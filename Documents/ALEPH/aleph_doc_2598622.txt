Chairman’s Report
Dear Fellow Shareholders 
 
The  sale  of the  Company’s  Balogo  Project  in West  Africa  in  2015  placed  Golden  Rim  in  a 
comparatively  unique  position  as  a  junior  explorer  in  the  difficult  market  conditions 
experienced during the  2016 financial year. The  resulting strong cash position enabled the 
Company  to  consider  other  opportunities  that  had  become  available  due  to  the  market 
downturn.  
 
The  extensive  search  and  review  work  undertaken  by  management  to  identify  a  suitable 
project, culminated in the announcement, on 10 May 2016, that the Company had executed 
an  agreement  with  Herencia  Resources  plc  (Herencia)  to  acquire  Herencia’s  70%  in  the 
Paguanta zinc-silver-lead project in northern Chile.  Paguanta is in a well-developed mining 
district  in  a  country  with  low  sovereign  risk;  hosts  inferred,  indicated  and  measured 
resources  of  zinc,  lead  and  silver;  and  has  potential  for  resource  upgrade  leading  to  mine 
development. As an advanced project it offers shareholders much lower risk than grassroots 
exploration and potential for cash flow within a foreseeable time frame.  
 
Importantly,  the  Board’s  expectation  of  improved  prices  for  the  targeted  commodities,  and 
thus  rationale  for  the  purchase,  has  been  shown  to  be  correct.  Moreover,  the  Company’s 
sound financial position enables it to commence a substantial drilling program on Paguanta. 
 
The  2017 financial  year  will  see  increased  exploration  and  evaluation  activity  at  Paguanta, 
targeting both an upgrade in the size and grade of the resources.  The Company will also be 
building  in-country  skills  and  understanding  with  a  view  to  undertaking  a  more  detailed 
feasibility study for mine development. 
 
I  wish  to  thank  management  who  have  diligently  worked  toward  delivering  our  goals.  I 
particularly  thank  our  Managing  Director,  Craig  Mackay,  who  has  worked  and  travelled 
tirelessly to identify a suitable project and negotiate the Paguanta deal.  
 
Thank you also to those many shareholders who have stuck with us through this, at times, 
difficult  journey.  I  feel  confident  that  the  broader  market  will  become  more  aware  of  the 
potential  of  Paguanta,  leading  to  share  price  improvement.  The  support  of  you  all  is  very 
much appreciated. 
 
 
Yours faithfully 
GOLDEN RIM RESOURCES LTD
RICK CRABB

Review of Operations
Golden Rim Resources Ltd
Paguanta Project  
 
On 10 May 2016 Golden Rim announced that it had executed an agreement with Herencia 
Resources  plc  (Herencia)  to  acquire  all  the  issued  shares  in  Herencia’s  wholly  owned 
subsidiary  Paguanta  Resources  (Chile)  SA  (PRC).  PRC  holds  70%  of  the  shares  in 
Compania  Minera Paguanta S.A. (CMP) which  holds mineral concessions at  the Paguanta 
zinc-silver-lead project in northern Chile (Figure 1).  
 
Paguanta  is  located  in  the  Tarapacá  Region  of  northern  Chile,  approximately  195km 
northeast  of  Iquique  and  30km  west  of  the  Chile-Bolivia  border.  Paguanta  is  situated 
approximately  40km  northeast  of  BHP  Billiton’s  Cerro  Colorado  Mine,  which  has  a  Mineral 
Resource  of  400Mt  @  0.62%  copper  for  5.5Blb  of  copper  and  annual  copper  cathode 
production of approximately 175Mlb.  
 
Mineral Resources 
 
The  Patricia  Prospect  at  Paguanta  hosts  Inferred,  Indicated  and  Measured  Mineral 
Resources of 4.4Mt at 3.7% zinc, 1.4% lead, 84 g/t silver and 0.2 g/t gold at 2% zinc cut-
off and 0.6Mt at 93 g/t silver and 1.4% lead at 40 g/t silver cut-off (Tables 1 & 2, Figure 2, 
Photo 1).

Notes: 
1.  This  information  was  prepared  by Golder  Associates  in  2012  and  first  disclosed  under 
the  JORC  Code  2004.  It  has  not  been  updated  since  to  comply  with  the  JORC  Code 
2012  on  the  basis  that  the  information  has  not  materially  changed  since  it  was  last 
reported.
2.  Golden  Rim  plans  to  conduct  further  drilling  at  Paguanta  in  the  second  Half  of  the 
calendar  year  2016  and  to  update the  Mineral Resource  under  JORC 2012  in  the first 
quarter of the 2017 calendar year.
Past  expenditure  on  the  project  is  approximately  US$31.5m  (approximately  A$42m). Work 
completed  on  the  project  includes  more  than  40,000m  of  drilling  (predominantly  diamond 
drilling) and the majority of a feasibility study.  
 
Golden Rim’s due diligence on Paguanta revealed that coherent higher grade mineralisation 
predominantly  associated  with  a  hydrothermal  breccia  in  the  Cathedral  Vein  at  Patricia  is 
likely to be the Company’s focus for a future mine development (Photos 2 & 3).  
 
At  a  3%  zinc  cut-off,  there  is  a  higher  grade  Inferred,  Indicated  and  Measured  Mineral 
Resource at  Patricia of 1.8Mt at 5.6% zinc, 2.0% lead, 125 g/t silver and 0.2 g/t gold  or 
1.8Mt at 9.8% zinc equivalent (ZnEq). The zinc equivalent calculations details are set out 
below.  
 
The higher grade mineralisation is mainly associated with the Cathedral Vein and is open at 
depth and along strike.  
 
Exploration Target  
 
Mining  Plus  Pty  Ltd  (Mining  Plus)  was  contracted  by  Golden  Rim  to  estimate  an  initial 
Exploration  Target  in  accordance  with  JORC  (2012),  for  the  potential  strike  and  depth 
extensions to the higher grade mineralisation at Patricia (Table 3, Figure 3). 
 
The  Exploration  Target  represents  potential  polymetallic  endowment  in  addition  to  the 
defined Mineral Resource for the Patricia deposit.

utilising Leapfrog Geo implicit modelling software to create solids at a 3% cut-off grade 
and a maximum vein width of 5m.
3.  The Exploration Target was based on drilling data, surface geochemical data and a 3D 
model  of  Induced  Polarisation  (IP)  chargeability  data.  The  surface  geochemical  data 
(1,930 samples) and IP geophysical data (survey by Zonge, Chile, 2012) were utilised to 
support the continuity of mineralisation in areas where drilling was more sparse.
4.  A total of 28 RC drill holes (3,626m) and 11 diamond drill holes (1,338m) were used to 
prepare  the  Exploration  Target.  The  holes  are  generally  drilled  on  lines  spaced  from 
20m  –  250m  apart, with  spacing  along  the  lines  ranging  from  30m  –  200m.  The  holes 
used for the Exploration Target are depicted on Figure 4.
5.  A  base  for  the  Exploration  Target  was  set  at  3250mRL  –  200m  below  the  base  of  the 
current drilling. The Exploration Target extends along strike for 250m from the eastern-
most drill hole.
6.  The Exploration Target was calculated using a SG of 3.2 g/cm3  
 
Transaction Details 
 
Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  acquisition  was  finalised  for  a  price  of 
US$1.49m  cash.  In  addition  to  the  cash  consideration,  Golden  Rim  will  issue  US$0.8m  in 
fully paid ordinary shares to Herencia at a deemed issue price equal to the 20 day volume 
weighted average price (VWAP), in the event a decision to mine at Paguanta.  
 
The  consideration  under  the  transaction  is  payable  in  instalments  and  to  date  Golden  Rim 
has paid US$1,027,000 (including two deposits previously paid). Prior to the next instalment 
of  US$413,000,  all  outstanding  creditors  in  PRC  and  CMP  are  required  to  be  paid.  A  final 
amount  of  US$50,000  is  payable  within  3  months.  Any  unknown  costs  previously  incurred 
that become evident during this period will be deducted from this amount. 
 
Chilean exporters may recover the value added tax (VAT) paid with respect to their exports. 
Under  certain  circumstances,  exporters  may  claim  VAT  credits  in  advance  before  exports 
are  completed  or  the  VAT  has  been  incurred.  CMP  has  received  such  VAT  credits  in 
advance  of  approximately  £1.5  million.  It  is  expected  that  upon  export,  the  VAT  credit 
received will be applied to reduce this advanced VAT credit over time. The Company further 
notes that if CMP does not carry out the exports as approved, such amounts of VAT credits 
claimed in advanced must be paid back to the tax authorities. 
 
Decision to Focus on South America 
 
The sale of the Company’s Balogo Project in West Africa in 2015 placed the Company in a 
comparatively  unique  position  as  a  junior  explorer  in  the  difficult  market  conditions 
experienced  during  the  year.  The  sale  provided  the  Company  with  a  strong  cash  position 
enabling  it  to  consider  other  opportunities  that  had  become  available  due  to  the  market 
downturn.  
 
During the reporting period, Golden Rim received cash funds of US$3 million from the MNG 
Group of companies (MNG) as final payment for the acquisition of the Balogo Project. The 
Company  was  approached  by  MNG  to  consider  a  renegotiation  of  the  remaining 
consideration for the sale of the Balogo Project. The renegotiation resulted in an agreement 
to bring forward all sale proceeds.  
 
Given  the  political  uncertainty  and  associated  security  issues  experienced  in  Burkina  Faso 
from late 2015 to early 2016, the Company suspended work in in Burkina Faso and decided 
to  look  for  opportunities  elsewhere.  Subsequently,  the  Company  identified  the  Paguanta 
project and decided to shift its focus to South America.  
 
Golden Rim retains its interest in the Korongou, Yako and Sebba projects, in Burkina Faso.

Korongou Project, Burkina Faso 
 
The  Korongou  Project  covers  part  of  the  highly  prospective  Lower  Proterozoic  Birimian 
Samira Hill greenstone belt in Burkina Faso and traversed by a significant NE-trending fault 
splay  which  is  connected  to  the  major  Markoye  Fault  system.  This  fault  system  controls  a 
number  of  major  gold  deposits  in  Burkina  Faso,  including  Kiaka  (5.9  Moz  gold),  Bomboré 
(5.2  Moz  gold)  and  Essakane  (6.2  Moz  gold).  The  mineralised  fault  system  extends  into 
western Niger where the 2 Moz Samira Hill is located. 
 
Exploration Target 
 
At  the  beginning  of  the  reporting  period,  an  Exploration  Target  was  calculated  for  gold 
mineralisation  identified  within  the  Guitorga  North,  Guitorga  South,  MCA/MCB  Pits  and 
Diabouga areas. 
 
The  initial  Exploration  Target  for  Korongou,  detailed  in  Table  4,  is  estimated  in  a  range  of 
7,954,000 to 9,722,000 tonnes grading from approximately 1.8 to 2.2 g/t gold and containing 
approximately 500,000 to 611,000 ounces of gold.

mineralisation is supported by mapping, the location of artisanal workings or anomalous 
auger  results);  maximum  of  70m  vertical  extent  below  surface  for  the  Guitorga  North, 
Guitorga  South  and  Diabouga  areas;  maximum  of  120m  vertical  extent  below  surface 
for the MCA/MCB Pits area; minimum downhole intercept width of 2m; and SG of 2.5.
2.  A total of 94 RC drill holes were used to prepare the Exploration Target. The holes are 
generally  drilled  on  lines  spaced from  40m  –  100m  apart, with  spacing along  the  lines 
ranging from 40m – 50m.
The  Company  has  agreed  to  enter  into  an  unincorporated  joint  venture  for  the  Korongou 
Project with MNG.

Mali Project (Sepola)  
 
No  field  work  was  completed  on  the  projects  in  Mali  during  the  year.  Golden  Rim  has 
continued  its  divestment  activity  for  the  Sepola  Project  and  continues  to  actively  discuss 
divestment opportunities.  
 
Corporate  
 
During the reporting period the Company moved its registered office to Surrey Hills, Victoria. 
 
The Company has also provided a short term loan of A$150,000 to a third party to secure a 
period of exclusivity in which to review a potential investment. The loan is subject to interest 
at the rate of 10% per annum and was repayable 9 June 2016. The Company has agreed to 
extend the period of repayment by a further 12 months. 
 
Mineral Resource Statement  
 
During  the  reporting  period,  no  work  was  carried  out  on  the  Company’s  mineral  resources 
and therefore there has been no material change to any mineral resource.  
 
The Company has no Mineral Resource as at 30 June 2015. 
 
Governance and Internal Controls 
 
Given the size of the Company and the internal expertise available to it, the Company does 
not calculate its own estimates of mineral resources. It engages reputable, suitably qualified 
external  party  to  review  the  Company’s  data  and  determine  an  estimate  of  mineral 
resources. All data is collected and recorded in accordance with JORC requirements. There 
has been no external audit or review of the Company’s techniques or data. 
 
Zinc Equivalent (ZnEq) Calculation Details 
 

Metal prices quoted on Kitco.com on 14 July 2016 were utilised in the ZnEq calculation 
and included the following: Zn = US$0.98/lb; Pb = US$0.85/lb; Ag = US$20.36/oz and 
Au = US$1344/oz).



Non-optimised  metallurgical  recoveries  were  derived  from  testwork  as  part  of  the 
feasibility  study  at  Paguanta  and  include  82%,  80%  and  90%  for  Zn,  Pb  and  Ag 
respectively. For Au a 90% recovery has been assumed, which Golden Rim believes is 
a reasonable average for an epithermal style of deposit.
It is Golden Rim’s opinion that all elements included in the metal equivalent calculation 
have a reasonable potential to be recovered and sold. 
 
The ZnEq calculation formula is as follows: ZnEq = (Zn% x 0.82) + (Pb% x 0.80 x 0.87) 
+ (Au% x 0.90 x 19,996) + (Ag% x 0.90 x 302).

Directors’ Report 
The  directors  present  their  report  on  the  consolidated  entity  consisting  of  Golden  Rim  and 
the entities it controlled at the end of or during the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
Directors 
 
The following persons were directors of Golden Rim during or since the end of the reporting 
period and up to the date of this Directors’ Report: 
 
 
 
 
 
Principal Activities 
 
The  principal  activities  of  the  consolidated  entity  during  the  course  of  the  reporting  period 
were mineral exploration and investment.  There were no significant changes in the nature of 
those activities during the reporting period. 
 
Operating Results 
 
During  the  reporting  period  the  consolidated  entity  incurred  an  loss  after  tax  of  $274,423 
(2015 profit: $3,148,146), after mineral exploration  and evaluation  expenditure of $765,387 
(2015: $3,504,097). 
 
Dividends 
 
No dividends have been paid or declared since the end of the previous financial year and no 
dividend is recommended in respect of this financial year. 
 
Subsequent Events 
 
Since the end of the reporting period, except as stated elsewhere in this Annual Report and 
below,  there  has  not  been  any  matter  or  circumstance  occurring  subsequent  to  the  end  of 
the reporting period that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the operations 
of the consolidated entity, or the state of affairs of the consolidated entity in future financial 
years. 
 
On 28 July 2016, the Company announced that it had finalised the transaction with Herencia 
Resources  plc  (Herencia)  to  acquire  all  the  issued  shares  in  Herencia’s  wholly  owned 
subsidiary  Paguanta  Resources  (Chile)  SA  (PRC).    PRC  holds  70%  of  the  shares  in 
Compania  Minera Paguanta S.A. (CMP) which  holds mineral concessions at  the Paguanta 
zinc-silver-lead project in northern Chile. 
 
The  final  acquisition  price  for  Paguanta  is  US$1.49m  cash.  In  addition  to  the  cash 
consideration,  Golden  Rim  will  issue  US$0.8m  in  fully  paid  ordinary  shares  (Shares)  to 
Herencia  at  a  deemed  issue  price  equal  to  the  20  day  volume  weighted  average  price 
(VWAP), in the event of a decision to mine at Paguanta.  
 
The  consideration  under  the  transaction  is  payable  in  instalments  and  to  date  Golden  Rim 
has paid US$1,027,000 (including two deposits previously paid). Prior to the next instalment 
of  US$413,000,  all  outstanding  creditors  in  PRC  and  CMP  are  required  to  be  paid.  A  final
Page | 16
Golden Rim Resources Ltd 
 
amount  of  US$50,000  is  payable  within  3  months.  Any  unknown  costs  previously  incurred 
that become evident during this period will be deducted from this amount. 
 
Chilean exporters may recover the value added tax (VAT) paid with respect to their exports. 
Under  certain  circumstances,  exporters  may  claim  VAT  credits  in  advance  before  exports 
are  completed  or  the  VAT  has  been  incurred.  CMP  has  received  such  VAT  credits  in 
advance  of  approximately  £1.5  million.  It  is  expected  that  upon  export,  the  VAT  credit 
received will be applied to reduce this advanced VAT credit over time. The Company further 
notes that if CMP does not carry out the exports as approved, such amounts of VAT credits 
claimed in advanced must be paid back to the tax authorities. 
 
Future Developments 
 
Details  of  important  developments  occurring  in  this  reporting  period  have  been  covered  in 
the  Review  of  Operations.  As  the  outcome  of  exploration  and  subsequent  development  is 
uncertain, it is impossible to determine the effect on the results of the  consolidated entity’s 
operations.  Exploration activities on existing projects are expected to be funded for the next 
reporting period from current funds and/or additional capital. However, existing projects that 
progress beyond exploration may require additional capital.  
 
Further information on future developments in the operations of the consolidated entity and 
the  expected  results  of  operations  have  not  been  included  in  this  Annual  Report,  as  the 
directors believe it is likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity.  
 
Review of Operations 
 
The Review of Operations has been disclosed separately in this Annual Report. 
 
Significant Changes in the State of Affairs 
 
In the opinion of the directors, there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the 
consolidated entity that occurred during the  reporting period  except as  stated elsewhere in 
this Annual Report.

Compensation Practices 
 
Non  executive  directors’  fees  include  superannuation.  The  aggregate  fees  are  fixed  and 
approved by shareholders.  
 
The  Company  does  not  have  a  bonus  or  incentive  option  scheme  for  the  directors.  The 
Company  has  an  Employee  Share  Option  Plan,  in  which  the  directors  may  participate.  To 
date,  any  options  granted  by  the  Board  to  executives,  do  not  have  associated  specific 
performance hurdles. 
 
The  Board  also  has  a  Remuneration  Committee,  details  of  which  are  contained  in  the 
Corporate Governance Statement.  
 
Remuneration Policy 
 
Remuneration of directors and senior executives is set by reference to payments made by 
other companies of similar size and industry, and by reference to the skills and experience 
of the directors and executives. Details of the nature and amount of remuneration of each 
director of the Company are disclosed annually in the Company's remuneration report in its 
annual report.  
 
Non-executive directors 
 
The  Company's  policy  is  to  remunerate  non-executive  directors  at  a  fixed  fee  for  time, 
commitment and responsibilities. Remuneration for non-executive directors is not linked to 
individual performance. From time to time the Company may grant options to non-executive

reward reflects the competitive market in which the Company operates; 
individual reward should be linked to performance criteria; and 
executives should be rewarded for both financial and non-financial performance.
directors.  The  grant  of  options  is  designed  to  attract  and  retain  suitably  qualified  non-
executive Directors.  
 
The maximum aggregate amount of fees (including superannuation payments) that can be 
paid to non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at General Meeting. 
To the extent that any non-executive directors participate in any equity-based remuneration 
schemes,  they  are  prohibited  from  entering  into  transactions  (whether  through  the  use  of 
derivatives or otherwise) which limit the economic risk of participating in the scheme. 
 
Executive directors and senior executives 
 
The  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  executive  directors  and  senior  executives  is 
designed to promote superior performance and long term commitment to the Company. 
 
Executives receive a base remuneration, which is market related. Overall, the remuneration 
policy is subject to the discretion of the Board and can be altered to reflect the competitive 
market  and  business  conditions,  where  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Company  and 
shareholders, to do so. 
 
The Board's reward policy is designed to retain appropriately qualified executive talent for 
the benefit of the Company. The main principles of the policy are: 
 
• 
• 
• 
 
Directors' and senior executives' remuneration is reviewed by the board of directors, having 
regarding  to  various  goals  set.  This  remuneration  and  other  terms  of  employment  are 
commensurate with those offered within the exploration and mining industry. 
 
Long  term  performance  incentives  may  include  options  granted  at  the  discretion  of  the 
Board and subject to the successful completion of performance hurdles. 
 
Where the Company has any equity-based remuneration scheme, executive directors and 
other senior executives are prohibited from entering into transactions (whether through the 
use of derivatives or otherwise) which limit the economic risk of participating in the scheme. 
 
Relationship between Remuneration of Key  Management Personnel and Shareholder 
Wealth 
 
During  the  Company’s  new  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  phases  of  its 
business,  the  Board  anticipates  that  the  Company  will  retain  earnings  (if  any)  and  other 
cash  resources for  the  exploration  and  development  of  its resource  projects.    Accordingly 
the Company does not currently have a policy with respect to the payment of dividends and 
returns  of  capital.  Therefore  there  was  no  relationship  between  the  Board’s  policy  for 
determining  the  nature  and  amount  of  remuneration  of  key  management  personnel,  and 
dividends paid and returns of capital by the Company during the current and previous four 
financial years. 
 
The  Board  does  not  determine,  and  there  was  no  relationship  between,  the  nature  and 
amount of remuneration of key management personnel  and changes in the price at which 
shares  in  the  Company  traded  between  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  current  and  the 
previous four financial years.

Share options 
 
As  noted  below,  a  number  of  key  management  personnel  have  received  options  of  the 
ordinary shares in the Company which generally will only be of value should the value of the 
Company’s shares increase sufficiently to warrant exercising the options. Options provide a 
means  of  ensuring  remuneration  offered  to key  management  personnel  is  competitive  with 
market  standards  and/or  practice  while  maintaining  the  Company’s  cash  reserves.  The 
exercise  price  of  the  options  is  determined  at  the  time  of  their  issuance  with  consideration 
given to the Company’s underlying share price at the time of issue. The conversion price is 
usually higher than the price of the shares at the time. 
 
No  options  were  granted  as  compensation  to  key  management  personnel  during  the 
financial year ended 30 June 2016.

Going Concern
(c) 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  going  concern  basis  which 
contemplates  continuity  of  normal  business  activities  and  the  realisation  of  assets  and  discharge  of 
liabilities in the normal course of business.   
 
During the reporting period, the Group incurred a net loss after tax of $274,423 (2015: profit after tax - 
$3,148,146)  and  had  net  cash  inflows  from  operating  and  investing  activities  of  $1,760,069  (2015  - 
$1,322,717).  At  30  June  2016  the  Company  has  net  assets  of  $8,569,883  (2015  -  $8,793,954)  and 
net current assets of $6,531,006 (2015 - $4,530,966). 
 
Based  on the  cash flow  forecasts  prepared by  the  directors  and other  factors  referred  to above, the 
directors are satisfied that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate.  
 
(d) 
 
(i) 
 
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary 
economic  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates  (its  functional  currency).  The  consolidated 
financial  statements  are  presented  in  Australian  dollars  which  is  the  functional  currency  of  the 
Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
 
The functional currency of the subsidiaries, Golden Rim SAR Exploration SARL; Golden Rim Mali SA; 
Golden  Rim  Resources  Burkina  SARL;  Talpha  Burkina  SARL  and  Golden  Rim  Resources  Cote 
d’Ivoire, is CFA Franc.

(ii)  
 
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates 
prevailing at the date of the transaction.  Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year 
end  exchange  rate.    Non-monetary  items  measured  at  historical  costs  continue  to  be  carried  at  the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  Non-monetary items measured at fair value are reported 
at the exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined. 
 
(iii)  
 
The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the 
Group’s presentation currency are translated as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
Exchange  differences  arising  on  translation  of  foreign  operations  are  recognised 
in  other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve.  These 
differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed. 
 
(e) 
 
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  reviews  the  carrying  amounts  of  its  assets  to  determine  whether 
there  is  any  indication  that  those  assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.    If  any  such  indication 
exists,  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  is  estimated  in  order  to  determine  the  extent  of  the 
impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset,  the  Group  estimates  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  asset 
belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are 
also  allocated  to  individual  cash-generating  units,  or  otherwise  allocated  to  the  smallest  group  of 
cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
 
If  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  (or  cash-generating  unit)  is  estimated  to  be  less  than  its 
carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  (or  cash-generating  unit)  is  reduced  to  its 
recoverable  amount.  An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  immediately  in  profit  or  loss,  unless  the 
relevant  asset  is  carried  at  a  revalued  amount,  in  which  case,  the  impairment  loss  is  treated  as  a 
revaluation decrease. 
 
When  an  impairment  loss  subsequently  reverses,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  (or  cash-
generating  unit)  is  increased  to  the  revised  estimate  of  its  recoverable  amount,  but  so  that  the 
increased  carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined 
had  no  impairment  loss  been  recognised  for  the  asset  (or  cash-generating  unit)  in  prior  years.  A 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is 
carried  at  a  revalued  amount,  in  which  case  the  reversal  of  the  impairment  loss  is  treated  as  a 
revaluation increase. 
 
(f)  
 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount 
of  GST  is  not  recoverable  from  the  Australian  Taxation  Office.    In  these  circumstances  the  GST  is 
recognised  as  part  of  the  cost  of  acquisition  of  the  asset  or  as  part  of  an  item  of  the  expense.  
Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST. 
 
Cash  flows  are  presented  in  the  statement  of  cash  flows  on  a  gross  basis,  except  for  the  GST 
component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.

No  income  tax  is  payable  by  the  Company.    The  consolidated  entity  has  un-recouped  Australian 
income  tax  losses  comprising  revenue  losses  of  approximately  $26.7  million  (2015  -  $25.4  million), 
foreign losses of approximately $22.2 million (2015 - $23.5 million) and capital losses of approximately 
$2.5 million (2015 - $2.3 million).  
 
Such benefits have not been recognised and will only be obtained if: 
 
(a)
the consolidated entity derives future assessable income of a nature and an amount sufficient 
to enable the benefit from the deductions for the loss to be realised; 
the losses are transferred to an eligible entity in the consolidated entity; 
the consolidated entity continues to comply with the conditions for deductibility imposed by tax 
legislation; and 
no changes in taxation legislation adversely affect the economic entity in realising the benefit 
from the deductions for the losses.
(b) 
(c)
(d)
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
 
Current tax 
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable income for the reporting period. Taxable income differs 
from  profit  as  reported  in the  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive  income because  of  items  of 
income  or  expense  that  are  assessable  or  deductible  in  other  periods  and  items  that  are  never 
assessable or deductible. 
 
Deferred tax 
 
Deferred  tax  is  recognised  on  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  corresponding  tax  bases  used  in  the  computation  of 
taxable income. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred  tax  assets  are  generally  recognised  for  all  deductible  temporary  differences  to  the  extent 
that it is probable that assessable income will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit. 
 
Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  for  taxable temporary  differences  associated  with  investments 
in  subsidiaries  and  associates,  and  interests  in  joint  ventures,  except  where  the  Group  is  able  to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Deferred  tax  assets  arising  from  deductible  temporary  differences
Page | 36
Golden Rim Resources Ltd  
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2016
associated  with  such  investments  and  interests  are  only  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable 
that  there  will  be  sufficient  assessable  income  against  which  to  utilise  the  benefits  of  the  temporary 
differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
The  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  is  reviewed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient assessable income will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  at  the  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  in  the 
period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  The  measurement  of 
deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 
of its assets and liabilities. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax  assets  against  current  tax  liabilities  and  when  they  relate  to  income  taxes  levied  by  the  same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
 
Current and deferred tax for the period 
 
Current  and  deferred  tax  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss,  except  when  they  relate  to  items  that  are 
recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity,  in  which  case  the  current  and 
deferred  tax  is  also  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity,  respectively. 
Where  current  or  deferred  tax  arises  from  the  initial  accounting  for  a  business  combination,  the  tax 
effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

Basic earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share
(i) 
 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  determined  by  dividing  net  profit/loss  after  income  tax  attributable  to 
members of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus 
elements in ordinary shares issued during the year. 
 
(ii) 
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share 
by taking into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with 
dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been 
issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
 
The profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company has been used in the calculation of basic 
loss per share. 
 
As  detailed  in  note  14(a)  the  Company  had  on  issue  143,358,400  (2015:  163,258,400)  unlisted 
options to subscribe for fully paid ordinary shares exercisable between 0.95 cents and  14 cents each 
at any time on or before the expiry dates. As the exercise price of these options at balance date was 
greater  than  the  market price of  the  shares,  it  is  considered the  options  are  unlikely  to be exercised 
and consequently  have not been considered dilutive.  None of the options have  been included  in the 
determination of basic and diluted earnings per share.

A loan of $150,000 advanced during the year to an unrelated party was considered impaired and fully 
provided for at 30 June 2016. 
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  that 
are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the effect of discounting is immaterial.  They are 
included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting 
period which are classified as non-current assets.

Under AASB 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations  or  joint  ventures  depending  on  the  contractual  rights  and  obligations  each  investor  has, 
rather  than  the  legal  structure  of  the  joint  arrangement.  Golden  Rim  has  assessed  the  nature  of  its 
current joint arrangements and has determined that it is a joint venture. 
 
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, the interests 
are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise 
the  Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  results  and  movements  in  other  comprehensive  income  in 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income respectively. 
 
When  the  Group’s  share  of  losses  in  a  joint  venture  equals  or  exceeds  its  interests  in  the  joint 
ventures  (which  includes  any  long-term  interests  that,  in  substance,  form  part  of  the  Group’s  net 
investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures. 
 
Unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  to  the 
extent  of the Group’s  interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised  losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction  provides  evidence  of  an  impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  the 
joint ventures have been changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group.

Each  class  of  plant  and  equipment  is  carried  at  cost,  less,  where  applicable,  any  accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. 
 
Depreciation  is  recognised  so  as  to  write  off  the  cost  or  valuation  of  plant  and  equipment  less  their 
residual values over their useful lives, using either the straight line basis or diminishing value method, 
commencing  from  the  time  the  assets  are  held  ready  for  use. The  depreciation  rates  used  for  plant 
and  equipment  vary  between  10%  and  40%.  The  estimated  useful  lives,  residual  values  and 
depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes 
in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 
The carrying values of plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy in 
note 2(e) when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows that will be 
received  from  an  asset’s  employment  and  subsequent  disposal.    The  expected  net  cash  flows  are 
discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts. An asset’s carrying amount is 
written  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount,  if  the  asset’s  carrying  value  is  greater  than  its 
estimated recoverable amount. 
 
An item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal  or  when no future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on disposals, being the 
difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in profit or 
loss.

Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest are recognised 
as  an  exploration and evaluation  asset in  the  year  in  which they  are  incurred  where  the  following 
conditions are satisfied:
Page | 40

(ii)
Golden Rim Resources Ltd  
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2016
the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
at least one of the following conditions is also met:
(a)   the  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through 
successful  development  and  exploration  of  the  area  of  interest,  or  alternatively,  by  its 
sale; or
(b)   exploration  and  evaluation  activities  in  the  area  of  interest  have  not,  at  the  reporting 
date,  reached  a  stage  which  permits  a  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  or 
otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves,  and  active  and  significant  operations 
in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  initially  measured  at  cost  and  include  the  acquisition  of 
permits / licenses that provide the right to explore. All other exploration and evaluation expenditure 
including studies, exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities is expensed 
as incurred.  
 
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  when  facts  and  circumstances 
suggest  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  exploration  and  evaluation  asset  may  exceed  its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation asset (or the cash-
generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated, being no larger than the relevant area of interest) 
is  estimated  to  determine  the  extent  of  the  impairment  loss  (if  any).  Where  an  impairment  loss 
subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in previous years.  
 
Where a decision  is made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest, 
the  relevant  exploration  and  evaluation  asset  is  tested  for  impairment  and  the  balance  is  then 
reclassified. 
 
The  ultimate  recoupment  of  acquisition  costs  carried  forward  is  dependent  upon  successful 
development  and  commercial  exploitation,  sale  or  farm  out  of  the  respective  areas.  The  carrying 
values  are  based  upon  the  Group’s  assumption  that  the  exploration  licences  will  be  renewed  when 
required, subject to the Group meeting agreed budgets and work programs. No impairment indicators 
have been identified by management and the exploration program continues on each area of interest.  
 
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific 
to the Group and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. These include prospectivity of an 
area  of  interest  and  economic  and  political  environments.  If  an  impairment  trigger  exists,  the 
recoverable amount of the asset is determined. 
 
There is some subjectivity involved in the carrying forward as capitalised or writing off to the income 
statement exploration and evaluation expenditure, however management give due consideration to 
areas of interest on a regular basis and are confident that decisions to either write off or carry forward 
such expenditure reflect fairly the prevailing situation 
 
Exploration Commitments 
 
The  Group has  the  following  expenditure  commitments  in respect  of  exploration  interests,  subject  to 
the right to withdraw at any time.

reliably measured. 
 
Provision  is  made  for  the  Group’s  liability  for  employee  benefits  arising  from  services  rendered  by 
employees to balance date.  Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have 
been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on costs.

The asset revaluation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses arising on the revaluation 
of  available-for-sale financial  assets  that  have been  recognised  in other  comprehensive  income, net 
of amounts reclassified to profit or loss when those assets have been disposed of or are determined 
to be impaired. 
 
15. 
 
Equity-settled  share-based  payments  to  directors,  employees  and  other  providing  service  providers 
are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
 
The  value  of  these  option  payments  are  based  on  reasonable  estimates  using  a  recognised  option 
pricing model. 
 
The  Group measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  with  employees  by  reference  to  the  fair 
value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.  The fair value is determined by 
an  external  valuer  using  a  Trinomial  or  Black  Scholes  option  pricing  model,  with  appropriate 
assumptions. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled transactions would 
have  no  impact  on  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  annual  reporting 
period but may impact expenses and equity. 
 
The fair value determined at the  grant date of the equity-settled share-based  payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, 
the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision  of  the  original  estimates,  if  any,  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  such  that  the  cumulative
Page | 44

Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2016 
 
expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee 
benefits reserve. 
 
The Golden Rim Resources Ltd Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP), first approved by shareholders 
at the Company’s annual general meeting on 22 November 2010, is designed to provide incentives to 
the  employees  and  directors  of  the  Company  and  to  recognise  their  contribution  to  the  Company's 
success.  The directors consider that the incentives provided by a grant of options are a cost effective 
and  efficient  means  for  the  Company  to  provide  incentives  as  opposed  to  alternative  forms  of 
incentives such as cash bonuses or increased remuneration.  
 
Each employee share option converts into one ordinary share in the Company on exercise. Unless the 
Board determines otherwise, no amounts are paid or payable by the recipient on receipt of the option. 
The  options  carry  neither  rights  to  dividends  nor  voting rights.  The  options  may  be  exercised  at any 
time from the date of vesting to the date of their expiry. 
 
The  options  granted  under  the  ESOP  are  offered  to  employees  and  directors  on  the  basis  of  the 
Board’s view of the contribution of the person to the company. 
 
In terms of ASX Listing Rules, securities issued under an employee incentive scheme which has been 
approved  by  shareholders  within  three  years  of  the  date  of  issue,  are  issued  as  an  exception  to  a 
company’s 15% placement capacity under the rules. The ESOP was again approved by shareholders 
at the annual general meeting on 22 November 2013. 
 
The  Company  also  issues,  from  time to time,  share options  to directors,  employees  and consultants 
either under the 15% placement capacity or with the prior approval of shareholders.

Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  subsidiaries  have  share  capital  consisting  solely  of  ordinary  shares, 
which  are  held  directly  by  the  Group,  and  the  proportion  of  ownership  interests  held  is  equal  to  the 
voting rights held by the Group. The country of incorporation is also their principal place of business. 
 
Golden Rim Chile Pty Ltd has a 30 June financial  year end and  was  incorporated on  14 June 2016. 
The  other  subsidiaries  have  31  December  financial  year  ends.  The  Company  has  made  a  provision 
for impairment in value against the full cost of its investment in subsidiaries. 
 
Golden  Rim  Resources  Cote  d’Ivoire  SARL  and  Talpha  Burkina  SARL  were  de-registered  on  10 
August 2015 and 6 November 2015 respectively. 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  all  subsidiaries  of  the 
Company as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.  
 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully  consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the  Group. 
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the 
impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have  been  changed  where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
 
Non-controlling  interests  in  the  results  and  equity  of  subsidiaries  are  shown  separately  in  the 
consolidated  statements  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income,  changes  in  equity  and 
financial position. 
 
(b) Significant restrictions 
 
There are no significant restrictions noted in relation to these subsidiaries. 
 
(c) Non-controlling interests (NCI) 
 
Set  out  below  is  summarised  financial  information  for  Golden  Rim  SAR  Exploration  SAR  in  which  a 
10%  ownership  interest  is  held  by  non-controlling  interests.  The  amounts  disclosed  are  before 
intercompany eliminations.

The fixed interest rate cash and cash equivalents is held in a twelve month term deposit. 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
The economic entity’s exposure to interest rate risk is the risk that a financial instrument’s value will fluctuate as a resu lt of changes in market interest rates and the 
effective weighted average interest rate on classes of financial assets and liabilities.  The Group does not have a major exposure in this area as the interest rate earned 
on deposited funds does not vary greatly from month to month.   
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
 
The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis relating to its exposure to interest rate risk at balance date. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect on the 
current year results and equity which could result from a change in these risks. 
 
The effect on loss and total equity as a result of changes in the interest rate with all other variables remaining constant would be as follows:
Golden Rim Resources Ltd 
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2016
Change in loss 
- Increase interest rate by 1% (one basis point) 
- Decrease interest rate by 1% (one basis point) 
Change in equity 
- Increase interest rate by 1% (one basis point) 
- Decrease interest rate by 1% (one basis point)

Credit Risk 
 
The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security at balance 
date  to recognised  financial  assets  is  the  carrying  amount  of  those  assets,  net  of  any  provisions  for 
doubtful  debts,  as  disclosed  in  the    Consolidated  Statement  of  Financial  Position  and  notes  to  and 
forming part of the financial statements. The Group does not have any material credit risk exposure to 
any single debtor or group of debtors under financial instruments it has entered into. 
 
Foreign Currency Risk and Sensitivity 
 
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise. The Group does not hedge to reduce the foreign exchange risk as the directors 
believe the risk is not significant. The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated 
monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date in Australian dollars are as follows:
Assets  
- USD (US dollar) 
- XOF (CFA franc) 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets 
 
Liabilities  
- EUR (Euro)
- USD (US dollar) 
- XOF (CFA franc)

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. 
Segment  result  represents  the  results  of  each  segment  without  allocation  of  central  administration 
costs  and  directors’  salaries,  share  of  losses  of  associates,  investment  income,  gains  and  losses, 
finance costs  and  income tax  expense. This  is  the measure  reported to the chief  operating  decision 
maker for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

Golden Rim Resources Ltd 
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 30 June 2015 
 
Paguanta Resources (Chile) SA (PRC). PRC holds 70% of the shares in Compania Minera Paguanta 
SA (CMP) which holds mineral concessions at the Paguanta zinc-silver-lead project in northern Chile. 
 
The  final  acquisition  price  for  Paguanta  is  US$1.49m  cash.  In  addition  to  the  cash  consideration, 
Golden Rim will issue US$0.8m in fully paid ordinary shares (Shares) to Herencia at a deemed issue 
price equal to the 20 day volume weighted average price (VWAP), in the event of a decision to mine 
at Paguanta.  
 
The  consideration  under  the transaction  is  payable  in  instalments  and to  date Golden  Rim  has  paid 
US$1,027,000 (including two deposits previously paid). Prior to the next instalment of US$413,000, all 
outstanding  creditors  in  PRC  and  CMP  are  required  to  be  paid.  A  final  amount  of  US$50,000  is 
payable  within  3  months.  Any  unknown  costs  previously  incurred  that  become  evident  during  this 
period will be deducted from this amount. 
 
Chilean  exporters  may  recover  the  value  added  tax  (VAT)  paid  with  respect  to  their  exports.  Under 
certain circumstances, exporters may claim VAT credits in advance before exports are completed or 
the  VAT  has  been  incurred.  CMP  has  received  such  VAT  credits  in  advance  of  approximately  £1.5 
million  (A$2.7  million).  It  is  expected  that  upon  export,  the  VAT  credit  received  will  be  applied  to 
reduce this advanced VAT credit over time. The Company further notes that if CMP does not carry out 
the exports as approved, such amounts of VAT credits claimed in advanced must be paid back to the 
tax authorities.

Report on the Financial Report  
 
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Golden Rim Resources Ltd, which comprises 
the  statement  of  financial  position  as  at  30  June  2016,  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other 
comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in equity for the 
year  ended  on  that date,  notes  comprising  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  other 
explanatory  information,  and  the  directors’  declaration  of  the  consolidated  entity,  comprising  the 
company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year 
as set out on pages 28 to 56.  
 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report 
 
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error. In Note 2(a), 
the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial 
Statements, that the consolidated financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting 
Standards. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply 
with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.   
 
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and 
disclosures  in  the  financial  report.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due 
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control, relevant 
to the entity’s preparation of the financial report  that gives a true and fair view, in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  entity’s  internal  control.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made 
by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion. 
 
Auditor’s Independence Declaration 
 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001.  We  confirm  that  the  independence  declaration  required  by  the  Corporations Act 2001, 
which has been given to the directors of  Golden Rim Resources Ltd, would be in the same terms if 
given to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s report.
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.
