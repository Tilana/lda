<p>*
 The term &#8220;Roma&#8221; used throughout the present text refers to Roma, Sinti, Kale and Travellers, and 
</p>
<p>aims to cover the wide diversity of groups concerned, including groups that identify themselves as 
Gypsies. 
</p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> general recommendation XXVII of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination on discrimination against Roma, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/65 entitled 
&#8220;Protection of Roma (Gypsies)&#8221; of 4 March 1992, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the efforts of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the Special 
Rapporteur on minority issues to fight against discrimination and the social exclusion of 
Roma, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that Roma have faced, for more than five centuries, widespread and 
enduring discrimination, rejection, social exclusion and marginalization all over the world, 
in particular in Europe, and in all areas of life, 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that Roma in many parts of the world continue to be socially 
and economically marginalized, which undermines the respect of their human rights, 
propagates prejudice and impedes their full participation in society and the effective 
exercise of civic responsibilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the existence of anti-Gypsyism as a specific form of racism and 
intolerance, leading to hostile acts ranging from exclusion to violence against Roma 
communities, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the recent rise of anti-Gypsyism, anti-Roma rhetoric and violent attacks 
against Roma, which constitutes a major obstacle to the successful social inclusion of Roma 
and the full respect of their human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the primary responsibility for combating discrimination against 
Roma and for promoting their inclusion lies with the States of which Roma are nationals or 
long-term legal residents, while the role of the international community is to support and 
assist the efforts made at the regional, national and, in particular, local levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that the challenges faced by States in handling Roma issues may 
have cross-border implications, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Condemns</i> unequivocally the persistent manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against Roma, including violence, 
stigmatization and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to carry out a comprehensive study of the human rights 
situation of Roma worldwide, with a particular focus on the phenomenon of anti-Gypsyism; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on minority issues to prepare the above-
mentioned study with concrete recommendations in consultation with States, national 
human rights institutions, civil society organizations, regional arrangements, and relevant 
special procedures and treaty bodies, and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-ninth session; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Invites</i> the Forum on Minority Issues to take into consideration the present 
resolution in its work; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Decides</i> to be seized of the matter. 
</p>
