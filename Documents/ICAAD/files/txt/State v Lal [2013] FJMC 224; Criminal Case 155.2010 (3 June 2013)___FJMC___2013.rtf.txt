9.      
In cross examination PW2 stated that he was sitting in the shop behind the school. He answered 'by 11pm" to a question that what time we went to school.

10.     
PW3 gave evidence for Prosecution. He is the Investing Officer in this case. He interviewed the Accused in English language and made a record of the Caution Interview. He said original record of the Caution Interview was missing. He did not give the reason why it is missing. However, he was able to produce photo copy of the record of the Caution Interview.

12.

13.     
The Accused's right to give sworn evidence or his right to remain silent under common law was explained to him. He opted to give sworn evidence.

14.     
The Accused stated in evidence that PW2 was telling lie in Court and he denied the charge.

15.     
On 15/02/10 the Accused was charged with one count of burglary contrary to Section 312(1) of Crimes Decree 2009.

16.     
The charging section states that:-

"Section 312 (1)  A person commits an indictable offence (which is triable summarily) if he or she enters or remains in a building as a trespasser, with intent to commit theft of a particular item of property  in the building".

17.     
Accordingly the Prosecution must prove the following elements beyond reasonable doubt:-

(i)     
the Accused, Roneel Vineel Lal;
(ii)    
entered or remained in Korovuto College Office as a trespasser;
(iii)   
with intent to steal a camera in the said office.

18.     
PW2 stated the Accused went to the Korovuto College Office after drinking grog. The Accused took him (PW2) for grog drinking. The Accused has been identified by recognition. It is worthy to note that identity of the Accused was not disputed.

19.     
PW1 in evidence stated that when he went to school office, he found that padlock was cut, door open and an Olympus silver camera was missing. He also, told that all items were scattered. PW1 was never cross examined by the Accused.

20.     
PW2 stated in evidence that the Accused went to Korovuto College office while he was waiting at the Korovuto shop behind the school and came after an hour with a silver colour camera.

21.     
In cross examination the Accused questioned that what time we went to the school. To this question PW2 answered "by 11pm". By asking this question the Accused has revealed that he entered the college office on that day. He could not have asked such question if he had not entered the school office.

22.     
The record of caution interview (P/Exhibit 1) and the Charge Statement of the Accused (P/Exhibit 2) were produced by the Prosecution wherein the Accused had admitted committing the offence. The Prosecution failed to produce original record of the Caution Interview. PW3 stated in evidence that the original of the Caution Interview missing.

23.     
In my view Prosecution has failed to form foundation to produce photo copy of the Caution Interview of the Accused. I therefore ignore the Caution Interview and the Charge Statement of the Accused.

24.     
PW2 gave straight forward evidence that the Accused went to school and came with a silver camera after some time. PW1 stated that when he checked the office he found that only the Olympus camera missing.

25.     
PW1 and PW2 gave clear evidence for the Prosecution. He was consistent in his evidence. Their evidence was credible.

26.     
The Accused had cut opened padlock of the school office, entered and stole a camera therein.

27.     
The Accused in evidence stated that PW2 was telling lie in Court denying the allegation which I cannot accept.

28.     
In my judgment the Prosecution was able to prove each one of the elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore find the Accused Guilty to the charge of burglary contrary to Section 312 (1) of the Crimes Decree 2009. I convict him accordingly.

Dated at Nadi this 03rd day of June 2013.
