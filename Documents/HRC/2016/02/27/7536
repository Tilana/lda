practices with regard to the independence of the National Council and to the national 
human rights action plan.  
</p>
<p>66. In cooperation with the national human rights commission of Bahrain, OHCHR

<p><b> B. Support by the Office of the High Commissioner for regional  
and subregional initiatives by national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Africa 
</b></p>
<p>69. On 31 May 2013, OHCHR co-organized and hosted the first meeting of the network 
of Central African national human rights institutions. The meeting was attended by five 
institutions and focused on an action plan and modalities for fundraising to sustain the 
network. </p>


<p>70. On 11 November 2013, OHCHR facilitated a training session on human rights 
investigation techniques during a workshop organized by the Economic Community of 
West African States Human Rights Institutions Network. 
</p>
<p>71. Together with the Commonwealth Forum of National Human Rights Institutions and 
the Danish Institute for Human Rights, OHCHR provided support to the biennial

adopted a declaration identifying priorities for the African institutions&#8217; action in that area. 
</p>
<p>72. In November 2013, OHCHR organized a subregional consultation in Kampala on 
strengthening the protection mandate of national human rights institutions, with the 
participation of 26 representatives of such institutions from eight countries of East Africa. 
The participants shared good practices and challenges in implementing protection 
mandates. They agreed to set up a network of national human rights institutions in East 
Africa.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Asia and the Pacific 
</b></p>
<p>73. In December 2013, OHCHR, UNDP, APF and the Ombudsman of Samoa organized 
a regional roundtable on the establishment of national human rights institutions in the 
Pacific in Apia, Samoa, with the participation of representatives from Palau, Samoa, Tonga 
and Vanuatu. 
</p>
<p>74. In March 2014, OHCHR, APF and the Pacific Islands Forum finalized a joint 
partnership for the establishment and strengthening of independent national human rights 
institutions in the Pacific. The partnership outlines principles of cooperation to ensure 
coordination, good use of existing resources and complementarity of efforts. The strategy 
involves close cooperation in visiting the countries of the region, in follow-up actions, and 
in continuing assistance to support the independent functioning of national human rights 
institutions in the Pacific. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Middle East and North Africa  
</b></p>
<p>75. In June 2013, OHCHR participated in the ninth annual meeting of Arab National 
Human Rights Institutions, organized in Rabat by the National Human Rights Council of 
Morocco, with a focus on transitional justice. OHCHR made a presentation on transitional 
justice processes and the role of national human rights institutions in that regard. 
</p><p>76. In September 2013, OHCHR participated in the eighth Arab-European Human 
Rights Dialogue, organized by the Danish Institute for Human Rights in Copenhagen. 
OHCHR made a presentation on the importance of the independence and accountability of 
NHRIs and on the general observations of the International Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Europe and Central Asia 
</b></p>
<p>77. On 4 December 2013, OHCHR provided support for a regional conference 
organized by the Council of Europe on the working relations of the Ombudsman of Kosovo 
with the judiciary, including the Constitutional Court. This conference was attended by 
representatives of ombudsman institutions and constitutional courts of the region. </p>


<p><b> C. Contributions by the Office of the High Commissioner to international 
initiatives supporting national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Annual general meetings of the International Coordinating Committee  
of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>78. During the reporting period, OHCHR provided secretariat and technical support for 
two annual general meetings of the International Coordinating Committee, held in Geneva 
from 6 to 8 May 2013 and from 12 to 14 March 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Bureau meetings  
</b></p>
<p>79. OHCHR provided secretariat and technical support for three statutory Bureau 
meetings of the International Coordinating Committee, which were held in Geneva on 6 
May 2013 and 12 March 2014 and in Accra on 25 and26 November 2013. The Bureau 
members discussed their strategic priorities and other organizational issues. They also 
endorsed the reports of the Subcommittee on Accreditation of November 2012, May 2013 
and November 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Subcommittee on Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p>80. Article 6 of the Statute of the International Coordinating Committee provides that 
meetings of the Subcommittee on Accreditation shall be held under the auspices of and in 
cooperation with OHCHR. Accordingly, OHCHR provided substantive support for three 
sessions of the Subcommittee, held in Geneva in May and November 2013 and in March 
</p><p>2014. The presence of OHCHR at all the meetings of the Subcommittee is instrumental to 
attesting the compliance of the accreditation process with the established rules of procedure 
and contributes to its transparency, fairness and rigorousness. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. National human rights institutions in Portuguese-speaking countries  
</b></p>
<p>81. In May 2013, OHCHR participated in a meeting in Lisbon as follow-up to a 
workshop held in October 2012 in Cape Verde on the establishment and strengthening of 
NHRIs in the Portuguese-speaking countries. During the meeting, a network of national 
human rights institutions of Portuguese-speaking countries was formally established under 
the chairship of the national human rights institution of Mozambique. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Fellowship programme for staff of national human rights institutions  
</b></p>
<p>82. OHCHR continued the fellowship programme for the staff of A-status national 
human rights institutions. Initiated in 2008, the programme is designed to provide fellows 
with information on and working experience with the international human rights system, 
and to familiarize them with the work of OHCHR with national human rights institutions. 
During the period under review, fellows from the human rights institutions of Kenya, 
Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, the State of Palestine, the Philippines and South Africa 
participated in the programme. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation between United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>83. During the reporting period, national human rights institutions were active before 
and during the sessions of the Human Rights Council, delivering statements, submitting </p>


<p>written documentation, participating in general debates and under specific agenda items, 
organizing parallel events and interacting with the special procedures. A total of 31 
institutions participated in Council sessions during the reporting period (see annex I). Out 
of these, 12 NHRIs participated in the sessions of the Human Rights Council through video 
statements. 
</p>
<p>84. In May 2013, at the twenty-third session of the Human Rights Council, a 
representative of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines participated in the 
panel discussion on the contribution of parliamentarians to the work of the Human Rights 
Council and the UPR. 
</p>
<p>85. In June, 2013, at the twenty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council, a 
representative of the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Ombudsperson for 
Gender Equality of Egypt participated in the annual full-day panel discussion on women&#8217;s 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>86. The second cycle of the UPR has seen increased engagement by national human 
rights institutions (see annex II). As was agreed on by the Council, a summary of the 
written contributions submitted by A-status institutions now forms a separate section in the 
summary of information from stakeholders prepared by OHCHR, which is one of the three 
documents that form the basis of the review. This has allowed A-status institutions to share 
their independent views on the impact of the UPR on the promotion and protection of 
human rights, including good practices, challenges and emerging human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>87. A-status institutions are also increasingly making use of opportunities created for 
them by the Council to intervene immediately after the State under review at the adoption 
of the outcome of the review by the Council plenary, including through the representative 
of the International Coordinating Committee or through video statements.  
</p>
<p>88. In the light of the role that national human rights institutions can play at the national 
level in the follow-up to the review and in developing tools to monitor and assess progress 
in the implementation of recommendations, OHCHR has been actively supporting and 
encouraging their participation in the UPR process. 
</p>
<p>89. A few A-status institutions have contributed in writing or via video statements to the 
general debate under agenda item 6 of the Council, including by sharing midterm progress 
reports on the status of the implementation of recommendations, and of voluntary 
commitments and pledges made by States. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>90. During the general debates at the sessions of the Human Rights Council, the 
International Coordinating Committee and individual national human rights institutions 
interacted with special procedures mechanisms and submitted written contributions on 
reports prepared by the latter. 
</p>
<p>91. OHCHR regularly provides special procedures mandate holders preparing for 
country missions with information on the work of national human rights institutions. 
Increasingly, mandate holders seek the assistance of such institutions in ensuring that their 
recommendations are implemented at the national level. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>92. OHCHR continued to support the participation of national human rights institutions 
in the sessions of the treaty bodies. The secretariats of the treaty bodies, the National </p>


<p>Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section of OHCHR and the Geneva representative of 
the International Coordinating Committee liaised with national human rights institutions 
prior to each session to encourage them to provide written or oral information, and to attend 
the sessions. OHCHR also prepared briefings on institutions for the attention of treaty 
bodies, and disseminated relevant recommendations and concluding observations to the 
institutions concerned. 
</p>
<p>93. During the reporting period, human rights treaty bodies reviewed 202 States parties, 
111 of which had national human rights institutions. Of the 111 institutions, more than 60 
interacted with treaty bodies by submitting reports, briefing treaty bodies prior to the 
review or attending the sessions (see annex III).  
</p><p>94. Treaty bodies have been providing national human rights institutions with advice 
and tools to facilitate their effective engagement, including by issuing general comments, 
information notes and statements and inviting representatives of the institutions to their 
meetings. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child have adopted general comments on national human rights institutions. The 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has amended its rules of procedure 
to allow A-status institutions to address the Committee in plenary session. The Human 
Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee against 
Torture, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities have included in their working methods a section on the 
participation of national human rights institutions in their activities. 
</p>
<p>95. The Committee on Enforced Disappearances is discussing a paper on its relationship 
with the NHRIs to enhance the opportunities for NHRIs to engage with and contribute to its 
work. The Committee has engaged with the International Coordinating Committee in the 
process. 
</p>
<p>96. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women held informal 
public meetings in July 2013 and February 2014 with the representatives of six national 
human rights institutions to gather information for its fifty-fifth and fifty-seventh sessions. 
</p>
<p>97. In September 2013, two NHRIs made interventions during the dialogue with State 
parties at the tenth Session of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and 
provided information on their national-level monitoring activities. 
</p>
<p>98. As of March 2014, a total of 36 NHRIs had been designated as national preventive 
mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Of those institutions, 17 had 
submitted annual reports to the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. During the period 
covered in this report, the Subcommittee conducted an advisory visit to the NPM (NHRI) of 
Armenia and held meetings with the NHRIs of Gabon, Germany, New Zealand and Peru in 
the context of its country visits. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other meetings 
</b></p>
<p>99. Twenty national human rights institutions participated in the second United Nations 
Forum on Business and Human Rights, held in December 2013 in Geneva. The Working 
Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises was represented on one of the panels focusing on trends, best practices and 
challenges in the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
and the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework. </p>


<p><b> IV. Cooperation with and support to national human rights 
institutions by international and regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>100. During the reporting period, OHCHR support towards the establishment and 
strengthening of NHRIs in French-speaking countries, including Benin, the Comoros, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and Senegal, was provided jointly or 
in cooperation with the International Organization of la Francophonie. 
</p>
<p>101. In early 2014, OHCHR and the International Organization of la Francophonie held 
discussions on their priorities for 2014 regarding the establishment or strengthening of 
NHRIs and, for that purpose, identified the following countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, 
Cameroon, Chad, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Djibouti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, 
Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to States 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>States are encouraged to establish a national human rights institution where 
none exists, and to strengthen the structures and independence of existing ones in 
order to enable the effective fulfilment of their mandate, taking into account the 
recommendations made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation and the advice 
provided by OHCHR.</b> 
</p>
<p>103. <b>States are encouraged to ensure that national human rights institutions are 
provided with a broad mandate to protect and promote all human rights, including 
economic, social and cultural rights, and are granted adequate powers of investigation 
into allegations of human rights violations, including an authorization to visit 
detention centres.</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>States must ensure that national human rights institutions are provided with 
adequate human and financial resources and enjoy the necessary autonomy to 
propose and manage their own budgets and recruit their own staff members. </b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>Open, participatory and pluralistic processes are important when establishing 
or strengthening national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris 
Principles, as well as in the selection and appointment of such institutions&#8217; members 
and staff.</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>Members and staff of national human rights institutions should enjoy immunity

</p>
<p>107. <b>States are encouraged to implement the recommendations of national human 
rights institutions.</b> 
</p>

national human rights institutions and the servicing of the International Coordinating 
Committee.</b> </p>


<p><b> B. Recommendations to national human rights institutions  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>National human rights institutions working in conflict situations or crises are 
encouraged to be vigilant and proactive in protecting the rights of persons affected, in 
accordance with the Paris Principles.
