Indenture or any Financing Document, the performance of the Trustee of its obligations under the
Financing Documents, the exercise of any rights or remedies under any Financing Documents or in any
other way connected to or caused by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Financing
Documents or the ongoing relationship between the Trustee, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors
occasioned by the Financing Documents, including, without limitation: (i) the costs of defending and/or
counter—claiming or claiming over against third parties in respect of any Claim; and (ii) subject to the
provisions set forth below, any Losses arising out of a settlement of any Claims
14.11.1 Whenever the Trustee shall have received notice that a Claim has been commenced or
threatened, which, if successful, would subject the Company (the “Indemnifying Party”) to the
indemnity provisions of this section 1411, the Trustee shall as soon as reasonably possible notify (to the
extent permitted by law) the Indemnifying Party in writing of the Claim and of all relevant information
the Trustee possesses relating thereto; provided, however, that failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not release it from any liability which it may have on account of the indemnity set forth in this
section 14.11 except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.
14.11.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the defence
of any Claim in any jurisdiction with legal counsel of reputable standard in order to protect the rights and
interest of the applicable Indemnitee(s). In such respect, (i) the Indemifying Party shall require the
consent of the applicable Indemnitee(s) of the choice of legal counsel in connection with the Claim,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (ii) without prejudice to the rights of
the applicable Indemnitee(s) to retain counsel and participate in the defence of the Claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the applicable Indemnitee(s) shall make all reasonable efforts to co-ordinate their
course of action in connection with the defence of such Claim. The related costs and expenses sustained
in such respect by the applicable Indemnitee(s) shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall only be liable for the costs and expenses of one firm of
separate counsel in addition to the cost of any local counsel that may be required unless there are conﬂicts
among parties which necessitate more than one firm of separate counsel in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the costs and expenses of such additional counseL If the Indemnifying Party fails
to assume defence of the Claim, the applicable Indemnitee(s) will (upon further notice to the Company)
have the right to undertake, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the defence and (upon further notice
to the Company) compromise or settlement of the Claim on behalf and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defence of the Claim at
any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Indemnitee, acting reasonably, does not agree with the
manner or timeliness in which the legal counsel of the Indemnifying Party is carrying on the defence of
the Claim, or, pursuant to the opinion of a reputable counsel retained by the Indemnitee, there may be
one or more legal defences available different from the one carried on by the legal counsel of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee shall have the right to assume its own defence in the Claim by
appointing its own legal counsel. The costs and the expenses sustained by the Indemnitee shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Pany provided that the Indemnifying Party shall only be liable for the costs
and expenses of one firm of separate counsel, in addition to the costs of any local counsel that may be
required unless there is a conﬂict among parties or the parties are adverse in interest (including because
one party may have a defence that is not available to another party) which justiﬁes more than one ﬁrm of
separate counsel in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the costs and expenses of such
additional counsel.
