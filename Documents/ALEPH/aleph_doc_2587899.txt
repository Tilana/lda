pages thereto (the &#147;Guarantors&#148;) and Wilmington Trust, National 
Association,
as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;) (the &#147;Indenture&#148;). The Notes were
sold within the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities
Act&#148;), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on 
Regulation S under the Securities Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

Notes were issued
at 100.0% of their par value and bear interest at a rate of 6.125%&nbsp;per 
year, payable semi-annually in arrears. The Issuers&#146; obligations under the 
Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Company&#146;s 
existing and

Notes, along
with borrowings under the Company&#146;s proposed new incremental term loan

statement on an
appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer to exchange the
Notes for new notes, with terms substantially identical in all material respects
to the Notes and (ii)&nbsp;cause the exchange offer registration statement to be

this obligation (a &#147;registration default&#148;), the annual interest rate 
on the Notes
will increase by 0.25% for the first 90-day period immediately following the 
occurrence of the registration default. The annual interest rate on the Notes 
will increase by an additional 0.25% for each subsequent 90-day period during 
which the
registration default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 
1.0%&nbsp;per annum. If the registration default is corrected, the interest rate
on the Notes will revert to the original level. </P>
