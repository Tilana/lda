FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Calvalley Petroleum – 2009 Annual Results and Filing of Reserves Data
Calgary, Alberta, March 31, 2010 – Calvalley Petroleum Inc., (TSX: CVI.A) 
 
Calvalley Petroleum Inc. (the “Company” or “Calvalley”), an international junior oil and gas company 
based  in  Calgary,  Alberta,  is  pleased  to  announce  its  financial  and  operating  results  for  the  year 
ended  December  31,  2009  and  the  filing  of  its  updated  reserves  estimates  and  other  disclosure 
documents.  The  Company  operates  its  50%  working  interest  in  Block  9  in  the  Masila  Basin  of  the 
Republic of Yemen and 100% working interest in the Gimbi and Metema Blocks in Ethiopia. 
 
 
2009 Highlights 
 
For the fourth consecutive year, Calvalley generated funds from operations which were sufficient to 
fund the entire capital spending program for the year.  Strong commodity prices and stable production 
were key factors in generating funds from operations. 
 
Calvalley  had  set  several  key  objectives  for  2009.    Management  is  pleased  to  report  Calvalley’s 
accomplishments against these key objectives. 
 
Transportation Agreement Successfully Completed - Complex multi-party negotiations were held 
throughout 2009 and culminated in the execution of all transportation agreements during February, 
2010.  As a result, Calvalley will be able to ship blended crude (26 degrees API) to Block 51.  This will 
enable  Calvalley  to  commence  production  from  all  Block  9  fields  including  heavy  oil  from  the  Al 
Roidhat field. 
 
Growth  Momentum  Continued  -  Despite  limited  drilling  activities  due  to  the  state  of  the  global 
economy, Calvalley added 11 percent and 14 percent new reserves to 2P and 3P reserves categories 
respectively. 
 
Larger Mapped Structures and Future Development Plan - With the positive results of the QQ-2 
flow  test,  drilling  activities  in  the  adjacent  block  and  re-interpretation  of  2D  seismic,  Calvalley’s 
technical  team  has  mapped  larger  structures  in  the  Kohlan  sands  and  fractured basement.    These 
changes are being incorporated into a future appraisal and development plan. 
 
Increasing Opportunities - Calvalley’s inventory of prospects has increased to 47.  The QQ-2 test 
and Ras Nowmah drilling results have helped the technical team to high grade the inventory. 
 
Initial  geological  work  underway  in  Ethiopia  -  Calvalley  has  completed  the  first  phase  surface 
geological  work  on  both  Metema  and  Gimbi  Blocks.  However,  the  gravity/magnetic  survey  was 
deferred into 2010. 
 
Al Roidhat 
 
Development  of  Al-Roidhat  continued  in  preparation  for  the  finalization  of  the  transportation 
agreements  for  blended  crude.    Calvalley  worked  over  the  four  wells  which  had  previously  been 
completed  and  tested  and  completed  three  additional  wells.    Extended  production  tests  were 
conducted  to  better  understand  the  sustainable  production  capability  of  the  wells  and  the  field.  Six
wells are fully equipped and ready to commence production as soon as the Truck Offloading Facility 
(“TOF”) is completed at Block 51.  Production from these wells will be accumulated at the field storage 
tanks and will then be transported by tanker truck to the CPF for blending with lighter oil produced by 
other fields. The wells are ready to produce. 
 
Hiswah 
 
Two  development  wells  were  drilled  at  Hiswah  during  2009.    The  wells  proved  to  be  excellent 
producers as a result of our improved reservoir modeling and completion techniques. The successful 
results from these two wells resulted in an upward revision of recoverable reserves from the field by 
the independent reserve engineers. The initial pilot project for water injection yielded positive results. 
The second pilot test results are currently being evaluated to determine the optimal injection rate.  The 
second  component  of  the  pressure  maintenance  program  at  Hiswah  involves  the  reinjection  of 
produced gas to reduce flaring and increase oil recoveries.  The gas injection project was delayed due 
to the inability of manufacturers of key facilities to meet Calvalley deadlines. The shipment of these 
facilities occurred in Q1-2010. An existing well has been selected to be converted to gas injection and 
a gas line was constructed from the CPF to the gas injector.  The remaining injection equipment is 
expected to be on-site in the second quarter of 2010. 
 
Qarn Qaymah 
 
The testing programs which were conducted during 2009 established the presence of condensate rich 
gas and light oil in the Kohlan sands and the Fractured Granitic Basement (FGB). The initial test of 
the FGB confirmed that the Qarn Qaymah structure lies within a high quality oil system.  The zone 
naturally  flowed  significant  volume  of  light  oil  with  fluctuating  rates  up  to  maximum  of  2,350  bopd. 
However, the test flow rates were not sustainable due to the lack of appropriate downhole equipment. 
The  seismically  defined  structure  covers  an  area  exceeding  37  square  kilometres.    The  estimated 
hydrocarbon column at Qarn Qaymah 2 (QQ-2) exceeds 380 meters.   
 
The second stage of QQ-2 completion and testing involved the isolation of the FGB and testing the 
Kohlan  Sands.    The  well  flowed  condensate-rich  natural  gas  over  an  extended  period  with  rates 
ranging  from  up  to  3.5  mmcf/d  with  a  condensate  yield  of  approximately  70  bbl  per  mmcf  of  gas.  
Kohlan  sands  in  the  Qarn  Qaymah  fairway  display  regional  blanket  sand  characteristics  with  the 
fairway extending over 34 square km of Block 9. 
 
Ras Nowmah 
 
The technical discovery during 2009 at Ras Nowmah has advanced the location from the exploration 
phase to the appraisal phase.  Based on an independent log interpretation, the well encountered a 
total of 45 meters of gross oil pay in high quality reservoir rock including 35 meters in the Qishn and 
10 meters in the Saar formation.  Appraisal of this technical discovery will continue in 2010 with up to 
two appraisal wells. 
 
Crude Oil Transportation Agreements 
 
A critical component of Calvalley’s future success is the ability to market all qualities of crude without 
delivery restrictions which limit production to reservoirs containing light, sweet crude.  During 2009, 
Calvalley  management  focused  on  negotiating  transportation  agreements  which  would  allow  the 
Company to commence production from all existing and future discoveries on Block 9.  These efforts 
were  rewarded  in  February  2010  with  the  execution  of  agreements  which  will  enable  Calvalley  to 
activate  shut-in  wells  in  Al  Roidhat  and  transport  blended  crude  of  26o  API  or  higher  from  Block  9
through  the  Masila  System.    Immediate  production  growth  is  expected  to  be  realized  in  the  third 
quarter upon the completion of the TOF. Calvalley expects to receive the Masila Blend price for its 
crude. 
 
ETHIOPIA EXPLORATION  
 
Ethiopia represents an opportunity for Calvalley to diversify its operations outside Yemen.  Calvalley 
has  completed  the  early  stage  activities  for  the  establishment  of  its  presence  in  Ethiopia  and 
preliminary geological work which will be utilized to direct future exploration efforts.  As each phase of 
geological work is completed, the next phase becomes more targeted and more technical.  Additional 
geological work planned for 2010 and 2011 includes an aeromagnetic survey and a seismic program 
to identify a location for the first exploration well to be drilled in 2011 or 2012. 
 
Production 
 
Substantially all of Calvalley’s crude oil production in 2009 and 2008 came from the Hiswah oil field, 
which  produces  high-quality,  lighter  crude  oil  that  is  sold  at  prices  comparable  to  the  Dated  Brent 
crude  oil  reference  price.  All  of  the  Company’s  crude  oil  production  was  trucked  more  than  250 
kilometres  to  the  Safer  Exploration  and  Production  Operations  Co.  processing  facility  on  Block  18, 
where the crude oil was processed and shipped via pipeline to the Ras Isa marine terminal facility for 
export. During 2009, the Company’s working interest oil production averaged 2,160 barrels of oil per 
day (bopd) (2008 – 2,261 bopd).  
Production during the first quarter of 2009 recovered from the levels of the fourth quarter of 2008 as 
shut-in production came on-stream as pumps became available. Fourth quarter 2008 production also 
suffered  due  to  flooding  during  October  which  essentially  shut  in  the  Hiswah  field  for  four  days. 
Production  decreased  during  the  second  quarter  of  2009  because  the  facility  through  which  the 
Company sells its oil restricted the volumes of oil it would accept from Block 9. The restriction resulted 
from the facility seeking to achieve a target sulphur content in the oil blend exiting the facility. Sulphur 
content had been increasing due to decreased production from other fields feeding the facility. The 
Company shut-in certain higher-sulphur producing wells  to meet the requirements of this externally 
imposed restriction.  
Subsequent to  year-end, the Company finalized certain transportation agreements which will utilize 
alternate facilities at Block 51 and Block 14. Once shipments to Block 51 commence, the Company 
expects these delivery restrictions to end. Notwithstanding the above, the Company’s working interest 
oil production has improved and in February 2010 averaged 2,268 bopd.

Revenue  
During 2009, Calvalley recorded oil revenue of $50.8 million as compared to $74.7 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2008. The significant decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a 47.3% 
decrease  in  the  average  selling  price  realized  in  2009  ($57.08/bbl)  from  2008  ($108.23/bbl).  The 
decrease was partially offset by the fact that the Company recognized revenue on the sale of 890,636 
barrels  during  2009  compared  with  690,091  barrels  during  2008,  representing  a  29.1%  increase  in 
volume. The increase in sales volume is attributable to the timing of lifts and is not directly correlated 
with production, which was 788,461 bbls in 2009 versus 825,265 bbls in 2008. 
Other Revenue  
Other  revenue,  comprised  primarily  of  interest  revenue,  amounted  to  $1.2  million  for  2009  as 
compared  to  $2.1  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2008.  Interest  revenue  resulted  from 
maintaining  significant  cash  reserves  and  guaranteed  investment  certificates  (GICs)  throughout  the 
year.  Interest  income  has  declined  from  2008  due  to  reduced  interest  rates  throughout  the  year. 
Interest rates on interest-bearing deposits declined throughout 2008 and remained depressed during 
2009 as central banks attempted to stimulate the economy by reducing borrowing rates. 
Operating Expenses 
Operating expenses during 2009 were $11.3 million as compared to $7.7 million in 2008. Operating 
expenses were higher in 2009 on an absolute basis as a result of $1.7 million of operating expenses 
that were included in inventory at the beginning of the year. The operating expenses and depletion 
that were included in inventory were recognized as an expense when the oil inventory was sold during 
2009.  Operating  costs  for  the  year  amounted  to  $11.58/bbl  versus  $11.22/bbl  in  2008.  Operating 
costs  in  the  fourth  quarter  were  $12.12/bbl  compared  to  $14.53/bbl  for  the  same  period  in  2008. 
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were elevated due to workovers that were taking 
place. 
During the first quarter of 2009, the Government of Yemen charged Calvalley $1.1 million for facilities 
usage.  All  producers  of  crude  oil  in  Yemen  are  subject  to  the  FUF.  The  charge  was  applied 
retroactively from the commencement of production at Block 9. The portion of the charge related to 
deliveries  that  occurred  prior  to  January  1,  2009  amounted  to  $1.0  million  and  has  been  excluded 
from  operating  expenses  for  the  purpose  of  this  MD&A  to  maintain  comparability  of  operating 
expenses.  The  balance  of  the  charge  in  the  amount  of  $81,000  ($0.40/bbl)  related  to  oil  that  was 
delivered to the government facility during the first quarter of 2009. The FUF is recoverable from the 
Company’s share of cost oil in accordance with the terms of the PSA. 
As  a  result  of  the  global  financial  crisis  and  falling  oil  prices,  the  oil  industry  cut  back  or  delayed 
certain capital-intensive projects, which has led to less demand and lower costs for certain goods and 
services.  Calvalley  manages  operating  costs  through  competitive  bidding,  long-term  contracts  and, 
recently, renegotiation of current contract terms.  
Operating  expenses  include  $5.06  (2008  –  $5.09)  per  gross  barrel  for  trucking  costs,  third-party 
processing costs, and tariffs for use of pipeline and marine terminal facilities. 
Netback 
Netbacks for 2009 were $20.05/bbl compared to $48.65/bbl for 2008. Netbacks for the fourth quarter 
were  $28.87/bbl  versus  $24.03/bbl  in  2008.  Fluctuations  in  netbacks  during  2009  are  primarily 
attributable to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil. 
General and Administrative Expenses (G&A) 
G&A, net of $1.2 million that was capitalized into resource development costs, totalled $4.4 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31,

2008. G&A  costs directly associated with Block 9 become recoverable costs and will be recovered 
from revenue associated with cost oil under the terms of the PSA. G&A for the fourth quarter of 2009 
totalled $1.1 million versus $1.1 million for comparative period in 2008.  
EBITDA 
During  2009,  the  Company  generated  EBITDA  of  $16.0  million  compared  with  $34.6  million  during 
2008.  For  the  fourth  quarter,  EBITDA  was  $5.4  million  versus  $0.7  million  for  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2009. The fluctuation in EBITDA is primarily attributable to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil. 
The FUF referred to above in the discussion on operating expenses was a major contributor to the 
negative EBITDA recognized in the first quarter of 2009. EBITDA is also impacted by the timing of lifts 
by the purchaser of the Company’s crude oil. 
Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization (DD&A) Expenses

DD&A ($000) 
DD&A ($/bbl) 
Calvalley  recorded  DD&A  expenses  of  $9.9  million  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2009  as 
compared to $9.4 million for the previous year. Fourth-quarter DD&A expenses were $2.4 million and 
$0.7 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the 2009 versus 2008 annual DD&A 
rate per barrel is primarily related to reserve additions as reflected in the Company’s December 31, 
2008 reserve report. DD&A expenses were higher in 2009 on an absolute basis as a result of $1.3 
million  of  depletion  that  was  included  in  inventory  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  The  operating 
expenses and depletion that were included in inventory were recognized as an expense when the oil 
inventory was sold during 2009.  
Operating Income 
During 2009, the Company generated operating income of $6.1 million compared with $25.3 million 
during 2008. Operating income was impacted by the same factors as those affecting netbacks and 
EBITDA. 
 
Outlook 
Despite drilling only three wells (two development wells at Hiswah and one exploration well at Ras 
Nowmah)  in  2009,  Calvalley’s  proved  plus  probable  reserves  increased  to  26.5  million  bbls  at 
December  31,  2009,  representing  an  increase  of  nearly  8%  (11%  including  reserves  produced  in 
2009) over the 24.6 million bbls estimated by McDaniel and Associates at December 31, 2008. This 
represents  a  reserves  replacement  ratio  of  343%  on  2009  production.  Cavalley’s  finding  and 
development costs are $4.68 per barrel on a three year average basis.   
With the finalization of the agreements to transport blended crude to Block 51, Calvalley's 2010 capital 
program is designed to complete key infrastructure projects and implement a significant development 
drilling program which is expected to achieve a step growth in production from existing discoveries 
including  the  Al  Roidhat  field.  Calvalley  is  positioning  itself  to  increase  production  to  the  maximum 
allowable trucking capacity of 10,000 bopd (5,000 bopd net). 
Calvalley  expects  to  bring  Al  Roidhat  production  on  stream  during  the  third  quarter  of  2010  upon 
completion of the TOF at Block 51.
Major milestones are subject to risks noted under “Risk Factors”.  Milestones planned for 2010 include 
the following:
Increase Block 9 gross production by activating shut-in wells;
•  Complete TOF at Block 51; 
• 
•  Continue  to  add  new  reserves  and  production  through  the  development  of  existing
discoveries and by drilling exploration, appraisal and development wells; 
•  High-grade the existing exploration portfolio of 47 prospects and leads; 
•  Complete  a  gravity/magnetic  survey  of  the  Metema  and  Gimbi  blocks  in  Ethiopia;  and
initiate a 2D seismic program; and
•  Utilize  Calvalley’s  strong  balance  sheet  and  international  operating  experience  by 
continuing  to  evaluate  potential  acquisitions  of  additional  assets  in  the  Middle  East  and 
Africa.
Filing of 2008 Reserves Estimates 
 
Calvalley  is  also  pleased  to  announce  that  it  has  complied  with  its  obligations  under  National 
Instrument  51-101  by  filing  the  following  required  Forms:  Form  51-101F1,  Statement  of  Reserves 
Data and Other Oil and Gas Information; Form 51-101F2, Reports of Reserve Data by Independent 
Qualified Reserves Evaluators; and Form 51-101F3, Report of Management and Directors on Oil and 
Gas  Disclosure.  These  Forms  have  been  included  in  Calvalley’s  Annual  Information  Form,  dated 
March 30, 2010, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The reserves report was prepared by the 
independent  engineering  evaluation  firm  McDaniel  &  Associates  Consultants  Ltd.  (the  “McDaniel 
Report”) for the year ending December 31, 2009. The McDaniel Report is dated March 9, 2010.

CAPITAL EFFICIENCY
(cid:190)  Three year average,  F&D cost  per barrel for was $14.01 (1P), $4.68(2P)  
(cid:190)  343 % Reserve Replacement Ratio and 34 year reserve life Index (2P)
As  at  December  31,  2009,  McDaniel  estimates  Calvalley’s  gross  working  interest  Proved  plus 
Probable  reserves  to  be  26.5  MMbbl,  representing  an  increase  of  8%  (11%  including  produced 
reserves in 2009) over the quantities estimated by McDaniel at December 31, 2008, and a reserves 
replacement  ratio  of  343%.  Calvalley’s  capital  efficiency  for  new  reserves  remains  very  attractive. 
Average Finding and Development (“F&D”) costs over the past three years was $14.01 per barrel on a 
Proved basis and $4.68 per barrel on a Proved plus Probable basis.  
 
Management is pleased with the reserves additions considering only three wells were drilled during 
2009  (one  exploration  well  at  Ras  Nowmah  and  two  development  wells  at  the  Hiswah  field).  
Reserves additions were largely attributable to better than expected well performance from Hiswah
producers and a new discovery at Ras Nowmah.  The improved well performance at Hiswah during 
2009  has  significantly  de-risked  those  reserves  and  has  also  increased  the  potential  for  further 
positive reserve revisions should the well performance continue.  
 
More importantly, the confidence level in Calvalley’s reserves potential near the Qarn Qaymah-2 well 
has increased substantially.  For the first time, reserves have been assigned to an oil leg in the Qarn 
Qaymah fractured basement discovery in Block 9.  The Company expects that significant contingent 
resources  will  be  converted  to  reserves  once  a  full  field  development  plan  is  implemented.  Qarn 
Qaymah is Calvalley’s first oil discovery in the fractured basement in Yemen.  
 
The Company's working interest share of high case contingent recoverable liquid resources (oil and 
condensate)  has  increased  from  3.3  MMbbls  to  11.2  MMbbls  at  December  31,  2009.  Similarly  the 
Company's  working  interest  contingent  recoverable  natural  gas  resources  has  increased  to  95  Bcf 
from 8.2 Bcf.  These increases primarily result from the test results of the QQ-2 well and new mapping 
of the Qarn Qaymah structure.  Calvalley’s 2010 drilling campaign is targeted to move some of the 
contingent oil resources into the reserves category. 
 
Unless otherwise indicated, the reserves estimates in this release are based on “forecast prices and 
costs” and are gross working interest Proved plus Probable estimates. Except as otherwise indicated, 
references to “$” and to “dollars” refer to the currency of the United States of America.
