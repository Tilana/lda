FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
24
25
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in Item 2 of Part I of this report includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on
our management’s current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,”
“should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “proposed,” “intended,” or “continue” or the
negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because
they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other “forward-looking”
information. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking
statements, including but not limited to: our ability to continue as a going concern; difficult global capital market conditions and our
ability to raise the capital needed to fund our ongoing operations; uncertainty of our future revenues and financial performance;
risks associated with our planned development of our historically operating mine; the accuracy of estimates and assumptions
associated with our reserves and/or mineralized material; challenges to title of our properties; risks associated with operating in a
complex environmental and regulatory business environment; risks of shortages of supplies, equipment, materials and/or water;
our ability to retain key personnel; disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems; the minimal public market for
our common stock and the potential of dilution through future issuances of our common stock. You should be aware that the
occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking
statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING MINERALIZED MATERIAL
“Mineralized material” as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, although permissible under the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards. We cannot be certain that any
mineralized materials will ever be converted into SEC Industry Guide 7-compliant “reserves”. Investors are cautioned not to
assume that all or any part of the disclosed mineralized material estimates will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that
mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.

STAR MOUNTAIN RESOURCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(US dollars in thousands, except share amounts)
(unaudited)
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Star Mountain Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a minerals exploration company focused on
acquiring and consolidating mining claims, mineral leases, producing mines, and historic mines with production and future growth
potential identified through our exploration efforts. Currently, our operations are focused on re-commencing mining activities at the
Balmat Zinc Mine in the Balmat mining district in St. Lawrence County, New York and evaluating the feasibility of further
exploration of minerals at the Star Mountain Mining District, Beaver County, Utah.
On November 2, 2015, the Company acquired a 100% interest in Northern Zinc, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Northern
Zinc”), pursuant to an October 13, 2015 purchase agreement the Company entered into with Northern Zinc and its sole member,
Aviano Financial Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Aviano”) (the “Northern Zinc Purchase Agreement”). Northern
Zinc and Aviano are unrelated third parties. Concurrent with the Company’s purchase of Northern Zinc, Northern Zinc acquired (a)
100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Balmat Holding Corporation (“Balmat”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, St.
Lawrence Zinc Company, LLC, (“SLZ”) the owner of the mining property known as the Balmat Zinc Mine and (b) certain mining and
processing equipment pursuant to an October 13, 2015 purchase agreement the Company entered into with Northern Zinc,
HudBay Minerals Inc. (“Hudbay”), Balmat and SLZ (the “Balmat Purchase Agreement”). Balmat, SLZ and Hudbay were unrelated
third parties. The Balmat Mine is located in upstate New York. See Note 3 for further details.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.
The Company has incurred losses the past two years and had total current assets of $2,632 and total current liabilities of $6,248,
resulting in a negative working capital balance of $3,616 as of June 30, 2016. Further losses are anticipated in the development of
its business. In view of these matters, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations
and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations. Management plans to finance the Company’s operating costs over
the next twelve months with loans from significant shareholders and directors, debt financing, and/or the issuance of the
Company’s securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary financing on acceptable terms or at
all. If management is unsuccessful in these efforts, discontinuance of operations is possible. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
NOTE 3 – BALMAT ACQUISITION
On November 2, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Northern Zinc. Concurrent with the Company’s acquisition of
Northern Zinc, Northern Zinc acquired Balmat and its wholly owned subsidiary, SLZ (together referred to as the “Balmat
Acquisition”). Each of the agreements is outlined further below.
Northern Zinc Purchase Agreement
Pursuant to the terms of the Northern Zinc Purchase Agreement, we issued 10,000,000 shares of our unregistered common stock
to Aviano and assumed $1,390 in debts of Aviano in exchange for 100% of Northern Zinc’s membership interests previously
owned by Aviano. We also entered into a corporate development consulting agreement with David Linsley, a principal of Northern
Zinc; appointed Wayne Rich as our Chief Financial Officer; agreed to appoint two members to our board of directors designated by
Aviano; and offered advisory board positions for a period of at least three years to three other individuals associated with Aviano.
7
Balmat Purchase Agreement
Upon closing, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Balmat from Hudbay for a cash purchase price
ranging from $8,500 to $17,000 (the “Balmat Cash Amount”) and issued Hudbay 550,000 shares of our unregistered common
stock. Subsequent to closing, and in accordance with the purchase agreement, we must issue Hudbay an additional 78,857 shares
of our unregistered common stock.
The Balmat Cash Amount is able to be satisfied in any of the following ways:
Option 1. Under this option, $1,500 was paid at closing and the balance of $15,500 will be paid as follows:
●$500 upon completion of the first shipment of ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine;
    
 ●$5,000 on the 12-month anniversary of the first shipment of ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine; and
    
 ●$2,500 on each of the following dates from the first shipment of ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine: 18th month, 24th month,
30th month and the 36th month.
Option 2. Under this option, with proper notice to Hudbay within three months of the closing date (which has since passed), the
Balmat Cash Amount would have been reduced to $8,500: $1,500 of which was paid upon closing, and the balance of $7,000 was
to have been paid within three days after proper notice to Hudbay.
Under Option 2, Northern Zinc would also have immediately assumed all environmental liabilities in respect of the Balmat Mine
and all liabilities relating to or arising from any claims by existing or former employees relating to employment, termination, on-the-
job injuries or death, unsafe working conditions or exposure to potentially harmful substances and waive its right to indemnification
by Hudbay in respect of certain damages identified in the purchase agreement with Hudbay.
Option 3. Under this option, with proper notice to Hudbay within 30 days before the 12-month anniversary of the first shipment of
ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine, the Balmat Cash Amount will be reduced to $16,000: $1,500 of which was paid upon
closing with the balance of $14,500 being paid as follows:
●$400 upon completion of the first shipment of ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine; and
    
 ●$4,700 on each of the following dates from the first shipment of ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine: 12th month, 18th month
and 24th month.
Notwithstanding the above Balmat Cash Amount options, if any portion of the purchase price has not been paid under Options 1 or
3 within 48 months of the closing date (or 54 months of the closing date if we have not elected one of the options) then the entire
unpaid balance shall be immediately due and payable no later than the end of the 48th or 54th month, respectively.
Fair Value Determination and Allocation of Consideration
The purchase price allocation presented below is preliminary and includes the use of estimates. This preliminary allocation is
based on information that was available to management at the time these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
were prepared. We believe the estimates used are reasonable and the significant effects of the transaction are properly reflected.
However, the estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available and is assessed by the Company.
These amounts will be finalized as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

valued at $3,078.
The acquisition has generated no revenues for us since the November 2, 2015 acquisition date.
NOTE 4 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Accounting and Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted principles for interim financial statements. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include certain information and note disclosures that are normally included in annual financial statements
prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial information for the interim periods reported have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal,
recurring nature. The interim results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that can be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements-Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-
15”). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are
effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the
impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.
9
In April 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”).
ASU 2016-09 is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of its simplification initiative.
This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.
NOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company continually monitors its cash positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests.
The Company maintains balances in various U.S. financial institutions in excess of U.S. federally insured limits. The Company’s
balances of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and notes payable approximate
fair value.
The following table presents information about financial instruments recognized at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30,

The fair value of the Company’s purchase price obligation was estimated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model
in order to arrive at a fair value of the liability. A discounted cash flow model was used to calculate the net present value of the
remaining payment options (Option 1 and Option 3) to satisfy the outstanding purchase price obligation. See Note 3 – Balmat
Acquisition for a detailed description of each payment option able to satisfy the remaining obligation. An estimated probability
weighting was then assigned to each option’s estimated net present value to arrive at the overall estimated fair value. Significant
unobservable inputs include management’s estimated timing of activities (including option election dates and timing of first
concentrate shipments) associated with payments due under the agreement as well as the 5.6% discount rate applied within the
model. Acceleration of timing of elections or shipments of first concentrates would accelerate payments due, therefore increasing
the net present value of a given payment option. An upward/downward adjustment to the discount rate would result in an inverse
effect on the overall fair value, all else being equal.
The fair value of the Company’s asset retirement obligation was estimated using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair
value of the liability. Significant unobservable inputs include management’s cost estimates and the estimated timing of those costs,
the annual inflation rate applied to cost estimates and the discount rate used to discount the inflated cost estimates. The
undiscounted costs of reclamation were estimated at $19,126 and are expected to be incurred over the next 28 years. A 3.6%
annual inflation rate and 4.6% discount rate were applied. Any upward/downward adjustments to the estimated costs or inflation
rate would result in a corresponding adjustment to the fair value estimate, all else being equal. An upward/downward adjustment to
the discount rate would result in an inverse effect on the overall fair value, all else being equal.

13, 2013 (the “Stipulated Agreement”) to pay Christiansen $123 (the “Amount Due”) relating to a promissory note, accrued
compensation and out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Company. The payment of this agreement is in default. Subject
to completion of the payments due under the agreement, the parties agreed to release certain claims against each other related to
or arising in connection with the matters that gave rise to our agreement to pay the Amount Due. At June 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the remaining liability of $79 is recorded as Stipulated Agreement Liability in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

DANC Note Payable
On March 15, 2016, the Company issued a $500 promissory note bearing interest at 2.3% per annum to the Development Authority
of the North Country, a New York public benefit trust (“DANC”). The maturity date of the note is April 1, 2017, and the Company is
obligated to pay interest-only payments on a monthly basis beginning April 1, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the note, SLZ granted
a security interest in certain of its machinery and equipment as well as mining rights to DANC. In addition, unconditional
guarantees were provided by Balmat, Northern Zinc and Star Mountain. The Company paid $3 in interest during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. Net proceeds received after fees were $490.
TCA Global Note Payable
On June 28, 2016 the Company entered into and completed the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement
(the “SPA”) it entered into with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP, a limited partnership organized and existing under the laws of
the Cayman Islands (“TCA Global”), whereby the Company agreed to sell and issue to TCA Global up to $5,000 of senior secured
convertible, redeemable debentures (the “Debenture”), of which $3,000 was purchased by TCA Global on the Closing Date for the
total purchase price of $3,000. Up to $2,000 of additional Debentures may be purchased in additional closings by TCA Global
upon our mutual agreement with TCA Global.
Pursuant to the SPA, the Company issued the Debenture to TCA Global in the principal amount of $3,000 which bears interest at
18% per annum. The Company agreed to make monthly payments of principal and interest to TCA Global provided the first two
monthly payments after the Closing Date will consist of interest only. Beginning on the third month after the Closing Date, the entire
principal amount will be amortized in equal payments over the next 10 months along with interest on the unpaid balance until the
maturity date which is 12 months after the Closing Date. In the event of default under any term or condition of the Debenture, the
interest on the Debenture will accrue at the rate of 22% per annum until it is paid.
The Company has the right to redeem the Debenture in full and for cash, at any time prior to the Maturity Date, with three business
days advance written notice to TCA Global. The amount required to redeem the Debenture in full is equal to: (i) the aggregate
principal amount then outstanding under the Debenture; plus all accrued and unpaid interest due under the Debenture as of the
redemption date. The Company is required to deliver the redemption amount to TCA Global on the third business day after the date
of the redemption notice.
TCA Global may at any time and from time to time while the Debenture is outstanding on or after the Closing Date, during the
period of time when an event of default has occurred under the Debenture and remains uncured and at the sole option of TCA
Global, convert the Debenture into shares of our common stock (the “Conversion Shares”) at a conversion price equal to: (i) the
amount to be converted; divided by (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the lowest of the volume weighted average price of our common
stock during the five (5) trading days immediately prior to a conversion date. The Company agreed to give TCA Global make-whole
rights whereby the Company agreed that upon liquidation by TCA Global of the Conversion Shares, provided that TCA Global
realizes a net amount from such liquidation equal to less than the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice
(such net realized amount, the “Realized Amount”), the Company agreed to issue to TCA Global additional shares of our common
stock equal to: (i) the conversion amount; minus (ii) the Realized Amount; divided by (iii) the average volume weighted average
price of our Common Stock during the five (5) Business Days immediately prior to the date upon which TCA Global delivers notice
to the Company that such additional shares are requested by TCA Global. Following the sale of the make-whole shares by TCA
Global: (i) in the event that TCA Global receives net proceeds from such sale which, when added to the Realized Amount from the
prior relevant conversion notice, is less than the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice, TCA Global shall
deliver an additional make-whole notice to us and our obligation to issue make-whole shares shall continue until the conversion
amount has been fully satisfied; and (ii) in the event that TCA Global received net proceeds from the sale of make-whole shares in
excess of the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice, such excess amount shall be applied to satisfy any
and all amounts owed hereunder in excess of the conversion amount specified in the relevant conversion notice.
13

Services Agreement. Net proceeds received after fees were $2,444.
Collateral
To secure our obligations under the Debenture, the Company entered into a Security Agreement covering all of our assets, a

covering all of their assets and pledge agreements covering their ownership interest in their subsidiaries (our indirect subsidiaries)
(collectively, the “Pledge Agreements”), our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary St. Lawrence Zinc Company, LLC entered into a
Mortgage, Security Agreement, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and Fixture Filing in favor of TCA Global encumbering all of its

Company issued to DANC, which loan is pari passu with the Debenture as provided for in an Intercreditor Agreement entered into
between DANC and TCA Global), Guarantee Agreements whereby our subsidiaries guaranteed our performance and payment
under the Debenture.
Notes Payable – Related Parties
The Company’s current notes payable – related parties balance at June 30, 2016 is net of reductions of $42 for unamortized

On November 10, 2015, the Company sold a total of 87.5 units to Mr. Marchal and Mr. Brogen in a private offering. Each unit
consisted of:
15
(i)
one convertible note in the principal amount of $10 per unit that bears simple interest at the rate of 10% per annum and is
payable by the Company on a lump sum basis with respect to principal and interest on or before October 31, 2016, unless
earlier repaid at the sole option of the Company or converted into common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share;
(ii) 5,000 shares of the Company’s common stock; and
a warrant to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $2.00 per share for a period of three years from the date
of issuance.
(iii)
The aggregate total of all notes issued in connection with this offering was $875. In addition, the Company issued a total of
437,500 common shares and warrants to purchase a total of 437,500 common shares. As equity treatment was determined
appropriate for the common stock and warrants issued with these convertible notes, the proceeds were allocated based on relative
fair values. The fair value of the common stock issuance of 437,500 shares was estimated at $127, or $0.29 per share as estimated
by independent valuation experts as part of the purchase price valuation performed for the Balmat Acquisition. The fair value of the
warrants was estimated at $21 using a Black-Scholes model with inputs including a market price of the Company’s common
shares of $0.29 per share, an exercise price of $2.00, a three-year term, volatility of 70%, a risk-free rate of 0.75% and no assumed
dividends.
Based on the relative fair values, initial note principal and note discount of $875 and $126, respectively, were recorded. During the
six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $63 in accretion of the note discount and $44 of accrued interest
associated with these related party notes. The effective interest rate of the notes is 24.5%.
Purchase Price Obligation – Balmat Acquisition
As is described in detail in Note 3, the Company has the right to satisfy the remaining amount owed to Hudbay related to the
Balmat Acquisition in one of two remaining ways (the purchase price obligation) where:
●the estimated fair value of this purchase price obligation of $13,361 was determined using a discounted cash flow model, with
future cash flows estimated based upon probability-weighted scenarios of payments under the remaining two repayment options;
●the current portion of this purchase price obligation of $500 reflects the Company’s plan to resume production at the Balmat Mine
within the next 12-months; and
●
because of the repayment options available to the Company and the fact that the Company has not yet selected one of these
repayment options, we are not able to say with certainty when the long-term portions of this purchase price obligation will be
paid.
Notwithstanding the above, if any portion of the purchase price obligation has not been paid within 48 months of the closing date
(or 54 months of the closing date if we have not elected one of the options) then the entire unpaid balance is immediately due and
payable to Hudbay no later than November 2, 2019 or May 2, 2020, respectively.
NOTE 11 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION
Changes in our asset retirement obligation are summarized in the following table:

$17,906
The Company recognized $412 in accretion expense during the six months ended June 30, 2016. An adjustment to the estimated
timing of future cash outflows associated with the Company’s planned reclamation activities resulted in a $412 downward
adjustment to the estimated fair value of the Company’s liability as of June 30, 2016.
NOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Royalty Payments
On a portion of the Balmat Mine’s mineral leases, the Company is subject to royalty payments of up to 4% of the net smelter return
on ores mined from these properties.
Potential Environmental Contingency
Our exploration and development activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of
the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and generally becoming more restrictive. The Company
conducts its operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are materially in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws
and regulations.
Legal Matters
In connection with our litigation involving Michael Stanford, formerly the Company’s CEO, in which the Fifth District Court of Beaver
County (Civil Case No. 140500023) awarded us a judgment against Mr. Stanford, the court issued a further order on February 2,
2015 authorizing us to cancel 910,000 shares of our common stock previously issued to Mr. Stanford. This cancellation of shares
was in addition the 25,000,000 shares that Mr. Stanford returned to the Company and were cancelled by us on September 22,
2014. The 910,000 shares were cancelled on February 2, 2015.
We are evaluating what future legal proceedings we may pursue in order to collect money damages of approximately $23,495
awarded to us pursuant to the judgment. Our ability to collect any further amounts on the judgment is, however, inherently
unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a recovery and/or the
measurement of any recovery is complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible further
recovery and no amounts related to this award have been included in our financial statements. Our assessment is based on
estimates and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and
assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might
cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.
Other than as set forth above, we are not presently a party to any material litigation nor to the knowledge of management is any
litigation threatened against us that may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.
NOTE 13 – EQUITY
Common Stock
On January 1, 2016, the Company entered into a consulting agreement for services relating to shareholder information and public
relations. The consulting firm was issued 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $0.66 per share for the six-
month agreement. Subsequently, on May 27, 2016, the Company cancelled 150,000 of the issued shares upon termination of the
agreement.
On February 24, 2016, the Company entered into a consulting agreement for services relating to management consulting and
business advisory. The consulting firm was issued 150,000 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $0.51 per share for
the six-month agreement.

Stock Options
The Company did not issue any stock option awards during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
On March 1, 2015, as part of an employment agreement, the Company granted an option to purchase 250,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The option vested as follows: 50,000 shares upon execution
of the employment agreement and 50,000 shares each on March 31, 2015; June 30, 2015; September 30, 2015; and December 31,
2015. On the grant date, the Company estimated the fair value of the option grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model
based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date as quoted on the stock exchange where the majority of our
trading volume and value of the shares occurs and assuming a maturity of 2.7 years, a 0.896% risk free rate and a 88.83% volatility.
The compensation expense recognized in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 for stock option awards was zero and $85, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, there was no unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested stock options as all outstanding options were fully vested.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following management’s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial results and condition of Star Mountain
Resources, Inc. (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Star Mountain” or the “Company”) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016,
should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
herewith and the audited consolidated financial statements of Star Mountain for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the
related notes thereto filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This
discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results
may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not
limited to, those set forth elsewhere in this report. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”
All amounts are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share and common share amounts, unless otherwise noted.
INTRODUCTION
Our primary focus is currently on the re-start of mining operations at our Balmat Mine in upstate New York, which includes raising
the capital needed to fund these re-start activities. If successful in our efforts, this re-start will transition us from a junior exploration
company with no revenues to a producing mining company capable of generating a consistent stream of revenues through the
production of a salable zinc concentrate material.
OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
We currently have limited cash resources on hand and a cash burn rate that ranges from approximately $200 to $300 per month
and will increase to approximately $500 to $600 per month beginning in September to satisfy a $3,000 debt obligation we incurred
on June 28, 2016 as discussed in Note 10 to our financial statements included in this report. Unless we are able to secure
additional funds shortly, we may not be able to meet some or all of our obligations. As a result, capital raising has been and
continues to be our number one priority and will remain our top priority until we have successfully raised the capital to meet our
projected cash needs; including our working capital needs as well as the capital needed for the re-start of operations at the Balmat
Mine.
As part of our capital raising efforts, we have had discussions with a number of possible financing sources about various forms of
financing including, but not limited to (i) equity investment; (ii) term debt; (iii) joint venture arrangements; (iv) off-take agreements;
(v) sales of a royalty interest and (vi) streaming deals. Notwithstanding, the market to finance mining related transactions such as
ours has been and continues to be very challenging and because of this we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our
efforts to secure the needed funds.
If our capital raising efforts are successful, our plan is to return the Balmat Mine to production following a six to nine month re-
commissioning period during which time it is estimated that we will need to invest approximately $14,700 refurbishing and
upgrading the Balmat Mine’s facilities and equipment and hiring and training the required work force. Following this re-
commissioning phase, the Balmat Mine would transition to a production start-up mode producing an estimated 300 to 500 tons of
ore per day during the initial ramp-up period before ultimately reaching the planned, near-term, full production run rate of 1,000 to
1,200 tons of ore per day; or roughly 360,000 to 430,000 tons per year. At full production, the Balmat Mine is expected to employ a
work force of over 100 employees.
To the extent that we are able to secure some but not the full amount of capital required for the Balmat Mine’s re-start, we would still
plan to return the Balmat Mine to production but on a scaled basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Three and Six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015
Summary
Our consolidated net losses were $1,523 and $1,776 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively
and $4,298 and $2,217 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the decrease in our consolidated net loss was primarily due to (i) a decrease
in general and administrative expenses of $837, (ii) a decrease in executive compensation of $371, and (iii) an unrealized gain of
$206. These decreases were partially offset by (i) an increase in mine maintenance costs of $444, (ii) an increase in depreciation
and amortization of $382, (iii) an increase in accretion expense of $206, and (iv) an increase in interest expense of $87.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the increase in our consolidated net loss was primarily due to (i) an increase in
mine maintenance costs of $985, (ii) an increase in depreciation and amortization of $762, (iii) an unrealized loss of $519, (iv) an
increase in accretion expense of $412, and (v) an increase in interest expense of $157. These increases were partially offset by (i)
a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $395, and (ii) a decrease in executive compensation of $381.
Revenue
Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were zero as we had no properties in production during
either period.
Executive Compensation
Executive compensation was $122 and $493 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively and $242
and $623 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. In May 2015, the Company issued shares to
executives for their services in lieu of cash, accounting for $593 of the $623 incurred during the six-month period.
Exploration and development costs
Exploration and development costs were $90 and $45 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively
and $139 and $112 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The increase during the 2016 period
was due to the acquisition of the Balmat Mine acquired in November 2015. While we have performed minimal exploration at our
Chopar project during 2016, we continue to incur development costs at the Balmat Mine as we continue to pursue restarting
production.
Mine Maintenance
Mine maintenance costs were $444 and zero for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively and $985
and zero for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The costs incurred during the 2016 period
related to the Balmat Mine the Company purchased in November 2015. No such costs were incurred during the same period of
2015.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization was $383 and $1 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively and
$765 and $3 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The increase during the 2016 period was
due to the increase in depreciable property, plant and equipment at the Balmat Mine acquired in November 2015.
Accretion Expense
Accretion expense was $206 and zero for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively and $412 and
zero for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The expense incurred during the 2016 period
related to the asset retirement obligation assumed as part of the Balmat Mine acquisition in November 2015. No such expense was
incurred during the same period of 2015.
20
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses were $390 and $1,227 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015,
respectively and $1,066 and $1,461, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. During the second
quarter of 2015, the Company issued shares for services to Directors and consultants in lieu of cash. No similar share issuance
occurred in the corresponding 2016 period. Absent the costs associated with the share issuance in 2015, remaining general and
administrative expenses increased during the corresponding 2016 period as a result of the acquisition of the Balmat Mine in
November 2015. With the closing of the acquisition, the Company employed an additional seven full-time employees from the
Balmat Mine as well as increased the number of employees and consultants at the corporate offices. Accounting and legal fees
associated with a more complex entity and operating structure also contributed to increased fees incurred.
Interest Expense
Total interest expense was $97 and $10 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively and $175 and
$18, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in interest expense was due to the
increase in outstanding debt as the Company issued several notes in late 2015 and 2016 to help finance the acquisition and
development of the Balmat Mine.
Unrealized Gain/Loss
The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $206 and zero for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015,
respectively. The gain represents the change in estimated fair value of the Company’s asset retirement obligation. The Company’s
asset retirement obligation did not exist as of June 30, 2016, as the Balmat Acquisition closed in November 2015.
The Company recognized an unrealized loss of $519 and zero for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015,
respectively. The unrealized loss for the six month period of 2016 consists of an unrealized net loss of $931, representing the
change in fair value of the Company’s outstanding purchase price obligation associated with the Balmat acquisition, partially offset
by an unrealized gain of $412, representing the change in estimated fair value of the Company’s asset retirement obligation. No
such changes in fair value occurred during the comparative period in 2015.
FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $2,025 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared with $195 for the same period
in 2015. The increase in cash used is mostly the result of (a) mine maintenance activities during the 2016 period occurring as a
result the Balmat Mine acquisition in November 2015 as well as the Company’s cash payments to executives and third party
vendors/consultants during 2016 (whereas much of the expenses incurred during the comparative 2015 period were settled
through the issuance of stock or considered contributed capital).
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,367 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $1,214 for the same
period in 2015. The net activity in the 2016 period included proceeds from the issuance of new debt for net proceeds of $3,184,
offset by debt repayments of $815. The net proceeds in 2015 related to issuances of common stock as well as proceeds from
related party notes issued during the period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At June 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $3,616 which represented an increase of $2,498 over our December 31, 2015
working capital deficit of $1,118. This increase was largely the result of (i) increases in notes payable and associated interest
payable, accounting for approximately $2,432 and (ii) an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $664, partially
offset by (iii) increased cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances, accounting for $638.
21
To the extent that we are unable to raise the funds for Balmat Mine’s restart and have no production from the mine, the $500
deferred purchase price obligation to Hudbay would not have to be paid within the next twelve months as the timing of this payment
is tied to our first shipments of zinc concentrates from the mine (subject to a final “no later than” payment date as is more fully
explained in Note 9 – Debt to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements).
Total outstanding debt as of June 30, 2016 was $17,943, of which $5,082 was estimated to come due within the next twelve
months. These amounts are primarily made up of obligations associated with the Balmat acquisition. The remaining long-term debt
of $12,861 is associated with our outstanding obligation to Hudbay for the Balmat Mine acquisition and becomes due at various
dates commencing upon completion of the first shipment of ore concentrate from the Balmat Mine.
Going Concern
We do not have sufficient funds to satisfy our current cash needs and, as a result, we will need to raise additional capital in order to
service our debt, fund our on-going operation expenses and, to the extent the capital is available, fund the refurbishment activities
necessary to return the Balmat Mine to production. As a result, there is substantial doubt as to whether our existing cash resources
and working capital are sufficient to enable us to continue our operations for the next 12 months as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of
our controls performed during the three months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
