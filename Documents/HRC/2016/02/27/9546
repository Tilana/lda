<p><b>R&#233;sum&#233; 
</b></p>
<p>&#192; l&#146;invitation du Gouvernement italien et conform&#233;ment &#224; son mandat, le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur les formes contemporaines de racisme, de discrimination raciale, de x&#233;nophobie et de 
l&#146;intol&#233;rance qui y est associ&#233;e s&#146;est rendu en Italie du 9 au 13 octobre 2006. Sa mission avait 
pour objet de faire le point sur les formes contemporaines de racisme, de discrimination raciale 
et de x&#233;nophobie en Italie, en s&#146;int&#233;ressant particuli&#232;rement aux facteurs de discrimination 
susceptibles de toucher les &#233;trangers, notamment les travailleurs migrants, les r&#233;fugi&#233;s et les 
demandeurs d&#146;asile, ainsi que les membres des communaut&#233;s juive, musulmane, sinti et rom. 
Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a souhait&#233; analyser les politiques et les mesures adopt&#233;es ou envisag&#233;es 
par le gouvernement r&#233;cemment &#233;lu pour combattre le racisme, la discrimination raciale et la 
x&#233;nophobie dans le contexte d&#146;une soci&#233;t&#233; marqu&#233;e par l&#146;h&#233;ritage et l&#146;impact des politiques et 
des programmes du gouvernement pr&#233;c&#233;dent, qui &#233;taient profond&#233;ment influenc&#233;s par l&#146;id&#233;ologie 
x&#233;nophobe et les plates-formes politiques de certains partis. 
</p>
<p>&#192; la fin de sa visite, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a pr&#233;sent&#233; ses observations pr&#233;liminaires au 
Gouvernement. Il retient principalement que, si la soci&#233;t&#233; italienne n&#146;est pas empreinte d&#146;un 
racisme profond, on constate dans le pays une inqui&#233;tante dynamique de x&#233;nophobie et une 
mont&#233;e des manifestations de racisme, qui touchent principalement les communaut&#233;s sinti et 
rom, les migrants et les demandeurs d&#146;asile &#8722; en premier lieu ceux qui sont d&#146;origine africaine, 
mais aussi ceux en provenance d&#146;Europe orientale &#8722;, ainsi que la communaut&#233; musulmane. Selon 
lui, ces groupes subissent de diff&#233;rentes mani&#232;res une marginalisation institutionnelle et 
socio&#233;conomique, de m&#234;me qu&#146;une discrimination d&#146;ordre culturel et religieux. Le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial juge particuli&#232;rement alarmantes les informations qu&#146;il a re&#231;ues au sujet des conditions 
de travail des immigr&#233;s dans l&#146;agriculture, qui s&#146;apparentent &#224; l&#146;esclavage, et de la situation des 
femmes migrantes, lesquelles sont expos&#233;es &#224; des conditions de travail abusives en tant 
qu&#146;employ&#233;es de maison ou aidantes et sont fortement repr&#233;sent&#233;es dans le secteur de la 
prostitution. Il prend note avec pr&#233;occupation de l&#146;approche s&#233;curitaire consacr&#233;e par la 
l&#233;gislation sur l&#146;immigration, qui a abouti &#224; la criminalisation des migrants, et de l&#146;absence 
d&#146;accords bilat&#233;raux avec la communaut&#233; de confession musulmane. 
</p>
<p>En ce qui concerne les politiques et les mesures adopt&#233;es par les autorit&#233;s, le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial se f&#233;licite de la ligne de conduite diff&#233;rente que le nouveau gouvernement a adopt&#233;e &#224; 
l&#146;&#233;gard de l&#146;immigration et des d&#233;fis du multiculturalisme, et de sa ferme d&#233;termination &#224; 
combattre le racisme et la x&#233;nophobie. &#192; ce propos, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial prend note avec int&#233;r&#234;t 
du nouveau projet de loi sur la citoyennet&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; au Parlement, de l&#146;intention annonc&#233;e 
d&#146;effectuer des r&#233;formes dans le domaine de l&#146;immigration et de l&#146;avant-projet de loi visant &#224; 
am&#233;liorer la protection des immigr&#233;s, quel que soit leur statut juridique, contre les abus au 
travail. 
</p>
<p>Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial formule pour terminer un certain nombre de recommandations, 
notamment sur les points suivants: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; La n&#233;cessit&#233; d&#146;exprimer au plus haut niveau la volont&#233; des autorit&#233;s publiques de 
combattre la discrimination raciale et la x&#233;nophobie et leur d&#233;termination &#224; le faire; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; L&#146;adoption d&#146;une strat&#233;gie juridique qui vise, &#224; court terme, &#224; faire appliquer la 
l&#233;gislation civile et p&#233;nale antidiscrimination existante, l&#146;adoption de la loi sur la 
citoyennet&#233; (sachant qu&#146;il faut veiller &#224; ce que l&#146;obtention de la citoyennet&#233; ne soit 
pas subordonn&#233;e &#224; un certain niveau de revenu) et la red&#233;finition du plan d&#146;action 
national &#233;tabli pour donner suite &#224; la Conf&#233;rence mondiale contre le racisme, la 
discrimination raciale, la x&#233;nophobie et l&#146;intol&#233;rance qui y est associ&#233;e, en 
concertation avec tous les acteurs pertinents, y compris les organisations de la soci&#233;t&#233; 
civile. Les mesures ci-apr&#232;s seront particuli&#232;rement cruciales: r&#233;forme de la loi dite 
Bossi-Fini, qui r&#233;git l&#146;immigration et, en partie, l&#146;asile; adoption d&#146;une loi et d&#146;une 
politique d&#146;ensemble sur l&#146;asile; et reconnaissance des communaut&#233;s rom et sinti en 
tant que minorit&#233;s nationales dont la culture et la langue doivent &#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233;es; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; L&#146;importance qu&#146;il y a &#224; lier le combat contre le racisme &#224; la construction dans la 
dur&#233;e d&#146;un multiculturalisme d&#233;mocratique, &#233;galitaire et interactif par la promotion 
de la connaissance r&#233;ciproque et du dialogue entre les diff&#233;rentes communaut&#233;s. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur visited Italy from 9 to 13 October 2006.  He travelled to Rome, 
Lampedusa, Siracusa, Ragusa and Palermo.  He met with the Ministers and other high-public 
officials of the Ministries of Education, the Interior, Justice, Rights and Equal Opportunities and 
Social Solidarity.  He also met with the Vice-President of the Supreme Court, members of 
various political parties represented on the Parliamentary Commission on Foreign and 
Constitutional Affairs and of local Government, including the police, and with the 
Vice-President of the Italian Federation of Football.  Furthermore, he met with representatives of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a wide range 
of national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) active in the combat 
against racism and xenophobia.  He visited a Roma and Sinti community in Rome, met with 
representatives of the Jewish and Muslim religious communities as well as journalists and trade 
unionists, and visited the reception centres at Lampedusa and Cassibile and the Temporary Stay 
and Assistance Centres (Centri di Permanenza Temporanea e Assistenza, CPTA) of Ragusa, 
where he had the opportunity to meet with migrants and asylum-seekers of African, 
Eastern European, Asian and South American origin. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur carried out his visit in excellent conditions, thanks to the full 
cooperation of the Italian authorities.  He also thanks NGOs, the communities he met and 
UNHCR for their excellent support. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Ethnic and demographic situation 
</b></p>
<p>3. Five per cent of Italy&#146;s population of 58,751,711 are estimated to be of foreign origin.  
Eastern Europeans constitute the greatest number of foreigners, the four largest groups being 
Albanians, Moroccans, Romanians and Chinese.<b>1</b>  Official sources estimate a population 
of 120,000-150,000 Roma and Sinti. 
</p>
<p>4. Since the late 1980s, Italy, like other European countries, has evolved from a country of 
emigration to a country of immigration.  Estimates indicate that between 1876 and 1970 around 
25 million Italians emigrated to the Americas and Australia mainly in search of work and the 
improvement of their living conditions.<b>2</b>  Since the 1970s, Italy has progressively become a 
recipient of migrant populations, experiencing significant migratory pressure and witnessing the 
arrival of populations from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Asia and South America.  In its recent 
history, Italian society, sharing a common historical, cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious 
background, has become exposed to an increasing process of multiculturalization, involving in 
particular cultures of non-European origin.

</p>
<p><b>B.  The legal system 
</b></p>
<p>5. The 1948 Constitution proclaims that the Italian legal system shall conform to the 
generally recognized principles of international law (art. 10.1).  Italy is party to six of the seven 
major international human rights instruments<b>3</b> and their optional protocols, the exception being 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families.  In addition, Italy is party to the 1951 Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees and the 2000 Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Crime (the Palermo Protocol). 
</p>
<p>6. The Italian Constitution recognizes the principle of equality before the law and the 
prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex, race, language, religion, political opinions and 
personal or social conditions for all, citizens and non-citizens (arts. 2 and 3), as confirmed by 
various rulings of the Constitutional Court.<b>4</b>  It recognizes the right to freedom of religion 
(arts. 19 and 8), the right to asylum, and determines that the legal status of foreigners shall be 
regulated by law in conformity with international law and treaties (arts. 10.4 and 10.2). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The political and administrative structure 
</b></p>
<p>7. Italy is a parliamentary democracy headed by a President of the Republic elected by the 
representatives in Parliament.  The Parliament, composed of the Senate and the Chamber of 
Deputies, constitutes the legislative branch; the executive branch, responsible for the general 
policies of the Government, is the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, who is 
usually the leader of the majority party or coalition of political factions, appointed by the 
President and confirmed by the Parliament; the judiciary is a three-level system of courts with a 
Supreme Court as the highest court of appeal and a Constitutional Court with the authority to 
decide on the constitutionality of laws and conflicts of competence.  Italy is administratively 
divided into 15 regions and 5 autonomous regions, provinces and municipalities with their own 
statutes, powers and functions. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur based his investigation on three main questions which he 
addressed to all his interlocutors:  1.  Is there racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance in Italy?  2.  If yes, what are their manifestations?  3.  What are the policies 
adopted by the Government to fight against these phenomena?  In the following two sections, the

Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial

against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

page 8 
 
Special Rapporteur reflects on the main issues and concerns that were reported to him by the 
Government and local authorities (section III) and the civil society and concerned communities 
(section IV) in response to these three main questions.  Thereafter, he presents his assessment of 
the state of contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance in Italy (section V), followed by his recommendations (section VI).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES:  GENERAL LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL 
FRAMEWORK TO COMBAT RACISM, DISCRIMINATION AND 
XENOPHOBIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Legal strategy and policies to combat racism, xenophobia 
and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Italian legal framework contains a wide range of criminal, civil and administrative law 
provisions to combat racism, which, in the view of the government officials with whom the 
Special Rapporteur met, provide the victims of racial discrimination with comprehensive legal 
protection.  While the legal framework is generally considered adequate, some voices within the 
Government acknowledged the need to improve its implementation by increasing awareness 
among the general public and concerned groups, but among law enforcement agents, members of 
the judiciary and other public officials as well. 
</p>
<p>10. In the field of civil<b> </b>and administrative law,<b>5 </b>particularly relevant is Legislative 
Decree 215/2003 (LD 215/2003), aiming at the implementation of the principle of equal 
treatment of all persons irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin (art. 1).  Moreover, the Italian 
legal system foresees civil action against discriminatory acts committed by private individuals or 
public administration on racial, ethnic or religious grounds (arts. 4 and 5) and on nationality 
grounds (article 44 of Legislative Decree 286/1998 governing immigration and the status of 
foreign nationals).  This form of civil action aims at ending prejudicial behaviour and the effects 
of discrimination and grants compensation for damage suffered.  Individuals and duly registered 
legal associations and bodies are able to initiate judicial or administrative proceedings on the 
grounds of individual or collective discrimination. 
</p>
<p>11. While the Italian Criminal Code as such contains no specific provision to combat racism, 
recently amended legislation establishes a criminal law framework (the Mancino Law as 
modified by Law No. 85/2006).<b>6</b>  Firstly, racial motivation constitutes a special aggravating 
circumstance, increasing the punishment by one half for all offences committed with the 
intention to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national or religious background.  
Secondly, ex officio investigation and prosecution are foreseen for racially aggravated offences.  
Thirdly, the establishment of, participation in, or assistance to organizations, associations, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>5</b>  In this field Legislative Decree 216/2003 and Legislative Decree 215/2003 incorporating into 
domestic law European Directives 2000/78 and 2000/43, respectively, are to be mentioned.  
Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishes a general framework for equal 
treatment in employment and occupation.  Council Directive 2000/43/EC implements the 
principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. 
</p>
<p><b>6</b>  See Law No. 654/1975 as amended by the Mancino Law (Law No. 205/1993) recently 
modified by Law No. 85/2006. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
 page 9 
 
movements or groups aiming to incite racial discrimination or hatred is prohibited.  Also 
prohibited are propaganda advocating racial or ethnic superiority or hatred, and instigation to 
commit or the commission of discriminatory or violent acts on racial, ethnic, national or 
religious grounds.  The amendment introduced in February 2006 by the previous 
Government to the Mancino Law<b>7</b> mitigated the punishments attached to the foregoing 
offences by reducing the initial maximum term of 3 years&#146; imprisonment to either a fine of 
6,000 euros or 18 months&#146; imprisonment.  The current Government has informed the Special 
Rapporteur, however, that a proposal to restore the more severe punishments is under 
examination.  It has also removed the reservation introduced by the former Government that 
impeded the adoption of a European Union (EU) Council framework decision aiming at the 
introduction of criminal provisions common to all member States in relation to racist and 
xenophobic offences. 
</p>
<p>12. Different institutions and mechanisms dealing with the fight against racism and 
discrimination have been established:  the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Human Rights (1978); 
the Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Semitism Committee (2004), tasked with monitoring 
regression with respect to forms of racism, intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism; the 
Territorial Immigration Councils, tasked at the municipal level with analysing the challenges of 
integration and multiculturalism; and the Council for Italian Islam (2005) as an advisory body of 
the Minister of the Interior examining the problems of immigrant communities of the Islamic 
faith in particular.  Especially relevant is the National Office for the Fight against Racial 
Discrimination (Ufficio Nazionale Antidiscriminazione Razziale, UNAR) (2004), which 
provides assistance to the victims of discrimination, including legal aid, launches prevention and 
awareness-raising campaigns, promotes positive actions, and monitors the implementation of the 
principle of equal treatment.<b>8</b>  During 2005, the Contact Centre of UNAR received more than 
10,000 calls, 282 of which reported cases of direct or indirect discrimination or harassment on 
the grounds of ethnic or racial origin.  Thirty per cent of these cases related to discrimination in 
the workplace, followed by complaints regarding housing, the police, public services and 
companies, schools and education, public transport, the mass media, health, public life and 
financial services.  It was indicated that the prototype victim is an African man between 30 
and 40 years old living in Italy for at least five years.  As recognized by public officials, the 
number of cases of racial discrimination registered by UNAR does not fully represent the reality 
as illegal migrants are afraid to report their situation, including because they lack awareness 
about UNAR legal assistance to victims.

<b>7</b>  Ibid. 
</p>
<p><b>8</b>  UNAR was established by LD 215/2003.  As defined in the UNAR 2005 report &#147;One Year of 
Activities Against Racial Discrimination&#148;, its aim is &#147;to foster the process of racial integration 
within the social and demographic evolution of the country, which shows a growing number of 
immigrants&#148;. </p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Legislation on and policies regarding the Roma and Sinti community 
</b></p>
<p>13. Although there are no precise data available, official estimates indicate that there are 
between 120,000 and 150,000 Roma and Sinti in Italy.  Approximately 50 per cent are Italian 
citizens, while most of the remaining are Roma from the Balkans and, increasingly, from 
Romania.  Roma holding Italian or EU citizenship have the same rights and duties as any other 
citizens while the non-EU Roma are subject to immigration laws.  Local authorities have the 
primary responsibility for addressing their situation, particularly the improvement of the living 
conditions of the non-Italian Roma population. 
</p>
<p>14. Roma and Sinti, usually referred to by the authorities as Travellers or nomads, have not 
been the subject of a comprehensive national law or policy, but of various legislative initiatives 
at the regional or local level on the protection of their culture.<b>9</b>  Under the &#147;Norms for the 
protection of historical linguistic minorities&#148;, Roma and Sinti have not been recognized as a 
historical linguistic minority.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>15. The Government acknowledged the need to adopt comprehensive legislation and policies 
addressing the specificity and needs of this population, as well as the need to reinforce the 
existing ad hoc solutions and pilot projects in cooperation with civil society.  Proposals before 
the Senate for the &#147;Acknowledgment and protection of the Roma people, Sinti and Travellers 
minorities&#148; and the &#147;Acknowledgement and protection of the Roma, Sinti and Travellers 
populations and safeguard of their cultural identity&#148; have recently been introduced.  
In October 2006 a working group was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which 
drafted a document based on all recommendations regarding Roma and Sinti from the different 
international bodies which is intended to serve as the working basis for a comprehensive bill.  A 
recently established inter-ministerial working group is elaborating a draft bill on the rights to 
non-discrimination, recognition of specificity and protection of the members of the Roma, Sinti 
and Travellers communities.  The Ministry of Labour, Social Solidarity and Health has adopted a 
National Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion that for the first time includes the Roma, 
Sinti and Travellers as a beneficiary group. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Special agreements with religious communities 
</b></p>
<p>16. The largest religious group in Italy, according to various estimates, are the 
Roman Catholics (97 per cent), followed by the Muslims (1.5 per cent); there 
are 363,000 Protestants, 230,000 Jehovah&#146;s Witnesses, 30,000 Buddhists and 30,000 Jews in 
Italy. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>9</b>  Since 1984 various regions have promulgated laws for the protection of the culture of Roma 
and Sinti, such as:  Veneto, Lazio, the Autonomous Province of Trento, Sardinia, Friuli-Venezia 
Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Lombardy, Liguria and Piedmont. 
</p>
<p><b>10</b>  This law, adopted in 1999, protects the language and culture of the Albanian, Catalan, 
German, Greek, Slovenian and Croatian populations as well as those of the 
French/Proven&#231;al-, Friulan-, Ladino-, Occitan- and Sardinian-speaking communities.  
(Law No. 483/1999). </p>

17. Religious denominations other than the Catholic Church have the right to organize 
themselves according to their own statutes.  Their relationship with the State is regulated through 
bilateral agreements, known as <i>intese</i>, between the Italian State and the Italian representatives of 
each denomination, (article 8.3 of the Italian Constitution).  At present, a draft law on religious 
liberty and on the bilateral agreements is being revised and will be submitted for approval to 
Parliament. 
</p>
<p>18. So far, bilateral agreements have been entered into with the Churches represented by the 
Waldesian Table, the Assemblies of God in Italy, the Union of the Christian Seventh-Day 
Adventist Churches, the Union of the Italian Jewish Communities, the Italian Christian 
Evangelical Baptist Union and the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy.  The <i>intese</i> with the 
Jehovah&#146;s Witnesses and with the Italian Buddhist Union have been signed but not yet ratified. 
</p>
<p>19. Four Islamic organizations have applied for <i>intese</i> though none has been approved so far.<b>11</b>  
In the views of various governmental interlocutors, the lack of a centralized authority and a 
unitary approach by the different Islamic denominational organizations has prevented the 
conclusion of an <i>intese</i>.  Nevertheless, as expressed by the Italian authorities, &#147;it is possible for 
the Government to start the procedure for the conclusion of different <i>intese</i> with Islamic 
denominational organizations, whereby each of them would be representing its 
associates-believers&#148;. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Immigration 
</b></p>
<p>20. The immigration law in force, the so-called Bossi-Fini Law,<b>12</b> besides promoting 
immigration from non-EU countries linked to employment, aims at curbing illegal entries with a 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>11</b>  The Islamic Cultural Centre of Italy applied in 1991 for an <i>intese</i>, which has not been granted 
because its particular organizational structure is composed of diplomatic representatives of the 
Islamic countries.  The Italian Islamic religious community (CO.RE.IS), comprised of Muslim 
Italian citizens, applied in 1998 for a bilateral agreement and recognition as a juridical person.  
In 2001 the draft decree was submitted to the Council of State, which returned a positive 
assessment.  The draft decree is at the Ministry of the Interior to be further improved in some 
formal aspects.  The Union of the Islamic Communities and Organizations in Italy, UCOII, is 
comprised of some 30 Islamic centres.  It submitted an application in 1992 without requesting 
recognition as a juridical person.  Negotiations have not begun.  The Association of Italian 
Muslims (AMI) founded in 1982 in Rome applied for an <i>intese</i> in 1997 but also did not request 
recognition as a juridical person.  
</p>
<p><b>12</b>  The Bossi-Fini Law (Law No. 189/2002) entered into force in September 2002 and its 
implementing legislation, Presidential Decree 303 adopted in 2004, entered into force on 
21 April 2005.  The Bossi-Fini Law amended the <i>Testo Unico,</i> the Consolidated Act of measures 
governing immigration and norms on the condition of foreign citizens (Law No. 191/1998 and 
Law Decree No. 286/1998), which had incorporated article 1 of Law No. 39/1990 (the Martelli 
Law) and the Turco-Napolitano Law (Law No. 40/1998), which had replaced the previous Law 
No. 943/1986 and all articles but article 1 of the Martelli Law. </p>

three-fold strategy:  (i) strengthening the control of borders;<b>13</b>  (ii) punishing smugglers, 
traffickers, and employers of illegal immigrants;<b>14</b> and (iii) rejecting illegal immigrants at the 
border, expelling them from the territory and imprisoning those who fail to execute an expulsion 
order.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Non-EU citizens, other than those entering for tourism, study, business, or family reasons, 
can enter Italy to perform subordinate work, including on a seasonal basis, as well as 
autonomous work within the limits set by the quotas determined yearly by ministerial decree,<b>16</b> 
provided that a work and residence contract exist prior to arrival.  In the residence contract, a 
prerequisite for obtaining a residence permit, the employer undertakes to guarantee adequate 
accommodation and the costs of the return travel.  As a response to the number of illegal 
immigrants on Italian territory, 1,369,258 immigrants have been regularized through four 
regularization processes in 1989, 1990, 1995 and 2002. 
</p>
<p>22. Once foreigners have entered Italy legally they are allowed to reside as long as they have a 
valid residence contract and permit for employment or a residence card, obtainable after six 
years of uninterrupted residence provided that the foreigner has sufficient income.<b>17</b>  The 
Bossi-Fini Law, in comparison with previous legislation:  (i) reduced the duration of residence 
permits from two to four years to one to two years; ( ii) required an additional year for the 
granting of a residence card; (iii) and halved to six months the time given to a foreigner who had 
lost his/her job to find new employment before losing the work permit.  The Bossi-Fini Law also 
established an office for immigration matters responsible for the entire procedure regarding the 
hiring of foreign workers (&#147;One-Stop Shop&#148;) in each province at the local office of the 
Government (<i>prefettura</i>).

<p><b>14</b>  The smuggler is punished with imprisonment from 3-12 years and a fine of up to 15,000 euros 
and the traffickers for the purpose of prostitution and sexual exploitation or other purposes 
involving minors with imprisonment of 5-15 years and a fine of 25,000 euros.  An employer who 
employs foreign workers lacking a residence permit or whose permit has expired without 
application for its renewal is punished by detention for three months to one year and a fine 
of 5,000 euros for each worker employed.  See articles 12 and 22.12 of the Consolidated Act as

agreements have been signed on the regulation of the incoming flow and readmission procedures 
are favoured.

23. Foreigners illegally entering or staying in Italy who fail to meet the requirements provided 
by the law, or for reasons of public order or national security may be rejected at the border, 
returned under escort to the frontier, expelled, or receive an expulsion order to leave the country 
within 5 or 15 days.  When rejection or expulsion is not immediately enforceable, illegal 
immigrants are held in a CPTA for a maximum period of 60 days, as extended by the 
Bossi-Fini Law.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>24. Administrative orders for expulsion are validated by a judge of the peace.  Appeals may be 
filed, though this does not suspend the person&#146;s removal.  Failure to obey the injunction to leave 
or the expulsion order is a criminal offence punishable by between one and five years&#146; 
imprisonment.<b>19</b>  The presence of foreign nationals in prisons has increased considerably in 
recent years, accounting in some cases for 50 per cent of the prison population.  In May 2006, of 
the 20,230 foreign prisoners (33 per cent of the total prison population) 11,590 were released 
in implementation of the collective pardon provided in Law No. 241/2006.  The remaining 
8,640 foreign prisoners come mainly from Morocco, Albania, Tunisia, Romania and countries of 
the former Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>25. Italian authorities have emphasized the importance of integration, though they have 
acknowledged that assimilation was the model that had been followed so far.  Italian authorities 
place particular importance on knowledge of the language and the acceptance of Italian values as 
contained in the Constitution, such as equality between men and women, as a basis for the 
integration of foreigners.  During the visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed about an 
ongoing process by which &#147;a charter of values, in consultation with all communities, is to be 
drafted to provide for a common framework to allow a cohabitation model&#148;.<b>20</b>  The Government 
has also announced its intention to reform the immigration legislation in force.  In November, the 
Council of Ministers submitted a bill to Parliament, in which legal or illegal migrants who were 
victims of abuse and exploitation in the agricultural and construction sectors would be granted a 
special stay permit on the same terms as victims of trafficking.  The Minister of the Interior has 
set up a commission to identify ad hoc actions to fight violence against and exploitation of 
foreign workers.  The draft law also foresees penal and civil sanctions ranging from one to 
eight years&#146; imprisonment and a fine of 9,000 euros, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Asylum 
</b></p>
<p>26. From 1990 to 2006, Italy examined 142,198 petitions for the recognition of refugee status.  
During the 1990s, the Balkans, mainly Albania and the former Yugoslavia, was the place of 
origin of the majority of asylum-seekers; it was gradually replaced by countries of sub-Saharan 
and Central Africa, the Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Somalia, as well as Ethiopia and 
Eritrea.  In 2005-2006, 19,655 asylum petitions were examined.

27. Asylum is currently regulated by the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees, article 10.3 of the Constitution, the Dublin Convention, article 1 of the Martelli Law, 
the Bossi-Fini Law, as well as Legislative Decree 140/2005.<b>21</b>  The Italian authorities 
acknowledged that there is still no Organic Law on the right to asylum as referred to in the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>28. The Bossi-Fini Law, through its implementing decree, has decentralized the refugee status 
determination procedure by establishing seven Local Asylum Commissions (LAC) throughout 
the territory as first instance administrative bodies and a National Asylum Commission (NAC) as 
the coordination body.  LACs are responsible for examining applications, interviewing the 
asylum-seeker and granting asylum or humanitarian protection in accordance with the law.  NAC 
may revoke or terminate the status granted.  Upon refusal of asylum status the applicant is 
entitled to appeal the decision before the civil courts, though the appeal does not suspend the 
expulsion order or its execution.  Asylum-seekers are held in &#147;identification centres&#148; while the 
first instance decision on their refugee status is being adopted, which may take 20 or 35 days in 
accordance with the urgent and ordinary procedures provided in Bossi-Fini Law.<b>22</b>  
Asylum-seekers may also be held in reception centres in those municipalities that have joined 
the Asylum-Seekers Protection System. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Citizenship 
</b></p>
<p>29. The current citizenship law adopted in 1992 adheres to the principle of <i>jus sanguinis</i> by 
which the transmission of citizenship takes place by descent from Italian citizens, while the 
principle of <i>jus soli</i> (the acquisition of citizenship by birth on a given territory) is confined to 
particular cases.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>30. A new draft Law on Citizenship is being examined by Parliament.  The draft law 
introduces three major changes.  First, regarding the acquisition of citizenship by minors, the law 
introduces the principle of <i>jus soli</i>, in addition to the principle of <i>jus sanguinis</i> as foreseen in the 
1992 law in force.  Children born in Italy to foreign parents will no longer need to reside 
continuously in Italy from birth to the age of 18 years to obtain Italian citizenship if one of their 
parents was either born in Italy or legally resident for at least five years at the time of birth.  In 
both cases, parents of minors are required to have a minimum annual income.<b>24</b>  Regarding 
                                                 
<b>21</b>  Legislative Decree 140/2005 was adopted in implementation of European Directive 
No. 2003/9/CE establishing minimum standards for the reception of asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p><b>22</b>  Two different procedures are foreseen by the Bossi-Fini Law.  A simplified procedure applies 
to asylum-seekers who were arrested due to illegal entry or attempted illegal entry, or who are 
irregularly staying on the Italian territory, or who applied for asylum after receiving an expulsion 
or rejection order; an ordinary procedure applies to those asylum-seekers who do not qualify for 
the simplified procedure. 
</p>
<p><b>23</b>  See Law No. 91 of 5 February 1992. 
</p>
<p><b>24</b>  The said income conditions refer to the annual income required in order to obtain a long-term 
EU residence permit, the latter being the &#147;minimum pension&#148; granted by the State, which at the 
end of August 2006, stood at 4,962.36 euros (equivalent to 381.72 euros x 13 months). </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.4

foreign minors not born in Italy, the draft law foresees three requirements for the acquisition of 
citizenship:  (i) an application by the natural or legal parents (if one of them was born in Italy or 
had legally resided there for five years) or an application of the minor on turning 18 years; 
(ii) uninterrupted legal residence of the minor for at least five years; and (iii) completion by the 
minor of a school cycle or vocational training or one year&#146;s work.  The second major change 
would reduce from 10 to 5 years the period of uninterrupted residence required to qualify for 
naturalization, provided that the income requirements are met and that in all cases involving 
adults a test determining a degree of linguistic and social integration is passed.  Last, regarding 
naturalization by marriage, the draft would extend the original six months of residence in Italy to 
two years from the date of marriage, with a view to countering so-called &#147;marriages of 
convenience&#148;. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Combating racism in sport 
</b></p>
<p>31. Decree Law 162/2005 was adopted to provide new measures aiming at preventing and 
repressing dangerous behaviours during sports events.  This decree also set up a National 
Observatory on Sports Events, whose tasks are first, to monitor acts of violence and intolerance 
committed at sports events; second, to promote initiatives for the prevention of violence and 
intolerance in collaboration with associations and local, public and private bodies; and third, to 
publish an annual report on acts of violence and intolerance during sports events.  The Code of 
Justice in Sports was amended in September 2006 to introduce disciplinary and pecuniary 
sanctions for those who directly or indirectly offend, denigrate or insult on grounds of race, 
religion, colour, etc.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>32. UNAR has directly addressed racism in sport by launching awareness-raising campaigns 
for TV and mass media, as well as among the members of the Football Federation and its 
associated leagues, that led to the establishment of a working group to identify the existing 
regulations and to design new ones to combat racism in football.  In addition, during one of its 
awareness-raising activities - the Week of Action against Racism - UNAR undertook numerous 
activities at sports events. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  VIEWS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND CONCERNED GROUPS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. General legal and institutional framework to combat 
racism, xenophobia and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>33. Civil society denounced the following major obstacles:  the lack of a national action plan 
to combat racism, xenophobia and related intolerance; the need to improve the implementation 
of current anti-discrimination legislation by increasing the knowledge of judicial and law 
enforcement officials about existing legislation, as well as publicizing and informing about the 
civil and criminal remedies available to victims of racial and ethnic discrimination; the 
instrumentalization of racism by some political parties; the lack of electoral rights (active and 
passive) preventing political parties from taking the interests of non-citizens fully into account; 
and the lack of independence of UNAR as a body within the Ministry of Rights and Equal 
Opportunities, in contravention of article 13 of the Racial Equality directive.  In the field of

sports, civil society highlighted the fact that some internal regulations of various sport 
federations had not been yet harmonized with LD 286/98.  As a consequence non-EU children 
are not allowed to join official competitions at the amateur and pre-professional levels (from 13 
to 17 years old).  Civil society also felt that the National Federation of Football should be more 
proactive in raising awareness within the local federations on the existing and new legislation 
adopted to combat racism in sports. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legislation on and policies regarding Roma and Sinti 
</b></p>
<p>34. Roma and Sinti began to settle in Italy in the fifteenth century.  The Sinti are thought to 
have come overland from the north and settled in the north of Italy, while the Roma crossed the 
Adriatic Sea from the southern Balkan areas and settled mainly in the south.  These communities 
are generally referred to as &#147;<i>zingari</i>&#148; a term which carries negative connotations associated with 
dirtiness, or &#147;nomads&#148;, the latter reflecting the still prevailing belief in their nomadic nature.  
Yet, only a small percentage of Sinti engage in economic activities entailing an itinerant 
lifestyle, and most of the Italian Roma are sedentary.<b>26</b>  NGOs estimate that there are 
approximately 550,000 Roma and Sinti in Italy, of whom the largest group are foreign Roma 
citizens, mainly from Romania and the former Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>35. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited a Romani community located in a 
temporary camp in &#147;Viale dello Scalo Tiburtino&#148; and a Sinti community in &#147;Via Tommaso 
Smith in Casalbruciato&#148; near Rome. 
</p>
<p>36. The Romani community was composed of around 250 Romanian Roma, 60 per cent of 
them children.  They had been living for the past two years in an unoccupied building till they 
were evicted in September 2006.  The community expressed their discontent about poor living 
conditions and the lack of assistance from the authorities.  The Special Rapporteur witnessed 
their lack of access to drinking water and electricity as well as the inadequate conditions of their 
improvised &#147;houses&#148; made with plastic, aluminium sheets and wood, with earth floors.  Roma 
representatives complained that the consequences of living under difficult hygienic conditions 
nurtured the already existing prejudices against them.  They explained that the children were 
being rejected in nearby schools, allegedly because of &#147;too many foreign children&#148;.  The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that negotiations to solve this problem were ongoing with the Ministry 
of Education. 
</p>
<p>37. The Sinti community was composed of 40-50 members of whom 8 were children regularly 
attending school.  All members of this community had been born in Italy, had Italian nationality, 
spoke Italian and described themselves as being integrated with their non-Sinti neighbours, who, 
unlike the Italian Sinti, lived in regular buildings surrounding their caravan camp.  The 
representatives explained that they had received an eviction order without an alternative location 
and expressed their strong opposition to the announced measure, in particular as it would lead to 
the disruption of their children&#146;s school attendance.  Despite their legal status, they identified 
unemployment as the major problem, particularly due to their difficulties in accessing jobs 
outside the recreational sector, which was in crisis. 
</p>

Participation and Media Representation of Roma and Sinti in Italy, p. 6. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
 page 17 
</p><p> 
38. According to the NGO community, the discrimination these communities are facing is 
institutionalized and manifests itself in various forms.  Firstly, among the Roma and Sinti born in 
Italy, an important number still lack Italian citizenship despite having been born to parents of 
Italian origin.  These Roma are de facto stateless and should, in the view of civil society, receive 
especial attention from the Government and be the subject of special provisions within the 
citizenship law and other relevant legislation for their regularization and acquisition 
of citizenship.  In this regard, NGOs noted with concern that the recent draft citizenship law, 
despite its positive aspects, would not offer any solution. 
</p>
<p>39. Second - and in contrast to other linguistic minorities - Roma and Sinti remain 
unrecognized as a minority, lacking the recognition and protection of their language and culture, 
concerning which there is scant knowledge.  Roma and Sinti are not considered by the 
authorities to fit the ad hoc definition of a national minority, particularly as they do not (or are 
not perceived to) live in well-defined areas of settlement and do not conform to the traditional 
profile of a territorially concentrated national minority.  Additionally, Roma foreign citizens are 
said to benefit to a lesser extent than other groups from regularization processes and face more 
difficulties in accessing the regular labour market due to their double condition of being Roma 
and immigrants.  There is no comprehensive law, policy or institution dealing with the Roma and 
Sinti community addressing their specificity, nor have they so far been included in the National 
Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion as a beneficiary group. 
</p>
<p>40. Third, they are the ethnic group facing the heaviest discrimination in housing, education 
and health as well as employment and suffer from racist violence.<b>27</b>  Up to one third of the Roma 
and Sinti population live segregated from the rest of the society in authorized or unauthorized 
camps in prefabricated houses or caravans, often in poor conditions and without security of 
tenure, access to drinking water, electricity, heating and sanitation, insulation and ventilation, 
etc.  Moreover, associations highlighted that these camps are often subject to abusive police 
raids, during which the members of these communities are exposed to verbal abuse.  Regarding 
their access to education, Roma children, like all other children, have the right and duty to attend 
compulsory education irrespective of their legal status.  Reports have highlighted the difficulties 
concerning the integration of Roma children at school and the occurrence of incidents of bias and 
discrimination.  In the view of the NGOs working in this field, authorities need to systematically 
address the high dropout rate of Roma children, particularly girls forced into early marriage and 
domestic work at home, by replacing the current ad hoc projects with comprehensive long-term 
programmes involving the families, schools, police and local authorities.  Lack of employment is 
identified as one of the major problems affecting the Roma and Sinti community.  Much needs to 
be accomplished in the areas of housing, unemployment, education and health care.

<p><b>C.  Legislation on and policies regarding migrants and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>41. According to the information received from civil society, there are 
approximately 3.2 million regular and 500,000 irregular immigrants.<b>28</b>  Illegal migration 
flows into Italy originate mainly from Asia (e.g. the Philippines, China), South Asia 
(Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), Africa (Nigeria, Ghana), Eastern Europe (Albania, Romania, the 
countries of the former Yugoslavia, Moldova, etc.) and the States of the former USSR.  The 
most frequent routes are located along the Italian-Slovenian border and the Adriatic coast, 
particularly in Puglia and Sicily (the islands of Lampedusa and Pantelleria), and there are also 
reported cases of entry by air via both large and small airports.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>42. During his visit to the reception centres on Lampedusa, the centre at Cassibile and the 
CPTA at Ragusa, the Special Rapporteur met with male and female immigrants and 
asylum-seekers from Morocco, Tunisia, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Nigeria, Niger, Ukraine, 
Romania, Moldova, Colombia and the Philippines.  At the Lampedusa centre, he witnessed the 
arrival of a boat with 11 Tunisian immigrants and followed their reception process.  During these 
contacts the Special Rapporteur learned about the difficulties most of the immigrants arriving by 
sea had experienced in trying to reach the Italian coasts, either to escape from persecution in 
their countries of origin or to search for a better life.  He also observed the living conditions in 
the centres and the system in place to ensure the rights of the immigrants. 
</p>
<p>43. The current &#147;stay for work permit&#148; scheme within an entry-quota system and the 
imprisonment of illegal migrants failing to abide by their expulsion orders were seriously 
questioned by different interlocutors.  In their view, the Bossi-Fini Law fails to prevent 
migratory flows and leads to a situation where migrants find themselves in an illegal situation 
with no possible means of legalization, their choices being either to return to their countries of 
origin or to stay in Italy as a &#147;clandestine&#148;.  Under the current legal framework, life as an illegal 
immigrant in Italy implies a greater exposure to poverty and various forms of discrimination and 
abuse, particularly in the labour market, and a high probability of imprisonment for failing to 
obey the injunction to leave the country.  Being a legal migrant, on the other hand, entails a high 
probability of becoming illegal if the migrant loses his/her job, increasing vulnerability to abuse.  
Legality is not necessarily accompanied by integration in society, but often rather by 
discrimination in the housing, employment and education sectors.

<b>28</b>  The figure for regular migrants corresponds to the information contained in the Caritas 2005 
Dossier and the 170,000 new residence permits provided in 2006, while the estimates on 
irregular immigration refer to the 370,000 requests under the &#147;flows decree&#148; and the official 
figure of 120,000 ordered but not implemented expulsions.

44. According to civil society, particular areas of concern relate to the lengthy and often 
discretionary decision-making processes in the granting and revocations of stay, work and 
residence permits despite the introduction of the &#147;One-Stop Shop&#148;; the different standards 
applied at various courts of appeal in granting free legal aid; the lack of systematic translation of 
official documents for foreigners; and particularly the lack of suspensive effect of an appeal 
against an expulsion order before the judge of the peace. 
</p>
<p>45. Regarding the situation in CPTAs, concerns were expressed about the detention per se 
of asylum-seekers or irregular migrants, and in any case about the excessive period of 
&#147;administrative detention&#148; foreseen in the law, especially when the expulsion of foreigners is 
not immediately enforceable.  Additionally, NGOs strongly criticized the existence of 
&#147;multipurpose&#148; centres, defined as reception centres though functioning as CPTAs, such as the 
centre in Cassibile.  Particularly worrisome in this regard is the lack of clarity as to the 
applicable legislation directly affecting the migrants and asylum-seekers present in the centres.  
As to the management of the centres, a common concern was expressed regarding the lack of 
transparency and free access of lawyers, medical doctors and NGOs to the detriment of the 
quality of services and legal protection granted to immigrants and asylum-seekers.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>46. During his visit to the Women&#146;s Centre of Ragusa, the Special Rapporteur received 
first-hand information about cases which, if confirmed, raised serious questions concerning the 
psychological and legal protection granted as well as information given to the women held there.  
A group of survivors, who had witnessed the death of 80 fellow immigrants in the course of their 
voyage, had not received any psychological counselling and were still traumatized.  A woman at 
risk of deportation showed the Special Rapporteur her marriage certificate testifying to her 
marriage to an Italian and the documents stating that her son had been granted refugee status due 
to fear of persecution in their country of origin.  In a separate incident widely covered by the 
media, a group of asylum-seekers and immigrants denounced mistreatment and discrimination in 
the centre at Caltanissetta (Sicily), where sub-Saharan Africans were subjected to discriminatory 
treatment by some of those working in the centre.<b>31</b>  It was also acknowledged, however, that the 
quality of the reception migrants received in the centres, particularly in Lampedusa, had 
improved, though it still depended on the number of persons arriving on a particular day.  With a 
nominal capacity of 186 persons, only a week before the Special Rapporteur&#146;s visit, the 
Lampedusa centre had received 600 migrants.  While there is a project to enlarge the centre, 
NGOs voiced scepticism about its actual implementation as the enlargement has been pending 
for years. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>30</b>  Under the legislation in force (DPR 303/2004), the Prefect (head of the Government 
Territorial Office) entrusts the running of the centre to local, public or private authorities 
operating in the field of social work or assistance to asylum-seekers or migrants. 
</p>
<p><b>31</b>  Reportedly, unlike North Africans and migrants and asylum-seekers from other continents, 
sub-Saharan Africans were required to pay in cash for services that should be provided for free 
according to established rules and norms, such as food and telephone cards, and had to wait in 
line to receive medical treatment. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
page 20 
</p><p> 
47. In addition, civil society strongly agreed on the need to adopt a comprehensive law on 
asylum separate from the one regulating immigration.  They expressed concern that the appeal of 
a rejected asylum-seeker did not suspend the individual&#146;s expulsion, and considered insufficient 
the existing measure by which, at the request of the asylum-seeker, the Prefect may grant 
permission to stay in Italy until the court&#146;s decision on the appeal.  It was also said that in 
practice the granting of refugee status seemed to be limited to certain nationalities, and that often 
humanitarian protection was provided instead. 
</p>
<p>48. Civil society welcomed the attempt of the new Government to introduce new legislation on 
citizenship.  Concerns were nevertheless expressed regarding the linking of access to citizenship 
by minors with the situation of their parents, in particular regarding income.  The new law is said 
to disregard the particular situation of Roma, who often lack legal documents and the minimum 
income.  Thus, they would continue to be excluded from the benefits of naturalization and 
legalization exercises for unauthorized migrations. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Access of migrants to employment, health and housing 
</b></p>
<p>49. Civil society emphasized the existence of segregation in the labour market as well as 
differences in treatment between indigenous and foreign citizens, reflected in poorer standards of 
safety, lower wages and inferior types of contracts.  While male migrants work mainly in the 
building, metallurgical or agricultural sector, women migrants work mainly as caregivers and 
domestic workers and are highly represented in the prostitution and sexual exploitation sector.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>50. A journalist of the newspaper <i>L&#146;Espresso</i>, who pretended to be a Romanian immigrant and 
worked in the agricultural sector for a week in Foggia (Puglia), publicized the slavery-like 
conditions faced by legal and illegal migrants working in the agricultural sector, particularly in 
Pulia, Campania, Calabria and Sicily.<b>33</b>  In Foggia, for which 1,600 permits for seasonal work 
had been foreseen by ministerial decree in 2006, there are said to be 5,000-7,000 migrants 
working under exploitative conditions.  These male and female migrants come mainly from 
Bulgaria, Poland, Nigeria, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Uganda, Senegal, the Sudan and Eritrea 
and are forced to work 16 hours a day for 15-20 euros (if paid), with no drinking water, little 
food, and constant exposure to racist verbal abuse and battery from the gangmasters supervising 
their work.  There have been documented cases of death and severe battering of migrants 
attempting to escape.  As reported in <i>L&#146;Espresso</i>, a Romanian migrant was severely beaten after 
he was caught attempting to escape.  After being left without medical assistance, he was finally 
hospitalized for two weeks to recover from serious wounds and septicaemia.  Allegedly, as a 
result he was arrested for working illegally while the aggressors have not yet been brought to 
justice.  Moreover, women migrants are subjected to demands for sexual services for obtaining 
and maintaining their jobs or the jobs of their male companions and are obliged to work long 
hours even if they are pregnant. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>32</b>  The Merlin Law banned prostitution in brothels and mandated the registration of prostitutes 
and compulsory medical treatment. It is the exploitation of prostitution which is punished by the 
law.  In 2003, trafficking in human beings was punished by Law No. 228/2003, covering all 
forms of internal and cross-border trafficking for different types of exploitation.

51. Various NGOs highlighted the vulnerable situation of women working as caregivers and 
domestic workers, which often leads to abusive working conditions, including long working days 
for little pay without social security.  Additionally, it has been highlighted that migrant women 
constitute the highest percentage of those engaged in prostitution and the sex industry, reaching 
90 per cent of street prostitutes in some cities.<b>34</b>  A study by the Parsec Consortium indicates that 
there are about 17,500-22,700 foreign women in the street prostitution sector, the majority of 
them from Eastern Europe (41 per cent) and Africa (33 per cent) followed by Latin America 
(19 per cent), ex-Soviet countries (5.8 per cent), Asia (0.2 per cent) and others (0.8 per cent).<b>35</b>  
Around 7 per cent of them (1,292-1,629)<b>36</b> are said to be minors and a minimum number of 
11,920 and a maximum of 15,425 are said to be women migrants engaged in indoor, as 
opposed to street prostitution.<b>37</b>  The study estimates that a minimum of 2,508 and a maximum 
of 3,209 women were trafficked during 2004-2005.  Official data for 2003-2004 indicate that 
there were 1,971 victims.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>52. As an indicator of the health situation of migrants, it was explained that for three years 
civil society has been running a project providing medical care in the Puglia region to remedy 
the lack of assistance and unsanitary conditions.  In May 2006 a refugee-like camp was 
established in Cassibile to house and provide basic humanitarian assistance to about 
400 migrants working in the fields in that area.  Among the seasonal farm workers in southern 
Italy, a survey conducted by Medici senza frontiere found that 30 per cent of the workers had 
become ill during their first six months in Italy, and after 19 months in the country, 93 per cent 
of the people surveyed needed to see a doctor.  Infectious diseases, skin problems, intestinal 
parasites, and mouth, throat and respiratory infections (including tuberculosis) were widespread.  
The most severe illnesses were found among those immigrants who had lived in Italy the 
longest (18-24 months).

53. Housing is one of the sectors where discrimination is most obvious.  Non-EU citizens face 
greater difficulties in renting and buying a house in comparison to Italians.  In 2005 the courts 
ruled against the practice of some local authorities of limiting the assignment of low-rent public 
houses to foreign citizens or linking it to the number of years of residence in the country.  The 
quality of housing is often inferior among non-EU citizens.  Concerning the particular situation 
of seasonal workers, a survey estimated that 40 per cent live in abandoned buildings, 5 per cent 
had no accommodation and 36 per cent rented apartments lacking amenities such as running 
water, electricity and bathrooms.<b>39 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Religious minorities:  the Jewish and Muslim communities 
</b></p>
<p>54. The number of Muslims in Italy is estimated to be between 700,000 and 1 million out of a 
total population of 57 million.  Some 30,000-60,000 Muslims are Italian citizens, of whom some 
10,000 are converts to Islam.  As described by some of the men and women originating from 
Arab or Muslim countries with whom the Special Rapporteur met and who have been long-time 
residents in Italy, the terrorist attacks of 11 September and its aftermath were a turning point for 
these communities.  The generalization of the equation &#147;Arab/Muslim equals terrorist, or at least 
fundamentalist&#148; by the media, politicians, particularly of right-wing parties, and to a certain 
extent Italian society as a whole, was one of the first consequences perceived.  Such negative 
sentiments were said to have increased after the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London.  
Furthermore, the implementation of security policies and measures to fight terrorism often 
exposed them to harassment, racial profiling and abusive checking by law enforcement officials.  
Moreover, incidents and attacks against the Muslim community or their places of worship were 
reported.  A recent example is a demonstration organized by the Lega Nord, the Alleanza 
Nazionale and Forza Italia against the construction of a mosque in Colle Val-d&#146;Elsa (Tuscany) 
on 16 December 2006.  Following the demonstration, violent attacks against the mosque, which 
is in an early stage of construction, took place.  A week before, a pig&#146;s head was found on the 
land where the mosque is to be built. 
</p>
<p>55. Another major concern related to the lack of a bilateral agreement (<i>intese</i>) between the 
State and the Muslim community.  It was felt by civil society that the arguments used by the 
former and current Governments, blaming a lack of a unified voice or institutions among the 
various Muslim groups for this situation, were not acceptable for various reasons.  First, various 
bilateral agreements have been signed with a variety of different Christian denominations, 
without major problems.  Second, some of these Muslim communities, which had undertaken all 
necessary proceedings in accordance with the law, have been awaiting a decision since 2001.  
Another question perceived as a discriminatory practice concerned the additional difficulties 
faced in the opening of private schools of Muslim countries, for example the case of the

Egyptian School in Milan.<b>40</b>  Muslim organizations and parents have advocated that religious 
education in Islam should also be introduced into the curricula of public schools, but so far these 
calls have not yielded any concrete results. 
</p>
<p>56. According to representatives of the Jewish community with whom the Special Rapporteur 
met, that community, which has been present in Italy for more than 2,000 years, is well 
integrated in Italian society.  Yet, there are still attacks against them, taking the form of 
anti-Semitic graffiti on walls, including swastikas, and occasional violent attacks on symbols or 
places of worship.  In their view, these attacks often relate to their identification with the policy 
of the State of Israel rather than to their belonging to the Jewish faith.  Recent studies highlight 
that individuals and groups belonging to the far right &#147;constitute the most numerous and 
aggressive category of perpetrators of racist and anti-Jewish acts&#148;.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p><b>F.  The role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>57. Various journalists highlighted the critical role the media continues to play in portraying a 
negative image of migrants and associating members of the Muslim faith with crime, invasion, 
danger, extremism and terrorism.  When crimes are committed by persons of foreign origin or 
belonging to the Roma or Sinti community, their nationality or ethnicity is particularly 
emphasized.  This has been recently reflected in a proliferation of press articles on rapes 
committed in the area of Bologna by persons of Moroccan origin triggered by an allegation of 
rape against a Moroccan regular migrant that was subsequently disproved.  On other occasions, 
the media serve as a platform for the dissemination of racist and xenophobic ideas, as in an 
article published in <i>Il Tempo </i>in which Romanian citizens were characterized as a &#147;very violent 
race, dangerous and overbearing&#148;.<b>42  </b>Regarding the frequent equation of &#147;migrant, Muslim, 
terrorist&#148;, examples were given of the reaction of some media after the London attacks, warning 
of the dangers of having immigrants of the Islamic faith in Italy.  Civil society and journalists 
stressed the need to sensitize the media concerning their responsibility in combating racism, 
xenophobia and racial discrimination, and proposals were made for the elaboration of a media 
code of conduct in this regard.

<b>40  </b>This school was first wrongly referred to as a Koranic school by the media and some 
politicians, though it included in the curriculum the same number of hours that Catholic schools 
devote to the teaching of religion.  Allegedly, the reasons given related to the absence of 
conditions in the school that had to be fulfilled before a permit could be granted.  Nevertheless, 
the question was said to have become politicized and misrepresented by the media and required 
the intervention of the Minister of Education to be unblocked.

<p><b>V.  ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>58. After having collected and analysed the views of all parties concerned, the Special 
Rapporteur concluded that while Italian society is not marked by a serious phenomenon of 
racism, it is facing a disturbing trend of xenophobia and the development of manifestations 
of racism, primarily affecting the Sinti and Roma community, immigrants and asylum-seekers 
primarily of African origin but also from Eastern Europe, and the Muslim community. 
</p>
<p>59. These dynamics of racism and xenophobia are nourished by the legacy and strong impact 
on government policies and on public perceptions of the extreme right parties&#146; racist political 
platforms.  They are also fostered by media that make political use of and legitimize racism and 
xenophobia by exploiting the profound process of multiculturalism taking place in Italian society 
and its consequent identity crisis.  Italy is still harvesting the consequences of the policies of the 
former Government coalition which allowed the extreme right-wing parties to implement their 
agendas and to adopt an anti-immigration discourse and a security approach towards 
immigration and asylum that is reflected in the Bossi-Fini Law.  Nevertheless, the political 
instrumentalization of racism is not a phenomenon of the past.  Extreme right-wing parties 
continue to promote at the national level and implement at the regional and local levels their 
xenophobic and racist platforms.  Moreover, media, often driven by the post-11 September 
culture of fear, continue to incite racial and religious hatred under the guises of freedom of 
expression and the need to combat terrorism.  These dynamics of racism and xenophobia are 
illustrated as well by the increase of racist manifestations and violent acts in football. 
</p>
<p>60. The xenophobic trend that has been observed is also to some extent a manifestation of the 
fear resulting from the identity crisis of Italian society and the challenge of multiculturalism, 
particularly regarding non-European migrants.  The Italian national identity, historically 
constructed to promote the nation State, marked by the legacy of the fascist State and 
impregnated with ethnic and religious connotations, no longer corresponds to the profoundly 
multicultural dynamics of modern society.  As in most European countries, the emerging 
multicultural identity is clashing with the established national identity.  The racist and 
xenophobic platforms are thus articulated around the need to &#147;defend the national identity&#148; and 
&#147;protect the national security&#148;. 
</p>
<p>61. Xenophobia and discrimination against Sinti, Roma, immigrants and asylum-seekers of 
non-European origin as well as the Muslim community are manifested in a variety of forms. 
</p>
<p>62. Firstly, these groups face institutionalized discrimination reflected in legislation and 
policies affecting or addressing them.  For example: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Roma and Sinti, unlike other minorities, have been excluded from past legislation 
recognizing linguistic minorities, nor were they recognized as a beneficiary group of 
the National Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion.  The legislator has failed as 
well to address their lack of identity documents and birth registration and the legal 
consequences of this, allowing the perpetuation of their statelessness.  Regarding the 
migrant Roma community, immigration law has disregarded the double 
discrimination they face as migrants and Roma in their access to employment, the 
gateway to legal migration; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Migrants continue to suffer from a security approach in immigration legislation that 
criminalizes them.  The security approach of the Bossi-Fini Law exposes migrants, 
asylum-seekers and refugees to:  harassment by law enforcement agents; 
administrative detention in centres during the deliberation of their status, which often 
exceeds the deadlines prescribed by the law; and the criminal punishment of one to 
five years&#146; imprisonment for failing to obey an expulsion order or injunction to leave 
the country.  In addition, in the view of the Special Rapporteur, the discourse of the 
authorities supporting a model of legal migration within quotas established on the 
basis of the needs of the labour market is challenged by the reality of an important 
number of migrants working in the illegal sector.  Fundamental questions need to be 
raised in this context.  Are the quotas wrongly established, or are the needs of the 
labour market incorrectly assessed?  Are the lengthy and costly procedures an 
excessive burden for employers, who resort to hiring migrants illegally?  Are the 
repressive norms in place pushing migrants into illegality?  Is the current 
administrative detention envisaged for migrants and asylum-seekers in compliance 
with the human rights obligations of Italy?  These and other questions will need to be 
answered by the Government in the revision of the immigration policy in place; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Members of the Muslim faith, despite belonging to the second largest denomination, 
are the only religious groups with whom the State has not signed a bilateral 
agreement (<i>intese</i>). 
</p>
<p>63. Secondly, the Special Rapporteur noted a dramatic socio-economic marginalization of 
these groups, who face greater difficulties in the enjoyment of their rights to employment, 
adequate housing, education and health.  These inequalities vis-&#224;-vis the rest of Italian society 
need to be urgently addressed.  The Special Rapporteur found particularly disturbing the poor 
housing and living conditions of Sinti and Roma; the slavery-like conditions of migrants in the 
agricultural sector; the exposure of migrant women to abusive working conditions as domestic 
workers and caregivers and their high representation in the prostitution and sexual exploitation 
sector. 
</p>
<p>64. Finally, racism, discrimination and xenophobia have a deep cultural dimension.  There is a 
profound lack of knowledge and understanding about the culture and religion of national 
minorities and migrants, in particular about Islam and Roma and Sinti culture and value systems, 
which remain untaught or insufficiently incorporated in school curricula despite the 
long-standing presence of these groups in Italian territory.  Additionally, asylum-seekers and 
refugees, particularly from Africa, are wrongly believed not to have relevant contributions to 
make from a cultural point of view despite the richness of their history, art, system of values, 
spirituality, language and culture.  Fundamentally, the assimilation approach to integration and 
its dominant rhetoric of &#147;acceptance of or adaptation to our values&#148;, which demands that 
migrants and asylum-seekers literally divest themselves of their cultural, religious and, if 
possible, ethnic specificity, is not only a rejection of cultural diversity but also the reproduction 
and recycling of the historical cultural prejudice against the uncivilized non-European.  This 
posture, which reflects an ideological trend in the European construction that negates history as 
well as geography, promotes the European nature over the Mediterranean dimension of the 
national identity of the Italian society. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
page 26 
</p><p> 
65. The Special Rapporteur noted the emergence of factors and positive trends to combat the 
dynamics of racism, discrimination and xenophobia within the Italian society reflected in a clear 
political will on the part of the Government, particularly at the central level, to combat racism, 
xenophobia and related intolerance.  This political will is illustrated by legislative initiatives such 
as the draft citizenship law, the announced reforms of the immigration legislation and the 
strengthening of the repressive measures to combat racism and abuse towards migrants; the 
greater sensitivity towards multiculturalism being included in the education policies; the 
strengthening of a rights-based approach to immigration and asylum within the Government and 
its institutions; as well as the steps taken for the improvement of the living conditions and quality 
of the legal protection granted in the various centres where immigrants, asylum-seekers and 
refugees are detained. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Given the recent political legacy of racism and xenophobia, the Government needs to 
recognize the fight against racism, xenophobia and related discrimination as one of its first 
priorities and confirm at the highest level its determination to fight these phenomena.  The 
Government has the responsibility to ensure that this struggle also takes place at the 
regional and local levels.  It is particularly important to publicly and strongly express 
disapproval of and combat racist and xenophobic political platforms. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the National Plan of Action on the Follow-up to the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance.  However, he recommends that the plan:  be redefined to include a 
comprehensive programmatic strategy to address all aspects of racism in every sphere of 
life and including all groups concerned in compliance with the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action; be the result of a concerted effort by relevant actors, particularly 
civil society, the concerned communities and political parties; be formally endorsed by 
the Government as a thorough strategy to fight racism and discrimination; and be 
based on a comprehensive analysis of the Italian context with regard to racism and 
xenophobia. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of further improving the 
implementation of the existing legislation combating racism and discrimination.  The 
judiciary and law enforcement agencies require training in the existence and content of the 
law as well as adequate information on legal protection for the groups concerned. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Government should consider the establishment by law of an independent 
national institution for the promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with 
the Paris Principles and for combating all forms of discrimination in a holistic manner, 
including all grounds such as race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, age, disability, sexual 
orientation and any other status.  Pending the establishment of this institution, the 
Government should consider with urgency the need to increase the level of independence 
and the human as well as financial resources of the National Office for the Fight against 
Racial Discrimination. </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
 page 27 
 
70. <b>Given the increase in violence in sport, especially football, it is strongly recommended 
that Italy implement the FIFA guidelines with particular vigilance.  The Government 
should also undertake a review of the regulations of the various federations to harmonize 
them with the provisions of article 2 of LD 286/98 in order to eliminate discrimination 
against legally resident non-EU children in sports. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Government should continue to promote the adoption of the legislative reforms 
that have already been initiated, in particular the Law on Citizenship, the reform allowing 
migrants to denounce abuse and receive protection, as well as the restoration of more 
severe punishment for incitement to racial and religious hatred and related crimes.  
Regarding the citizenship law, it should consider eliminating the economic requirements 
for the naturalization and acquisition of citizenship and making the obtaining of citizenship 
by minors dependent on the legal and economic situation of their parents, which may be 
against the best interests of the child.  The Government should ensure that the draft 
citizenship law does not discriminate against socio-economically vulnerable migrants, 
refugees, Roma and Sinti by impeding their eligibility to apply for and obtain citizenship 
on economic grounds, and that it solves the problem of a lack of identification documents 
traditionally affecting the Roma community, hampering their acquisition of Italian 
citizenship and their recognition as citizens. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Government should adopt comprehensive legislation on the right to asylum, 
distinct from the one on immigration, ensuring that gender-related persecution is a ground 
for the grant of asylum.  The Government has the obligation to ensure that the 
implementation of the immigration legislation does not lead to a violation of the principle 
of non-refoulement and that no asylum-seeker is sent back to his or her country of origin 
while awaiting the outcome of appeals. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Government should consider ratifying the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and 
harmonize its national legislation accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Government should review and amend the Bossi-Fini Law on immigration to 
replace the security approach and the criminalization of migrants and guarantee the 
protection of the rights of migrants and their integration in society. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Government should further improve the conditions of the CPTAs and the 
reception and identification centres to ensure that health care as well as appropriate 
housing and living conditions are provided.  It is particularly important to improve the 
provision of legal information and counselling.  The Government should allow the free and 
permanent presence of relevant international organizations, in particular UNHCR and the 
International Organization for Migration, and the access of specialized humanitarian 
NGOs, particularly in the fields of health and legal aid, to improve the quality of the 
services currently provided. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Government should combat the exploitation and abuse of migrant workers, 
particularly in the agricultural sector, as well as their current segregation in the labour 
market.  It should ensure that there is appropriate legislation in place to protect women 
migrants working as caregivers and domestic workers. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.4 
page 28 
 
77. <b>The Government, in line with the Palermo Protocol, has the obligation to ensure that 
migrant women are not forced into prostitution because of their socio-economic 
vulnerability. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Government should ensure that there are sufficient resources at all levels of 
government, in particular locally, to assist and guarantee the rights of migrants, 
asylum-seekers and refugees as well as Roma and Sinti. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Italy should recognize the Roma and Sinti as national minorities, and protect and 
promote their language and culture.  The Government should adopt a comprehensive 
national policy towards these communities, in particular to address their poor housing 
conditions, lack of documents, high dropouts of their children and their difficulties in 
accessing employment.  Roma and Sinti should be among the priority beneficiary groups of 
social inclusion policies. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Government should conclude bilateral agreements (<i>intese</i>) with those Islamic 
denominational organizations that have applied and fulfilled the requirements in 
accordance with the law. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Government should adopt an ethical and cultural strategy guided by the 
promotion of mutual knowledge and interaction between the different communities.  The 
combat against racism, xenophobia and discrimination should be linked to the long-term 
construction of multiculturalism by two fundamental elements:  firstly, it should be 
recalled that Italy had traditionally been a country of migration and that Italian 
communities abroad have been successful in preserving their cultural identity and 
integrating in the countries of migration; secondly, owing to its history and geography, 
Italy has had profound human and cultural interactions with the Mediterranean countries.  
The interaction between the combat against racism, xenophobia and discrimination and 
the promotion of multiculturalism should lead to a process of constructing a new 
multicultural identity. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The long-term construction of an Italian multicultural identity should be reflected in 
Italian institutions and guide government policies and programmes, in particular in 
education, culture and information. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Government could consider launching, with the participation of all media, a 
process of reflection on the role and responsibility of the media to combat racism, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and to foster the adoption of a code of conduct in that 
regard.
