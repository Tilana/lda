“should,” “predicts,” “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative
of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and are subject
to substantial risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of performance. Future actions, events and
conditions and future results of operations may differ materially from those expressed in these
statements. In evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the information above as well
as the risks outlined in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances
after the date of this report except as required by law. All of our written and oral forward-looking
statements are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements
that may accompany such forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. GENERAL
Key Energy Services, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Key,” the “Company,” “we,”
“us,” “its,” and “our”) provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign national oil
companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. Our services include rig-based
and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion
services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services, and other ancillary oilfield services.
Additionally, certain of our rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major
oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States and have operations in Mexico
and Russia. In addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in
Canada.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”). The condensed December 31, 2015 balance sheet was prepared from audited
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
(the “2015 Form 10-K”). Certain information relating to our organization and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or
omitted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in our 2015 Form 10-K.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report include all normal
and recurring material adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods
presented herein. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other interim period, due to fluctuations in
demand for our services, timing of maintenance and other expenditures, and other factors.
We have evaluated events occurring after the balance sheet date included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and through the date on which the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
were issued, for possible disclosure of a subsequent event. In July and August of 2016, we identified
subsequent events that required disclosure. See “Note 17. Subsequent Events” for further discussion.
NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to develop
estimates and to make assumptions that affect our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. These estimates may also impact the nature and extent of our disclosure, if any, of our contingent
liabilities. Among other things, we use estimates to (i) analyze assets for possible impairment,
(ii) determine depreciable lives for our assets, (iii) assess future tax exposure and realization of deferred
tax assets, (iv) determine amounts to accrue for contingencies, (v) value tangible and intangible assets,
(vi) assess workers’ compensation, vehicular liability, self-insured risk accruals and other insurance
reserves, (vii) provide allowances for our uncollectible accounts receivable, (viii) value our asset
retirement obligations, and (ix) value our equity-based compensation. We review all significant
estimates on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to publication of
our financial statements. Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates relate to improved
information not previously available. Because of the limitations inherent in this process, our actual
results may differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the estimates used in the preparation
of these interim financial statements are reasonable.
There have been no material changes or developments in our evaluation of accounting estimates and
underlying assumptions or methodologies that we believe to be a “Critical Accounting Policy or
Estimate” as disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Developments
ASU 2016-09. In March 2016, the FASB Issued ASU 2016-09 Compensation—Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The updated guidance
changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees,
including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as
well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the
impact of its adoption on the consolidated financial statements.
8
Table of Contents
ASU 2016-02. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will
replace the existing lease guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency
and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities
on the balance sheet. Additional disclosure requirements include qualitative disclosures along with
specific quantitative disclosures with the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess
the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the
Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with
a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented. We are currently evaluating
the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2015-17. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). The objective of this ASU is to simplify the current guidance which requires
entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and non-current in a classified
balance sheet. The new guidance will require entities to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as
non-current in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, and may be applied either prospectively to
all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently
evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2014-09. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606). The objective of this ASU is to establish the principles to report useful information to users
of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with
customers. The core principle is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 must be adopted using either a full
retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. During a July 2015 meeting, the FASB
affirmed a proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for all entities by one year. As
a result, ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of
its adoption on the consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 3. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
In April 2015, we announced our decision to exit markets in which we participate outside of North
America. Our strategy is to sell or relocate the assets of the businesses operating in these markets.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the assets and related liabilities of our Russian business unit which is
included in our International reporting segment met the criteria for assets held for sale. We expect this
sale to occur by the end of 2016.
The following assets and related liabilities of our Russian business unit are classified as held for sale on

6.75% Senior Notes due 2021
We have outstanding $675.0 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The 2021
Notes are general unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing
and future secured indebtedness. The 2021 Notes are or will be jointly and severally guaranteed on a
senior unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the 2021
Notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2021 Notes mature on March 1, 2021.
The 2021 Notes are subject to redemption at any time and from time to time at our option, in whole or in
part, at the redemption prices below (expressed as percentages of the principal amount redeemed), plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below:

If we experience a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, we must give holders of the 2021
Notes the opportunity to sell to us their 2021 Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
We are subject to certain negative covenants under the Indenture. The Indenture limits our ability to,
among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity interests;
•pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem equity interests;
•make loans and investments;
•enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•sell, transfer or otherwise convey assets;
•create liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•enter into agreements restricting subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;
•designate future subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the applicable entities’ assets.
These covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, and contain cross-default
provisions relating to the covenants of our Facilities discussed below. Substantially all of the covenants
will terminate before the 2021 Notes mature if one of two specified ratings agencies assigns the 2021
Notes an investment grade rating in the future and no events of default exist under the Indenture. As of
June 30, 2016, the 2021 Notes were rated below investment grade. Any covenants that cease to apply
to us as a result of achieving an investment grade rating will not be restored, even if the investment
rating assigned to the 2021 Notes later falls below investment grade. We were in compliance with these
covenants as of June 30, 2016.

ABL Facility
On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “ABL Facility”), among
the Company and Key Energy Services, LLC, as the Borrowers (collectively, the “ABL Borrowers”),
certain subsidiaries of the ABL Borrowers named as guarantors therein, the financial institutions party
thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the “ABL Lenders”), Bank of America, N.A., as
Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the “ABL Administrative Agent”), and Bank of America, N.A. and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Collateral Agents for the Lenders. The ABL Facility
provides for aggregate initial commitments from the ABL Lenders of $100 million (the “Commitments”)
and matures on February 28, 2020.
The ABL Facility provides the ABL Borrowers with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Commitments and (ii) the sum of (a) 85% of the value of eligible
accounts receivable plus (b) 80% of the value of eligible unbilled accounts receivable, subject to a limit
equal to the greater of (x) $35 million and (y) 25% of the Commitments plus (c) certain cash and cash
equivalents deposited for the benefit of the ABL Lenders, subject to a limit of $15 million. The amount
that may be borrowed under the ABL Facility is subject to reduction for certain reserves provided for by
the ABL Facility. In addition, the percentages of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable
included in the calculation described above is subject to reduction to the extent of certain bad debt write-
downs and similar amounts provided in the ABL Facility.
Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at the ABL Borrowers’ option, at a per annum rate equal
to (i) LIBOR for 30, 60, 90, 180, or, with the consent of the ABL Lenders, 360 days, plus 4.5% or (ii) a
base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50%
or (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 3.5%. In addition, the ABL Facility provides for unused line fees
of 1.00% to 1.25% per year, depending on utilization, letter of credit fees and certain other fees.
The ABL Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries (the “ABL
Guarantors,” and together with the ABL Borrowers, the “ABL Loan Parties”). To secure their obligations
under the ABL Facility, each of the ABL Loan Parties has granted to the Administrative Agent a first-
priority security interest for the benefit of the ABL Lenders in its present and future accounts receivable,
inventory and related assets and proceeds of the foregoing (the “ABL Priority Collateral”). In addition, the
obligations of the ABL Loan Parties under the ABL Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the
Term Priority Collateral (as described below under “Term Loan Facility”).
The revolving loans under the ABL Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs.
The ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict
the ability of the ABL Loan Parties to take certain actions without the permission of the ABL Lenders or
as permitted under the ABL Facility including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of
investments, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The ABL Facility also contains a
requirement that the ABL Borrowers comply with a minimum liquidity covenant, an asset coverage ratio
and, during certain periods, a fixed charge coverage ratio.
Under the asset coverage ratio covenant, the ABL Borrowers must maintain an asset coverage ratio of at
least 1.5 to 1.0. The asset coverage ratio is generally defined as the ratio of (i) the sum of (a) the value of
the Term Priority Collateral plus (b) certain cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held for
the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders to (ii) the sum of (a) the amount outstanding under the Term Loan
Facility and, following repayment of the Term Loan Facility, the amount outstanding under the ABL
Facility, plus (b) the amount of any fine or settlement in respect of the FCPA Matter (as defined in the
ABL Facility) that is secured by a lien on the ABL Priority Collateral or the Term Priority Collateral (the
“Asset Coverage Ratio”).
Under the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, the ABL Borrowers must maintain a fixed charge
coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 during the period commencing on the day that availability under the
ABL Facility is less than the greater of $20 million and 20% of the Commitments and continuing until the
90th day following the day that availability under the ABL Facility is greater than the greater of $20
million and 20% of the Commitments. The fixed charge coverage ratio is generally defined as the ratio of
(i) EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to (ii) the sum of cash interest
expenses, scheduled principal payments on borrowed money and certain distributions. The ABL Facility
permits the ABL Borrowers, in calculating EBITDA, to add back certain amounts in respect of the
investigatory expenses associated with the FCPA Matter and amounts paid in settlement of the FCPA
Matter to the extent such amounts do not exceed net liquidity, defined as certain cash and cash
equivalents minus the principal amount of loans outstanding under the ABL Facility.
Under the minimum liquidity covenant (the “Minimum Liquidity Covenant”), the ABL Borrowers must not
permit Liquidity, defined as the sum of (i) availability under the ABL Facility plus (ii) certain unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents, to be less than $100.0 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter or
immediately after any cash payment of a settlement of, or fine in connection with, the FCPA Matter.
14
Table of Contents
The ABL Facility contains customary representations and warranties and conditions to borrowing,
including the absence of any default or event of default, the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of the ABL Loan Parties contained in the ABL Facility and the absence
of any event or circumstance that has or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect.
The ABL Facility contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which entitle the ABL Lenders
to accelerate the maturity of amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and exercise other customary
remedies including an event of default that is triggered if, immediately after any cash payment of a
settlement of the FCPA Matter (and after any cash or borrowings under the ABL Facility are used to fund
such payment), (i) the Company shall fail to be in compliance with the Minimum Liquidity Covenant or
(ii) if any loans under the ABL Facility are outstanding on the date of such cash payment, availability
under the ABL Facility is less than 33% of the borrowing base in effect on such date.
As of June 30, 2016, we have no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility and $38.8 million of
letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $27.3 million available subject to covenant
constraints under our ABL Facility.
Term Loan Facility
On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “Term Loan
Facility”), among the Company, as Borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company named as guarantors
therein, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the “Term Loan
Lenders”), Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Agent for the Lenders (the “Term Loan
Administrative Agent”), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as Sole Lead Arranger
and Sole Bookrunner.
On June 1, 2015, the Company and other parties thereto closed on the Term Loan Facility, the Company
borrowed $315 million (prior to giving effect to an upfront discount of 3% which resulted in net proceeds
to the Company, prior to expenses, of approximately $305.5 million), and the Company used a portion of
such proceeds to repay its prior credit facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for an incremental facility
which, subject to the agreement of one or more Term Loan Lenders or other institutional lenders
agreeing to provide the additional loans and the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, would
enable the Company to borrow additional amounts under the Term Loan Facility as long as the
aggregate outstanding amount of all borrowings thereunder does not exceed $400 million. The Term
Loan Facility will mature on June 1, 2020, although such maturity date may, at the Company’s request,
be extended by one or more of the Term Loan Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Facility.
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate
equal to (i) LIBOR for one, two, three, six, or, with the consent of the Term Loan Lenders, 12
months, plus 9.25% or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the
Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% and (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 8.25%.
The Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries (the
“Term Loan Guarantors,” and together with the Company, the “Term Loan Parties”). To secure their
obligations under the Term Loan Facility, each of the Term Loan Parties has granted to the Agent a first-
priority security interest for the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders in substantially all of each Term Loan
Party’s assets other than certain excluded assets and the ABL Priority Collateral (the “Term Priority
Collateral”). In addition, the obligations of the Term Loan Parties under the Term Loan Facility are
secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as described above under “ABL
Facility”).
The loans under the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid at the Company’s option, subject to the
payment of a prepayment premium in certain circumstances as provided in the Term Loan Facility. The
Company is required to make principal payments in the amount of $787,500 per quarter commencing
with the quarter ended September 30, 2015. In addition, pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, the
Company must offer to prepay term loans out of the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the Term Loan
Facility) of certain asset sales and, for each fiscal year beginning with the Company’s fiscal year ending
December 31, 2015, the Company must offer to prepay term loans in an aggregate principal amount
equal to 50% of the Company’s Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) for such fiscal
year. Within 30 days following any Change of Control (as defined in the Term Loan Facility), the
Company must offer to prepay all term loans (i) at a price of 101% of the amount thereof if, after giving
effect to such Change of Control, the Asset Coverage Ratio is at least 1.5 to 1.0 or (ii) at a price equal to
the greater of 101% of the amount thereof and the applicable prepayment premium provided for in the
Term Loan Facility if, after giving effect to such Change of Control, the Asset Coverage Ratio is less
than 1.5 to 1.0.
The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties and certain affirmative and
negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Term Loan Parties to take certain
actions without the permission of the Term Loan Lenders or as permitted under the Term Loan Facility
including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, the payment of
dividends and the sale of assets. The Term Loan Facility also contains financial covenants requiring
that the Company maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0 and that Liquidity (as defined
in
15
Table of Contents
the Term Loan Facility) must not be less than $100 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter or
immediately after any cash payment of a settlement of, or fine in connection with, the FCPA Matter.
The Term Loan Facility contains events of default, the occurrence of which entitle the Term Loan
Lenders to accelerate the maturity of amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and exercise
other customary remedies.
Covenant Compliance
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the 2021
Notes and under the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility (collectively, the “Facilities”), subject to the
matter described below.
In calculating the Asset Coverage Ratio under the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility, the value of
certain of the Term Priority Collateral used in calculating the Asset Coverage Ratio is determined
pursuant to an appraisal required to be obtained by the Company and provided to the Term Loan
Administrative Agent and the ABL Administrative Agent (collectively, the “Administrative Agents”) in
connection with the delivery to the Administrative Agents of the Company’s year-end and June 30
financial statements. In addition, the Term Loan Lenders are permitted to request an additional appraisal
once each fiscal year.
Based on the appraisal obtained by the Company and delivered to the Administrative Agents with our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the Asset
Coverage Ratio as of March 31, 2016. However, during the first quarter of 2016, certain of the Term
Loan Lenders requested a new appraisal from a different appraiser, and, based on that appraisal,
certain of the Term Loan Lenders have alleged that we were not in compliance with the Asset Coverage
Ratio as of March 31, 2016. Although the Company disagrees with the validity of the appraisal
commissioned by the Term Loan Lenders, and has reserved certain of its rights to contest such
appraisal, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement on May 11, 2016 (the “Forbearance Agreement”)
with certain of the Term Loan Lenders pursuant to which such lenders agreed that, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Forbearance Agreement, they would forbear from exercising remedies available to
them under the Term Loan Facility as a result of our alleged non-compliance with the Asset Coverage
Ratio under the Term Loan Facility. We also entered into a Limited Consent and Forbearance
Agreement on May 11, 2016 (the “Limited Consent”) with certain of the ABL Lenders pursuant to which
such lenders consented to the prepayment we made under the Term Loan Facility and agreed to a
substantially similar forbearance. Those forbearance agreements have been extended since they were
originally entered into and currently continue indefinitely until terminated by the lenders or noteholders
party thereto on not less than five business days’ notice to us. As consideration for the Term Loan
Lenders’ forbearance, we have prepaid $12.5 million in principal and accrued interest under the Term
Loan Facility.
The Forbearance Agreement and amendments and the Limited Consent and amendments are filed as
exhibits 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 10-Q and
reference is hereby made to such exhibits for their complete terms.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our ability to fund our operations, pay the principal and interest on our long-term debt and satisfy our
other obligations will depend upon our available liquidity and the amount of cash flows we are able to
generate from our operations. Cash used in operations was $22.4 million during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2015 and $67.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and, if
industry conditions do not improve, we are likely to continue to have significant negative cash flows from
operations during the remainder of 2016.
In light of the current conditions in our industry, our significant negative cash flow, our high level of
indebtedness and diminishing liquidity and the risk that we may be unable to remain in compliance with
the financial ratios in our Facilities, we continue to analyze a variety of transactions and alternatives
designed to reduce our debt and improve our liquidity, and we are in active discussions with our lenders
and noteholders regarding such transactions and alternatives. No assurance can be given, however,
that we will be able to implement any such transaction or alternative, if necessary, on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, and, even if we are successful in implementing a strategic transaction or
alternative, such transaction or alternative may not be successful in allowing us to meet our debt
obligations and improving our liquidity.
If we breach the covenants under our debt agreements or otherwise default under those agreements or if
we lack sufficient liquidity to satisfy our debt or other obligations, then, in the absence of a strategic
transaction or alternative, our creditors could potentially force us into bankruptcy or we could be forced
to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital structure, in which case we could
be forced to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried
on our financial statements. Even if we are able to implement a strategic transaction or alternative, such
transaction or alternative may impose onerous terms on us. Additionally, we have a significant amount
of secured indebtedness that is senior to our unsecured indebtedness and a significant amount of total
indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result,
implementation of a strategic transaction or alternative or a bankruptcy proceeding could result in a
limited recovery for unsecured noteholders, if any, and place equity holders at significant risk of losing
all of their interests in the Company.

Additionally, if we default under one or more of our debt agreements, the ABL Lenders will no longer be
obligated to extend credit to us. Finally, access to the liquidity provided by our ABL Facility is predicated
upon the absence of a default under the ABL Facility and our other debt agreements and on our ability to
satisfy the conditions to borrowing, which among other things require that the representations and
warranties under the ABL Facility, including representations and warranties related to our solvency and
the absence of a material adverse effect, remain true and correct and that we not be in violation of any of
the covenants in the ABL Facility.
The weighted average interest rates on the outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility and Term
Loan Facility for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 were as follows:

letters of credit were outstanding under the facility.

NOTE 9. INCOME TAXES
We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes in multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were 0.1% and
32.0%, respectively, and 0.2% and 33.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our effective tax rate varies due to the mix of pre-tax profit between the U.S. and
international taxing jurisdictions with varying statutory rates, the impact of permanent differences,
including goodwill impairment expense, and discrete tax adjustments, such as valuation allowances
against deferred tax assets and tax expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions. The
variance between our effective rate and the U.S. statutory rate reflects international profits and losses
subject to varying statutory rates, the impact of permanent items, including goodwill impairment expense
and expenses subject to statutorily imposed limitations such as meals and entertainment expenses, plus
the impact of state income taxes and discrete tax adjustments, such as valuation allowances against
deferred tax assets and tax expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions.    
The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it
is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 2015, due to
the history of losses in recent years and the current downturn in the oil and gas industry, management
determined it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a substantial portion of our net
deferred tax assets. No release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was made during the three

or six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $0.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, net of
federal tax benefit, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. We recognized a tax
expense of less than $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, related to these
items. We have substantially concluded all U.S. federal and state tax matters through the year ended
December 31, 2012.

Table of Contents
We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. We have
accrued a liability of less than $0.1 million for the payment of interest and penalties as of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. We believe that it is reasonably possible that $0.6 million of our currently
remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is individually insignificant, may be recognized in
the next twelve months as a result of a lapse of statute of limitations and settlement of ongoing audits.
NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
Various suits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business are pending against us. We conduct
business throughout the continental United States and may be subject to jury verdicts or arbitrations that
result in outcomes in favor of the plaintiffs. We are also exposed to various claims abroad. We
continually assess our contingent liabilities, including potential litigation liabilities, as well as the
adequacy of our accruals and our need for the disclosure of these items, if any. We establish a provision
for a contingent liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is
reasonably estimable. We have $1.5 million of other liabilities related to litigation that is deemed
probable and reasonably estimable as of June 30, 2016. We do not believe that the disposition of any of
these matters will result in an additional loss materially in excess of amounts that have been recorded.
Since January 2014, the Company has been cooperating with investigations by the Department of
Justice and the SEC into possible violations by the Company of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(“FCPA”). On April 28, 2016, the Company announced that the Department of Justice had closed its
investigation and that the Department had decided to decline prosecution of the Company. Effective
August 11, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC resolving the SEC’s
investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by the Company or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the
settlement, Key has agreed to pay disgorgement of $5.0 million and to cease and desist from committing
or causing any violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The
Company neither admitted nor denied any of the SEC’s allegations, except as to jurisdiction. The
Company accrued a liability for the SEC settlement in the first quarter in the amount of $5.0 million.
Between May of 2013 and June of 2014, five lawsuits (four class actions and one enforcement action)
were filed in California involving alleged violations of California’s wage and hour laws. In general, the
lawsuits allege failure to pay wages, including overtime and minimum wages, failure to pay final wages
upon employment terminations in a timely manner, failure to reimburse reasonable and necessary
business expenses, failure to provide wage statements consistent with California law, and violations of
the California meal and break period laws, among other claims. Two of the five cases have been
consolidated in United States District Court for the Central District of California. On December 22, 2015,
that court issued an order granting in part and denying in part a class certification motion. The court
initially certified a class of hourly paid, non-exempt oilfield employees who allege they did not receive
reimbursement for all business expenses and allege they did not receive all rest breaks required by
California law. On July 6, 2016, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, and certified
additional claims alleging that the wage statements were inaccurate and the overtime was improperly
calculated. The court did not determine whether Key is liable to any of the class members. The plaintiff
in the third case must file the motion for class certification by September 30, 2016, and that motion is
scheduled to be heard on February 6, 2017. The fourth case is waiting for a decision regarding whether
it will move forward in California state court or in federal court. The fifth case was dismissed on July 19,
2016. We have investigated the claims in the four remaining lawsuits, and intend to vigorously defend
them.  Because these cases are at an early stage, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of
loss.  
In August 2014, two class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas,
Houston Division, individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated against the Company
and certain officers of the Company, alleging violations of federal securities laws, specifically, violations
of Section 10(b) thereunder, and Rule 10(b)-5, thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Those lawsuits were styled as follows: Sean Cady, Individually and on Behalf of All Other
Persons Similarly Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall Dodson, No.
4:14-cv-2368, filed on August 15, 2014; and Ian W. Davidson, Individually and on Behalf of All Other
Persons Similarly Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall Dodson, No.
4.14-cv-2403, filed on August 21, 2014. On December 11, 2014, the Court entered an order that
consolidated the two lawsuits into one action, along with any future filed tag-along actions brought on
behalf of purchasers of Key Energy Services, Inc. common stock. The order also appointed Inter-Local
Pension Fund as the lead plaintiff in the class action and approved the law firm of Spector Roseman
Kodroff & Willis, P.C. as lead counsel for the consolidated class and Kendall Law Group, LLP, as local
counsel for the consolidated class. The lead plaintiff filed the consolidated amended complaint on
February 13, 2015. Among other changes, the consolidated amended complaint added Taylor M.
Whichard III and Newton W. Wilson III as defendants, and sought to represent a class of purchasers of
the Company’s stock between September 4, 2012 and July 17, 2014. Defendants Key Energy Services,
Inc., Richard J. Alario, J. Marshall Dodson and Newton W. Wilson III filed a Motion to Dismiss on April
14, 2015. Defendant Taylor M. Whichard III filed a Joinder in Motion and Motion to Dismiss on the same
date. Lead plaintiff filed an
18
Table of Contents
opposition to that motion, and all defendants filed reply briefs in support of the motion. On April 1, 2016,
the Court issued its Opinion and Order granting the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. The Court allowed
the lead plaintiff 20 days to file another amended complaint or to inform the Court that it no longer
wishes to proceed with the suit. On April 20, 2016, the lead plaintiff notified the Court that it did not
intend to amend its complaint. On April 26, 2016, the Court entered a final judgment dismissing the
case. The deadline for the lead plaintiff to appeal the dismissal expired on May 26, 2016. Accordingly,
there has not been any loss associated with this case.
In addition, in a letter dated September 4, 2014, a purported shareholder of the Company demanded that
the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) commence an independent internal investigation into
and legal proceedings against each member of the Board, a former member of the Board and certain
officers of the Company for alleged violations of Maryland and/or federal law. The letter alleges that the
Board and senior officers breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, including the duty of loyalty
and due care, by (i) improperly accounting for goodwill, (ii) causing the Company to potentially violate
the FCPA, resulting in an investigation by the SEC, (iii) causing the Company to engage in improper
conduct related to the Company’s Russia operations; and (iv) making false statements regarding, and
failing to properly account for, certain contracts with Pemex. As described in the letter, the purported
shareholder believes that the legal proceedings should seek recovery of damages in an unspecified
amount allegedly sustained by the Company. The Board referred the demand letter to a special
committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”).  
In April 2016, the Special Committee decided to recommend to the Board that the actions stated in the
demand letter, including the commencement of litigation asserting the claims stated in the demand letter,
would not serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and that the demand should be
refused. On May 12, 2016, the Special Committee reported its recommendations to the independent
members of the board, who voted unanimously to ratify, adopt and approve the recommendations of the
Special Committee and directed counsel to prepare a response. On August 10, 2016, the Board
approved the response and the purported shareholder was notified of this determination on August 12,
2016. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
In March 2015, two collective action lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi
Division, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, alleging violations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938 (“FLSA”). We agreed to conditional certification in the first lawsuit and notice of
the case issued to 56 putative class members.  Only 11 of the eligible class members filed a notice of
consent to join the lawsuit by the opt-in deadline. This is an opt-in rate of just below 20%. The first
lawsuit is currently set for trial on December 12, 2016. We also agreed to conditional certification in the
second lawsuit and notice of the case issued to 14 putative class members. Nine putative class
members, including the named plaintiff, have filed a notice of consent to join the lawsuit and the
deadline to join expired on April 4, 2016. There is no trial date set for the second lawsuit. At this time, we
cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss for either case.
In May 2015, a class and collective action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, alleging violations of the FLSA and
the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act. We agreed to conditional certification of a putative class and
notice issued to 174 putative class members. Only 27 of the eligible class members filed a notice of
consent to join the lawsuit by the opt-in deadline. This is an opt-in rate of just above 15%. There is no
trial date set for this lawsuit. At this time, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss for this
case.
In November 2015, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney filed a criminal complaint against two
former employees and Key, specifically alleging three counts of violations of California Labor Code
section 6425(a) against Key. The complaint seeks unspecified penalties against Key related to an
October 12, 2013 accident which resulted in the death of one Key employee at a drilling site near Santa
Maria, California. An arraignment was held on February 10, 2016, where Key and its former employees
pleaded not guilty to all charges. Because the matter is in early stages, we cannot predict the outcome at
this time. Accordingly, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss.
On or about November 23, 2015, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) filed a notice in the
county of Burleigh County, ND alleging statutory violations by Key Energy Services, LLC, as operator of
two salt water disposal wells in the state of North Dakota. The NDIC has pled for approximately
$888,000 in fines and costs. The Company is currently in discussions with the NDIC and is not able to
estimate any possible loss or range of loss at this time.

Self-Insurance Reserves
We maintain reserves for workers’ compensation and vehicle liability on our balance sheet based on our
judgment and estimates using an actuarial method based on claims incurred. We estimate general
liability claims on a case-by-case basis. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation,
vehicle liability and general liability claims. These insurance policies carry self-insured retention limits
or deductibles on a per occurrence basis. The retention limits or deductibles are accounted for in our
accrual process for all workers’ compensation, vehicular liability and general liability claims. As of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have recorded $52.1 million and $56.4 million, respectively,
of self-insurance reserves related to workers’ compensation, vehicular liabilities and general liability
claims. Partially offsetting these liabilities, we had $16.9 million and $17.3 million of insurance
receivables as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We believe that the liabilities we
have recorded are appropriate based on the known facts and circumstances and do not expect further
losses materially in excess of the amounts already accrued for existing claims.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities
2015
June 30,
 2016
For environmental reserve matters, including remediation efforts for current locations and those relating
to previously disposed properties, we record liabilities when our remediation efforts are probable and
the costs to conduct such remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, we have recorded $4.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for our environmental
remediation liabilities. We believe that the liabilities we have recorded are appropriate based on the
known facts and circumstances and do not expect further losses materially in excess of the amounts
already accrued.
NOTE 11. LOSS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is determined by dividing net loss attributable to Key by the weighted average
number of common shares actually outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is
based on the increased number of shares that would be outstanding assuming conversion of potentially
dilutive outstanding securities using the treasury stock and “as if converted” methods.
The components of our loss per share are as follows:

Basic and diluted loss per share
Stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are included in the computation of diluted loss per
share using the treasury stock method. Restricted stock awards are legally considered issued and
outstanding when granted and are included in basic weighted average shares outstanding.
The company has issued potentially dilutive instruments such as stock options and SARs. However, the
company did not include these instruments in its calculation of diluted loss per share during the periods
presented, because to include them would be anti-dilutive. The following shows potentially dilutive
instruments:

NOTE 12. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
We recognized employee share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and $2.1 million during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognized employee share-based
compensation expense of $2.9 million and $6.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. We did not capitalize any share-based compensation during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
The unrecognized compensation cost related to our unvested restricted stock as of June 30, 2016 is
estimated to be $3.5 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4
years. All outstanding stock options are vested and there are no unrecognized cost related to our stock
options as of June 30, 2016.
In January 2015, we issued 2.1 million performance units to our executive officers under the 2014 Plan
with such material terms as set forth in the 2014 PU Award Agreement. In February 2015, we issued 0.4
million performance units to certain other employees under the 2015 PU Plan. The performance units
are measured based on one three-year performance period from January 1, 2015 to December 31,
2017. The number of performance units that may be earned by a participant is determined at the end of
the performance period based on the relative placement of Key’s total stockholder return for that period
within the peer group, as follows:

If any performance units vest for a given performance period, the award holder will be paid a cash
amount equal to the vested percentage of the performance units multiplied by the closing stock price of
our common stock on the last trading day of the performance period. We account for the performance
units as a liability-type award as they are settled in cash. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of
outstanding performance units was $0.1 million, and is being accreted to compensation expense over
the vesting terms of the awards. As of June 30, 2016, the unrecognized compensation cost related to our
unvested performance units is estimated to be less than $0.1 million and is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.
NOTE 13. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
Board of Director Relationships
A member of our board of directors is the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief
Administrative Officer of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”), which is one of our customers.
Sales to Anadarko were approximately $1.3 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.1 million and $7.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Receivables outstanding from Anadarko were approximately
$0.4 million and $0.9 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Transactions
with Anadarko for our services are made on terms consistent with other customers.

NOTE 15. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Our reportable business segments are U.S. Rig Services, Fluid Management Services, Coiled Tubing
Services, Fishing and Rental Services and International. We also have a “Functional Support” segment
associated with overhead and other costs in support of our reportable segments. Our U.S. Rig Services,
Fluid Management Services, Coiled Tubing Services, Fishing and Rental Services operate
geographically within the United States. The International reportable segment includes our operations in
Mexico and Russia and our Canadian subsidiary. During the second half of 2015, we ceased operations
in Colombia, Ecuador and the Middle East. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on
gross margin measures. All inter-segment sales pricing is based on current market conditions.
U.S. Rig Services
Our U.S. Rig Services include the completion of newly drilled wells, workover and recompletion of
existing oil and natural gas wells, well maintenance, and the plugging and abandonment of wells at the
end of their useful lives. We also provide specialty drilling services to oil and natural gas producers with
certain of our larger rigs that are capable of providing conventional and horizontal drilling services. Our
rigs encompass various sizes and capabilities, allowing us to service all types of wells with depths up to
20,000 feet. Many of our rigs are outfitted with our proprietary KeyView® technology, which captures
and reports well site operating data and provides safety control systems. We believe that this technology
allows our customers and our crews to better monitor well site operations, improves efficiency and
safety, and adds value to the services that we offer.
The completion and recompletion services provided by our rigs prepare wells for production, whether
newly drilled, or recently extended through a workover operation. The completion process may involve
selectively perforating the well casing to access production zones, stimulating and testing these zones,
and installing tubular and downhole equipment. We typically provide a well service rig and may also
provide other equipment to assist in the completion process. Completion services vary by well and our
work may take a few days to several weeks to perform, depending on the nature of the completion.
The workover services that we provide are designed to enhance the production of existing wells and
generally are more complex and time consuming than normal maintenance services. Workover services
can include deepening or extending wellbores into new formations by drilling horizontal or lateral
wellbores, sealing off depleted production zones and accessing previously bypassed production zones,
converting former production wells into injection wells for enhanced recovery operations and conducting
major subsurface repairs due to equipment failures. Workover services may last from a few days to
several weeks, depending on the complexity of the workover.
Maintenance services provided with our rig fleet are generally required throughout the life cycle of an oil
or natural gas well. Examples of these maintenance services include routine mechanical repairs to the
pumps, tubing and other equipment, removing debris and formation material from wellbores, and pulling
rods and other downhole equipment from wellbores to identify and resolve production problems.
Maintenance services are generally less complicated than completion and workover related services
and require less time to perform.
22
Table of Contents
Our rig fleet is also used in the process of permanently shutting-in oil or natural gas wells that are at the
end of their productive lives. These plugging and abandonment services generally require auxiliary
equipment in addition to a well servicing rig. The demand for plugging and abandonment services is not
significantly impacted by the demand for oil and natural gas because well operators are required by
state regulations to plug wells that are no longer productive.
Fluid Management Services
We provide transportation and well-site storage services for various fluids utilized in connection with
drilling, completions, workover and maintenance activities. We also provide disposal services for fluids
produced subsequent to well completion.  These fluids are removed from the well site and transported
for disposal in saltwater disposal wells owned by us or a third party. In addition, we operate a fleet of hot
oilers capable of pumping heated fluids used to clear soluble restrictions in a wellbore. Demand and
pricing for these services generally correspond to demand for our well service rigs.
Coiled Tubing Services
Coiled Tubing Services involve the use of a continuous metal pipe spooled onto a large reel which is
then deployed into oil and natural gas wells to perform various applications, such as wellbore clean-
outs, nitrogen jet lifts, through-tubing fishing, and formation stimulations utilizing acid and chemical
treatments. Coiled tubing is also used for a number of horizontal well applications such as milling
temporary isolation plugs that separate frac zones, and various other pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing
well preparation services.
Fishing and Rental Services
We offer a full line of fishing services and rental equipment designed for use in providing both onshore
and offshore drilling and workover services. Fishing services involve recovering lost or stuck equipment
in the wellbore utilizing a broad array of “fishing tools.” Our rental tool inventory consists of drill pipe,
tubulars, handling tools (including our patented Hydra-Walk® pipe-handling units and services),
pressure-control equipment, pumps, power swivels, reversing units, foam air units, frac stack equipment
used to support hydraulic fracturing operations and the associated flowback of frac fluids, proppants, oil
and natural gas. We also provide well testing services.
Demand for our fishing and rental services is closely related to capital spending by oil and natural gas
producers, which is generally a function of oil and natural gas prices.
International
Our International segment includes operations in Mexico and Russia. During the second half of 2015,
we ceased operations in Colombia, Ecuador and the Middle East. We provide rig-based services such
as the maintenance, workover, recompletion of existing oil wells, completion of newly-drilled wells and
plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives in each of our international markets.
In addition, in Mexico we provide drilling, coiled tubing, wireline and project management and
consulting services. Our work in Mexico also requires us to provide third-party services, which vary in
scope by project. We also have a technology development and control systems business based in
Canada which is focused on the development of hardware and software related to oilfield service
equipment controls, data acquisition and digital information flow.
In April 2015, we announced our decision to exit markets in which we participate outside of North
America. Our strategy is to sell or relocate the assets of the businesses operating in these markets. As of
December 31, 2015, we sold our subsidiary in Bahrain and certain assets in Oman, Ecuador and
Colombia and are no longer operating in these markets. We are currently in discussions to sell our
subsidiary in Russia.
Functional Support
Our Functional Support segment includes unallocated overhead costs associated with administrative
support for our U.S. and International reporting segments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
NOTE 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Our common stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “KEG”
throughout the first and second quarter of this year. On July 27, 2016, the trading of our common stock
on the NYSE was suspended due to abnormally low price levels. The NYSE stated that it will apply to
the SEC to delist our common stock upon completion of all applicable procedures. Our common stock is
now being traded on the OTC Pink under the symbol “KEGX.”
Effective August 11, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC resolving the
SEC’s investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by the Company or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to
the settlement, Key has agreed to pay disgorgement of $5.0 million and to cease and desist from
committing or causing any violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
FCPA. The Company neither admitted nor denied any of the SEC’s allegations, except as to jurisdiction.
See “Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies” for further discussion.
ITEM
2.
OVERVIEW    
Key Energy Services, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Key,” the “Company,” “we,”
“us,” “its,” and “our”) provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign national oil
companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. Our services include rig-based
and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion
services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services, and other ancillary oilfield services.
Additionally, certain rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major oil and
natural gas producing regions of the continental United States and have operations in Mexico and
Russia. In addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in Canada.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, included elsewhere herein, and the audited consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in our 2015 Form 10-K and Part 1A. Risk Factors of our 2015 Form 10-K.
We operate in five business segments; U.S. Rig Services, Fluid Management Services, Coiled Tubing
Services, Fishing and Rental Services and International. We also have a “Functional Support” segment
associated with managing our U.S. and International business segments. See “Note 15. Segment
Information” in “Item 1. Financial Statements” of Part I of this report for a summary of our business
segments.
KEY COMMON STOCK
Our common stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “KEG”
throughout the first and second quarter of this year. On July 27, 2016, the trading of our common stock
on the NYSE was suspended due to abnormally low price levels. The NYSE stated that it will apply to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to delist our common stock upon completion of all
applicable procedures. Our common stock is now being traded on the OTC Pink under the symbol
“KEGX.”
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is often used as
an indicator of overall Exploration and Production (“E&P”) company spending and broader oilfield
activity. In assessing overall activity in the U.S. onshore oilfield service industry in which we operate, we
believe that the Baker Hughes U.S. land drilling rig count is the best available barometer of E&P
companies’ capital spending and resulting activity levels. Historically, our activity levels have been
highly correlated to U.S. onshore capital spending by our E&P company customers as a group.

Internally, we measure activity levels for our well servicing operations primarily through our rig and
trucking hours. Generally, as capital spending by E&P companies increases, demand for our services
also rises, resulting in increased rig and trucking services and more hours worked. Conversely, when
activity levels decline due to lower spending by E&P companies, we generally provide fewer rig and
trucking services, which results in lower hours worked.
In the U.S., our rig activity occurs primarily on weekdays during daylight hours. Accordingly, we track
U.S. rig activity on a “per U.S. working day” basis. Key’s U.S. working days per quarter, which exclude
national holidays, are indicated in the table below. Our international rig activity and domestic trucking
activity tend to occur on a 24/7 basis. Accordingly, we track our international rig activity and our
domestic trucking activity on a “per calendar day” basis. The following table presents our quarterly rig
and trucking hours from 2015 through the second quarter of 2016:

MARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK
Our core businesses depend on our customers’ willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop
and explore for oil and natural gas. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as oil
and natural gas prices, the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide
economic conditions, and political instability in oil producing countries. Oil and natural gas prices began
a rapid and substantial decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Depressed commodity price conditions
persisted and worsened during 2015 and that trend has continued into 2016. As a result, the rig count
and demand for our products and services has declined substantially, and the prices we are able to
charge our customers for our products and services have also declined substantially. While we have
sought to anticipate activity declines and have undertaken to reshape our organizational and cost
structure to mitigate the negative impact of these declines, we have continued to experience negative
operating results and cash flows from operations. Although oil prices have improved more recently, we
have not experienced an uptick in activity levels commensurate with that of oil prices, and the timing
associated with a material activity improvement is difficult to predict.

Consolidated Results of Operations — Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenues
Our revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $102.5 million, or 51.9%, to $95.0
million from $197.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, due to lower spending from our
customers as a result of lower oil prices. These market conditions resulted in reduced customer activity
and a reduction in the price received for our services. Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result
of reduced customer activity in Mexico and the exit of operations in the Middle East and South America.
See “Segment Operating Results — Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015” below for a more
detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.
Direct Operating Expenses
Our direct operating expenses decreased $69.4 million, to $89.4 million (94.1% of revenues), for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $158.8 million (80.4% of revenues) for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in employee
compensation costs, fuel expense and repair and maintenance expense as we sought to reduce our
cost structure and as a result of lower activity levels.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.0 million, or 21.9%, to $35.9 million during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $45.9 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets and decreases in
capital expenditures, plus lower amortization expense due to the impairment of certain intangible assets.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased $9.8 million, to $40.9 million (43.1% of revenues), for
the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $50.7 million (25.7% of revenues) for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee compensation costs as
a result of reduced staffing levels.
Impairment Expense
No impairments were recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2016. During the three months
ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a $21.4 million impairment of fixed assets in our Oman business unit
which is included in our International reporting segment.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense increased $4.3 million, or 25.2%, to $21.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $17.1 million for the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily related to
increased borrowings and higher interest rate under the new Term Loan Facility for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.

Other (Income) Loss, Net
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we recognized other loss, net, of $0.4 million, compared to
other income, net, of $0.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Our foreign exchange loss relates
to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign businesses and fluctuations in exchange rates
between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.

Income Tax Benefit
We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $92.9 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to an income tax benefit of $30.7 million on a pre-tax loss of $96.1
million in the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective tax rate was 0.1% for the three months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to 32.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective tax
rates for such periods differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a number of factors, including the
mix of profit and loss between domestic and international taxing jurisdictions and the impact of
permanent items, including goodwill impairment expense and expenses subject to statutorily imposed
limitations such as meals and entertainment expenses, that affect book income but do not affect taxable
income and discrete tax adjustments, such as valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax
expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions.

six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $93.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment of certain fixed assets and decreases in capital

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased $31.2 million, to $87.1 million (42.3% of revenues), for
the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $118.4 million (25.4% of revenues) for the six months

No impairments were recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016. During the six months
ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a $21.4 million impairment of fixed assets in our Oman business unit
which is included in our International reporting segment and a $21.7 million impairment of goodwill in
our Coiled Tubing Services segment related to the finalization of our 2014 goodwill impairment testing.

Interest expense increased $12.5 million, or 41.3%, to $42.9 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $30.4 million for the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily related to

Income Tax Benefit
We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.4 million on a pre-tax loss of $174.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to an income tax benefit of $62.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $187.2
million for the same period in 2015. Our effective tax rate was 0.2% for the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to 33.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Due to the history of losses in recent
years and the current downturn in the oil and gas industry, the company did not provide a tax benefit of
year to date losses for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Our effective tax rates for such periods differ
from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a number of factors, including the mix of profit and loss
between domestic and international taxing jurisdictions and the impact of permanent items, including
goodwill impairment expense and expenses subject to statutorily imposed limitations such as meals and
entertainment expenses, that affect book income but do not affect taxable income and discrete tax
adjustments, such as valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax expense or benefit
recognized for uncertain tax positions.

the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $76.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
These expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in employee compensation costs and
equipment expense, primarily due to lower activity and no impairment expense compared to $21.4
million in 2015.
Functional Support
Operating expenses for Functional Support, which represent expenses associated with managing our
U.S. and International reporting segments, decreased $21.0 million, or 24.8%, to $63.9 million (31.0% of
consolidated revenues) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $84.9 million (18.2% of
consolidated revenues) for the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower employee
compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels and a decrease in legal expense related to the FCPA
investigation.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Current Financial Condition and Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $103.5 million compared to $204.4 million as
of December 31, 2015. Our working capital was $147.7 million as of June 30, 2016, compared to $265.9
million as of December 31, 2015. Our working capital decreased from the prior year end primarily as a
result of a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other current assets partially
offset by an increase in restricted cash and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities.
Our cash balance declined by $100.8 million during the first half of 2016 primarily as a result of our
making interest payments on our outstanding debt instruments totaling $40.4 million, moving
approximately $18.6 million to restricted cash in order to maintain the borrowing base under our ABL
Facility and repaying $13.9 million of long-term debt. As of June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings
outstanding and $38.8 million in committed letters of credit outstanding under our ABL Facility with
borrowing capacity of $27.3 million available subject to covenant constraints under that facility.

Cash used in operating activities was $67.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
cash used in operating activities of $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Cash used by
operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily related to net loss adjusted for
noncash items. Cash used by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily
related to decrease in deferred tax liabilities partially offset by net loss adjusted for noncash items.
Cash provided by investing activities was $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to cash used in investing activities of $22.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Cash inflows during these periods consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of fixed assets. Cash
outflows during these periods consisted primarily of capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures
primarily relate to maintenance of our equipment.
Cash used in financing activities was $35.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
cash provided by financing activities of $221.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Overall
financing cash outflows for 2016 primarily relate to the increase in restricted cash and repayment of
long-term debt. Overall financing cash inflows for 2015 primarily relate to proceeds from long-term debt
partially offset by net repayment of our prior revolving credit facility.
Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources
We expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be from cash on hand, internally generated cash
flows from operations and availability under our ABL Facility. We had negative cash from operating
activities of $22.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and $67.4 million during
the six months ended June 30, 2016, and, if industry conditions do not improve, we expect to continue to
experience negative cash from operations for the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents
As of June 30, 2016, our total outstanding debt was $953.6 million. We have no significant maturities of
debt until 2020. Interest to be paid for the remainder of 2016 related to our 2021 Notes is approximately
$11 million and is due on September 1, 2016. Mandatory principal payments for the remainder of 2016
related to our Term Loan Facility, assuming we make no optional principal payments and without giving
effect to the prepayments described below under “-Covenant Compliance,”, is approximately $1.6
thousand. Interest on our Term Loan Facility is due each quarter and, assuming we make no optional
principal payments on the Term Loan Facility, quarterly interest payments are expected to be
approximately $8 million.
At June 30, 2016, our annual debt maturities for our 2021 Notes and Term Loan Facility were as follows:

Covenant Compliance    
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the 2021
Notes and under the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility (collectively, the “Facilities”), subject to the
matter described below.
In calculating the Asset Coverage Ratio under the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility, the value of
certain of the Term Priority Collateral used in calculating the Asset Coverage Ratio is determined
pursuant to an appraisal required to be obtained by the Company and provided to the Term Loan
Administrative Agent and the ABL Administrative Agent (collectively, the “Administrative Agents”) in
connection with the delivery to the Administrative Agents of the Company’s year-end and June 30
financial statements. In addition, the Term Loan Lenders are permitted to request an additional appraisal
once each fiscal year.
Based on the appraisal obtained by the Company and delivered to the Administrative Agents with our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the Asset
Coverage Ratio as of March 31, 2016. However, during the first quarter of 2016, certain of the Term
Loan Lenders requested a new appraisal from a different appraiser, and, based on that appraisal,
certain of the Term Loan Lenders have alleged that we were not in compliance with the Asset Coverage
Ratio as of March 31, 2016. Although the Company disagrees with the validity of the appraisal
commissioned by the Term Loan Lenders, and has reserved certain of its rights to contest such
appraisal, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement on May 11, 2016 (the “Forbearance Agreement”)
with certain of the Term Loan Lenders pursuant to which such lenders agreed that, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Forbearance Agreement, they would forbear from exercising remedies available to
them under the Term Loan Facility as a result of our alleged non-compliance with the Asset Coverage
Ratio under the Term Loan Facility. We also entered into a Limited Consent and Forbearance
Agreement on May 11, 2016 (the “Limited Consent”) with certain of the ABL Lenders pursuant to which
such lenders consented to the prepayment we made under the Term Loan Facility and agreed to a
substantially similar forbearance. Those forbearance agreements have been extended since they were
originally entered into and currently continue indefinitely until terminated by the lenders or noteholders
party thereto on not less than five business days’ notice to us. As consideration for the Term Loan
Lenders’ forbearance, we have prepaid $12.5 million in principal and accrued interest under the Term
Loan Facility.
The Forbearance Agreement and amendments and the Limited Consent and amendments are filed as
exhibits 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 10-Q and
reference is hereby made to such exhibits for their complete terms.
For more information, please read “-Liquidity Outlook” below.
6.75% Senior Notes due 2021
We have outstanding $675.0 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The 2021
Notes are general unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing
and future secured indebtedness. The 2021 Notes are or will be jointly and severally guaranteed on a
senior unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the 2021
Notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2021 Notes mature on March 1, 2021.
40
Table of Contents
The 2021 Notes are subject to redemption at any time and from time to time at our option, in whole or in
part, at the redemption prices below (expressed as percentages of the principal amount redeemed), plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below:

If we experience a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, we must give holders of the 2021
Notes the opportunity to sell to us their 2021 Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
We are subject to certain negative covenants under the Indenture. The Indenture limits our ability to,
among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity interests;
•pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem equity interests;
•make loans and investments;
•enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•sell, transfer or otherwise convey assets;
•create liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•enter into agreements restricting subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;
•designate future subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the applicable entities’ assets.
These covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, and contain cross-default
provisions relating to the covenants of our Facilities discussed below. Substantially all of the covenants
will terminate before the 2021 Notes mature if one of two specified ratings agencies assigns the 2021
Notes an investment grade rating in the future and no events of default exist under the Indenture. As of
June 30, 2016, the 2021 Notes were rated below investment grade. Any covenants that cease to apply
to us as a result of achieving an investment grade rating will not be restored, even if the investment
rating assigned to the 2021 Notes later falls below investment grade. We were in compliance with these
covenants as of June 30, 2016.
ABL Facility
On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “ABL Facility”), among
the Company and Key Energy Services, LLC, as the Borrowers (collectively, the “ABL Borrowers”),
certain subsidiaries of the ABL Borrowers named as guarantors therein, the financial institutions party
thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the “ABL Lenders”), Bank of America, N.A., as
Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the “ABL Administrative Agent”), and Bank of America, N.A. and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Collateral Agents for the Lenders. The ABL Facility
provides for aggregate initial commitments from the ABL Lenders of $100 million (the “Commitments”)
and matures on February 28, 2020.
The ABL Facility provides the ABL Borrowers with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Commitments and (ii) the sum of (a) 85% of the value of eligible
accounts receivable plus (b) 80% of the value of eligible unbilled accounts receivable, subject to a limit
equal to the greater of (x) $35 million and (y) 25% of the Commitments plus (c) certain cash and cash
equivalents deposited for the benefit of the ABL Lenders, subject to a limit of $15 million. The amount
that may be borrowed under the ABL Facility is subject to reduction for certain reserves provided for by
the ABL Facility. In addition, the percentages of accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable
included in the calculation described above is subject to reduction to the extent of certain bad debt write-
downs and similar amounts provided in the ABL Facility.
Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at the ABL Borrowers’ option, at a per annum rate equal
to (i) LIBOR for 30, 60, 90, 180, or, with the consent of the ABL Lenders, 360 days, plus 4.5% or (ii) a
base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50%
or (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 3.5%. In addition, the ABL Facility provides for unused line fees
of 1.00% to 1.25% per year, depending on utilization, letter of credit fees and certain other fees.
The ABL Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries (the “ABL
Guarantors,” and together with the ABL Borrowers, the “ABL Loan Parties”). To secure their obligations
under the ABL Facility, each of the
41
Table of Contents
ABL Loan Parties has granted to the Administrative Agent a first-priority security interest for the benefit of
the ABL Lenders in its present and future accounts receivable, inventory and related assets and
proceeds of the foregoing (the “ABL Priority Collateral”). In addition, the obligations of the ABL Loan
Parties under the ABL Facility are secured by second-priority liens on the Term Priority Collateral (as
described below under “Term Loan Facility”).
The revolving loans under the ABL Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty, subject to breakage or similar costs.
The ABL Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict
the ability of the ABL Loan Parties to take certain actions without the permission of the ABL Lenders or
as permitted under the ABL Facility including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of
investments, the payment of dividends and the sale of assets. The ABL Facility also contains a
requirement that the ABL Borrowers comply with a minimum liquidity covenant, an asset coverage ratio
and, during certain periods, a fixed charge coverage ratio.
Under the asset coverage ratio covenant, the ABL Borrowers must maintain an asset coverage ratio of at
least 1.5 to 1.0. The asset coverage ratio is generally defined as the ratio of (i) the sum of (a) the value of
the Term Priority Collateral plus (b) certain cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million held for
the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders to (ii) the sum of (a) the amount outstanding under the Term Loan
Facility and, following repayment of the Term Loan Facility, the amount outstanding under the ABL
Facility, plus (b) the amount of any fine or settlement in respect of the FCPA Matter (as defined in the
ABL Facility) that is secured by a lien on the ABL Priority Collateral or the Term Priority Collateral (the
“Asset Coverage Ratio”).
Under the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, the ABL Borrowers must maintain a fixed charge
coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 during the period commencing on the day that availability under the
ABL Facility is less than the greater of $20 million and 20% of the Commitments and continuing until the
90th day following the day that availability under the ABL Facility is greater than the greater of $20
million and 20% of the Commitments. The fixed charge coverage ratio is generally defined as the ratio of
(i) EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to (ii) the sum of cash interest
expenses, scheduled principal payments on borrowed money and certain distributions. The ABL Facility
permits the ABL Borrowers, in calculating EBITDA, to add back certain amounts in respect of the
investigatory expenses associated with the FCPA Matter and amounts paid in settlement of the FCPA
Matter to the extent such amounts do not exceed net liquidity, defined as certain cash and cash
equivalents minus the principal amount of loans outstanding under the ABL Facility.
Under the minimum liquidity covenant (the “Minimum Liquidity Covenant”), the ABL Borrowers must not
permit Liquidity, defined as the sum of (i) availability under the ABL Facility plus (ii) certain unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents, to be less than $100.0 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter or
immediately after any cash payment of a settlement of, or fine in connection with, the FCPA Matter.
The ABL Facility contains customary representations and warranties and conditions to borrowing,
including the absence of any default or event of default, the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of the ABL Loan Parties contained in the ABL Facility and the absence
of any event or circumstance that has or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect.
The ABL Facility contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which entitle the ABL Lenders
to accelerate the maturity of amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility and exercise other customary
remedies including an event of default that is triggered if, immediately after any cash payment of a
settlement of the FCPA Matter (and after any cash or borrowings under the ABL Facility are used to fund
such payment), (i) the Company shall fail to be in compliance with the Minimum Liquidity Covenant or
(ii) if any loans under the ABL Facility are outstanding on the date of such cash payment, availability
under the ABL Facility is less than 33% of the borrowing base in effect on such date.
Term Loan Facility
On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Term Loan and Security Agreement (the “Term Loan
Facility”), among the Company, as Borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company named as guarantors
therein, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as Lenders (collectively, the “Term Loan
Lenders”), Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Agent for the Lenders (the “Term Loan
Administrative Agent”), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as Sole Lead Arranger
and Sole Bookrunner.
On June 1, 2015, the Company and other parties thereto closed on the Term Loan Facility, the Company
borrowed $315 million (prior to giving effect to an upfront discount of 3% which resulted in net proceeds
to the Company, prior to expenses, of approximately $305.5 million), and the Company used a portion of
such proceeds to repay its prior credit facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for an incremental facility
which, subject to the agreement of one or more Term Loan Lenders or other institutional lenders
agreeing to provide the additional loans and the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, would
enable the Company to borrow additional amounts under the Term Loan Facility as long as the
aggregate outstanding amount of all borrowings thereunder does not exceed $400 million. The Term
Loan Facility will mature on June 1, 2020, although such
42
Table of Contents
maturity date may, at the Company’s request, be extended by one or more of the Term Loan Lenders
pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Facility.
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate
equal to (i) LIBOR for one, two, three, six, or, with the consent of the Term Loan Lenders, 12
months, plus 9.25% or (ii) a base rate equal to the sum of (a) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the
Federal Funds rate, plus 0.50% and (z) 30-day LIBOR, plus 1.0% plus (b) 8.25%.
The Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries (the
“Term Loan Guarantors,” and together with the Company, the “Term Loan Parties”). To secure their
obligations under the Term Loan Facility, each of the Term Loan Parties has granted to the Agent a first-
priority security interest for the benefit of the Term Loan Lenders in substantially all of each Term Loan
Party’s assets other than certain excluded assets and the ABL Priority Collateral (the “Term Priority
Collateral”). In addition, the obligations of the Term Loan Parties under the Term Loan Facility are
secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as described above under “ABL
Facility”).
The loans under the Term Loan Facility may be prepaid at the Company’s option, subject to the
payment of a prepayment premium in certain circumstances as provided in the Term Loan Facility. The
Company is required to make principal payments in the amount of $787,500 per quarter commencing
with the quarter ended September 30, 2015. In addition, pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, the
Company must offer to prepay term loans out of the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the Term Loan
Facility) of certain asset sales and, for each fiscal year beginning with the Company’s fiscal year ending
December 31, 2015, the Company must offer to prepay term loans in an aggregate principal amount
equal to 50% of the Company’s Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) for such fiscal
year. Within 30 days following any Change of Control (as defined in the Term Loan Facility), the
Company must offer to prepay all term loans (i) at a price of 101% of the amount thereof if, after giving
effect to such Change of Control, the Asset Coverage Ratio is at least 1.5 to 1.0 or (ii) at a price equal to
the greater of 101% of the amount thereof and the applicable prepayment premium provided for in the
Term Loan Facility if, after giving effect to such Change of Control, the Asset Coverage Ratio is less
than 1.5 to 1.0.
The Term Loan Facility contains customary representations and warranties and certain affirmative and
negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Term Loan Parties to take certain
actions without the permission of the Term Loan Lenders or as permitted under the Term Loan Facility
including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, the payment of
dividends and the sale of assets. The Term Loan Facility also contains financial covenants requiring
that the Company maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0 and that Liquidity (as defined
in the Term Loan Facility) must not be less than $100 million as of the last day of any fiscal quarter or
immediately after any cash payment of a settlement of, or fine in connection with, the FCPA Matter.
The Term Loan Facility contains events of default, the occurrence of which entitle the Term Loan
Lenders to accelerate the maturity of amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and exercise
other customary remedies.
We were in compliance with covenants of the Facilities as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we
have no borrowings outstanding and $38.8 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing
capacity of $27.3 million available subject to covenant constraints under our ABL Facility.
Letter of Credit Facility
On November 7, 2013, we entered into an uncommitted, unsecured $15.0 million letter of credit facility to
be used solely for the issuances of performance letters of credit. As of June 30, 2016, $2.0 million of
letters of credit were outstanding under the facility.
Liquidity Outlook
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $103.5 million and borrowing capacity of
$27.3 million, subject to covenant constraints under the ABL Facility. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we utilized existing cash balances to fund the Company’s operations as our cash flow
from operations was negative $67.4 million. Our ability to fund our operations, pay the principal and
interest on our long-term debt and satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our available liquidity
and the amount of cash flows we are able to generate from our operations. If industry conditions do not
improve, we are likely to continue to have significant negative cash flows from operations during the
remainder of 2016.
43
Table of Contents
We have had negative cash flows from operations in recent fiscal periods and conditions in our industry
remain depressed. Additionally, and as more fully described above, each of our Facilities and our
Indenture contain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial ratios and tests, and if we fail
to remain in compliance with those covenants, our lenders and note holders may declare us to be in
default and exercise a variety of remedies against us. These covenants include, among others,
covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions without the permission of the holders of our
indebtedness, including the incurrence of debt, the granting of liens, the making of investments, the
payment of dividends and the sale of assets, and the financial ratios and tests include, among others, a
requirement that we comply with a Minimum Liquidity Covenant, an Asset Coverage Ratio and, during
certain periods, a fixed charge coverage ratio.
Our ability to satisfy required financial covenants, ratios and tests in our debt agreements and to
generate cash from operations and maintain availability of cash and other sources of liquidity can be
affected by events beyond our control, including commodity prices, demand for our services, the
valuation of our assets and other obligations as well as prevailing economic, financial and industry
conditions, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from
operations, maintain sufficient liquidity or comply with such covenants or that the holders of our
indebtedness will not seek to assert that we are not in compliance with our covenants.    
Even though we believe we were in compliance with the Asset Coverage Ratio as of June 30, 2016, we
may have difficulty complying with this and other financial ratios and tests in future periods. For
example, the Term Priority Collateral includes substantially all of our operating assets, and the value of
these assets is susceptible to decline during periods of low activity. If the appraised value of these
assets further declines and we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility
and/or provide additional Term Priority Collateral, we may be unable to comply with the Asset Coverage
Ratio in the Facilities.
Likewise, we are required to maintain Liquidity (as defined in the Facilities) of not less than $100 million
as of the last day of any fiscal quarter or immediately after any cash payment of a settlement of, or fine in
connection with, the FCPA matter. If we continue to experience negative cash from operations or are
required to expend cash to repay additional amounts under the Term Loan Facility or to discharge other
obligations, we may be unable to maintain compliance with the Minimum Liquidity Covenant under the
Facilities.
Finally, under our ABL Facility, we must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0
during the period commencing on the day that availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater
of $20 million and 20% of the Commitments under the ABL Facility. The fixed charge coverage ratio is
generally defined as the ratio of (i) EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to (ii)
the sum of cash interest expenses, scheduled principal payments on borrowed money and certain
distributions. We have generated negative EBITDA in recent fiscal periods and therefore believe that, in
the absence of a significant improvement in the conditions in our industry, we would not be in
compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio if our availability were to decrease to a level that
resulted in such covenant becoming applicable. Availability under the ABL Facility is influenced
primarily by our use of the facility and by the level of our accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2016, we
had no borrowings outstanding but had $38.8 million of committed letters of credit outstanding, resulting
in availability under the ABL Facility of $27.3 million subject to covenant constraints under that facility.
Our accounts receivable have been decreasing as a result of the conditions in our industry, and,
although we have been taking steps to seek to maintain the availability under our ABL Facility, such as
by depositing cash with the ABL Lenders and seeking to cash collateralize certain letters of credit, we
may not be able to maintain sufficient availability to avoid the application, and a potential breach, of the
fixed charge coverage ratio.
A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or tests would result in a default under our indebtedness. If
we default, lenders under our ABL Facility will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us and they, as
well as the trustee for the 2021 Notes and the Term Loan Administrative Agent, could declare all
amounts of outstanding debt together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The
results of such actions would have a significant negative impact on our financial position and liquidity,
and absent strategic alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or capital
structure, we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness.
As a result, in light of the current conditions in our industry, our significant negative cash flow, our high
level of indebtedness and diminishing liquidity and the risk that we may be unable to remain in
compliance with the financial ratios in our Facilities, we continue to analyze a variety of transactions and
alternatives designed to reduce our debt and improve our liquidity, and we are in active discussions with
our lenders and noteholders regarding such transactions and alternatives.
No assurance can be given, however, that we will be able to implement any such transaction or
alternative, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and, even if we are successful in
implementing a strategic transaction or alternative, such transaction or alternative may not be successful
in allowing us to meet our debt obligations and improving our liquidity. If we breach the covenants under
our debt agreements or if we are lack sufficient liquidity to satisfy our debt or other obligations, then, in
the absence of a strategic transaction or alternative, our creditors could potentially force us into
bankruptcy or we could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection to restructure our business and capital
structure, in which case we could be
44
Table of Contents
forced to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on
our financial statements. Even if we are able to implement a strategic transaction or alternative, such
transaction or alternative may impose onerous terms on us. Additionally, we have a significant amount
of secured indebtedness that is senior to our unsecured indebtedness and a significant amount of total
indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, we believe
that implementation of a strategic transaction or alternative or a bankruptcy proceeding is likely to result
in a limited recovery for unsecured noteholders, if any, and place equity holders at significant risk of
losing all of their interests in our company.
In addition, access to the liquidity provided by our ABL Facility is predicated upon the absence of a
default under the ABL Facility and our other debt agreements and on our ability to satisfy the conditions
to borrowing, which, among other things, require that the representations and warranties under the
facility, including representations and warranties related to our solvency and the absence of a material
adverse effect, remain true and correct and that we not be in violation of any of the covenants in the ABL
Facility.
Future Capital Requirements
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our capital expenditures totaled $5.1 million, primarily
related to the ongoing maintenance of our equipment. Our capital expenditure plan for 2016
contemplates spending up to approximately $20.0 million, subject to market conditions. This is primarily
related to equipment maintenance needs. Our capital expenditure program for 2016 is subject to market
conditions, including activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs.
Our focus for 2016 has been and continues to be the maximization of our current equipment fleet, but we
may choose to increase our capital expenditures in 2016 to increase market share or expand our
presence into a new market. We may also incur capital expenditures for strategic investments and
acquisitions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2016 we did not, and we currently do not, have any off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
from those disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K. More detailed information concerning market risk can be
found in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our 2015 Form 10-K.
ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management performed, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered
by this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2016
that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are subject to various suits and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. We do
not believe that the disposition of any of our ordinary course litigation will result in a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For additional
information on legal proceedings, see “Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies” in “Item 1. Financial
Statements” of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Since January 2014, the Company has been cooperating with investigations by the Department of
Justice and the SEC into possible violations by the Company of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(“FCPA”). On April 28, 2016, the Company announced that the Department of Justice had closed its
investigation and that the Department had decided to decline prosecution of the Company. Effective
August 11, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC resolving the SEC’s
investigation into possible violations of the FCPA by the Company or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the
settlement, Key has agreed to pay disgorgement of $5.0 million and to cease and desist from committing
or causing any violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The
Company neither admitted nor denied any of the SEC’s allegations, except as to jurisdiction. The
Company accrued a liability for the SEC settlement in the first quarter in the amount of $5.0 million.
Between May of 2013 and June of 2014, five lawsuits (four class actions and one enforcement action)
were filed in California involving alleged violations of California’s wage and hour laws. In general, the
lawsuits allege failure to pay wages, including overtime and minimum wages, failure to pay final wages
upon employment terminations in a timely manner, failure to reimburse reasonable and necessary
business expenses, failure to provide wage statements consistent with California law, and violations of
the California meal and break period laws, among other claims. Two of the five cases have been
consolidated in United States District Court for the Central District of California. On December 22, 2015,
that court issued an order granting in part and denying in part a class certification motion. The court
initially certified a class of hourly paid, non-exempt oilfield employees who allege they did not receive
reimbursement for all business expenses and allege they did not receive all rest breaks required by
California law. On July 6, 2016, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, and certified
additional claims alleging that the wage statements were inaccurate and the overtime was improperly
calculated. The court did not determine whether Key is liable to any of the class members. The plaintiff
in the third case must file the motion for class certification by September 30, 2016, and that motion is
scheduled to be heard on February 6, 2017. The fourth case is waiting for a decision regarding whether
it will move forward in California state court or in federal court. The fifth case was dismissed on July 19,
2016. We have investigated the claims in the four remaining lawsuits, and intend to vigorously defend
them.  Because these cases are at an early stage, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of
loss.  
In August 2014, two class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas,
Houston Division, individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated against the Company
and certain officers of the Company, alleging violations of federal securities laws, specifically, violations
of Section 10(b) thereunder and Rule 10(b)-5 thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Those lawsuits were styled as follows: Sean Cady, Individually and on Behalf of All Other
Persons Similarly Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall Dodson, No.
4:14-cv-2368, filed on August 15, 2014; and Ian W. Davidson, Individually and on Behalf of All Other
Persons Similarly Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall Dodson, No.
4.14-cv-2403, filed on August 21, 2014. On December 11, 2014, the Court entered an order that
consolidated the two lawsuits into one action, along with any future filed tag-along actions brought on
behalf of purchasers of Key Energy Services, Inc. common stock. The order also appointed Inter-Local
Pension Fund as the lead plaintiff in the class action and approved the law firm of Spector Roseman
Kodroff & Willis, P.C. as lead counsel for the consolidated class and Kendall Law Group, LLP, as local
counsel for the consolidated class. The lead plaintiff filed the consolidated amended complaint on
February 13, 2015. Among other changes, the consolidated amended complaint added Taylor M.
Whichard III and Newton W. Wilson III as defendants, and sought to represent a class of purchasers of
the Company’s stock between September 4, 2012 and July 17, 2014. Defendants Key Energy Services,
Inc., Richard J. Alario, J. Marshall Dodson and Newton W. Wilson III filed a Motion to Dismiss on April
14, 2015. Defendant Taylor M. Whichard III filed a Joinder in Motion and Motion to Dismiss on the same
date. Lead plaintiff filed an opposition to that motion, and all defendants filed reply briefs in support of
the motion. On April 1, 2016, the Court issued its Opinion and Order granting the defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss. The Court allowed the lead plaintiff 20 days to file another amended complaint or to inform the
Court that it no longer wishes to proceed with the suit. On April 20, 2016, the lead plaintiff notified the
Court that it did not intend to amend its complaint. On April 26, 2016, the Court entered a final judgment
dismissing the case. The deadline for the lead plaintiff to appeal the dismissal expired on May 26, 2016.
Accordingly, there has not been any loss associated with this case.
In addition, in a letter dated September 4, 2014, a purported shareholder of the Company demanded that
the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) commence an independent internal investigation into
and legal proceedings against each member of the Board, a former member of the Board and certain
officers of the Company for alleged violations of
46
Table of Contents
Maryland and/or federal law. The letter alleges that the Board and senior officers breached their
fiduciary duties to the Company, including the duty of loyalty and due care, by (i) improperly accounting
for goodwill, (ii) causing the Company to potentially violate the FCPA, resulting in an investigation by
the SEC, (iii) causing the Company to engage in improper conduct related to the Company’s Russia
operations; and (iv) making false statements regarding, and failing to properly account for, certain
contracts with Pemex. As described in the letter, the purported shareholder believes that the legal
proceedings should seek recovery of damages in an unspecified amount allegedly sustained by the
Company. The Board referred the demand letter to a special committee of the Board (the “Special
Committee”).  
In April 2016, the Special Committee decided to recommend to the Board that the actions stated in the
demand letter, including the commencement of litigation asserting the claims stated in the demand letter,
would not serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and that the demand should be
refused. On May 12, 2016, the Special Committee reported its recommendations to the independent
members of the board, who voted unanimously to ratify, adopt and approve the recommendations of the
Special Committee and directed counsel to prepare a response. On August 10, 2016, the Board
approved the response and the purported shareholder was notified of this determination on August 12,
2016. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
In March 2015, two collective action lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi
Division, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, alleging violations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938 (“FLSA”). We agreed to conditional certification in the first lawsuit and notice of
the case issued to 56 putative class members.  Only 11 of the eligible class members filed a notice of
consent to join the lawsuit by the opt-in deadline. This is an opt-in rate of just below 20%. The first
lawsuit is currently set for trial on December 12, 2016. We also agreed to conditional certification in the
second lawsuit and notice of the case issued to 14 putative class members. Nine putative class
members, including the named plaintiff, have filed a notice of consent to join the lawsuit and the
deadline to join expired on April 4, 2016. There is no trial date set for the second lawsuit.  At this time,
we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss for either case.
In May 2015, a class and collective action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, alleging violations of the FLSA and
the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act. We agreed to conditional certification of a putative class and
notice issued to 174 putative class members. Only 27 of the eligible class members filed a notice of
consent to join the lawsuit by the opt-in deadline. This is an opt-in rate of just above 15%. There is no
trial date set for this lawsuit. At this time, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss for this
case.
In November 2015, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney filed a criminal complaint against two
former employees and Key, specifically alleging three counts of violations of California Labor Code
section 6425(a) against Key. The complaint seeks unspecified penalties against Key related to an
October 12, 2013 accident which resulted in the death of one Key employee at a drilling site near Santa
Maria, California. An arraignment was held on February 10, 2016, where Key and its former employees
pleaded not guilty to all charges. Because the matter is in early stages, we cannot predict the outcome at
this time. Accordingly, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss.
On or about November 23, 2015, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) filed a notice in the
county of Burleigh County, ND alleging statutory violations by Key Energy Services, LLC, as operator of
two salt water disposal wells in the state of North Dakota. The NDIC has pled for approximately
$888,000 in fines and costs. The Company is currently in discussions with the NDIC and is not able to
estimate any possible loss or range of loss at this time.
