<p><b>The issue of Palestinian pregnant women giving birth at Israeli checkpoints

<p><b>Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>*<b>  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.  On the current issue of Palestinian pregnant women 
giving birth at Israeli checkpoints, a report was submitted by the High Commissioner to the 
sixtieth session of the General Assembly (see A/60/324) pursuant to Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2005/7 of 14 April 2005.  The information in the report remains relevant and 
has been complemented by a note submitted by the Secretariat to the Commission on Human 
Rights at its sixty-second session (E/CN.4/2006/28).  The Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 as preserving the 
previous annual reporting cycle in respect of the issue of Palestinian pregnant women giving 
birth at Israeli checkpoints, until otherwise decided by the Council.  The current report to the 
Human Rights Council accordingly addresses developments in respect of this issue since the last 
report submitted to the Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2. On 9 January 2007, the Secretary-General addressed notes verbales to the Permanent 
Mission of Israel and to the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva, in which he indicated that he would appreciate receiving any comments or 
observations that they might wish to submit following Commission resolution 2005/7, the

<p>subsequent report submitted by the High Commissioner to the General Assembly at its sixtieth 
session, and the note submitted by the Secretariat to the Commission on Human Rights at its 
sixty-second session on the issue of Palestinian pregnant women giving birth at Israeli 
checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>3. On 6 February 2007, OHCHR received a report from the Permanent Observer Mission of 
Palestine<b>1</b>, compiled by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, indicating that since the 
Al Aqsa intifada in September 2000, Israel had intensified its military occupation of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) through obstacles and checkpoints at the entry of 
Palestinian cities and villages, impeding seriously the mobility of civilians.  These restrictions 
imposed on the liberty of movement of Palestinian people were perceived as a form of collective 
punishment and constitute a violation of article 33 of the Fourth  Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilians in Time of War of 12 August 1949, which forbids collective penalties 
and intimidation measures, and of article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which guarantees to everyone the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose 
his/her residence.  The Israeli policy of segregation led to the splitting of the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank respectively into 3 and 43 isolated areas or units. 
</p>
<p>4. According to the Information Health Centre of the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 
from 2000 to 2006, 69 cases of Palestinian pregnant women giving birth at Israeli checkpoints 
had been recorded with peaks reached in 2001 (18 cases), in 2002 (24 cases), in 2003 (8 cases) 
and in 2004 (9 cases).  Of these, 45 took place in the West Bank (out of which 11 cases occurred 
in Nablus and 9 cases in Ramallah), while 14 cases were registered in Gaza.  In 2005, only three 
cases were reported in the West Bank and Gaza, while two cases occurred in the West Bank and 
none in Gaza in 2006. 
</p>
<p>5. As a result of the checkpoints, 10 per cent of pregnant women who wished to give birth 
in a hospital had been delayed on the road between two to four hours before reaching health 
facilities, while 6 per cent of them had spent more than four hours for the same journey.  Before 
the intifada, the average time to reach health facilities was 15 to 30 minutes.  These hazardous 
conditions were mainly attributed to impediments faced by ambulances and medical teams when 
trying to transport women in labour through checkpoints, and to inspections or attacks 
perpetrated by Israeli forces against ambulances and their patients. 
</p>
<p>6. According to the figures provided in the same report, 35 newborn babies had died at 
checkpoints as their mothers did not receive the urgent care required by their condition and five 
women lost their lives while giving birth.  In addition, six pregnant women had been injured at 
checkpoints as a result of beating, shooting and use of toxic gas by Israeli soldiers.  Mention was 
made of the case of a pregnant woman who had been targeted in her ninth month of pregnancy at 
a checkpoint by Israeli military, while she was accompanied by her husband and her father.  The 
woman received a wound in her shoulder and the father was injured in the chest; her husband, 
however, died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds.  Most pregnant women belonged to the

</p>
<p>age groups 21-25 (17 cases), 26-30 (16 cases), 31-35 (15 cases), and 36-40 (9 cases).  The fear of 
such hardships led a significant number of Palestinian pregnant women to choose to give birth at 
home (with an increase by 8.2 per cent of home deliveries).  
</p>
<p>7. At the time of preparation of the present report, no reply has been received from the 
Permanent Mission of Israel. 
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR also addressed letters dated 9 January 2007 to the following United Nations 
entities and specialized agencies represented in the OPT:  Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the 
Middle East Process (UNSCO), United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 
World Food Programme (WFP) and World Health Organization (WHO). 
</p>
<p>9. Replies were received in late January and early February 2007 from UNSCO, UNRWA 
transmitting statistics from WHO and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS), as well as 
from UNICEF, UNIFEM and UNFPA.  UNSCO indicated that it had no specific contribution to 
make on the subject.  UNRWA mentioned that it did not keep statistics on the issue of 
Palestinian pregnant women at Israeli checkpoints and that the field staff consulted had no direct 
knowledge of any cases in 2005 or 2006.  The two tables of figures transmitted by WHO are 
based on the statistics provided by the Information Health Centre of the Palestinian Ministry of 
Health (see paragraph 4 above).  The information given by PRCS noted 10 cases of deliveries in 
ambulances between January and May 2005 at the El-Toufah checkpoint in the Gaza Strip, 
which was later dismantled by Israeli forces when they withdrew from Gaza.  All the deliveries 
occurred within delays ranging from one and a half hours to two hours.  
</p>
<p>10. UNICEF indicated that it had no additional comments or observations, except that it 
remained determined to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of the 
Palestinian women and their children, in particular unobstructed and timely access to health 
facilities. 
</p>
<p>11. UNIFEM noted that other United Nations agencies working in the OPT had already 
reported comprehensively on the issue of Palestinian pregnant women giving birth at Israeli 
checkpoints, and focused its contribution on the question of the treatment of pregnant Palestinian 
female prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention centres. 
</p>
<p>12. UNFPA expressed deep concern about recent reports of delays at Israeli checkpoints and 
women in labour, and reiterated the universal right of pregnant women to have access to health 
care, including delivery, in complex humanitarian situations such as in the OPT.  Delays of 
pregnant women at checkpoints and other blockades had resulted in forced roadside births, and 
even in the death of some women (68 women, according to Palestinian Ministry of Health 
statistical reports have in the last six years given birth at a checkpoint, with 34 miscarriages) and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>infants.<b>2</b>  According to 2006 Ministry of Health statistics, there were currently an estimated 
117,000 pregnant women in the OPT, including around 18,000 who suffered from difficult 
pregnancy and birth due to a lack of appropriate and timely antenatal, delivery and 
post-natal care.  In fact, inadequate medical care during pregnancy was the third cause of 
mortality among Palestinian women of reproductive age. 
</p>
<p>13. UNFPA thus urged that civilians with urgent needs should have access to health 
facilities, and that humanitarian organizations be allowed to work freely to alleviate the suffering 
of the Palestinian people, especially women and children.  In this regard, UNFPA had been 
helping Palestinian women to avoid distress, including from delays at checkpoints.  Key 
interventions included training of health personnel in emergency obstetric care; equipping 
trained health-care personnel with delivery kits to enable them to provide more effective service 
delivery in their respective communities; facilitation of the formation of community support 
teams to assist health providers and to raise community awareness on the availability of delivery 
services; and procurement of medications and supplies to ensure the continuity of maternal 
services. 
</p>
<p>14. The latest Israeli military incursions into the Gaza Strip, which started on 28 June  2006, 
had compounded the suffering of the Palestinian population in general and women and young 
people in particular.  General damage to infrastructure, power grids and communication services 
jeopardized provision of adequate health services.  UNFPA was concerned about the negative 
impact of such damage on maternal outcome, including death.  In Gaza, the inability to refer 
properly emergency cases outside of the Strip had been observed as a factor related to maternal 
death in a recent Ministry of Health descriptive study supported by UNFPA (<i>Maternal Death 
Study</i>, Ministry of Health, December 2006).  
</p>
<p>15. Through its network with the Ministry of Health and civil society organizations in 
Palestine, UNFPA continued to work with its partners on the provision of essential emergency 
services and supplies, including the restoration of health facilities, as well as psychosocial and 
clinical services.  UNFPA also raised the issue that any birth at a checkpoint or inability to refer 
a pregnant woman as a result of a military barrier that resulted in birth, death or disability was a 
breach of human and reproductive rights.
