RULING

[1]     
This is an application by the Respondent to have the application of the Applicant for final orders made in Form 9 on 7 December 2011 concerning child maintenance struck out and dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

[2]     
The applicant filed application in Form 9 and sought the following orders:

1.      
The Applicant seeks an Order fixing/specifying and/or particularizing maintenance/financial support that is to be provided by the Applicant for the child George Andrew Naylor pursuant to Clause 5 of the Parenting Plan executed by the parties herein and filed in Nadi Family Court in the within Action on the 02nd December, 2011.

2.      
The applicant seeks an Order fixing/specifying and/or particularizing maintenance/financial support that is to be provided by the Applicant for the child George Andrew Naylor F$500.00 per month.

3.      
The Applicant seeks an Order that any maintenance/financial support that is to be provided by the Applicant for the child George Andrew Naylor is to be paid into a Bank Account details of which are to be provided by the Respondent and to be operated by the Respondent.

4.      
All maintenance/financial support that is to be provided by the Applicant for the child George Andrew Naylor to be utilized for the sole benefit of the child George Andrew Naylor.

[3]     
On 16 January 2012 the Respondent filed Affidavit in Reply in Form 23 and stated inter alia that:

1.      
New Zealand Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development have made an assessment that the Applicant is required to pay a sum of NZ$942 per month as maintenance for George, our son, which is a reasonable amount.

2.      
The determination of this amount is clearly outlined in the Admin Review Decision letter dated 6th September 2011 and any appeal to this decision may only be contested via the New Zealand Family Court (Exhibit 1) and the Applicant would need to file papers in the New Zealand Court to set aside any orders made.

[4]     
On 29 February 2012 the Applicant filed Reply to the Affidavit of the Respondent and stated that he would like to the Court to decide upon the maintenance amount payable for his son as the Court can decide what is best for a 10 year old child and upon looking into his income and expenses.

[5]     
When the matter came up for mention in court on 18.04.2012 Counsel for the Respondent filed a written submission and also orally submitted that this court has no jurisdiction to hear this application as the maintenance has already been determined in New Zealand by Authorities.

[6]     
The learned counsel for the Respondent further submitted that the child is a resident in New Zealand and studies in New Zealand. The maintenance amount has been decided by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development after ascertaining financial position of a paying parent, namely the Applicant.

[7]     
On the other hand learned counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Court has power and jurisdiction to make an order fixing or specifying the maintenance amount that is to be provided by the Applicant for the child pursuant to pursuant to Clause 5 of the Parenting Plan filed in Court on 2 December 2011.

[8]     
Counsel for the Applicant further submitted that the Applicant and the child are Fiji citizens and the child and the Respondent were in Fiji at the time this application was made hence this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine this application pursuant to section 129 of the Family Law Act. She also submitted that the Respondent has conceded to the jurisdiction by not raising the issue of jurisdiction in the first available opportunity. However, learned counsel for the Applicant admitted that currently the Respondent and the child are resident in New Zealand.

[9]     
Section 129 of the Family Law Act provides that:

129.-(1) Proceedings may be instituted under this Act in relation to a child only if-

(a) the child is present in the Fiji Islands on the relevant day;

(b) the child is a citizen of the Fiji Islands, or is ordinarily resident in the Fiji Islands, on the relevant day;

(c) a parent of the child is a citizen of the Fiji Islands, is ordinarily resident in the Fiji Islands, or is present in the Fiji Islands, on the relevant day;

(d) a party to the proceedings is a citizen of the Fiji Islands, or is present in the Fiji Islands, on the relevant day; or

(e) it would be in accordance with a treaty or arrangement in force between the State and an overseas jurisdiction, or the common law rules of private international law, for the court to exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings.

[10]    
I have carefully considered the submissions advanced by both counsel on the issue of jurisdiction to hear and determine this application.

[11]    
The issue before this court is whether this court can have jurisdiction to hear and ascertain a maintenance amount to be paid by the Applicant for the child George, Now resident in New Zealand. 

[12]    
The Applicant filed this application seeking an order fixing/specifying and/or particularizing maintenance to be provided by him for the child. He seeks to fix the maintenance amount at F$500.00 per month.

[13]    
Currently the child resides in New Zealand for study purpose. New Zealand Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development have made an assessment that the Applicant is required to pay a sum of NZ$942 per month. The Respondent is paying this amount as child maintenance.

[14]    
The parties entered into a consent parenting plan on 2 December 2011. The present application is filed just five days after the parenting plan.

[15]    
Clause 5 of the Parenting Plan provides that:

"Andrew will continue provide reasonable financial support for Geordie while he is in Christchurch. These maintenance payments are for Geordies benefit and Tracy will seek employment or alternate income to provide for her own needs".

[16]    
The parties could not set, I believe, a maintenance amount to be paid by the Applicant in their agreed Parenting Plan filed in court on 2 December 2012, for the same had already been decided by the New Zealand Authorities and the Applicant is paying maintenance as per direction and order by the New Zealand Authorities.

[17]    
In Suriji v Native Land Trust Board Civil Appeal 12/94 High Court Labasa 
Scott J. Observed that:

"Alleged want of jurisdiction should always be voiced at the commencement of the proceedings and while a total want of jurisdiction cannot be cured by consent of the parties (Jones v Owen (1849) 18 LJ QB8) a party who conducts himself as to waive his rights cannot rely on want of jurisdiction on appeal (Windsor v Danford (1848) 12 QB 603 and Prinsle v Holes (1925) 1 KB 573). In the present case want of jurisdiction was not raised in the Magistrate's Court at all and I have some doubt as to whether it could be raised on "appeal". 

[18]    
In the matter at hand, the objection to the jurisdiction has been raised well before the commencement of the proceedings. Further, the Respondent in paragraph 4 (b) of Affidavit in Reply deposed that the determination made by New Zealand   
Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development regarding the maintenance amount can only be contested via appeal to the New Zealand Family Court. This deposition maybe considered as jurisdictional objection of this court to hear and determine the Applicant's application.

[19]    
Hence the argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Applicant that the Respondent has acquiesced to the jurisdiction is untenable.

[20     
Pursuant to section 129 (1) (e) of the Family Court Act proceeding may be instituted in relation to a child only if- it would be in accordance with a treaty or arrangement in force between the State and an overseas jurisdiction, or the common law rules of private international law, for the court to exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings. In this case it was not brought to my notice about existence of any such treaty between Fiji and New Zealand or common law rules of private international law for the court to exercise jurisdiction in the proceedings.

[20]    
In application the Applicant seeks an order fixing/specifying and/or particularizing maintenance to be provided by the Applicant for the child George Andrew Naylor. What the Applicant seeks this court to do is to revise or vary the maintenance assessment made by New Zealand Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development. This, in my respectful opinion, should be done in New Zealand where the assessment was made. 

[21]    
I therefore uphold the jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent. I accordingly proceed to strike out the application made by the Applicant to set a maintenance amount to be paid by the Applicant for the child George Andrew Naylor for want of jurisdiction.
