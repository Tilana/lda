commitments and their determination to improve living conditions for Haitians, with a 
special emphasis on respect for human rights.

</p>
<p>4. The Council welcomes the adoption of the Regulations on the judiciary and the new 
Act on the High Council of the Judiciary, as well as the reopening of the Judicial Training 
College. It encourages the authorities to continue their efforts, in particular as regards 
reinforcing inspection units within the police and justice systems, eliminating prolonged 
pretrial detention, introducing a legal aid scheme and strengthening the Office of Citizen 
Protection.  
</p>
<p>5. The Council thanks the outgoing independent expert for his important contribution to 
consolidating the rule of law in Haiti through his judicious recommendations, in particular 
with regard to judicial reform. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council is deeply concerned at the deterioration of Haitians&#8217; standard of living 
and quality of life in recent months, partly as a result of the serious economic crisis and 
acute food shortage. It deplores the heavy loss of life and material damage caused by the 
consecutive passage of hurricanes Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike. 
</p>
<p>7. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
difficulties encountered by its leaders in daily governance. It recognizes that full 
enjoyment of human rights - civil and political, economic, social and cultural - is a factor 
of peace, stability and progress in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>8. The Council strongly encourages the international community as a whole, and in 
particular international donors, friendly countries and United Nations specialized agencies, 
to step up their cooperation with the constituted authorities of Haiti for the full realization 
of human rights.

his mission by bringing his experience and expertise to bear and contributing to the cause 
of human rights in Haiti, with a particular emphasis on economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The Council also invites the new expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the near 
future and report to it each year in accordance with its programme of work. It encourages 
the Haitian authorities to cooperate with the new independent expert.&#8221;
