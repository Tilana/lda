SM ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1 - The Company and Business
SM Energy Company (“SM Energy” or the “Company”) is an independent energy company
engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of crude oil and
condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (also respectively referred to as “oil,” “gas,” and
“NGLs” throughout this report) in onshore North America.
Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies, and Recently Issued Accounting
Standards
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of SM Energy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information and the instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. These
financial statements do not include all information and notes required by GAAP for annual
financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material change in
the information disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in SM
Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015
Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of interim financial information, have
been included. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of
expected results for the full year. In connection with the preparation of the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluated events subsequent to the
balance sheet date of June 30, 2016, through the filing date of this report. Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation on the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Significant Accounting Policies
The significant accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in Note 1 to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements in its 2015 Form 10-K, and are supplemented by
the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this report. These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes included in the 2015 Form 10-K.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted, on a retrospective basis, Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-02, Consolidation
(Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. This ASU clarifies the consolidation
reporting guidance in GAAP. There was no impact to the Company’s financial statements or
disclosures from the adoption of this standard.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which changes the
accounting for leases. This guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective method and
is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company’s financial statements and
disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”) for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
Subsequent to the issuance of this ASU, the FASB has issued additional related ASUs as
follows:
•
•
•
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. This ASU deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09
by one year.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).
This ASU amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU No. 2014-09.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. This ASU amends the
identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses in ASU 2014-09.
8
•
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This ASU amends certain
issues in ASU 2014-09 on transition, collectibility, noncash consideration, and the presentation
of sales taxes and other similar taxes.
ASU 2014-09 and each update have the same effective date and transition requirements. That is,
the guidance under these standards is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a
modified retrospective method, as outlined in ASU 2014-09, and is effective for annual periods,
and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption is permitted only for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods,
beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the level of effort
needed to implement the standards, evaluating the provisions of each of these standards, and
assessing their impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures, as well as
determining whether to use the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU makes targeted
amendments to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This guidance is to be
applied using various transition methods, such as full retrospective, modified retrospective, and
prospective, based on the criteria for the specific amendments as outlined in the guidance. The
guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods,
beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, as long as all of the
amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the
provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company’s financial statements and
disclosures.
Other than as disclosed above or in the 2015 Form 10-K, there are no other accounting standards
applicable to the Company that would have a material effect on the Company’s financial
statements and related disclosures that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company
as of June 30, 2016, and through the filing date of this report.
Note 3 – Assets Held for Sale and Divestitures
Assets Held for Sale
Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company commits to a plan to sell the assets and
there is reasonable certainty the sale will take place within one year. Upon classification as held
for sale, long-lived assets are no longer depreciated or depleted, and a measurement for
impairment is performed to identify and expense any excess of carrying value over fair value less
estimated costs to sell. Any subsequent changes to the fair value less estimated costs to sell
impact the measurement of assets held for sale with any gain or loss reflected in the net gain
(loss) on divestiture activity line item in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of
operations (“accompanying statements of operations”).
As of June 30, 2016, the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets
(“accompanying balance sheets”) present $173.0 million of assets held for sale, net of
accumulated depletion, depreciation, and amortization expense, which consists of certain non-
core assets in each of the Company’s operating regions. A corresponding aggregate asset
retirement obligation liability of $32.1 million is separately presented. Certain of these assets
were written down by $68.3 million to reflect fair value less estimated costs to sell upon
reclassification to assets held for sale, as of March 31, 2016. During the second quarter of 2016,
the Company estimated an increase in the fair value of certain previously impaired assets held
for sale due to an increase in estimated selling prices, as evidenced by recent bid prices
received from third parties, resulting in a $49.5 million gain recorded for the three months ended
June 30, 2016. The Company expects to close the asset sale transactions prior to December 31,
2016. There were no material assets held for sale as of December 31, 2015.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company entered into separate purchase and sale
agreements for the sale of certain of its Permian and Rocky Mountain assets that were classified
as held for sale as of June 30, 2016. The Company expects to close these transactions prior to
December 31, 2016. The closings of these transactions are subject to the satisfaction of
customary closing conditions, and there can be no assurance that these transactions will close
on the expected closing dates or at all.
Divestitures
During the second quarter of 2015, the Company divested its Mid-Continent assets in separate
packages for total cash proceeds received at closing of $316.5 million and recorded an estimated
net gain of $107.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. These assets were classified
as held for sale as of March 31, 2015, and certain of these assets were written down by $30.0
million during the three months ended March 31, 2015, to reflect their fair value less estimated
costs to sell. This write-down is reflected in the total net gain of $107.8 million discussed above.
In conjunction with this divestiture, the Company closed its Tulsa, Oklahoma office in 2015 and
incurred $5.0 million and $8.5 million of exit and disposal costs for the three and six months
ended
9
June 30, 2015, respectively. Offsetting the net gain recorded on the divestiture of the Company’s
Mid-Continent assets were write-downs recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015,
on certain other assets held for sale totaling $66.0 million.
The Company determined that neither these planned nor executed asset sales qualified for
discontinued operations accounting under financial statement presentation authoritative
guidance.
Note 4 - Income Taxes
The income tax benefit recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015,
differs from the amounts that would be provided by applying the statutory United States federal
income tax rate to income or loss before income taxes primarily due to the effect of state income
taxes, changes in valuation allowances, research and development (“R&D”) credits, and other
permanent differences. The quarterly rate can also be affected by the proportional effects of
forecasted net income or loss as of each period end presented.
The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

On a year-to-date basis, a change in the Company’s effective tax rate between reported periods
will generally reflect differences in its estimated highest marginal state tax rate due to changes in
the composition of income or loss from various state tax jurisdictions. Cumulative effects of state
rate changes are reflected in the period legislation is enacted.
The Company is generally no longer subject to United States federal or state income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. During the first quarter of 2016, the
Company received an expected $4.9 million refund of tax and interest after the Company and the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) reached a final agreement on the examination of the
Company’s 2007 - 2011 tax years. There were no material adjustments to previously reported
amounts. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the IRS initiated an audit of the tax
partnership between the Company and Mitsui E&P Texas LP for the 2013 tax year. The
Company has a significant investment in the underlying assets of this tax partnership. The
Company received notice during the first quarter of 2016 that the IRS concluded the audit with no
adjustments.
Note 5 - Long-Term Debt
Revolving Credit Facility
On April 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Fifth Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement” and as amended, the “Amended Credit
Agreement”) with its lenders. The Company incurred approximately $3.1 million in deferred
financing costs associated with the amendment of this credit facility. The Amended Credit
Agreement provides for a maximum loan amount of $2.5 billion and has a maturity date of
December 10, 2019. Pursuant to the amendment, and as part of the regular, semi-annual
borrowing base redetermination process, the Company’s borrowing base was reduced to $1.25
billion. This expected reduction was primarily due to the decline in commodity prices, which had
resulted in a decrease in the Company’s proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. The next
scheduled redetermination date is October 1, 2016. The borrowing base redetermination process
considers the value of both the Company’s (a) proved oil and gas properties reflected in the
Company’s most recent reserve report and (b) commodity derivative contracts, each as
determined by the Company’s lender group. The amendment also reduced the aggregate lender
commitments to $1.25 billion, and changed the required percentage of oil and gas properties
subject to a mortgage to at least 90 percent of the total PV-9 of the Company’s proved oil and gas
properties evaluated in the most recent reserve report. Further, the amendment revised certain of
the Company’s covenants under the Credit Agreement and modified the borrowing base
utilization grid, as discussed below.
10
The Company must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the terms of
the Amended Credit Agreement, including covenants limiting dividend payments and requiring
the Company to maintain certain financial ratios, as defined by the Amended Credit Agreement.
Financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement require, as of the last day of each of
the Company’s fiscal quarters, the Company’s (a) ratio of senior secured debt to 12-month trailing
adjusted EBITDAX to be not more than 2.75 to 1.0; (b) adjusted current ratio to be not less than
1.0 to 1.0; and (c) ratio of 12-month trailing adjusted EBITDAX to interest expense to be not less
than 2.0 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants
under the Amended Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016, and through the filing date of this
report.
Interest and commitment fees are accrued based on a borrowing base utilization grid set forth in
the Amended Credit Agreement.  Eurodollar loans accrue interest at the London Interbank
Offered Rate plus the applicable margin from the utilization table below, and Alternate Base Rate
(“ABR”) and swingline loans accrue interest at prime plus the applicable margin from the
utilization table below.  Commitment fees are accrued on the unused portion of the aggregate
commitment amount and are included in interest expense in the accompanying statements of
operations. Effective as of April 8, 2016, the revised borrowing base utilization grid under the
Amended Credit Agreement is as follows:
Borrowing Base Utilization Grid
Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage <25%  ≥25% <50% ≥50% <75% ≥75% <90% ≥90%

The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of
the Company’s existing and any future unsecured senior debt, and are senior in right of payment
to any future subordinated debt. There are no subsidiary guarantors of the Senior Notes.  The
Company is subject to certain covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes that
limit the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, and make
restricted payments, including dividends; however, the first $6.5 million of dividends paid each
year are not restricted by the restricted payment covenant. The Company was in compliance with
all covenants under its Senior Notes as of June 30, 2016, and through the filing date of this
report. The Company may redeem some or all of its Senior Notes prior to their maturity at
redemption prices based on a premium plus accrued and unpaid interest as described in the
indentures governing the Senior Notes.
During the first quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased in open market transactions a total of
$46.3 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.50% Senior Notes due 2021, 6.125% Senior
Notes due 2022, and 6.50% Senior Notes due 2023 for a settlement amount of $29.9 million,
excluding interest. Of the $29.9 million settlement amount, $10.0 million related to purchases
during the first quarter of 2016, in which the related cash settlement occurred during the three
months ended June 30, 2016. The Company recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of
approximately $15.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. This amount includes a
gain of $16.4 million associated with the discount realized upon repurchase, which was partially
offset by approximately $700,000 related to the acceleration of unamortized deferred financing
costs. The Company accounted for the repurchases under the extinguishment method of
accounting. The Company canceled all repurchased notes upon cash settlement.
Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
There were no material changes in commitments during the first half of 2016, except as
discussed below. Please refer to Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Company’s
2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a water disposal agreement. Under
the agreement, the Company is committed to deliver 25.4 MMBbl of water for treatment through
2026. In the event that the Company does not deliver any volumes under this agreement, the
Company’s aggregate undiscounted deficiency payments would be approximately $23.0 million.
This commitment will not be effective until the counterparty constructs and places the associated
pipeline into operation, which is expected to be by the end of 2016.
12
During the first half of 2016, the Company renegotiated the terms of certain drilling rig contracts to
provide flexibility concerning the timing of activity and payment. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $2.6 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of
expense related to the early termination of drilling rig contracts or fees incurred for rigs placed on
standby, which are recorded in the other operating expenses line item in the accompanying
statements of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company
incurred drilling rig termination fees of $2.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into amendments to certain oil gathering
and gas gathering agreements related to its outside-operated Eagle Ford shale assets, neither of
which previously had a minimum volume commitment, in order to obtain more favorable rates
and terms. Under these amended agreements, as of June 30, 2016, the Company is now
committed to deliver 296 Bcf of natural gas and 39 MMBbl of oil through 2034. In the event that
the Company delivers no product under these amended agreements, the Company’s aggregate
undiscounted deficiency payments would be approximately $342.0 million at June 30, 2016;
however, because of the Company’s partial ownership interest in the gathering systems used to
provide the services under these agreements, the Company is entitled to receive its share of
operating income generated by the systems, and thus would expect to receive approximately
$241.4 million if the $342.0 million shortfall payment was required.
During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to a gas gathering
agreement related to its operated Eagle Ford shale assets, which reduced the Company’s
volume commitment amount as of December 31, 2015, by 829 Bcf, and reduced the aggregate
undiscounted deficiency payments, in the event no product is delivered, by $118.2 million
through 2021.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had total gas, oil, and NGL gathering, processing, and
transportation throughput commitments with various third parties that require delivery of a
minimum amount of 1,590 Bcf of natural gas, 72 MMBbl of crude oil, and 14 MMBbl of natural gas
liquids through 2034. If the Company delivers no product, the aggregate undiscounted deficiency
payments total approximately $1.0 billion through 2034, prior to considering the $241.4 million of
operating income the Company would expect to receive if certain payments were required as
discussed above.
As of the filing date of this report, the Company does not expect to incur any material shortfalls
with regard to its gas, oil, and NGL gathering, processing, and transportation throughput
commitments.
Contingencies
The Company is subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The
Company accrues for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, the expected results of any pending
litigation and claims will not have a material effect on the results of operations, the financial
position, or the cash flows of the Company.
The Company is subject to routine severance, royalty and joint interest audits from regulatory
authorities, non-operators and others, as the case may be, and records accruals for estimated
exposure when a claim is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Additionally, the Company is subject to various possible contingencies that arise from third party
interpretations of the Company’s contracts or otherwise affecting the oil and natural gas industry.
Such contingencies include differing interpretations as to the prices at which oil and natural gas
sales may be made, the prices that royalty owners are paid for production from their leases,
allowable costs under joint interest arrangements, and other matters. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company had $4.4 million accrued for estimated exposure related to potential claims for payment
of royalties on certain Federal and Indian oil and gas leases. Although the Company believes
that it has properly estimated its potential exposure with respect to these claims based on various
contracts, laws and regulations, administrative rulings, and interpretations thereof, adjustments
could be required as new interpretations and regulations arise.

Note 7 - Compensation Plans
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan
As of June 30, 2016, 6.2 million shares of common stock remained available for grant under the
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan.
Performance Share Units Under the Equity Incentive Compensation Plan
The Company grants performance share units (“PSUs”) to eligible employees as part of its long-
term equity compensation program. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock
issued to settle PSUs ranges from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs awarded and is
determined based on certain performance criteria over a three-year measurement period. The
performance criteria for the PSUs are based on a combination of the Company’s annualized
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for the performance period and the relative performance of the
Company’s TSR compared with the annualized TSR of certain peer companies for the
performance period. Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized within general and
administrative and exploration expense over the vesting periods of the respective awards.
Total compensation expense recorded for PSUs for the three months ended June 30, 2016, and
2015, was $3.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and $5.9 million and $5.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, there was $12.3
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested PSU awards, which is
being amortized through 2018. There were no material changes to the outstanding and non-
vested PSUs during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, as part of its regular annual long-term equity compensation
program, the Company granted 447,971 PSUs with a fair value of $11.9 million. These PSUs will
fully vest on the third anniversary of the date of the grant. Also, subsequent to June 30, 2016, the
Company settled PSUs that were granted in 2013, which earned a 0.2 times multiplier, by issuing
a net 30,061 shares of the Company’s common stock in accordance with the terms of the
respective PSU awards. The Company and the majority of grant participants mutually agreed to
net share settle a portion of the awards to cover income and payroll tax withholdings as provided
for in the plan document and award agreements. As a result, 14,809 shares were withheld to
satisfy income and payroll tax withholding obligations that occurred upon delivery of the shares
underlying those PSUs.
Restricted Stock Units Under the Equity Incentive Compensation Plan
The Company grants restricted stock units (“RSUs”) as part of its long-term equity compensation
program. Each RSU represents a right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock
upon settlement of the award at the end of the specified vesting period. Compensation expense
for RSUs is recognized within general and administrative expense and exploration expense over
the vesting periods of the award.
Total compensation expense recorded for RSUs was $3.3 million and $2.9 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $6.5 million and $5.8 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, there was $12.0
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSU awards, which is
being amortized through 2018. There were no material changes to the outstanding and non-
vested RSUs during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, as part of its regular annual long-term equity compensation
program, the Company granted 417,065 RSUs with a fair value of $11.7 million. These RSUs will
vest one-third of the total grant on each of the next three anniversary dates of the grant. Also,
subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company settled 232,258 RSUs that related to awards granted
in previous years. The Company and the majority of grant participants mutually agreed to net
share settle a portion of the awards to cover income and payroll tax withholdings as provided for
in the plan document and award agreements. As a result, the Company issued 162,211 net
shares of common stock. The remaining 70,047 shares were withheld to satisfy income and
payroll tax withholding obligations that occurred upon delivery of the shares underlying those
RSUs.
Director Shares
During the first half of 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 53,473 and 37,950 shares,
respectively, of its common stock to its non-employee directors, under the Company’s Equity
Incentive Compensation Plan and recorded $517,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, of
compensation expense.
14
Beginning with 2016, all shares issued to non-employee directors fully vest on December 31st of
the year granted.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible employees may
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 percent
of eligible compensation, without accruing in excess of $25,000 in value from purchases for each
calendar year. The purchase price of the stock is 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value
of the stock on the first or last day of the purchase period, and shares issued under the ESPP
have no restriction period. The ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code (“IRC”). The Company had 808,854 shares available for issuance under the
ESPP as of June 30, 2016. There were 140,853 and 96,285 shares issued under the ESPP
during the second quarters of 2016, and 2015, respectively. The fair value of ESPP grants is
measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Note 8 - Pension Benefits
Pension Plans
The Company has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its
employees who joined the Company prior to January 1, 2015, and who meet age and service
requirements (the “Qualified Pension Plan”). The Company also has a supplemental non-
contributory pension plan covering certain management employees (the “Nonqualified Pension
Plan” and together with the Qualified Pension Plan, the “Pension Plans”). The Company froze
the Pension Plans to new participants, effective as of December 31, 2015. Employees
participating in the Pension Plans as of December 31, 2015, will continue to earn benefits.

Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service
period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining
service period of active participants.
Contributions
The Company contributed $6.0 million to the Pension Plans during the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
Note 9 - Earnings Per Share
Basic net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income or loss
available to common stockholders by the basic weighted-average common shares outstanding
for the respective period. The earnings per share calculations reflect the impact of any
repurchases of shares of common stock made by the Company.
Diluted net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income or
loss by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding, which includes the effect of
potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities for this calculation consist of unvested
RSUs and contingent PSUs. The treasury stock method is used to measure the dilutive impact of
these stock awards.
15
PSUs represent the right to receive, upon settlement of the PSUs after the completion of the
three-year performance period, a number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may
range from zero to two times the number of PSUs granted on the award date. The number of
potentially dilutive shares related to PSUs is based on the number of shares, if any, that would be
issuable at the end of the respective reporting period, assuming that date was the end of the
contingency period applicable to such PSUs.
Please refer to Note 7 - Compensation Plans for additional discussion of the RSUs and PSUs
granted subsequent to June 30, 2016, as part of the Company’s regular annual long-term equity
compensation program, in addition to the net RSUs and PSUs settled.
When the Company recognizes a loss from continuing operations, as was the case for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, all potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive
and are consequently excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. The
following table details the weighted-average anti-dilutive securities related to RSUs and PSUs
for the periods presented:

Summary of Oil, Gas, and NGL Derivative Contracts in Place
    
The Company has entered into various commodity derivative contracts to mitigate a portion of its
exposure to potentially adverse market changes in commodity prices and the associated impact
on cash flows. All contracts are entered into for other-than-trading purposes. The Company’s
derivative contracts consist of swap and collar arrangements for oil, gas, and NGLs. In a typical
commodity swap agreement, if the agreed upon published third-party index price (“index price”) is
lower than the swap fixed price, the Company receives the difference between the index price
and the agreed upon swap fixed price. If the index price is higher than the swap fixed price, the
Company pays the difference.  For collar arrangements, the Company receives the difference
between an agreed upon index and the floor price if the index price is below the floor price. The
Company pays the difference between the agreed upon ceiling price and the index price if the
index price is above the ceiling price. No amounts are paid or received if the index price is
between the floor and ceiling prices.
    
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had commodity derivative contracts outstanding through the
second quarter of 2020 as summarized in the tables below. During the three months ended
March 31, 2016, the Company restructured certain of its gas derivative contracts by buying fixed
price volumes to offset existing 2018 and 2019 fixed price swap contracts totaling 55.0 million
MMBtu. The Company then entered into new 2017 fixed price swap contracts totaling 38.6
million MMBtu with a contract price of $4.43 per MMBtu. No cash or other consideration was
included as part of the restructuring.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company entered into derivative fixed price swap contracts
through the first quarter of 2018 for a total of 15.6 million MMBtu of gas production at contract
prices ranging from $2.90 to $3.24 per MMBtu, and derivative fixed price swap contracts through
the fourth quarter of 2018 for 1.4 million Bbls of NGL production at contract prices ranging from
16
$21.32 per Bbl to $21.79 per Bbl. Additionally, subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company
entered into a derivative collar contract through the fourth quarter of 2017 for a total of 1.4 million
Bbls of crude oil production with a contract floor price of $45.00 per Bbl and a contract ceiling
price of $56.25 per Bbl.

As of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, all derivative instruments held by the Company
were subject to master netting arrangements with various financial institutions. In general, the
terms of the Company’s agreements provide for offsetting of amounts payable or receivable
between it and the counterparty, at the election of both parties, for transactions that settle on the
same date and in the same currency. The Company’s agreements also provide that in the event
of an early termination, the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under
that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. The Company’s accounting policy is to
not offset these positions in its accompanying balance sheets.

Natural gas derivative settlements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, include a
$15.3 million gain on the early settlement of future contracts as a result of divesting our Mid-
Continent assets during the second quarter of 2015.
Credit Related Contingent Features
As of June 30, 2016, and through the filing date of this report, all of the Company’s derivative
counterparties were members of the Company’s credit facility lender group. The Amended Credit
Agreement, as discussed above, changed the required percentage of oil and gas properties
subject to a mortgage to at least 90 percent of the total PV-9 of the Company’s proved oil and gas
properties evaluated in the most recent reserve report.

Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements
The Company follows fair value measurement accounting guidance for all assets and liabilities
measured at fair value. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. Market or observable inputs are the preferred sources of
values, followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market
inputs. The fair value hierarchy for grouping these assets and liabilities is based on the
significance level of the following inputs:
•Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations
whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable
•Level 3 – significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable
The following table is a listing of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value in the accompanying balance sheets and where they are classified within the fair value
hierarchy as of June 30, 2016:

Both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are categorized within the above fair value
hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by the Company as well as the
general classification of such instruments pursuant to the above fair value hierarchy.
20
Derivatives
The Company uses Level 2 inputs to measure the fair value of oil, gas, and NGL commodity
derivatives. Fair values are based upon interpolated data. The Company derives internal
valuation estimates taking into consideration forward commodity price curves, counterparties’
credit ratings, the Company’s credit rating, and the time value of money. These valuations are
then compared to the respective counterparties’ mark-to-market statements. The considered
factors result in an estimated exit-price that management believes provides a reasonable and
consistent methodology for valuing derivative instruments. The derivative instruments utilized by
the Company are not considered by management to be complex, structured, or illiquid. The oil,
gas, and NGL commodity derivative markets are highly active.
Generally, market quotes assume that all counterparties have near zero, or low, default rates and
have equal credit quality. However, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the credit quality
of a specific counterparty to determine the fair value of the instrument. The Company monitors the
credit ratings of its counterparties and may require counterparties to post collateral if their ratings
deteriorate. In some instances, the Company will attempt to novate the trade to a more stable
counterparty.
Valuation adjustments are necessary to reflect the effect of the Company’s credit quality on the
fair value of any derivative liability position. This adjustment takes into account any credit
enhancements, such as collateral margin that the Company may have posted with a
counterparty, as well as any letters of credit between the parties. The methodology to determine
this adjustment is consistent with how the Company evaluates counterparty credit risk, taking into
account the Company’s credit rating, current credit facility margins, and any change in such
margins since the last measurement date. All of the Company’s derivative counterparties are
members of the Company’s credit facility lender group.
The methods described above may result in a fair value estimate that may not be indicative of net
realizable value or may not be reflective of future fair values and cash flows. While the Company
believes that the valuation methods utilized are appropriate and consistent with authoritative
accounting guidance and with other marketplace participants, the Company recognizes that third
parties may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain
financial instruments that could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Refer to Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more information regarding the
Company’s derivative instruments.
Net Profits Plan
The Net Profits Plan is a standalone liability for which there is no available market price, principal
market, or market participants. The inputs available for this instrument are unobservable and are
therefore classified as Level 3 inputs. The Company employs the income valuation technique,
which converts expected future cash flow amounts to a single present value amount. This
technique uses the estimate of future cash payments, expectations of possible variations in the
amount and/or timing of cash flows, the risk premium, and nonperformance risk to calculate the
fair value. There is a direct correlation between realized oil, gas, and NGL commodity prices
driving net cash flows and the Net Profits Plan liability. Generally, higher commodity prices result
in a larger Net Profits Plan liability and lower commodity prices result in a smaller Net Profits
Plan liability.
The Company records the estimated fair value of the long-term liability for estimated future
payments under the Net Profits Plan based on the discounted value of estimated future payments
associated with each individual pool. A discount rate of 10 percent was used to calculate this
liability, and is intended to represent the Company’s best estimate of the present value of
expected future payments under the Net Profits Plan.
The Company’s estimate of its liability is highly dependent on commodity prices, cost
assumptions, discount rates, and overall market conditions. The Company regularly assesses
the current market environment.  The Net Profits Plan liability is determined using price
assumptions of five one-year strip prices with the fifth year’s pricing then carried out indefinitely.
The average price is adjusted for realized price differentials and to include the effects of the
forecasted production covered by derivative contracts in the relevant periods.  The non-cash
expense associated with this significant management estimate is highly volatile from period to
period due to fluctuations that occur in the oil, gas, and NGL commodity markets.
If the commodity prices used in the calculation changed by five percent, the liability recorded at
June 30, 2016, would differ by approximately $1.5 million. A one percent increase or decrease in
the discount rate would result in a change of approximately $400,000. Actual cash payments to
be made to participants in future periods are dependent on realized actual production, realized
commodity prices, and costs associated with the properties in each individual pool of the Net
Profits Plan. Consequently, actual cash payments are inherently different from the amounts
estimated.
21
No published market quotes exist on which to base the Company’s estimate of fair value of its
Net Profits Plan liability. As such, the recorded fair value is based entirely on management
estimates that are described within this footnote. While some inputs to the Company’s calculation
of fair value of the Net Profits Plan’s future payments are from published sources, others, such as
the discount rate and the expected future cash flows, are derived from the Company’s own
calculations and estimates.

The carrying value of the Company’s credit facility approximates its fair value, as the applicable
interest rates are floating, based on prevailing market rates.
Proved and Unproved Oil and Gas Properties and Other Property and Equipment
Total property and equipment, net, measured at fair value within the accompanying balance
sheets totaled $99.9 million and $124.8 million as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015,
respectively.
    
Proved oil and gas property costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value when
there is an indication the carrying costs may not be recoverable. The Company uses Level 3
inputs and the income valuation technique, which converts future amounts to a single present
value amount, to measure the fair value of proved properties through an application of discount
rates and price forecasts representative of the current operating environment, as selected by the
Company’s management. The calculation of the discount rates are based on the best information
available and were estimated to be 10 percent to 15 percent based on the reservoir specific
weightings of future estimated proved and unproved cash flows as of June 30, 2016, and
December 31, 2015. The Company believes the discount rates are representative of current
market conditions and take into account estimates of future cash payments, reserve categories,
expectations of possible variations in the amount and/or timing of cash flows, the risk premium,
and nonperformance risk. The prices for oil and gas are forecast based on NYMEX strip pricing,
adjusted for basis differentials, for the
22
first five years, after which a flat terminal price is used for each commodity stream. The prices for
NGLs are forecast using OPIS Mont Belvieu pricing, for as long as the market is actively trading,
after which a flat terminal price is used. Future operating costs are also adjusted as deemed
appropriate for these estimates. The Company did not recognize any impairment on proved
properties during the three months ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30,
2016, the Company recorded impairment of proved properties expense of $269.8 million due to
the decline in proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserve expected cash flows for
the Company’s outside-operated Eagle Ford assets, driven by commodity price declines during
the first quarter of 2016. The Company recorded impairment of proved oil and gas properties
expense of $468.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the decline in proved
and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserve expected cash flows, driven by commodity price
declines. Impairments were recorded mainly in the Company’s east Texas and Powder River
Basin programs with smaller impacts on other legacy and non-core assets in the Rocky Mountain
region.
Unproved oil and gas property costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value when
there is an indication that the carrying costs may not be recoverable.  To measure the fair value of
unproved properties, the Company uses a market approach, which takes into account the
following significant assumptions: future development plans, risk weighted potential resource
recovery, and estimated reserve values. The Company recorded $38,000 and $2.3 million
abandonment and impairment expense on unproved properties for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In
all periods discussed, the abandonment and impairment expense resulted from lease expirations
and acreage the Company no longer intended to develop in light of changes in drilling plans in
response to the decline in commodity prices.
Other property and equipment costs are evaluated for impairment and reduced to fair value when
there is an indication the carrying costs may not be recoverable. Fair value of other property and
equipment is valued using an income valuation technique or market approach depending on the
quality of information available to support management’s assumptions and the circumstances.
The valuation includes consideration of the proved and unproved assets supported by the
property and equipment, future cash flows associated with the assets, and fixed costs necessary
to operate and maintain the assets. The Company recorded impairment of other property and
equipment expense of $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, on the Company’s
gathering system assets in east Texas. These assets were impaired in conjunction with the
impairment of the associated proved and unproved properties, which the Company does not
intend to develop during an environment of sustained low commodity prices.
Proved properties classified as held for sale, including the corresponding asset retirement
obligation liability, are valued using a market approach, based on an estimated selling price, as
evidenced by the most current bid prices received from third parties, if available. If an estimated
selling price is not available, the Company utilizes the income valuation technique discussed
above. Unproved properties classified as held for sale are valued using a market approach,
based on an estimated selling price, as evidenced by the most current bid prices received from
third parties. If an estimated selling price is not available, the Company estimates acreage value
based on the price received for similar acreage in recent transactions by the Company or other
market participants in the principal market. As of June 30, 2016, certain assets held for sale are
recorded at fair value totaling $99.9 million less estimated selling costs. Certain of these assets
were written down during the first quarter of 2016. A subsequent increase in estimated selling
prices, as evidenced by recent bid prices received from third parties, resulted in a $49.5 million
gain recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Please refer to Note 3 – Assets Held for
Sale and Divestitures. There were no assets held for sale recorded at fair value as of December
31, 2015.
The fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured on a
nonrecurring basis on the acquisition date using an income valuation technique based on inputs
that are not observable in the market and therefore represent Level 3 inputs. Significant inputs to
the valuation of acquired oil and gas properties include estimates of: (i) reserves; (ii) production
rates; (iii) future operating and development costs; (iv) future commodity prices, including price
differentials; (v) future cash flows; and (vi) a market participant-based weighted average cost of
capital rate. These inputs require significant judgments and estimates by the Company’s
management at the time of the valuation.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This management’s discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Refer to
Cautionary Information About Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this item for an
explanation of these types of statements.
Overview of the Company, Highlights, and Outlook
General Overview
We are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development,
and production of oil, gas, and NGLs in onshore North America. Our strategic objective is to
profitably build our ownership and operatorship of North American oil, gas, and NGL producing
assets that have high operating margins and significant opportunities for additional economic
investment. We pursue growth opportunities through both exploration and acquisitions, and we
seek to maximize the value of our assets through industry leading technology application and
outstanding operational execution. We focus on achieving high full-cycle economic returns on
our investments and maintaining a simple, strong balance sheet through a conservative
approach to leverage.
We currently focus our capital investments on our development positions in the Eagle Ford shale,
Bakken/Three Forks, and Permian Basin resource plays. We also have a delineation and
exploration program in the Powder River Basin.
In the second quarter of 2016, we had the following financial and operational results:
•
Average net daily production for the three months ended June 30, 2016, was 45.1 MBbls of oil,
428.2 MMcf of gas, and 40.8 MBbls of NGLs, for a quarterly equivalent daily production rate of
157.2 MBOE, compared with 181.0 MBOE for the same period in 2015. Please see additional
discussion below under Production Results.
•
•
We recorded a net loss of $168.7 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared with a net loss of $57.5 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and Trends
Between the Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, below for
additional discussion regarding the components of net loss for each period.
Costs incurred for oil and gas property acquisitions, exploration and development activities for
the three months ended June 30, 2016, totaled $177.3 million, compared with $354.0 million for
the same period in 2015. Please refer to Costs Incurred in Oil and Gas Producing Activities
below for additional discussion.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016, totaled
•$138.6 million, compared with $265.6 million for the same period in 2015.
•
Adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
was $217.1 million, compared with $337.3 million for the same period in 2015. Please refer to
Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional discussion, including our definition of
adjusted EBITDAX and reconciliations of our net loss and net cash provided by operating
activities to adjusted EBITDAX.
Oil, Gas, and NGL Prices
Our financial condition and the results of our operations are significantly affected by the prices we
receive for our oil, gas, and NGL production, which can fluctuate dramatically. We sell the
majority of our gas under contracts using first-of-the-month index pricing, which means gas
produced in a given month is sold at the first-of-the-month price regardless of the spot price on
the day the gas is produced.  For assets where high BTU gas is sold at the wellhead, we also
receive additional value for the higher energy content contained in the gas stream. Our NGL
production is generally sold using contracts paying us a monthly average of the posted OPIS
daily settlement prices, adjusted for processing, transportation, and location differentials. Our oil
is sold using the calendar month average of the NYMEX WTI daily contract settlement prices,
excluding weekends, during the month of production, adjusted for quality, transportation,
American Petroleum Institute (“API”) gravity, and location differentials. When we refer to realized
oil, gas, and NGL prices below, the disclosed price represents the average price for the
respective period, before the effects of derivative settlements, unless otherwise indicated.

million gain on the early settlement of future contracts as a result of divesting our Mid-Continent
assets during the second quarter of 2015, increasing the effect of derivative settlements by
$0.35 per Mcf.
Average OPIS prices per barrel of NGL, historical or strip, are based on a product mix of 37%
Ethane, 32% Propane, 6% Isobutane, 11% Normal Butane, and 14% Natural Gasoline for all
periods presented. This product mix represents the industry standard composite barrel and
does not necessarily represent our product mix for NGL production. Realized prices reflect our
actual product mix.
While quoted NYMEX oil and gas and OPIS NGL prices are generally used as a basis for
comparison within our industry, the prices we receive are affected by quality, energy content,
location, and transportation differentials for these products.
We expect future prices for oil, gas, and NGLs to continue to be volatile.  In addition to supply and
demand fundamentals, as a global commodity, the price of oil is affected by real or perceived
geopolitical risks in all regions of the world as well as the relative strength of the dollar compared
to other currencies.  Due to short-term supply reductions and disruptions, crude oil prices gained
strength during the second quarter of 2016. However, as those temporary disruptions are
rectified, we expect supply to increase back to prior levels while demand for oil and oil products
is expected to continue to slow during the remainder of 2016 and remain the main source of
uncertainty for future prices. Although the United States is now leading production declines,
declines elsewhere in the world are required to balance the market.
Supply for natural gas continued to exceed demand during the second quarter of 2016; however,
demand growth from gas fired power generation and exports exceeded expectations causing an
uplift in prices late in the second quarter of 2016. We expect prices to continue to recover due to
decreased supply from associated oil drilling and ethane recovery, and from continued demand
growth from LNG exports and exports to Mexico. We also expect prices to fluctuate with changes
in demand resulting from the weather.
NGL prices have recovered in recent months due to oil and natural gas price recovery and we
expect continued recovery through 2017 as increased demand from export and petrochemical
markets grow. We expect that world-scale ethane crackers currently under construction will come
online at the end of the year, increasing demand for propane and ethane as feedstock.
As commodity prices have seen some recovery in the second quarter of 2016, the rig count has
slightly increased. Overall, we expect commodity prices to fluctuate but remain near current
levels through the remainder of 2016, and we expect prices to increase in 2017 due to reduction
in supply and demand increases across all commodities.

Derivative Activity
We use financial derivative instruments as part of our financial risk management program. We
have a financial risk management policy governing our use of derivatives.  The amount of our
production covered by derivatives is driven by the amount of debt on our balance sheet, the level
of capital commitments and long-term obligations we have in place, and our ability to enter into
favorable derivative commodity contracts.  With our current derivative contracts, we believe we
have partially reduced our exposure to volatility in commodity prices in the near term. Our use of
costless collars for a portion of our derivatives allows us to participate in some of the upward
movements in oil and gas prices while also setting a price floor for a portion of our production.
Please refer to Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part I, Item 1 of this report and the
caption titled Commodity Price Risk in Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources below for
additional information regarding our oil, gas, and NGL derivatives.
Second Quarter 2016 Highlights and Outlook for the Remainder of 2016
Operational Activities. Our goal during 2016 is to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve
liquidity in the current commodity price environment while improving our portfolio and holding our
quality acreage positions. We expect to incur capital expenditures below adjusted EBITDAX in
order to minimize any impact to our total debt. We believe this focus on our liquidity will best
preserve our balance sheet and will give us the flexibility to adapt as industry conditions change.
We expect our capital program for 2016 to be approximately $670 million, of which we plan to
invest approximately 85 percent in drilling and completion activities with the focus on our core
development programs in the Bakken/Three Forks, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford shale. Our
capital expenditure guidance was reduced from the approximate $705 million previously
announced, as lower drilling and completion costs and realized efficiencies have contributed to
overall capital cost savings. We plan to continue our focus on conducting safe operations even
as we pursue cost saving measures throughout our business.
In our operated Eagle Ford shale program, we began the second quarter of 2016 with one active,
operated drilling rig. We expect to drop this rig during the third quarter of 2016, and plan to utilize
one frac crew through the third quarter of 2016. In 2016, our capital is primarily being spent on
wells that were drilled but uncompleted at year-end 2015 and to meet lease obligations. As of
June 30, 2016, in our operated Eagle Ford program, we had drilled but not completed 78 gross
and net wells. We drilled 13 gross and net wells during the first half of 2016.
In our outside-operated Eagle Ford shale program, the operator has further slowed its pace of
development in 2016. We do not expect any additional drilling or completion activity in 2016.
In our Bakken/Three Forks program, we began the second quarter of 2016 with two active,
operated drilling rigs. We dropped one drilling rig during the second quarter of 2016, and expect
to run the remaining drilling rig for the remainder of 2016. As of June 30, 2016, in our operated
Bakken/Three Forks program, we had drilled but not completed 40 gross wells (35 net). We
drilled 15 gross wells (13 net) during the first half of 2016.
In our Permian Basin development program, we began the second quarter of 2016 with one
operated drilling rig and increased to two drilling rigs during the second quarter of 2016. We are
focused on developing the Wolfcamp and Spraberry shale intervals on our Sweetie Peck
property in Upton County, Texas. As of June 30, 2016, in our Permian program, we had drilled
but not completed eight gross and net wells. We drilled 11 gross and net wells during the first half
of 2016.
We have curtailed activity in our delineation and exploration programs to focus our capital
spending on our highest return development programs and to meet acreage-holding
commitments in our core plays. We dropped our last operated drilling rig in our Powder River
Basin program during the first quarter of 2016.
26
We will continue to evaluate our drilling and completion activities throughout the remainder of
2016 as we respond to commodity price changes and costs. Please refer to Overview of Liquidity
and Capital Resources below for additional discussion concerning how we intend to fund the
remainder of our 2016 capital program.

Production decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same
periods in 2015, driven by the divestiture of properties in our Mid-Continent region in the second
quarter of 2015, as well as a reduction in our drilling and completion activity. The table below
provides a summary of wells completed in our operated programs during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016.

(2) Derivative settlements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015,
respectively, are included within the derivative (gain) loss line item in the accompanying
statements of operations. Natural gas derivative settlements for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, include a $15.3 million gain on the early settlement of future contracts as a result
of divesting our Mid-Continent assets during the second quarter of 2015. This settlement gain
increased our derivative settlement gain by $0.93 and $0.46 per BOE for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
We present per BOE information because we use this information to evaluate our performance
relative to our peers and to identify and measure trends we believe may require additional
analysis. Average daily production for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, decreased
13 percent and 17 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2015. The
decreases were due to the sale of our Mid-Continent assets during the second quarter of 2015,
which produced 7.4 MBOE per day and 9.3 MBOE per day during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and due to our reduced drilling and completion activity
throughout 2015 and 2016. Overall, we expect our production to be relatively flat quarter-over-
quarter for the remainder of 2016, resulting in an overall decrease in production for the full-year
2016 compared to the full-year 2015. Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and
Trends Between the Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 below for
additional discussion.
Changes in production volumes, revenues, and costs reflect the highly volatile nature of our
industry. Our realized prices on a per BOE basis for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, decreased 24 percent and 28 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015,
as a result of lower commodity prices.
Lease operating expense (“LOE”) on a per BOE basis remained relatively flat for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. Our LOE is comprised
of recurring LOE and workover expense. We experience volatility in our LOE as a result of the
impact industry activity has on service provider costs and seasonality in workover expense. For
full-year 2016, we expect LOE on a per BOE basis to be slightly lower than full-year 2015 as a
result of lower service provider costs.
Transportation expense on a per BOE basis slightly increased for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, due to selling our Mid-Continent
assets during the second quarter of 2015, which resulted in our higher cost Eagle Ford shale
assets becoming a larger portion of our total production. As a result of this divestiture, we expect
the change in our production mix to result in slightly higher transportation costs on a per BOE
basis when comparing full-year 2016 to full-year 2015.
Production taxes on a per BOE basis decreased 33 percent and 36 percent for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 in line with the
decrease in production revenues. Our production tax rate for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, was 4.6 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, compared to 5.2 percent and 5.0
percent, respectively, for the same periods in 2015. This decrease in our company-wide
production tax rate is primarily a result of divesting our Mid-Continent properties in the second
quarter of 2015. We generally expect absolute production tax expense to trend with oil, gas, and
NGL production revenue. Product mix, the location of production, and incentives to encourage oil
and gas development can also impact or change the amount of production tax we recognize.
Ad valorem tax expense on a per BOE basis decreased 24 percent and 41 percent for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The
decrease in ad valorem tax expense on a per BOE basis is primarily due to the lower valuation of
properties subject to ad valorem taxes in 2016 as a result of declining commodity prices. We
expect ad valorem tax expense to fluctuate throughout the year on an absolute and on a per BOE
basis as valuations and county tax rates are finalized.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense on a per BOE basis decreased 24 percent and 16
percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2015, as our absolute G&A expense decreased at a faster rate than the decrease in
production volumes. Absolute G&A expense decreased for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to lower headcount in 2016 than
in 2015, and due to the exit and disposal costs incurred during the second quarter of 2015
relating to the closure of our Tulsa, Oklahoma office. Overall, we expect G&A expense on a per
BOE basis to be lower for the full-year 2016 compared to the full-year 2015 due to lower
headcount and exit and disposal costs incurred during 2015.
31
Depletion, depreciation, amortization, and asset retirement obligation liability accretion (“DD&A”)
expense on a per BOE basis increased 11 percent and 17 percent for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. Our DD&A rate can fluctuate as a
result of impairments, planned and closed divestitures, and changes in the mix of our production
and the underlying proved reserve volumes. The decrease in commodity prices has resulted in a
decrease in proved reserve volumes and consequently an increased DD&A rate in 2016
compared to 2015. However, the marketing of certain non-core assets in each of our operating
regions caused a reduction in our DD&A expense on a per BOE basis in the second quarter of
2016, as these assets were held for sale with no DD&A expense recorded for these assets for the
three months ended June 30, 2016. Changes in commodity prices impact our proved reserve
volumes, and consequently, we would expect a decrease in commodity prices to increase our
DD&A rate and an increase in commodity prices to lower our DD&A rate. For the remainder of
2016, we expect DD&A expense on a per BOE basis to be in line with our second quarter rate or
slightly higher upon the closure of divestitures of the properties held for sale at June 30, 2016.
Please refer to Comparison of Financial Results and Trends Between the Three Months and Six
Months Ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 below for additional discussion on operating expenses.
Please refer to Note 9 - Earnings Per Share in Part I, Item 1 of this report for discussion on the
types of shares included in our basic and diluted net loss per common share calculations. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, we recorded losses from continuing
operations and all potentially dilutive shares were anti-dilutive and excluded from the calculation
of diluted net loss per common share.

The net gain on divestiture activity recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2016, is
primarily due to an increase in estimated selling prices, as evidenced by recent bid prices
received from third parties, on certain previously impaired assets held for sale. The net gain on
divestiture activity recorded for the same period in 2015 is related to the gain on the sale of our
Mid-Continent assets, partially offset by the write-down to fair value less costs to sell on certain
assets held for sale as of June 30, 2015.
The net loss on divestiture activity recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2016, is primarily
due to the $68.3 million write-down to fair value less estimated costs to sell on certain assets
held for sale during the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by a subsequent write-up recorded on
certain assets held for sale during the second quarter of 2016 as discussed above. The net gain
recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2015, was due to the gain recorded on the sale of our
Mid-Continent assets in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by the write-down to fair value
less costs to sell on certain assets held for sale in both the first and second quarters of 2015.
Please refer to Note 3 – Assets Held for Sale and Divestitures in Part I, Item 1 of this report for

The decrease in other operating revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,

the second quarter of 2015, which eliminated all marketed gas volumes and thus all marketed
gas system revenues.

Exploration expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, decreased 48 percent
and 55 percent, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to exploratory
dry holes being expensed in the first and second quarters of 2015 and reduced overhead costs
due to decreased headcount. An exploratory project resulting in non-commercial quantities of oil,
gas, or NGLs is deemed an exploratory dry hole and impacts the amount of exploration expense
we record. As a result of the current commodity price environment, we have reduced exploration
activity and expect our exploratory dry hole, geological and geophysical, overhead and other
exploration expenses to be lower in 2016 than in 2015.

During the first quarter of 2016, we impaired proved properties, primarily in our outside-operated
Eagle Ford shale program, as a result of continued commodity price declines. Additionally, we
allowed certain leases to expire and impaired unproved properties we no longer intended to
develop.
Proved and unproved property impairments recorded for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, were due to commodity price declines, our decision to reduce capital invested in
the development of certain prospects in our South Texas & Gulf Coast and Permian regions, and
acreage we no longer intended to develop.
We expect proved property impairments to be more likely to occur in periods of declining
commodity prices, and unproved property impairments to fluctuate with the timing of lease
expirations, unsuccessful exploration activities, and changing economics associated with volatile
commodity prices. Any amount of future impairment is difficult to predict, but based on updated
commodity price assumptions as of July 27, 2016, we do not expect any material impairments in
the third quarter of 2016 due to commodity price impacts. If commodity prices decline, downward
revisions of proved reserves may be significant and could result in impairments in future periods.
In addition to future commodity price declines, changes in drilling plans, downward engineering
revisions, or unsuccessful exploration efforts may result in proved and unproved property
impairments.

G&A expense decreased 34 percent and 30 percent for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to
lower headcount in 2016 than in 2015, and exit and disposal costs of $5.0 million and $8.5
million incurred for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, relating to the
closure of our Tulsa, Oklahoma office.

ended June 30, 2016, is a result of the increase in commodity prices during the second quarter of
2016 driving an increase in the corresponding liability as of June 30, 2016. The non-cash benefit
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, resulted from cash payments made or accrued
under the Net Profits Plan upon the divestiture of properties subject to the Net Profits Plan and
the decline in commodity prices during the first half of 2015. We generally expect changes in our
Net Profits Plan liability to correlate with fluctuations in commodity prices. Divestitures of
properties subject to the Net Profits Plan also result in changes to the Net Profits Plan liability.

ended June 30, 2016, in the fair value of contracts settling subsequent to June 30, 2016. We
recognized a $15.8 million gain on first quarter 2016 settlements, partially offset by a $1.6 million
mark-to-market loss recorded on remaining contracts as of March 31, 2016.
We recognized a derivative loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Contracts settled
during the three months ended June 30, 2015, had a fair value of $133.1 million at March 31,
2015, and settled for $112.8 million, which resulted in a $20.3 million loss during the second
quarter of 2015. Included in these settlements was a $15.3 million gain on the early settlement of
future contracts resulting from the divestiture of our Mid-Continent assets during the second
quarter of 2015. Additionally, we recorded a $60.6 million decrease during the three months
ended June 30, 2015, in the fair value of contracts settling subsequent to June 30, 2015. We
recognized a $13.5 million gain on first quarter 2015 settlements and a $140.7 million mark-to-

compares to drilling rig termination and standby fees of $2.7 million and $5.9 million recorded for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Additionally, we recorded $4.7
million related to estimated claims for payment of royalties on certain Federal and Indian leases
during the three months ended June 30, 2015. These estimated claims were slightly reduced
during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Please refer to Note 6 - Commitments and
Contingencies in Part I, Item I of this report for additional information. The remaining decrease is
largely due to the sale of our Mid-Continent gas assets in the second quarter of 2015, which
eliminated all marketed gas volumes and all marketed gas system expenses.

of an R&D credit claim in the first quarter of 2015 and enacted state rate changes in Texas and
North Dakota in the second quarter of 2015. Please refer to Note 4 - Income Taxes in Part I, Item
1 of this report for additional discussion.
Overview of Liquidity and Capital Resources
Based on the current commodity price environment, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and
capital resources to execute our business plan for the foreseeable future. We continue to manage
the duration and level of our drilling and completion service commitments to maintain the
flexibility to adjust our activity and capital expenditures in periods of prolonged weak commodity
prices or to respond should commodity prices recover.
Sources of Cash
We currently expect our 2016 capital program to be primarily funded by cash flows from
operations, with any remaining cash needs to be funded by borrowings under our credit facility
and proceeds received from the divestiture of properties. See Credit Facility below for a
discussion of our most recent borrowing base redetermination. Although we anticipate cash flows
from these sources will be sufficient to fund our expected 2016 capital program, we may also
elect to access the capital markets, depending on prevailing market conditions. From time to
time, we may enter into carrying cost funding and sharing arrangements with third parties for
particular exploration and/or development programs. During the first quarter of 2016, our credit
ratings were downgraded by two major rating agencies. These downgrades and any future
downgrades may make it more difficult or expensive for us to borrow additional funds. All of our
sources of liquidity can be impacted by the general condition of the broader economy and by
fluctuations in commodity prices, operating costs, and volumes produced, all of which affect us
and our industry. We have no control over the market prices for oil, gas, or NGLs, although we
may be able to influence the amount of our realized revenues from our oil, gas, and NGL sales
through the use of derivative contracts as part of our commodity price risk management program.
During the first half of 2016, cash received from the settlement of commodity derivative contracts
provided a significant positive source of cash, which is reflected in net cash provided by
operating activities in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The
fair
37
value of our commodity derivative contracts was a net asset of $90.5 million at June 30, 2016, of
which $62.2 million relates to contracts expected to settle in the second half of 2016. As our
derivative contracts settle in future periods, and if commodity prices remain at current levels or
decline further, our future cash flows from operations will be negatively impacted. Please refer to
Note 10 – Derivative Financial Instruments in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information
about our oil, gas, and NGL derivative contracts currently in place and the timing of settlement of
those contracts. Decreases in commodity prices have limited our industry’s access to capital
markets. Our credit facility borrowing base could be further reduced as a result of lower
commodity prices, divestitures of proved properties, or newly issued debt.
Proposals to reform the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which include eliminating
or reducing current tax deductions for intangible drilling costs, depreciation of equipment
acquisition costs, the domestic production activities deduction, percentage depletion, and other
deductions that reduce our taxable income, continue to circulate. We expect that future legislation
modifying or eliminating these deductions would reduce net operating cash flows over time,
thereby reducing funding available for our exploration and development capital programs, as well
as funding available to our peers in the industry for similar programs. If enacted, these reductions
in available deductions could have a significant adverse effect on drilling in the United States for
a number of years.
Credit Facility
Our Amended Credit Agreement provides for a maximum loan amount of $2.5 billion and a
maturity date of December 10, 2019. Pursuant to the most recent amendment, and as part of our
regular semi-annual redetermination, our borrowing base and the current aggregate lender
commitments were both reduced to $1.25 billion during the second quarter of 2016. This
expected reduction was primarily a result of the decrease in our proved reserves as of December
31, 2015, resulting from the continued decline in commodity prices. We do not expect to be
negatively impacted by the reduction in our borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments,
as we currently plan to spend within adjusted EBITDAX during 2016 and believe the revised
amounts will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity and operating needs. No individual
bank that is a party to our Amended Credit Agreement represents more than 10 percent of the
lender commitments. Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this report for
additional discussion as well as the presentation of the outstanding balance, total amount of
letters of credit outstanding, and available borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit
Agreement as of July 27, 2016, and June 30, 2016, and Credit Agreement as of December 31,
2015.
We must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the terms of the
Amended Credit Agreement, including covenants limiting dividend payments and requiring us to
maintain certain financial ratios, as defined by the Amended Credit Agreement. As of June 30,
2016, financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement require, as of the last day of
each of our fiscal quarters, our (a) ratio of senior secured debt to 12-month trailing adjusted
EBITDAX to be not more than 2.75 to 1.0; (b) adjusted current ratio to be not less than 1.0 to 1.0;
and (c) ratio of 12-month trailing adjusted EBITDAX to interest expense to be not less than 2.0 to
1.0. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the Amended
Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016, and through the filing date of this report. Please refer to
the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX, and
a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDAX to net loss and to net cash provided by operating activities.
  
Our daily weighted-average credit facility debt balance was approximately $312.1 million and
$282.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Our daily
weighted-average credit facility debt balance was approximately $330.0 million and $321.8
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Cash flows provided by
our operating activities, proceeds received from divestitures of properties, capital markets
activities, and the amount of our capital expenditures all impact the amount we have borrowed
under our credit facility.
Weighted-Average Interest Rates
Our weighted-average interest rates include paid and accrued interest, fees on the unused
portion of the credit facility’s aggregate commitment amount, letter of credit fees, and the non-
cash amortization of deferred financing costs. Our weighted-average borrowing rates include
paid and accrued interest only.

Our weighted-average interest rates and weighted-average borrowing rates in 2016 and 2015
have been impacted by the timing of Senior Notes issuances and redemption, the average
balance on our revolving credit facility, and the fees paid on the unused portion of our aggregate
commitment. The rates disclosed in the above table for the six months ended June 30, 2016, do
not reflect the approximate $16.4 million associated with the discount realized upon repurchase
of certain of our Senior Notes during the first quarter of 2016, or the approximate $700,000
related to the acceleration of unamortized deferred financing costs expensed upon repurchase.
Please refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional discussion.
The rates disclosed in the above table for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, do not
reflect the approximate $12.5 million premium paid for the tender offer and redemption of the
2019 Notes or the approximate $4.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs expensed
upon extinguishment of these notes.
Uses of Cash
 
We use cash for the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties and for
the payment of operating and G&A costs, income taxes, dividends, and debt obligations,
including interest. Expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas
properties are the primary use of our capital resources. In the first half of 2016, we spent $363.3
million in capital expenditures and in acquiring proved and unproved oil and gas properties. This
amount differs from the costs incurred amount, which is accrual-based and includes asset
retirement obligation, geological and geophysical expenses, and exploration overhead amounts.
The amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors,
including the number and size of acquisition opportunities, our cash flows from operating,
investing, and financing activities, and our ability to assimilate acquisitions and execute our
drilling program. In addition, the impact of oil, gas, and NGL prices on investment opportunities,
the availability of capital, and the timing and results of our operated and outside-operated
exploration and development activities may lead to changes in funding requirements for future
development. We periodically review our capital expenditure budget to assess changes in
current and projected cash flows, acquisition and divestiture activities, debt requirements, and
other factors.
We may from time to time repurchase certain amounts of our outstanding debt securities for cash
and/or through exchanges for other securities. Such repurchases or exchanges may be made in
open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Any such repurchases
or exchanges will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions including covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement, compliance with securities
laws, and other factors. The amounts involved in any such transaction may be material. During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased a portion of our 6.50% Senior Notes due
2021, 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022, and 6.50% Senior Notes due 2023, in open market
transactions, at a discount, resulting in a $15.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt. Please
refer to Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional discussion.
As of the filing date of this report, we could repurchase up to 3,072,184 shares of our common
stock under our stock repurchase program, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, or in privately negotiated

Analysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016, and 2015
The following tables present changes in cash flows between the six months ended June 30,
2016, and 2015, for our operating, investing, and financing activities. The analysis following each
table should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in
Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Cash received from oil, gas, and NGL production revenues, net of transportation costs and
production taxes, including derivative cash settlements, decreased $393.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, as a result of the decline in
both production volumes and realized commodity prices. Cash paid for LOE, excluding ad
valorem tax expense, decreased $29.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in production volumes and lower
service provider costs. Additionally, during the six months ended June 30, 2015, we paid $12.5
million associated with the premium for the tender offer and redemption of the 6.625% Senior
Notes due 2019.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period in 2015. Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30,
2016, decreased $628.6 million, or 65 percent, compared to the same period in 2015. Drilling,
completion, and facilities capital expenditures decreased approximately 55 percent for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, as a result of a reduced
operated rig count, fewer well completions, and lower service provider costs. Additionally, we
paid a significant amount of year-end 2014 accrued payables during the first half of 2015. We
acquired $17.8 million of primarily unproved properties in the Midland Basin during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $6.6 million of proved and unproved property
acquisitions in our Gooseneck prospect area in the same period in 2015. Net proceeds from the
sale of oil and gas properties decreased $322.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the divestiture of our Mid-Continent assets
during the second quarter of 2015.

We paid $29.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, for the repurchase of a portion of
the principal amount of our 6.50% Senior Notes due 2021, 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022, and
6.50% Senior Notes due 2023. We received $491.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of
our 2025 Notes in the second quarter of 2015. These proceeds were primarily used for the tender
and redemption of the principal amount of $350.0 million of our 2019 Notes. Please refer to Note
5 - Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional discussion. We had net
borrowings under our credit facility of $128.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to repayments of $44.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
40
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rate on our revolving credit facility. Our
Amended Credit Agreement allows us to fix the interest rate for all or a portion of the principal
balance of our revolving credit facility for a period up to six months. To the extent that the interest
rate is fixed, interest rate changes will affect the credit facility’s fair market value, but will not
impact results of operations or cash flows. Conversely, for the portion of the credit facility that has
a floating interest rate, interest rate changes will not affect the fair market value, but will impact
future results of operations and cash flows. Changes in interest rates do not impact the amount of
interest we pay on our fixed-rate Senior Notes, but can impact their fair market values. As of
June 30, 2016, our fixed-rate debt and floating-rate debt outstanding totaled $2.3 billion and
$330.5 million, respectively. The carrying amount of our floating rate debt at June 30, 2016,
approximated its fair value. Assuming a constant floating-rate debt level of $330.5 million, the
before-tax cash flow impact resulting from a 100 basis point change would be $3.3 million over a
12-month period. Please refer to Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements in Part I, Item 1 of this report
for additional discussion on the fair value of our Senior Notes.
    
Commodity Price Risk
    
The prices we receive for our oil, gas, and NGL production directly impact our revenue, overall
profitability, access to capital, and future rate of growth. Oil, gas, and NGL prices are subject to
wide fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand and other factors. The markets
for oil, gas, and NGLs have been volatile, especially over the last year, and these markets will
likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production depend on
numerous factors beyond our control. Based on our production for the six months ended June 30,
2016, a 10 percent decrease in our average realized oil, gas, and NGL prices, before the effects
of derivative settlements, would have reduced our oil, gas, and NGL production revenues by
approximately $26.7 million, $13.6 million, and $9.9 million, respectively.
We enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in
commodity prices. Based on our derivative contracts in place for the six months ended June 30,
2016, a 10 percent decrease in the contract settlement prices, would have increased our oil, gas,
and NGL derivative settlement gain by approximately $14.2 million, $8.7 million, and $6.9 million,
respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred
to as structured finance or special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes.
We evaluate our transactions to determine if any variable interest entities exist. If we determine
that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, that entity is consolidated into our
consolidated financial statements. We have not been involved in any unconsolidated SPE
transactions in 2016.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Please refer to the corresponding section in Part II, Item 7 and to Note 1 - Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies included in Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K for discussion of our
accounting policies and estimates.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Please refer to Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies, and Recently
Issued Accounting Standards under Part I, Item 1 of this report for new accounting matters.
41
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDAX represents net income (loss) before interest expense, other non-operating
income or expense, income taxes, depletion, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense,
exploration expense, impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, derivative
gains and losses net of settlements, change in the Net Profits Plan liability, and gains and losses
on divestitures. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes certain items that we believe affect the
comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are generally one-time in nature or
whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-
GAAP measure that we present because we believe it provides useful additional information to
investors and analysts, as a performance measure, for analysis of our ability to internally
generate funds for exploration, development, acquisitions, and to service debt. We are also
subject to financial covenants under our Amended Credit Agreement based on adjusted
EBITDAX ratios as further described in Note 5 - Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In
addition, adjusted EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the
valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas
exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry
research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash
provided by operating activities, or profitability or liquidity measures prepared under GAAP.
Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net income (loss) and
may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be comparable
to similar metrics of other companies. Our credit facility provides a material source of liquidity for
us. Under the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement, if we fail to comply with the covenants
that establish a maximum permitted ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDAX and a
minimum permitted ratio of interest to adjusted EBITDAX, we will be in default, an event that
would prevent us from borrowing under our credit facility and would therefore materially limit our
sources of liquidity.  In addition, if we default under our credit facility and are unable to obtain a
waiver of that default from our lenders, lenders under that facility and under the indentures
governing our outstanding Senior Notes would be entitled to exercise all of their remedies for a
default.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, that result in substantial
costs and other risks;

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The information required by this item is provided under Interest Rate Risk and Commodity Price
Risk in Item 2 above and is incorporated herein by reference. Please also refer to the information
under Interest Rate Risk and Commodity Price Risk in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2015 Form 10-K.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to reasonably
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to
reasonably ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) (“Disclosure Controls”) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the
control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and make modifications as necessary; our
intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls will be modified as systems change and
conditions warrant.
 
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was
performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our Disclosure Controls were effective at a
reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes during the second quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

All shares purchased in the second quarter of 2016 offset tax withholding obligations that
occurred upon the delivery of outstanding shares underlying RSUs and PSUs delivered under
the terms of grants under our Equity Incentive Compensation Plan.
In July 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares that may be
repurchased under the original August 1998 authorization to up to 6,000,000 shares as of the
effective date of the resolution. Accordingly, as of the date of this filing, we may repurchase up
to 3,072,184 shares of common stock on a prospective basis, subject to the approval of our
Board of Directors. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market
transactions or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other
factors, including certain provisions of our Amended Credit Agreement, the indentures
governing our Senior Notes and compliance with securities laws. Stock repurchases may be
funded with existing cash balances, internal cash flow, or borrowings under our credit facility.
The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Our payment of cash dividends to our stockholders is subject to covenants under the terms of our
Amended Credit Agreement that limit our annual dividend payments to no more than $50.0
million per year. We are also subject to certain covenants under the indentures governing our
Senior Notes that restrict certain payments, including dividends; provided, however, that the first
$6.5 million of dividends paid each year are not restricted by these covenants. We do not
anticipate that these restrictions will limit our payment of dividends at our current rate for the
foreseeable future if any dividends are declared by our Board of Directors.
