Dala Petroleum Corp.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(unaudited)
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION
Dala  Petroleum  Corp.  (the  “Company,”  “we,”  “our,”  or  “Dala”),  formerly  known  as  “Westcott  Products
Corporation,” was incorporated as “Light Tech, Inc.” under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 24,
1984. A subsidiary in the name “Westcott Products Corporation” was organized by us under the laws of
the State of Delaware on June 24, 1986, for the purpose of changing our name and domicile to the State of
Delaware. On June 27, 1986, we merged with the Delaware subsidiary, with the survivor being Westcott
Products Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
NOTE 2 – TRANSACTIONS
June 2014 Merger
On June 2, 2014, the Company, its newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, Dala Acquisition Corp., a
Nevada  corporation  (“Merger  Subsidiary”),  and  Dala  Petroleum  Corp.,  a  Nevada  corporation  (“Dala”),
executed  and  delivered  an  Agreement  and  Plan  of  Merger  (the  “Merger  Agreement”),  whereby  Merger
Subsidiary  merged  with  and  into  Dala,  and  Dala  was  the  surviving  company  under  the  merger  and
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of then-named Westcott (the “Merger”) on the closing of the Merger. As
a result of the Merger, Westcott issued 10,000,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of Dala, which was distributed to Dala Petroleum’s sole shareholder
and was then distributed on a pro rata basis to its members.
As  a  condition  precedent  to  the  Merger,  Westcott  raised  $2,025,000  from  persons  who  are  “accredited
investors” in consideration of the sale of 2,025 shares of its Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock and
2,893,725 warrants at the offering price of $1,000 per unit.  Each $1,000 unit consisted of (i) one share of
Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock that is convertible at any time at the option of the Holder into
common  stock  at  the  conversion  price  of  $0.70  per  common  share  based  on  the  total  dollar  amount
invested and (ii) 1,429 warrants (issued for each Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock sold in each
unit) to purchase common shares of the Company at an exercise price of $1.35 with a life of three years as
of  the  “Effective  Date”  defined  as  the  earliest  date  of  the  following  to  occur:  (a)  the  initial  registration
statement required by the Offering Documents has been declared effective by the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), (b) all of the underlying shares have been sold pursuant to SEC
Rule 144 or may be sold pursuant to SEC Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in
compliance  with  the  current  public  information  required  under  SEC  Rule  144  and  without  volume  or
manner-of-sale restrictions or (c) following the one year anniversary of June 3, 2014.
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization of Dala.
Dala  possesses  rights  to  engage  in  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  and  development  in  north  central
Kansas, with total acreage of approximately 25,000 acres (the “Property”).  Since the time of the Merger,
Dala  is  operating  as  an  early-stage  oil  exploration  company  focused  on  the  Property,  which  has  oil
potential  at  depths  of  less  than  6,000  feet.  Since  May  2015,  Dala  has  temporarily  suspended  its
exploration program due to the decline in the price of oil and difficult market conditions.
May 2016 Transaction
The Company entered into a Partial Cancellation Agreement (the “PCA”) by and among its subsidiary,
Dala Petroleum Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Dala NV”), Chisholm Partners II, LLC, a Louisiana limited
liability company (“Chisholm II”), and certain members of Chisholm II (the “Chisholm Members”) through
which  Chisholm  II  (after  receiving  shares  from  certain  of  its  Chisholm  Members)  returned  a  total  of
8,567,800 shares of the Company common stock to the Company’s treasury for cancellation.  In exchange
for  the  return  of  these  shares  for  cancellation,  the  Company  assigned  55,000  acres  of  the  Company’s
property rights (approximately 68.75% of its total holdings) to Chisholm II.
Pursuant  to  terms  of  the  PCA,  on  May  26,  2016,  the  8,567,800  shares  of  common  stock  delivered  by
Chisholm II were cancelled on the books and records of the Company. Prior to that, Company delivered
55,000 acres of its leased property to Chisholm II.
On May 16, 2016, as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company as part of the settlement with the
Preferred Shareholders, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of the
Company’s Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock (the “COD”), which (i) changed the conversion price
of  the  preferred  stock  from  $0.70  per  share  to  $0.05  per  share,  and  (ii)  eliminated  Section  7  “Certain
Adjustments” of the COD.

On  May  16,  2016,  the  Company  filed  an  Amended  and  Restated  Certificate  of  Designation  of  the
Company’s Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock (the “COD”), which (i) changed the conversion price
of  the  preferred  stock  from  $0.70  per  share  to  $0.05  per  share,  and  (ii)  eliminated  Section  7  “Certain
Adjustments” of the COD.
Pursuant to terms of the PCA, on July 28, 2016, the 1,030,000 shares of common stock delivered after the
initial closing by Baldo Sanso (360,000 shares of common stock), Robert Sali (610,000 shares of common
stock) and Chris Dabbs (60,000 shares of common stock), were cancelled on the books and records of the
Company. The reduction was offset to additional paid-in capital.  See Note 14.
NOTE 3 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The  accompanying  unaudited  financial  statements  of  Dala  Petroleum,  Inc.  have  been  prepared  in
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for  interim  financial  information  and  the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. The results of operations for the interim period
ended June 30, 2016 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the
full fiscal year ending September 30, 2016. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the information
contained herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair
presentation  of  the  Company’s  results  of  operations,  financial  position  and  cash  flows.  The  unaudited
interim  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  audited  financial  statements  in  the
Company’s  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2015  filed  on  January  13,  2016  and
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Use of Estimates
The timely preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenue  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Accounting for Derivatives
The  Company  evaluates  its  convertible  debt,  options,  warrants  or  other  contracts  to  determine  if  those
contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted
for.  The  result  of  this  accounting  treatment  is  that  under  certain  circumstances  the  fair  value  of  the
derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair
value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other
income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to
fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that
are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under this accounting standard are
reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  ASC  360-10,  “Accounting  for  the  Impairment  or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets”.
This  statement  requires  that  long-lived  assets  and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  be  reviewed  for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount
by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
The  Company  measures  its  financial  assets  and  liabilities  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, accrued
expenses, deposits received from customers for layaway sales and short term loans the carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

We follow accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. This standard defines
fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does
not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to
share-based  payments.  This  guidance  discusses  valuation  techniques,  such  as  the  market  approach
(comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the
cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates
and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.
Unproved oil and natural gas properties are accounted for and measured under Regulation S-X, Rule 4-
10.
We currently measure and report at fair value other intangible assets (due to our impairment analysis) and
derivative liabilities using ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement.  The fair value of intangible assets has
been  determined  using  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows  method.    The  fair  value  of
derivative  liabilities  is  measured  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  method.    The  following  tables
summarizes our non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June
30, 2016 and 2015:

The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations whereby all
costs related to the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are initially capitalized
into a single cost center (“full cost pool”). Such costs include land acquisition costs, a portion of employee
salaries related to property development, geological and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on non-
producing  properties,  costs  of  drilling  directly  related  to  acquisition,  and  exploration  activities.  Internal
salaries  are  capitalized  based  on  employee  time  allocated  to  the  acquisition  of  leaseholds  and
development  of  oil  and  natural  gas  properties.  The  Company  did  not  capitalize  interest  for  the  period
ended June 30, 2016 as it was not required.
Proceeds  from  property  sales  will  generally  be  credited  to  the  full  cost  pool,  with  no  gain  or  loss
recognized, unless such a sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the
proved reserves attributable to these costs.
The  Company  assesses  all  items  classified  as  unproved  property  on  a  quarterly  basis  for  possible
impairment or reduction in value. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among
others: intent to drill, remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results and
activity, the assignment of proved reserves, and the economic viability of development if proved reserves
are  assigned.  During  any  period  in  which  these  factors  indicate  an  impairment,  the  cumulative  drilling
costs  incurred  to  date  for  such  property  and  all  or  a  portion  of  the  associated  leasehold  costs  are
transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and amortization.  The costs of drilling
exploratory dry holes are included in the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is
dry.
Capitalized costs associated with impaired properties and properties having proven reserves, estimated
future  development  costs,  and  asset  retirement  costs  under  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 410-20-25 are depleted and amortized on the unit-of-
production method based on the estimated gross proved reserves.  The costs of unproved properties are
withheld from the depletion base until such time as they are developed, impaired, or abandoned.
Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated
depletion,  net  of  deferred  income  taxes,  may  not  exceed  a  ceiling  amount  equal  to  the  present  value,
discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the cost
of unproved properties not subject to amortization (without regard to estimates of fair value), or estimated
fair value, if lower, of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. Should capitalized costs exceed
this  ceiling,  which  is  tested  on  a  quarterly  basis,  an  impairment  is  recognized.  The  present  value  of
estimated future net revenues is computed by applying prices based on a 12-month unweighted average
of the oil and natural gas prices in effect on the first day of each month, less estimated future expenditures
to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves (assuming the continuation of existing
economic conditions), less any applicable future taxes.  If such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, the
Company will record a write-down to the extent of such excess as a non-cash charge to earnings.  Any
such  write-down  will  reduce  earnings  in  the  period  of  occurrence  and  result  in  a  lower  depreciation,
depletion and amortization rate in future periods.  A write-down may not be reversed in future periods even
though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling.
In April, 2015, the Company participated in the completion of a well in which the Company owns a 10%
non-operated  working  interest  targeting  the  Simpson  and  Viola  formations,  Kansas.  That  well  was
determined to be dry in June 2015.
During  the  nine  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  incurred  total  $0  in  oil  and  natural  gas
expenditures.
As of September 30, 2015, the Company’s oil and natural gas properties were determined to be impaired
thereby reducing the unproved oil and natural gas properties to $608,000.  No additional impairment was
realized for the nine months ended June 30, 2016.

On May 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Partial Cancellation Agreement (the “PCA”) by and among
its subsidiary, Dala Petroleum Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Dala NV”), Chisholm II, and certain members
of Chisholm II (the “Chisholm Members”) through which Chisholm II (after receiving shares from certain of
Chisholm  Members)  returned  a  total  of  8,567,800  shares  of  the  Company’s  common  stock  to  the
Company’s  treasury  for  cancellation.    In  exchange  for  the  return  of  these  shares  for  cancellation,  the
Company returned 55,000 acres of the Company’s property rights, held in the form of oil and gas leases
from Chisholm II (approximately 68.75% of its total holdings), to Chisholm II.
Revenue Recognition
The  Company  recognizes  oil  and  natural  gas  revenues  from  our  interests  in  producing  wells  when
production is delivered to, and title has transferred to, the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is
reasonably determinable.
The Company uses the sales method of accounting for balancing of natural gas production and would
recognize  a  liability  if  the  existing  proven  reserves  were  not  adequate  to  cover  the  current  imbalance
situation. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, no revenue has been recognized as all wells are still
unproved and non-producing.
Asset Retirement Obligation
Asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement,
removal,  site  reclamation  and  similar  activities  associated  with  the  Company's  oil  and  natural  gas
properties. Inherent in the fair value calculation of the ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments
including  the  ultimate  settlement  amounts,  inflation  factors,  credit  adjusted  discount  rates,  timing  of
settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments.   As of June 30,
2016, the Company had no ARO liability as no wells have been established.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC 718 which
requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards.
This  requires  that  such  transactions  be  accounted  for  using  a  fair-value-based  method.  The  Company
recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the
award.
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from
other than employees in accordance with ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the ASC 505-50.
Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair
value  of  the  equity  instruments  issued,  whichever  is  more  reliably  measurable.  The  value  of  equity
instruments  issued  for  consideration  other  than  employee  services  is  determined  on  the  earliest  of  a
performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by
ASC 505-50.
Income Taxes
The Company follows ASC Topic 740 for recording the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or
liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the
changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to
reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in
such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.
Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items
reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as
current  or  non-current,  depending  on  the  classification  of  assets  and  liabilities  to  which  they  relate.
Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified
as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to
reverse.

The Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740
only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. As of June 30, 2016, the Company reviewed its tax
positions  and  determined  there  were  no  outstanding,  or  retroactive  tax  positions  with  less  than  a  50%
likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore this standard has not
had a material effect on the Company.
Net Loss Per Share
The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the loss per share. Basic loss per common share
calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  loss  per  common  share  calculations  are  determined  by
dividing  net  loss  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  and  dilutive  common  share
equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are
not considered in the computation.
Segment Information
In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ASC  280-10,  “Disclosures  about  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and
Related  Information,”  the  Company  is  required  to  report  financial  and  descriptive  information  about  its
reportable  operating  segments.  The  Company  does  not  have  any  operating  segments  as  of  June  30,
2016.
NOTE 4 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (“ASU No. 2014-09”), which
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of
promised  goods  or  services  to  customers.  The  ASU  will  replace  most  existing  revenue  recognition
guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of
either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that
ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company
has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing
financial reporting.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205)
Disclosure  of  Uncertainties  about  an  Entity’s  Ability  to  Continue  as  a  Going  Concern.   The  guidance
requires management to perform an evaluation each annual and interim reporting period of whether there
are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability
to continue as a going concern within the one-year period after the date that the financial statements are
issued.  If  such  conditions  are  identified,  the  guidance  requires  an  entity  to  provide  certain  disclosures
about the principal conditions or events that gave rise to the substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern, management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in
relation  to  the  entity’s  ability  to  meet  its  obligations  and  management’s  plans  to  alleviate  or  mitigate
substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance is effective for the
first annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The Company currently
does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on its financial statements and
does not anticipate early adoption of this pronouncement.

In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Determining
Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to
Debt or Equity.  This update amends existing guidance with the objective to eliminate the use of different
methods in practice with respect to the consideration of redemption features in relation to other features
when determining whether the nature of a host contract is more akin to debt or equity and thereby reduce
existing diversity under GAAP in accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share.
  The  amendments  clarify  how  current  GAAP  should  be  interpreted  in  evaluating  the  economic
characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a
share.  The amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic
characteristics and risks of a host contract, but rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the
economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument.  In addition, the amendments in
this update clarify that, in evaluating the nature of a host contract, an entity should assess the substance of
the relevant terms and features when considering how to weight those terms and features. The guidance
applies to all entities that are issuers of, or investor in, hybrid instruments that are issued in the form of a
share.   The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this update should be applied on a modified
retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning
of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective.  Retrospective application is permitted to all
relevant prior periods.  The updates in this pronouncement are effective for public entities for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company is currently
evaluating the adoption of ASU 2014-16 and the impact of the updates upon the Company.  The Company
plans  on  adopting  the  pronouncement  for  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2015  and  does  not
anticipate early adoption of this pronouncement.
The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them
will have a significant effect on the Company’s financial statement.
NOTE 5 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On June 2, 2014, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its common stock to Chisholm II in exchange
for  oil  and  gas  assets.    Chisholm  II  was  the  sole  stockholder  of  Dala  Petroleum  Corp.  (a  Nevada
corporation) prior to the Merger and now is the Company’s wholly-owned operating subsidiary.
The Company had a service agreement, which has been suspended by the Company since May 2015
and has since been cancelled, with Chisholm II to use its existing technical exploration team for general
and  administrative-type  services  on  behalf  of  the  Company.      The  Company  was  obligated  to  pay
Chisholm II $25,000 per month plus expenses for these services under the Master Services Agreement.
 For the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company paid $225,472 and had accrued $50,000 for its
services prior to suspending the Master Services Agreement.
In June 2014, the Company entered into an Option Participation Agreement with Chisholm II, whereby
Chisholm  II  granted  the  Company  the  option,  at  the  Company’s  own  election,  to  participate  for  up  to
twenty-five percent (25%) of Chisholm II’s share of each drilling operation in search for oil or gas in the
State of Kansas undertaken by Chisholm II.  The Company has not elected to participate in the Option
Participation Agreement since April 2015.
On June 15, 2015, the Company received the funds from a Promissory Note (the “Pacific Note”) in the
amount of $99,999 in favor of Pacific Oil & Gas, LLC (the “Pacific”). The Pacific Note bears an interest rate
of  12%  per  annum  and  all  principal  and  accrued  interest  will  be  due  and  payable  by  the  Company  to
Pacific  on  December  31,  2015.  The  Note  is  secured  by  a  Mortgage,  Deed  of  Trust,  Assignment  of
Production,  Security  Agreement  and  Financing  Statement  that  was  filed  on  June  25,  2015  against  the
Company’s  Evans  9-1  lease  in  McPherson  County,  Kansas.  The  trustee  of  Pacific  is  the  Company’s
director, Clancy Cottman, and the funds delivered to the Company by Pacific were provided by a group of
the Company’s Series A 6% Convertible Preferred shareholders.
On December 22, 2015, the Company entered into four Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) in the total amount
of $20,000 in favor of Chisholm Partners II, LLC, Mill City Ventures III, LLC, Lane Ventures, Inc. and Alpha
Capital Anstalt (the “Lenders”). The Notes all bear an interest rate of 12% per annum and all principal and
accrued interest will be due and payable by the Company to the Lender on December 22, 2016. The Note
is  unsecured.  The  managing  partner  of  Chisholm  Partners  II,  LLC  is  the  Company’s  director,  Clancy
Cottman.    The  other  three  Lenders  are  the  shareholders  in  the  Company’s  Series  A  6%  Convertible

have yet been effected by the Board.
On  March  30,  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Promissory  Note  (the  “Alpha  Note”)  in  the  amount  of
$40,010  in  favor  of  Alpha  Capital  Anstalt  (“Alpha”).  The  Alpha  Note  bears  an  interest  rate  of  12%  per
annum  and  all  principal  and  accrued  interest  will  be  due  and  payable  by  the  Company  to  Alpha  on
January 28, 2017. The Alpha Note is unsecured. Alpha is a shareholder in the Company’s Series A 6%
Convertible  Preferred  offering.  The  funds  have  been  used  by  the  Company  to  pay  liabilities  and  to
maintain the Company’s listing on the OTCQB.
On May 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Partial Cancellation Agreement (the “PCA”) by and among
its  subsidiary,  Dala  Petroleum  Corp.,  a  Nevada  corporation  (“Dala  NV”),  Chisholm  Partners  II,  LLC,  a
Louisiana limited liability company (“Chisholm II”)(a company that is managed by one of the Company’s
then-directors),  and  certain  members  of  Chisholm  II  (the  “Chisholm  Members”)(some  of  which  are
beneficially controlled by the Company’s then-officer and then-directors) through which Chisholm II (after
receiving  shares  from  certain  of  its  Chisholm  Members)  is  to  return  a  total  of  8,567,800  shares  of  the
Company common stock to the Company’s treasury for cancellation.  In exchange for the return of these
shares  for  cancellation,  the  Company  assigned  55,000  acres  of  the  Company’s  property  rights
(approximately 65% of its total holdings) to Chisholm II.
On May 10, 2016, the Company and one of its creditors, Pacific Oil & Gas Company, LLC (a company
managed by Clancy Cottman, the Company’s then-director), restated the Pacific Note by assigning the
amounts  due  to  four  different  creditors  based  on  their  initial  participation  in  the  Pacific  Note.  The

On June 15, 2015, the Company received funds from a demanded Promissory Note (the “Note”) that it
entered into on June 8, 2015 in the amount of $99,999 in favor of Pacific Oil & Gas, LLC (the “Lender”).
The Note bears an interest rate of 12% per annum and all principal and accrued interest will be due and
payable by the Company to the Lender on December 31, 2015. The Note is secured by a Mortgage, Deed
of Trust, Assignment of Production, Security Agreement and Financing Statement that was filed on June
25,  2015  against  the  Company’s  Evans  9-1  lease  in  McPherson  County,  Kansas.  The  trustee  of  the
Lender is the Company’s director, Clancy Cottman, and the funds delivered to the Company by the Lender
were provided by a group of the Company’s Series A 6% Convertible Preferred shareholders. As of June
30,  2016,  the  Company  received  proceeds  of  $97,500.    On  January  26,  2016,  Lender  extended  the
maturity date to March 1, 2016.  During the period ended May 26, 2016, the Company accrued $10,849
interest expense under this note.  On May 26, 2016, as part of the PCA (see Note 2), the Lender forgave
the  principal  and  interest  of  $110,848.    On  May  10,  2016,  the  Company  and  the  Lender  (a  company
managed by Clancy Cottman, the Company’s then-director), restated the Pacific Note by assigning the
amounts due to four different creditors based on their initial participation in the Pacific Note as reflected in
the Restated Pacific Note (see Note5).  The restated Pacific note was accounted for by separate notes.
 The balance of $39,771 (includes principal and accrued interest) that was forgiven was offset to additional
paid-in capital.
As part of the settlement with the Preferred Shareholders, and in association with the PCA, on May 10,
2016  certain  creditors  of  the  Company  agreed  to  release  and  waive  all  amounts  owed  to  them  by  the
Company, including all amounts owed to Pacific Oil & Gas, LLC under the Restated Pacific Note.
On December 22, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note with Mill City Ventures III, Ltd. for
$5,195.  The note matures on December 22, 2016 and bears interest at the rate of 12%. During the nine
months ended June 30, 2016, the Company accrued $326 interest expense under this note.
On December 22, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note with Chisholm Partners II, LLC for
$7,002.  The note matures on December 22, 2016 and bears interest at the rate of 12%. During the period
ended May 26, 2016, the Company accrued $322 interest expense under this note.  On May 26, 2016, as

NOTE 7 – PREFERRED CONVERTIBLE STOCK AND WARRANTS
As discussed above in Note 2, in fiscal year 2014, the Company sold 2,025 units consisting of a total of
2,025 shares of Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock and 2,893,725 warrants at the price of $1,000
per unit.  Proceeds received totaled $2,025,000 (with a net of offering costs of $1,990,000).  The warrants
were  valued  at  $711,044  and  this  amount  was  separated  from  the  value  of  the  preferred  stock.    Each
$1,000 unit consisted of (i) one share of Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock that is convertible at any
time at the option of the holder into common stock at the conversion price of $0.70 per common share
based on the total dollar amount invested (subject to adjustment) and (ii) 1,429 warrants (issued for each
Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock sold in each unit) to purchase common shares of the Company
at an exercise price of $1.35 for three years of the “Effective Date, ” defined as the earliest date of the
following  to  occur:  (a)  the  initial  registration  statement  required  by  the  Offering  Documents  has  been
declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), (b) all of the
underlying shares have been sold pursuant to SEC Rule 144 or may be sold pursuant to SEC Rule 144
without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required
under  SEC  Rule  144  and  without  volume  or  manner-of-sale  restrictions  or  (c)  following  the  one  year
anniversary  of  June  3,  2014.    A  total  of  2,008  shares  of  Series  A  6%  Convertible  Preferred  Stock,
exercisable into 2,868,571 shares of common stock, remain issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016.
The 6% per annum dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly in cash or, at the Company’s option, in
shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company discontinued paying the quarterly dividend as of
July 1, 2015 and the amount owed thereunder has been accruing since that time until May 10, 2016 at
which time all accrued dividends on 675 of the 2,025 shares were waived and cancelled by those certain
preferred shareholders.  The cancelled dividends were accounted for by offsetting to additional paid-in
capital.
As  the  Series  A  6%  Convertible  Preferred  Stock  is  contingently  redeemable  at  a  fixed  price  and  such
redemption would not be solely within the control of the Company, the preferred stock is classified outside
of  stockholders’  equity,  as  “temporary  equity”  between  liabilities  and  stockholders’  equity  on  the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
The Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock has no voting rights.
On  February  17,  2016,  a  supermajority  of  more  than  67%  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Series  A  6%
Convertible Preferred Stock approved certain corporate transactions in an effort to settle certain violations
of the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation and other documents related to
the  sale  of  Series  A  6%  Convertible  Preferred  Stock  in  2014.  The  transactions  approved  by  a
supermajority of the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Shareholders are to be implemented by the Board
of Directors at the Board’s discretion. The approved transactions include the following: (i) the approval of a
potential settlement agreement with Chisholm Partners II, LLC and certain members of Chisholm II, (ii) the
approval of the amendment of the Certificate of Designation for the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred
Stock modifying the Conversion Price to $0.05, (iii) the Removal of Section 7, “Certain Adjustments” in the
Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (iv) the modification of the permitted
indebtedness allowable under the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation to
$200,000, (v) the approval of promissory notes with related parties in an amount up to $60,000, (vi) the
waiver of the right of redemption upon Triggering Events for the Company’s violations of Section 10 of the
Certificate of Designation, (vii) the waiver of the accrual of the late fee for unpaid dividends as of January
1, 2016, (viii) the waiver of the first right of refusal to purchase shares from other Series A 6% Convertible
Preferred Shareholders, and (ix) waiver of the “Most Favored Nation” provision in the SPA for the Series A
6%  Convertible  Preferred  Stock,  among  other  things.  None  of  the  items  approved  by  the  shareholders
have yet been effected by the Board.

Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, each holder shall have the right to require the Company to
redeem all of the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock in cash at the redemption amount which is the
sum of (a) the greater of (i) 130% of the stated value, and (ii) the product of (y) the VWAP on the trading
day immediately preceding the date of the triggering event and (z) the stated value divided by the then
conversion price, (b) all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, if any, and (c) all liquidated damages and
other costs, expenses or amounts due in respect of the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock.

24,286 shares of the Company’s common stock. As of June 30, 2016, 2,008 Convertible Preferred Shares
remain outstanding.
Effective December 31, 2015, the valuation of  the  derivative  from  the  warrants  using  the  Black  Sholes
model was no longer a liability given the decrease in the Company’s stock and the exercise price of the
warrants.
NOTE 8 – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock
On June 2, 2014, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its common stock to Chisholm II in exchange
for oil and natural gas assets recorded at $1,898,947.
As discussed above, the Company completed a reverse merger with Dala, with Dala being the acquirer for
financial reporting purposes.  At the date of the Merger, Westcott had 2,500,000 shares of common stock
outstanding, which are now outstanding for the merged Company. The total amount of shares issued and
outstanding post-Merger, as of December 31, 2014 was 12,500,000 shares of common stock.
On November 17, 2014, one of the Company’s shareholders of Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock,
Chienn Consulting Company, converted 17 shares of its Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock into
24,286 shares of the Company’s common stock.
As part of the Settlement (see Note 2 and 14), 9,597,800 shares of common stock were returned to the
Company and recorded in treasury.
As of June 30, 2016, there are a total of 3,956,486 common shares outstanding.
Stock-Based Compensation
On June 2, 2014, the Company granted options to acquire common shares to its Chief Executive Officer
and two directors, totaling 600,000 options.  The options have an exercise price of $0.70 per share for
terms of six years.  Of the total stock options, 400,000 vest equally over the next four years and 200,000
vest  equally  over  the  next  two  years.    The  total  fair  value  of  these  options  at  the  date  of  grant  was
estimated  to  be  $400,087,  and  was  determined  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  with  an
expected  lives  of  4.25  (four-year  vesting)  and  3.75  years  (two-year  vesting),  a  risk-free  interest  rate  of
1.92%,  a  dividend  yield  of  0%  and  expected  volatility  of  195%.    The  expected  terms  were  determined
using  the  simplified  method.    For  the  nine  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  recorded
approximately $49,771 of stock-based compensation expense.
On December 21, 2015, ninety days after the resignation of a former officer of the Company, his 400,000
stock options expired.
On May 9, 2016, two former directors of the Company each voluntarily cancelled 100,000 stock options
awarded  on  June  2,  2014,  related  to  the  Partial  Cancellation  Agreement  and  their  subsequent
resignations.

NOTE 9 – DERIVATIVES
The  Series  A  6%  Convertible  Preferred  Stock  issued  by  the  Company  had  a  full-ratchet  down-round
provision on the exercise price, in which the investors’ conversion price is adjusted down to the share
price of future financings.  Therefore, prior to June 30, 2016, following ASC 815-40, the warrants and the
conversion feature of the preferred stock are not considered indexed to our own stock, and as such, the fair
value of the embedded derivative liabilities are reflected on the balance sheet prior to June 30, 2016.
On  February  17,  2016,  a  supermajority  of  more  than  67%  of  the  shareholders  of  the  Series  A  6%

NOTE 10 – REGISTRATION RIGHTS PENALTY
In connection with the private placement and sale of 2,025 units of Series A 6% Convertible Preferred
Stock and related warrants at the price of $1,000 per unit, the Company was required to register certain
shares of common stock as part of a Registration Rights Agreement.
The Company granted the investors’ registration rights on the underlying shares related to the Series A
6% Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants.  The registration rights agreement provided for a liquidated
damages provision imposed upon the Company of 1.5% of the gross proceeds per month for each month
that the shares are not registered.  The liquidated damages are not to exceed 9% which was met in 2015.
 The Company filed a registration statement that was effective on September 12, 2014 that did not register
all of the underlying shares of the Series A 6% Convertible Preferred Stock the warrants and the dividend
payments required to be registered in the Registration Rights Agreement.  As of June 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company incurred registration rights penalty of $0 and $133,658, respectively.
The  Company  has  also  accrued  interest  in  the  amount  of  $6,543  and  $986  as  of  June  30,  2016  and
September 30, 2015, respectively, at the rate of 18% per annum simple interest in accordance with the
terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
NOTE 11 – CONCENTRATIONS
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial  instruments,  which  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  a  concentration  of  credit  risk,  consist
principally of temporary cash investments.
The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial institutions insured by the FDIC. No
amounts  exceeded  federally  insured  limits  as  of  June  30,  2016.  There  have  been  no  losses  in  these
accounts through June 30, 2016.
Concentration of Supplier
The Company does not rely on any particular suppliers for its services.
NOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company, as a lessee of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment.  These laws and
regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost
of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages.
  We  believe  our  operations  are  in  substantial  compliance  with  existing  requirements  of  governmental
bodies.
NOTE 13 – GOING CONCERN
The Company has not generated any revenues, has recurring net losses, a working capital deficiency as
of June 30, 2016 of $262,898, and used cash in operations of $82,162 and $650,300 for the nine months
ended  June  30,  2016  and  2015,  respectively.  In  addition,  as  of  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  had  an
accumulated  deficit  and  stockholders’  deficiency  of  $2,948,510  and  $1,375,823,  respectively.  These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of
assets  and  satisfaction  of  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  ability  of  the  Company  to
continue its operations is dependent on the execution of management’s plans, which include the raising of
capital  through  the  debt  and/or  equity  markets,  until  such  time  that  funds  provided  by  operations  are
sufficient to fund working capital requirements. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it
would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value
estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(unaudited)
There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating additional cash from the
equity/debt markets or other sources to be used for operations. The consolidated financial statements do
not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  of  assets  and  classification  of  assets  and
liabilities that might be necessary. Based on the Company’s current resources, the Company will not be
able to continue to operate without additional immediate funding. Should the Company not be successful
in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or
all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company is attempting to commence explorations and generate revenue; however, the Company’s
future cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.  While the Company believes in
the  viability  of  its  strategy  in  the  exploration  and  development  of  its  unproved  properties  and  the
Company’s  ability  to  raise  additional  funds,  until  such  time  it  is  able  to  generate  sufficient  revenue  to
support its operations, there can be no assurances to that effect.  The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and in its ability to
raise  additional  funds,  until  such  time  the  Company  can  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  support  its
operations.
In  the  event  the  Company  is  unable  to  raise  funding  in  the  near  term,  we  will  not  be  able  to  pay  our
liabilities. In the event we are unable to raise adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay
our outstanding debt obligations, and if our current creditors elect to foreclose on the outstanding debts
then owed, we would be forced to liquidate our assets or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection,
which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classification  of  recorded  asset  amounts  or  the  amounts  and  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 14 – SUBSEQUENT EVENT
Pursuant to terms of the PCA, on July 28, 2016, the 1,030,000 shares of common stock delivered by Baldo
Sanso  (360,000  shares  of  common  stock),  Robert  Sali  (610,000  shares  of  common  stock)  and  Chris
Dabbs (60,000 shares of common stock), were cancelled on the books and records of the Company.  Due
to the later delivery of these shares, the Company is in discussions regarding the viability of the divesture
of  up  to  3,659  additional  lease  acres  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  PCA  and  has  not  fully  resolved  this
matter to date.  See Note 2.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Forward-looking Statements
Statements made in this Quarterly Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements
with  respect  to  the  goals,  plan  objectives,  intentions,  expectations,  financial  condition,  results  of
operations, future performance and our business, including, without limitation, (i) our ability to raise capital,
and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “may,” “would,” “could,” “should,”
“expects,”  “projects,”  “anticipates,”  “believes,”  “estimates,”  “plans,”  “intends,”  “targets”  or  similar
expressions.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which
are  beyond  our  control)  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  set  forth  in  the
forward-looking statements, including the following:  general  economic  or  industry  conditions,  nationally
and/or in the communities in which we may conduct business, changes in the interest rate environment,
legislation  or  regulatory  requirements,  conditions  of  the  securities  markets,  our  ability  to  raise  capital,
changes  in  accounting  principles,  policies  or  guidelines,  financial  or  political  instability,  acts  of  war  or
terrorism, other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our current
or potential business and related matters.
Accordingly,  results  actually  achieved  may  differ  materially  from  expected  results  in  these  statements.
  Forward-looking  statements  speak  only  as  of  the  date  they  are  made.    We  do  not  undertake,  and
specifically  disclaim,  any  obligation  to  update  any  forward-looking  statements  to  reflect  events  or
circumstances occurring after the date of such statements.
Plan of Operations
Our revenues and future profitability are substantially dependent on our ability to raise additional funds.
We have suspended drilling and other exploration and development operations until the market conditions
related to the price of oil have improved.  We have substantially cut administrative expenses to conserve
to conserve cash.  The management and directors are no longer paid any salary or bonus.  We also are
not immediately planning any other leasing activity in our areas of operation.  We continue to search for a
financial and/or operational partner to assist in developing our oil and gas properties.  If we were to partner
with another entity, we would consider all options in developing our properties.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $0 and $0 in oil and gas
expenditures, respectively. As a result of the dry holes encountered, the Company immediately expensed
$0 of cost capitalized as impairment expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2016.
Our common stock currently trades on the OTCQB under the symbol “DALP.”
Results of Operations
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
During  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016  and  2015,  we  had  no  revenues,  respectively,  and  we
incurred  $16,817  and  $150,201,  respectively,  of  general  and  administrative  expenses.    For  the  period
ended  June  30,  2016,  those  expenses  included  $11,537  of  legal  and  accounting  fees,  consulting  and
other professional fees.  As a result, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stock of $(0.00) per
share for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  For the period ended June 30, 2015, those expenses
included  $22,438  of  legal,  accounting,  consulting  and  other  professional  fees,  and  $95,377  officer  and
director compensation expense (to include $33,261 of stock-based compensation expense).  Additionally,
we  paid  $30,375  in  quarterly  dividends  on  our  preferred  stock.    As  a  result,  we  incurred  a  net  loss
attributable to common stock of $(0.06) per share for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
During  the  nine  months  ended  June  30,  2016  and  2015,  we  had  no  revenues,  respectively,  and  we
incurred $145,640 and $600,373, respectively, of general and administrative expenses.  For the period
ended  June  30,  2016,  those  expenses  included  $49,657  of  legal  and  accounting  fees,  consulting  and
other professional fees and $49,771 of stock-based compensation expense.  As a result, we incurred a net
loss attributable to common stock of $(0.01) per share for the nine months ended June 30, 2016.  For the
period ended June 30, 2015, those expenses included $163,834 of legal and accounting fees, consulting
and other professional fees, and $279,765 officer and director compensation expense (to include $99,783
of  stock-based  compensation  expense).    Additionally,  we  paid  $90,870  in  quarterly  dividends  on  our
preferred stock.  As a result, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stock of $(0.13) per share for
the nine months ended June 30, 2015.
21
Liquidity and Capital Requirements
We had $10,722 in cash on hand and negative working capital of $262,898 at June 30, 2016.  We believe
these funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our principal business operations through at least the
next 30 days.   The Company plans to raise additional capital from the sale of its securities (including,
without limitation common stock, preferred stock, promissory notes, etc.) and achieve operating revenues
with the development of its oil and gas properties. In the event the Company is unable to raise funding in
the  near  term,  we  will  not  be  able  to  pay  our  liabilities.  In  the  event  we  are  unable  to  raise  adequate
funding  in  the  future  for  our  operations  and  to  pay  our  outstanding  debt  obligations,  and  if  our  current
creditors elect to foreclose on the outstanding debts then owed, we would be forced to liquidate our assets
or  may  be  forced  to  seek  bankruptcy  protection,  which  could  result  in  the  value  of  our  outstanding
securities declining in value or becoming worthless.
Cash flows used in operating activities was $82,162 in cash for the nine months ended June 30, 2016,
primarily the result of our loss of $112,331, change on fair value of derivative liabilities of $54,240, offset
by $49,771 in stock-based compensation, and a decrease in prepaid assets of $33,942.
Cash flows used in investing activities was $0 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016.
Cash flows provided by financing activities was $90,010 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016, related
to proceeds received from notes payable.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean
a  company's  controls  and  other  procedures  of  an  issuer  that  are  designed  to  ensure  that  information
required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports  that  it  files  or  submits  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  is  accumulated  and
communicated  to  the  issuer’s  management,  including  its  chief  executive  and  chief  financial  officers,  or
persons  performing  similar  functions,  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required
disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that
all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's
rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
chief executive and interim chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  the  Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are not effective as of such date. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
determined  that  the  Company  continues  to  have  the  following  deficiencies  which  represent  a  material
weakness:
·
The Company intends to appoint additional independent directors;
·
Lack of in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting
issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With material, complex and non-routine
transactions,  management  has  and  will  continue  to  seek  guidance  from  third-party  experts  and/or
consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions;
·
Insufficient  personnel  resources  within  the  accounting  function  to  segregate  the  duties  over  financial
transaction processing and reporting; and
·
Insufficient  written  policies  and  procedures  over  accounting  transaction  processing  and  period  end
financial disclosure and reporting processes.
22
To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to implement the following measures:
·
As funding permits, the Company will add sufficient accounting personnel to properly segregate duties
and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of the financial statements.
·
The  Company  will  hire  staff  technically  proficient  at  applying  U.S.  GAAP  to  financial  transactions  and
reporting.
·
Upon  the  hiring  of  additional  accounting  personnel,  the  Company  will  develop  and  maintain  adequate
written accounting policies and procedures.
The additional hiring is contingent upon The Company’s efforts to obtain additional funding through equity
or debt and the results of its operations. Management hopes to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but
provides no assurances that it will be able to do so.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
The Company’s sole officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well  designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  that  the  control
system’s  objectives  will  be  met.  Further,  the  design  of  the  control  system  must  reflect  that  there  are
resource  constraints  and  that  the  benefits  must  be  considered  relative  to  their  costs.  Because  of  the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control  issues  and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  the  company  have  been  detected.  These  inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can
occur  because  of  simple  error  or  mistake.  Controls  can  also  be  circumvented  by  the  individual  acts  of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of
any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the
degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, there has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
