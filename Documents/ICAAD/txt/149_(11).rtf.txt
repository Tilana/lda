 [2] This case was heard on 21st September 2011 and case was fixed for judgement today.

Summary of evidence

[3] At the trial, prosecution called one witness to prove the charge.

[4] PW 1-PC 2838 Peni Vesikula; He said on 03-09-2009 at 5.30pm, he was operating Radar machine at Queens Road, Nabua. He said the maximum speed is 80kmph. He said he used the Radar Machine. Before he used he checked it and it was working properly. The machine was calibrated by Safeway Electronics and Ministry of Commerce, Weigh and Measure Unit. He said he stopped LT 6333 for high speeding. It was travelling 91kmph and permitted speed is 80kmph. He further said that the driver of vehicle overtook and crossed the Zebra line. Zebra line prohibited overtaking both ways. He then showed speed metre to the accused. He was booked for Careless Driving and Exceeding Speed limits. He issued relevant TINS. 

In cross examination the witness said that the accused was booked for two counts. He said he issued TIN for both counts and the accused was issued two TINS. The witness answered the accused overtook bus and crossed the Zebra line. The accused suggested that there was an animal on the road he evade it. But witness said there was no animal on the road at that time. The witness said he cannot the number of the bus and company of the bus. 

[5] Thereafter prosecution closed their case. Since there is a case to answer, then, Defence was called and Rights of the accused had been explained. The accused opted to give sworn evidence and but he did call one defence witness on his behalf. 
The accused gave evidence as follows;

DW1-Azeezul Rahiman; the accused said on that date he drove vehicle from Suva to Nadi. When he reached the point of detection he saw 15 Animals, cows on the road. He said oncoming track was clear so he went that side. Then officer stop him and charge him for offence. When He saw animals he slowed down, the officer did not show him the Radar Machine. He crossed the zebra line to avoid an accident. But officer did not hear him. 

In cross examination he said he was a frequent traveller of Suva Nadi corridor. The animals were on left side. He was questioned why he cannot stop the vehicle without crossing the Zebra line. The witness said he was afraid that cows may damage the car. He admitted that he cross the Zebra line. The prosecution suggested that the accused was travelling at high speed and therefore he was over speeding and he could not stop the vehicle. But the accused denied it, but said he saw the cows and slowed the vehicle. He said the officer did not show the Radar Machine. 

DW2- Murshand Ali: The witness said they were going from Suva to Nadi. When they reached Naburo Bridge, some of animals were on the road. Then, Driver went outside and he was booked by the police officers. 

In the cross examination the witness said he doesnt know this accused but he went with him. One of his cousins told him there is driver he can come with him. So he joined him. He rang and informed that case is today and he came to give evidence by bus. He said his cousins phone number 9876289 and name Artiff Khan. The witnesss mobile was checked in open court see whether any incoming call from this number for veracity of this evidence. But there were no phone call then this witness changed the stance and said call come to his wifes mobile number. It seems to this court the witness lied to court. Thus this evidence is unreliable. 

The Law on Careless Driving

[6]Careless Drivingis defined by s 99 (1) of the Land Transport Act as driving "on a public street without due care and attention".

[7]The test forcareless driving is stated in the case of Khan v State, High Court of Fiji Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1994 (21 October, 1994) as follows:

"In order to determine whether the offence ofcareless drivingis committed, the test, as LORD GODDARD C.J. said in SIMPSON v PEAT (1952 1 AER 447 at p.449) is: "was D exercising that degree of care and attention that a reasonable and prudent driver would exercise in the circumstances?"

The standard of proof is an objective one . . ." (As cited in State v Lovo [2009] FJMC 7; Traffic Case 31.2009 (24 September 2009) 

[8] Maximum Penalty to EXCEEDING SPEED LIMIT (Contrary to Regulation 24 (2) and 87 of Land Transport (Traffic) Regulation 2000) is $500 fine and 3 months imprisonment and one demerit point to be added.

[9] The burden of proof is vested on the state in this matter and they should prove this charge beyond reasonable doubt. What is proof of beyond reasonable doubt is described in several cases. 

[10] In State v Seniloli [2004] FJHC 48; HAC0028.2003S (5 August 2004) Her Ladyship Justice Nazhat Shameem told to assessors (summing up);

"The standard of proof in a criminal case is one of proof beyondreasonable doubt. This means that you must be satisfied so that you feel sure of the guilt of the accused persons before you express an opinion that they are guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt as to whether the accused persons committed the offence charged against each of them on the Information, then it is your duty to express an opinion that the accused are not guilty. It is only if you are satisfied so that you feel sure of their guilt that you must express an opinion that they are guilty. One of the defence counsel asked you if you had the slightest doubt about the accused's guilt. That is not the correct test. The correct test is whether you have anyreasonable doubtabout the guilt of the accused."

[11] In State v Tuiloa [2008] FJHC 251; HAC003.2007 (24 June 2008) Justice Jocelynne A. Scutt in Her Ladyship's summing up said;

 "The question then is what the standard of proof is. That is, when the onus rests on the State as it does here and generally in criminal trials, what is the standard the State must meet? The State must prove all the necessary ingredients of the charge.... beyondreasonable doubt. Proof beyondreasonable doubtmeans what it says. You must be sure; you must be satisfied of guilt, before you can express an opinion about it. Only if you are sure, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doublet of guilt, then it is your duty to say so. If you are not sure, not satisfied beyond areasonable doubt, then you must give your opinion that the accused is not guilty. This assessment, this determination, rests with you  with each of you  upon your individual assessment of the evidence." (Emphasises is mine) 

[12] As Lord Devlin mentioned in the Privy Council in Jayasena v. The Queen reported in 72 New Law Reports 313 (Sri Lanka) 

"A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.

[13] Therefore, if the court or prudent man thinks the accused is guilty for offence in considering all the facts placed before them without any reasonable doubt, then charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the accused should be convicted as per charged. If the court or prudent man thinks that the accused is not guilty to the offence in considering all the facts placed before them, then the charge has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. If evidence creates some reasonable doubt in mind of court or prudent man, the benefit of doubt must be given to accused and accused should be acquitted and discharged from the proceedings. This is the golden rule of criminal law and "one who says the fact exists should prove that fact no burden lies on one who denies it- as legal maxim "Ex qui affirmat non ei qui negat incumbit probatio". On the other hand court should consider what actually happened and not what adduced by witnesses- as legal maxim "In traditionibus scruptorum non quod dictum est sed qudogestum est inspicitur" have to be noted. 
 
Analysis of the evidence

[14] Now I evaluate the evidence adduced before me. The prosecution witness said that the accused did drive excessive speed and he crossed Zebra line. Thereby he caused two traffic offences. Prosecution witness was cross examined by the accused. The witness said there were no animals on the road. The accused did not question whether there was a passenger in that vehicle. But he called DW2 as the passenger. DW2 is to be highly unreliable witness. This detection was done at about 5.30 pm. The accused was going to Nadi and it is almost 200km drive. It is possible to draw inference that the accused speeded the vehicle up to end journey as soon as possible. At that time he was caught. The accused lied to court that he was never shown the Radar Metre. But it shows that there were two TIN issued to the accused on the very same day, same time. 

[15] Prosecution only called single witness. But the court can rely on single witness if it is satisfied by his evidence. I have no hesitation to accept PW1's evidence. Therefore, I am satisfied with prosecution evidence. But I decline the defence evidence for forgoing reasons. I hold that the prosecution has proved its charges beyond reasonable doubts. 

[16] I convict the accused on both counts as charged.
