Sandstorm as follows and acknowledges and agrees that Sandstorm is relying on such
covenants in executing and delivering this Agreement:
(a)                         Rambler Canada and Rambler UK shall only use the Upfront Deposit to fund
capital expenditures which are required to construct and develop the Property in a manner that is
consistent with the Mine Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Rambler Canada and Rambler
UK may make changes to construction plans to improve upon the plans in the Mine Plans and
the Upfront Deposit may be used to fund any related capital expenditures so long as such
departures do not result in Rambler UK or Rambler Canada no longer having sufficient funds to
bring the Property to the Commencement of Commercial Production.
(b)                             Rambler UK and Rambler Canada shall limit spending on all of their properties
(other than the Property) to levels as agreed with Sandstorm in its sole discretion, but acting
reasonably, until the Property attains the Commencement of Commercial Production.
(c)                              Subject to the provisions of section 5(d), during the Term and the Extended Term,
as the case may be, Rambler UK and Rambler Canada and their respective affiliates and
subsidiaries shall not enter into any future gold stream agreements, royalty agreements or other
agreements (excluding Hedging Arrangements), in respect of the Property without the prior
written consent of Sandstorm.
- 14 -
(d)                         Rambler Canada and Rambler UK shall provide Sandstorm with monthly
construction, development, operational and cash expenditure reports until such time as the
Property attains the Commencement of Commercial Production. Rambler UK and Rambler
Canada shall notify Sandstorm on a timely basis and in accordance with its monthly reporting
procedures as set forth in Article 6, of any material departures from the Mine Plans including cost
overruns (if any) with respect to construction of the Property as well as any negative, material
impact on Au to be produced, either in amount or timing, together with Rambler Canada’s plans
for rectifying the situation.
(e)                             Rambler Canada shall use its best efforts to obtain all Project Permits.

cause to be done all things necessary to maintain their respective corporate existence. Rambler
Canada shall at all times during the Term do all things necessary to maintain the Property in
good standing including paying all taxes owing in respect thereof. During the Term, Rambler
Canada shall not abandon any of the claims, leases, lands or tenements forming a part of the
Property unless Rambler Canada provides evidence satisfactory to Sandstorm, acting
reasonably, that it is not economical, as at the date of determination, to produce Minerals from
such claims, leases, lands or tenements.

of each calendar month.
(b)                             During the Term and the Extended Term, as the case may be, Rambler Canada
shall deliver to Sandstorm: (i) an Annual Sales Report, on or before 30 days after the last day of

any part thereof) (the “Audit Dispute Notice”);
(ii)                            Sandstorm and Rambler Canada shall have 60 days from the date the Audit
Dispute Notice is delivered by Sandstorm to resolve the dispute. If Sandstorm and Rambler
Canada have not resolved the dispute within the said 60 day period, a mutually agreed
independent third party expert will
- 15 -
be appointed to prepare a report with respect to the dispute in question (the “Expert’s Report”). If
Sandstorm and Rambler Canada have not agreed upon such expert within a further 10 days after
the said 60 day period, then the dispute as to the expert shall be resolved by the dispute
mechanism procedures set forth in Article 18.
(iii)                        if the Expert’s Report concludes that the actual number of ounces of Sandstorm

set out in the Annual Sales Report, then the cost of the Expert’s Report shall be borne by
Sandstorm;
(iv)                         if the Expert’s Report concludes that the number of ounces of Sandstorm Payable
Au varies by more than two percent from the number of ounces of Sandstorm Payable Au set out
in the Annual Sales Report, then the cost of the Expert’s Report shall be borne by Rambler
Canada; and
(v)                             if either Sandstorm or Rambler Canada disputes the Expert’s Report and such
dispute is not resolved between the Parties within ten days after the date of delivery of the
Expert’s Report, then such dispute shall be resolved by the dispute mechanism procedures set
forth in Article 18.

Report as required pursuant to this Article 6, Sandstorm shall have the right to perform or to
cause its representatives or agents to perform, at the cost and expense of Rambler Canada, an
audit of the books and records of Rambler UK and Rambler Canada relevant to the production

books and records on a timely basis. In order to exercise this right, Sandstorm must provide not
less than 14 days’ written notice to Rambler Canada of its intention to conduct the Sandstorm
Audit. If within seven days of receipt of such notice, Rambler Canada delivers the applicable

no right to perform the Sandstorm Audit. If Rambler Canada delivers the applicable (draft or final)
Monthly Report or Annual Report, as the case may be, before the delivery of the Sandstorm
Audit, the applicable (draft or final) Monthly Report or Annual Report, as the case may be, shall
be taken as final and conclusive, subject to the rights of Sandstorm as set forth in section 6(c).
Otherwise, absent any manifest or gross error in the Sandstorm Audit, the Sandstorm Audit shall

and/or damages pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, this Agreement shall be deemed
terminated upon the payment by or on behalf of Rambler Canada or the Rambler Canada Default
Fee and/or the applicable damages.
(e)                             Termination of this Agreement under this Article shall not terminate any payment
or delivery obligation hereunder that arose prior to the time of termination.
