particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them,

views, and that those views be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also </i>that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or 
her personality, should grow up in a family environment while the best interests of the child 
shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and protection and 
that families&#8217; and caregivers&#8217; capacities to provide the child with care and safe environment 
should be promoted,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, 1999 (No. 182) and the Convention 
concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, 1973 (No. 138) of the

prostitution and child pornography,<footnote name="4">A/HRC/16/57. </footnote> and taking note of their reports,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> <i>further </i>the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the constructive dialogue on the theme &#8220;A holistic approach to the 
protection and promotion of the rights of children working and/or living on the street&#8221;, on 
the occasion of the full-day annual meeting on the rights of the child, held on 9 March 
2011, and the renewed commitment to the implementation of the Convention expressed on 
that occasion by States parties,  
</p>
<p><i>Profoundly concerned</i> that the situation of children in many parts of the world 
remains critical and has been negatively affected by the world financial and economic 
crisis, </p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>about the situation of girls and boys working and/or living on the 
street worldwide and the negative impact that this has on the full enjoyment of their rights 
and their development<i>, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that the prevention and solution of certain aspects of this phenomenon 
could be facilitated in the context of economic and social development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the need for States and the international community to create an 
environment in which the well-being of the child is ensured, including by strengthening 
international cooperation in this field, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> about the multiple forms of discrimination and stigmatization 
children living and/or working on the street often face because of factors such as race,

living on the street, facing violence, including sexual exploitation, HIV infection and other 
serious health problems, substance use and early pregnancies, and about the situation of 
children born on the street, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that prostitution of children is a serious form of exploitation and 
violence and a crime against those most vulnerable, that States parties should prohibit and 
address it in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and reiterating the 
importance of States ensuring children&#8217;s protection from them,

migration; trafficking; violence; abuse and neglect at home or in care institutions; broken 
families; lack of access to basic services, including free education; HIV/AIDS and child 
relinquishment; substance abuse; and mental health issues, intolerance, discrimination, 
armed conflict and displacement, and that such causes are often aggravated and their 
solution made more difficult by serious socio-economic and other difficulties,

disaggregated data collection and research on children, including children living and/or 
working on the street, </p>

killings;  </p>
<p>2. <i>Urges </i>States to ensure a holistic child rights and gender-based response to the

comprehensive domestic child protection strategies, with realistic and time-bound targets 
and sufficient financial and human resources for their implementation, including 
arrangements for the monitoring and regular review of action taken;  </p>
<p>3. <i>Calls on </i>States to give priority attention to the prevention of the phenomenon 
of children working and/or living on the street by addressing its diverse causes through 
economic, social, educational and empowerment strategies, including by: </p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Ensuring birth registration of all children immediately after birth through 
universal, free, accessible, simple, expeditious and effective registration procedures; raising 
awareness of the importance of birth registration at the national, regional and local levels;

registered have access without discrimination to health care, protection, education, safe 
drinking water and sanitation, and basic services;  </p>

opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory, available 
and free to all children, ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, 
as well as by making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in 
particular through the progressive introduction of free education and by ensuring school 
attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children living 
and/or working on the street, including, where appropriate, through the implementation of 
incentives relating to school attendance in the context of social policies;  
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Upholding children&#8217;s rights to protection and their access to services by 
establishing child-friendly, accessible and effective counselling, complaint and reporting 
mechanisms; 
</p>

regard to child development and non-abusive parenting, to enable them to provide children 
with care in a safe environment;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To adopt, strengthen and implement legislative and other measures, cross-
sectoral strategies and plans of action to eliminate, as a matter of priority, all forms of

<p>(<i>d</i>) To recognize that it is generally in the child's best interests that survival 
behaviours, such as begging, loitering, vagrancy, truancy, running away and other acts, be 
dealt with as child protection issues by the relevant State authorities, and to ensure, in 
accordance with their legal systems, that laws on such behaviours do not constitute an 
obstacle to effective assistance, support and protection for children working and/or living 
on the street;  </p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To ensure that children working and/or living on the street who are involved 
in judicial proceedings have effective access to child-friendly justice systems and, where

in the proceedings and are informed about their rights in a way understandable to them;  
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To ensure that all interventions directed at children working and/or living on

professionals in order to prevent further victimization;

testing and adequate protection against health risks, including HIV;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls on </i>States to ensure appropriate care and protection of children who 
work and/or live on the street without any parental contact or supervision, including
