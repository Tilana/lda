Adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard 
of living, in the context of the hosting of mega-events 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous resolutions on adequate housing of the Council and the 
Commission on Human Rights, in particular Council resolution 6/27 of 14 December 2007 
and Commission resolution 2004/28 of 16 April 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that international human rights law instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, entail obligations and commitments of States parties in 
relation to access to adequate housing, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the principles and commitments with regard to adequate housing 
enshrined in the relevant provisions of declarations and programmes adopted by major 
United Nations conferences and summits and at special sessions of the General Assembly 
and by their follow-up meetings, inter alia, the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements 
and the Habitat Agenda (A/CONF.165/14), and the Declaration on Cities and Other Human 
Settlements in the New Millennium adopted at the twenty-fifth special session of the 
Assembly, and annexed to its resolution S-25/2 of 9 June 2001,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the work of the United Nations treaty bodies, in particular the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the promotion of the rights related to adequate 
housing, including its general comments Nos. 4, 7, 9 and 16, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-12221 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>that any deterioration in the general housing situation disproportionally 
affects persons living in conditions of poverty, low-income earners, women, children, 
persons belonging to minorities and indigenous peoples, migrants, the elderly and persons 
with disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the hosting of &#8220;mega-events&#8221;, that is, large-scale events of limited 
duration and diverse nature, including major international sporting or cultural events, can 
provide a major opportunity to enhance the housing stock and to improve the related 
infrastructure in the host country, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
right to non-discrimination in this context, including the undertaking of country missions; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Acknowledges</i> the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual report on the realization of the 
right to adequate housing in the context of hosting mega-events (A/HRC/13/20); 
 3. <i>Calls upon </i>States, in the context of hosting mega-events, to promote the right 
to adequate housing and to create a sustainable, development-oriented housing legacy, and 
to strive in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (a) To integrate housing concerns into the bidding and planning process at an 
early stage and, in this regard, to assess the impact on the affected population throughout 
the process, as appropriate; 
</p>
<p> (b) To ensure full transparency of the planning and implementation process and 
the meaningful participation of the affected local communities therein; 
</p>
<p> (c) To pay particular attention to persons belonging to vulnerable and 
marginalized groups, including by respecting the principles of non-discrimination and 
gender equality; 
</p>
<p> (d) To plan and develop the event venues with the post-event period in view, 
while taking into account the needs of socially disadvantaged persons for affordable 
housing;  
</p>
<p> (e) To ensure, consistent with the domestic legal framework and international 
human rights obligations, that the right to adequate housing of affected persons in the 
context of the hosting of mega-events is respected, while giving due consideration to issues 
such as insecurity of tenure; 
</p>
<p> (f) To explore alternatives to evictions and to undertake any such evictions as 
may be necessary in accordance with the domestic legal framework and in full compliance 
with the relevant provisions of international human rights law, including those for adequate 
and effective remedies;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> States to share with the Special Rapporteur good practices with 
regard to the realization of the right to adequate housing in the context of the hosting of 
mega-events; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to consider, as appropriate, the issue of 
mega-events in the context of her work; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the cooperation extended to date to the Special 
Rapporteur by different actors, and calls upon States to continue to cooperate with the 
Special Rapporteur in the discharge of her mandate and to respond favourably to her 
requests for information and visits; </p>


<p>GE.10-12221 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to ensure that the Special Rapporteur receives the necessary resources to enable 
her to discharge her mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item and in accordance with its programme of work.
