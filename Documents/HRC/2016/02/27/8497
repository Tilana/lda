<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011. The review of Nauru was held at the 1st  
meeting, on 24 January 2011. The delegation of Nauru was headed by Mathew Batsiua, 
MP, Minister for Health, Justice and Sports. At its 5th meeting, held on 26 January 2011, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Nauru. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Nauru: Hungary, Malaysia and Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Nauru: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/NRU/1 and A/HRC/WG.6/10/NRU/1/Corr.1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/NRU/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/NRU/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Latvia, Maldives, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland was transmitted to Nauru through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Mr. Batsiua, MP, Minister for Health, Justice and Sports introduced the Nauruan 
delegation and acknowledged with gratitude the support of the Secretariat of the Pacific 
Community. The delegation of Nauru stated that Nauruan people had traditionally 
respected fundamental beliefs, which today were translated into international fundamental 
rights and freedoms. However, Nauru, the world&#8217;s smallest independent Republic, was not 
without its own issues and challenges. 
</p>
<p>6. The Constitution of Nauru was the source of its fundamental human rights 
principles. In 2004, the Government embarked upon a comprehensive review of the 
Constitution, which involved a very extensive public awareness and consultation campaign. 
It resulted in two draft laws, which received the unanimous support of the Parliament in 
</p><p>2009. The second of these Bills, upon being passed by Parliament, needed to be further 
endorsed through a referendum. However, in February 2010, voters rejected the proposed 
amendments, which would have significantly amended Part II of the Constitution, 
containing the bill of rights provisions. It would have notably protected the rights of 
disabled persons and environmental rights, prohibited the death penalty, guaranteed 
children&#8217;s rights, recognized the right to receive education and health, and enshrined the 
right to receive maternity leave and the right to access information. 
</p>
<p>7. Nauru mentioned that the failure of the referendum was currently under review and 
being analysed by a Standing Committee of Parliament known as the Constitutional Review 
Committee. The head of the delegation stated that he thought that the rejection of the </p>


<p>referendum amendments likely had more to do with the complexity and number of 
amendments than with any concern on the part of Nauruans with the proposed changes. 
Nauru was committed to exploring alternative approaches which might yet see a successful 
referendum. 
</p>
<p>8. In the meantime, Nauru was pushing forward with those constitutional amendments 
which did not require approval through a referendum. The relevant Bill was tabled in 
Parliament in December 2010. It was hoped that it would enter into force at the time of the 
next general elections. In their current form, the amendments introduce the concept of a 
leadership code and create the office of Ombudsman. The powers of the President and 
Cabinet during times of emergency would be tightened. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that the State of Emergency, declared in June 2010, was lifted 
on 1 November 2010. Nauru looked forward to a period of stability in the remaining two 
years and the 2011 legislative agenda would aim to address the need for major reform in 
several sectors. This included the progress of the review of the Nauruan Criminal Code, 
much of which has remained unchanged since 1899. With the assistance of the Government 
of Australia, this major project was expected to take three years and to introduce significant 
changes in how Nauru addressed sexual offences and those arising from domestic violence. 
The decriminalization of homosexual activity between consenting adults was under active 
consideration as part of this review. 
</p>
<p>10. Nauru was conscious that human rights concerns were not resolved by laws alone 
and that it had to address the social, economic and political impediments to effective 
enjoyment of civil rights. The country size created significant financial and capacity 
constraints in the Government&#8217;s efforts to meet these objectives. 
</p>
<p>11. Since the submission of its national report, Nauru had been able to fill the position 
of Chief Justice and to appoint a second Supreme Court Judge although there was still a 
concern about the lack of affordable legal services available to the public. Free legal 
assistance was available for those charged with criminal offences only, through the creation 
of the position of Public Defender. 
</p>
<p>12. With the aid of development assistance, particularly from New Zealand, Nauru was 
endeavouring to address the issue of capacity in the legal sector. 
</p>
<p>13. Nauru&#8217;s economy was gradually recovering as a result of major economic and 
governance reforms, but remained heavily reliant on foreign aid. Nauru had been seeking to 
promote greater sustainability, but this was difficult due to the environmental devastation 
caused by mining and the lack of arable land. Nauru continued to nurture the private sector 
as a means of promoting development and economic growth. However, Nauru did not have 
a regular commercial bank available for its citizens which had been an elusive goal for 
successive Nauru Governments. Notwithstanding the challenges it faced, Nauru had 
notably established the Nauru Entrepreneurship Development Centre, which provided 
training and skills development in the establishment and operation of small business. 
</p>
<p>14. In 2005, Nauru finalized its National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS), a 
25-year strategic plan, which was reviewed and revised in 2009. The theme was 
&#8220;Partnership for a better quality of life&#8221;, recognizing that this was a shared responsibility of 
Government, civil society and the private sector. Broad consultations were held to ensure 
the NSDS would reflect the priorities of the people of Nauru. 
</p>
<p>15. One of the NSDS priorities was to achieve &#8220;a stable, trustworthy, fiscally 
responsible government with transparent and accountable parliamentarians, cabinet and 
public service&#8221;. This goal will require essential governance, policy and institutional 
reforms. </p>


<p>16. There was still considerable concern relating to the standard of living of Nauruans, 
particularly issues such as unemployment, inadequate income, housing and access to clean 
drinking water and fresh food. The Government was endeavouring to address these issues 
through community-based programmes. 
</p>
<p>17. Education was compulsory and free but Nauru was very concerned about the 
reportedly high rates of truancy and the Department for Education had implemented 
policies to address this issue. While, because of the financial crisis, older children were 
being taken out of school to care for younger siblings, Nauru was hopeful that, as the 
economic situation improved, families would ensure that their children stay in school for as 
long as possible. 
</p>
<p>18. An Education Bill was scheduled to be tabled at the next Parliament&#8217;s session, 
which notably proposed to make education compulsory until the age of 18, increase the 
hours of school and pursue many other positive changes under the principle of providing 
decent education to children and young people. 
</p>
<p>19. Nauru stated that specific groups, such as senior citizens and persons with 
disabilities, now received financial assistance.  
</p>
<p>20. Nauru noted the international concern about its failure to ratify many international 
human rights treaties. Nauru had signed most of them and many of the legislative 
obligations already found expression in existing laws. However, it was the burden of 
reporting that most concerned Nauru. Therefore, Nauru urged the United Nations to 
seriously review the reporting obligations and would like to contribute to the current 
review. It would notably suggest that some of the reporting obligations be undertaken on a 
regional basis, rather than in Geneva owing to the costs involved. 
</p>
<p>21. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had recently established an inter-
ministerial Working Group on Treaties tasked to review Nauru&#8217;s existing international 
obligations and to recommend action as regards ratification of treaties to which Nauru was 
not yet a party. The Working Group would be looking at the recommendations from the 
UPR Working Group, and it was likely that the treaties mentioned will be given individual 
consideration in 2011. 
</p>
<p>22. Nauru informed the Council about inaccuracies in the United Nations records on the 
various international human rights instruments that Nauru had signed in 2000. 
</p>
<p>23. Due to its recent history with hosting migrant processing centres, the signature of 
Refugees Convention was presently under active consideration by the Cabinet. Nauru was 
also prepared to consider agreeing to the visit request from the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and would be prepared to consider extending a standing invitation to the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>24. Nauru stated that the impacts of climate change included a notable sea-level rise, 
which posed an immediate and serious threat to food security, human health and could 
cause displacement. The vast majority of the island&#8217;s population lived on the coast, which 
was on average 3 to 4 metres above sea level. Unfortunately there was little that Nauru 
could do to halt the global emission of greenhouse gases, and it called on major emitters to 
recognize its right to survival and to make significant cuts as a matter of urgency. Nauru 
was committed to enacting environmental rights as human rights. 
</p>
<p>25. The mining of phosphate over the last century had caused significant environmental 
damage on Nauru, which was endeavouring to do what it could through the Nauru 
Rehabilitation Corporation. In January 2010, the Government collaborated with the Pacific 
Applied Geoscience Commission on a survey on the impact of the mining industry on the 
communities close to the processing plant. Nauru hoped that, when available, the results 
from the survey would guide it in its efforts to improve the quality of life for these </p>


<p>communities, as Nauru remained very concerned about the overall impact of environmental 
pollution on the population. 
</p>
<p>26. The delegation, in its conclusions, reiterated its commitment to improving and 
realizing human rights. As a tiny nation facing enormous challenges, Nauru was slowly 
recovering from recent financial devastation, envisaged positive progress on the human 
rights situation and looked to work with its partners, both at home and internationally to 
this end. 
</p>
<p>27. Nauru thanked all States which had submitted advance questions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>28. During the interactive dialogue, 30 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. A number of 
delegations welcomed the participative approach taken to the drafting of the national report 
and the commitment shown by Nauru to the universal periodic review mechanism. 
</p>
<p>29. Algeria noted that Nauru&#8217;s commitment to human rights manifested itself in an 
active contribution to regional mechanisms in the areas of immigration, refugees and 
internally displaced persons, and climate change, as well as measures benefiting vulnerable 
groups. It called on the international community to contribute to capacity-building, in light 
of Nauru&#8217;s limited financial and human resources. Assistance in the area of international 
legal norms would be of particular importance. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Cuba noted that the population of Nauru was faced with a number of difficulties 
resulting from the international economic crises, serious environmental problems, climate 
change and other consequences of the unjust international economic order. Nevertheless, 
Nauru had made considerable efforts to limit the negative impact of these circumstances on 
human rights. In addition to steps aimed at economic recovery, Nauru had taken measures 
to fight domestic violence and promote the representation of women in government. It had 
also created a National Youth Council, undertaken literacy programmes and improved its 
health infrastructure.  Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. China noted with appreciation that Nauru had established a comprehensive 
constitutional review process and had made efforts to advance the domestic legislation 
process.  In recent years, Nauru had made commitments and taken action to strengthen the 
protection of vulnerable groups. However, due to geographical constraints and lack of 
capacities and financial resources, Nauru was faced with considerable challenges with 
regard to its development and in the human rights area.  Issues such as climate change, the 
environmental impact of phosphate mining, eliminating violence against women, 
facilitating access to justice, strengthening food security, reducing of poverty and 
improving health standards remained major challenges. China called on the United Nations 
system and its members to positively consider Nauru&#8217;s request for technical and financial 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>32. Morocco noted with satisfaction the adoption in 2005 of a National Sustainable 
Development Strategy, which aimed at reforms in governance and in the political and 
institutional area, with a view to improving the quality of life. Morocco also took note of 
legislative measures to strengthen human rights protection, including the adoption of laws 
on freedom of information and the protection of persons with mental disabilities. Morocco 
also welcomed the 2009 law on the penitentiary system, which provided for protections for 
detainees and offered them training opportunities.  Morocco further appreciated efforts to 
strengthen the role of women in society and fight domestic violence. Morocco made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>33. Brazil was pleased to learn of measures aimed at reviewing the Constitution, with 
positive impact in areas such as women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, the right to life, economic 
and social rights, freedom of information and political participation.  Brazil regretted 
however that despite all efforts, the review had not been approved by referendum. It warned 
that persistence of the political stalemate could jeopardize the promotion and protection of 
fundamental rights and freedoms. Brazil commended Nauru for its review of the Criminal 
Code, which, amongst others, would decriminalize sexual relations between consenting 
adults of the same sex. Brazil also recognized positive steps with regard to women&#8217;s rights, 
but noted with concern the high incidence of violence against women, particularly domestic 
violence. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. The delegation of Nauru welcomed the fact that most of the statements were in 
support of Nauru. Regarding women and children, Nauru tried to address most of these 
issues through the constitutional review. Although the constitutional referendum failed, all 
the measures for the advancement of the rights of women and children were very much 
supported and were not controversial matters. The Government and the Parliament were 
looking at ways to introduce legislation in this regard that could be allowed under the 
current circumstances. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to the national human rights institution, Nauru had discussed the matter 
at length. The biggest obstacle towards establishing such an institution was again resources 
and expertise. In its struggle to regain financial and economic situation, Nauru recognized 
that there were probably other institutions which took precedence such as the Ombudsman 
Office, the Leadership Code and tribunal. A national Ombudsman Office might be created 
through the parliamentary amendments to the Constitution. Because of human and financial 
constraints, a proposal was still under consideration for this office to have a dual function. 
</p>
<p>36. Domestic violence against women and children was a problem in Nauru and the 
Government was taking positive steps and gave more focus on this issue by establishing the 
Domestic Violence Unit, which combined various departments to look at this matter. Nauru 
was interested in trying to formulate policies and actions in this field. In prisons, for 
example, young offenders and women were physically separated after the building of new 
facilities. 
</p>
<p>37. Nauru was aware of the lack of a focal point for children issues. There were many 
issues such as children and disability issues which were cross-sectoral, as they did not relate 
to one ministry. Nauru needed a better arrangement in place in this regard. 
</p>
<p>38. Slovenia welcomed the efforts undertaken by Nauru to improve the human rights 
situation of its people, in spite of challenges. In particular, it noted efforts to fight domestic 
violence, empower women, improve the quality of education, address unemployment and 
draft a new Criminal Code. With regard to the negative outcome of the referendum on 
constitutional reform, Slovenia asked which of the envisaged rights clauses could still be 
approved by the parliament. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Hungary noted with satisfaction that despite the impact of climate change Nauru had 
proved its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. Hungary welcomed the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child without reservations, but noted that 
no reports had been submitted yet to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Hungary 
was concerned about the low proportion of boys enrolled in secondary education, and about 
the high rate of school truancy. It also expressed concern about the lack of specific 
legislation on violence against women. At the same time, Hungary appreciated efforts made 
to curb that situation and also welcomed that Nauru had signed Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Hungary made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>40. Spain welcomed Nauru&#8217;s intention to decriminalize sexual relations between 
consenting adults of the same sex and encouraged it to continue its efforts to prevent 
discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity.  Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Canada commended Nauru for its commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights. In particular, it commended Nauru for steps taken to combat corruption, by 
enacting anti-money laundering legislation and closing its offshore banks, and for making 
the elimination of domestic violence a national priority. Measures taken with regard to the 
latter had included the establishment of a safe house for women and children victims of 
domestic violence, conducting awareness campaigns and instituting a Domestic Violence 
Unit within the Nauru Police Force. Canada welcomed Nauru&#8217;s participation in various 
regional mechanisms and encouraged further cooperation with international mechanisms.    
Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Azerbaijan noted that Nauru was not yet a party to key international human rights 
treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional 
Protocol, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and  the 
Convention against Torture, but welcomed the intention of Nauru to be bound by these 
instruments. Although Nauru had not yet ratified the Convention against Torture, its 
legislation was in compliance with it. Azerbaijan noted with interest the establishment of a 
Domestic Violence Unit and asked about measures taken to combat violence against 
women. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. France noted with satisfaction that Nauru was a party to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and that it 
had signed, although not ratified, most of the international instruments for the promotion 
and protection of human rights. France welcomed the fact that no execution had taken place 
in Nauru since its independence in 1968, and that Nauru had signed the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which aims at the 
abolition of the death penalty. France noted that Nauru could still improve its cooperation 
with the United Nations human rights mechanisms. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Nauru thanked all delegations and welcomed the comments made. With regard to 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Nauru had 
committed itself to ratify the Convention. Nauru signed Convention on the Rights of the 
Child but still faced resource and capacity constraints to submit its initial report. Nauru 
requested UNICEF assistance and welcomed comments and recommendations made in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>45. Nauru stated that there was a chapter on domestic and sexual violence in the new 
draft criminal code. This code will be considered soon by the Government before being 
tabled before the Parliament. This approach would be more effective for Nauru instead of 
having many different laws. 
</p>
<p>46. Freedom of information laws were also considered. They were widely supported and 
would be easily brought into place. 
</p>
<p>47. The suggestions made for a human rights based environment programme was 
something that Nauru was certainly interested to further look into. Nauru did not have the 
capacity to develop such programmes but welcomed ideas and suggestions in this regard. 
</p>
<p>48. Malaysia was encouraged to note that despite many challenges Nauru had 
demonstrated its commitment and determination in improving the socio-economic and 
human rights situation in the country.  It welcomed the National Sustainable Development 
Strategy and its recent review, which aimed at achieving a positive future for Nauru and a </p>


<p>better quality of life for Nauruans. Malaysia noted that Nauru had planned to reopen the 
detention centre for asylum-seekers who had attempted to enter Australia by boat without a 
visa; it asked what benefits the centre would bring to Nauru and its population. Malaysia 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>49. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland acknowledged the 
capacity and resource challenges facing Nauru in its efforts to address its human rights 
obligations, especially in light of the increasing impact of climate change.  It asked about 
the intentions of Nauru with regard to the continuation of the dialogue with civil society in 
the follow-up to the universal periodic review. The United Kingdom welcomed the work 
undertaken in tackling domestic violence, in particular the establishment of the Domestic 
Violence Unit and the safe house for women.  However, the United Kingdom noted that it 
would also welcome specific laws in this area, as a signal that violence and discrimination 
against women would not be condoned. It commended Nauru for undertaking a review of 
its Criminal Code and expressed interest in learning more about future efforts by the 
Government to provide an operational and accessible justice system. The United Kingdom 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Germany welcomed the establishment of a work programme, undertaken in 2010 in 
cooperation with Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
to complete a situation analysis, provide policy and legal advice, assist drafting legislation, 
regulations and standard operation procedures, and conduct joint awareness-raising 
workshops and specialized training of officials. Germany requested to receive more 
detailed information about the outcome, regarding in particular legislative projects and 
workshops relating to awareness-raising. Germany made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>51. Slovakia commended Nauru&#8217;s participation in various Pacific regional mechanisms. 
It also noted positively the criminalization by Nauru of torture and inhuman or degrading 
treatment, despite not being a party to the Convention against Torture. Slovakia was 
concerned about reports on widespread domestic violence and commended Nauru for the 
establishment of a safe house for victims of domestic violence and the creation of a 
Domestic Violence Unit in the police force.  Slovakia expressed concern about the extent of 
child abuse. While commending the provision of free compulsory education up to the age 
of 16 and the recent renovation of the school infrastructure, it was concerned about the 
level of truancy. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Ghana noted the enactment in 2009 of the Correctional Service Act, which 
prescribed a more human approach to imprisonment and provided for the protection of 
prisoners&#8217; human rights as well as rehabilitation and training. Ghana lauded the ongoing 
review of the Criminal Code with the aim of introducing a modernised code in accordance 
with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Ghana also noted the limitations 
mentioned in the national report, in particular problems with access to justice, limited 
capacity of the legal profession, extreme vulnerability to the impacts of the climate change 
and heavy reliance on foreign aid. Ghana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The United States of America commended Nauru for lifting the state of emergency 
in place for much of 2010 and welcomed the renewed dialogue between the President and 
members of Parliament. It remained concerned over the lack of effective mechanisms for 
addressing and curtailing domestic violence, but it commended Nauru for highlighting this 
need in its national report and making the elimination of domestic violence a national 
priority. The United States asked whether Nauru planned to expeditiously ratify the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and strongly encouraged the 
Government to make freedom of association and expression hallmarks of Nauruan 
democracy. The United States made recommendations. </p>


<p>54. Nauru was looking at the ratification of the International Covenant and formed a 
working group to look at all the treaties and provide the Government with 
recommendations on what could realistically be done either immediately or at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>55. The Nauru delegation highlighted that women&#8217;s representation was quite good in the 
public services. However, the political representation was not the same, as there has been 
only one female MP since the independence of Nauru. During the constitutional review, it 
was felt by many, including women, that having a preferential seat for women in 
Parliament to redress this shortage was not the best way to proceed. There were female 
senior Government officials, as evidenced by the delegation but the problem lay with 
female political representation. 
</p>
<p>56. Regarding the centres for asylum-seekers, the delegation recalled that Nauru 
contributed towards a regional solution to this problem. Nauru wanted to contribute to 
handling a situation which was affecting people in difficult situation and saw its 
contribution as humanitarian in nature. Consideration of the ratification of the Refugee 
Convention was dealt with by the working group mentioned earlier. 
</p>
<p>57. Poland noted that Nauru had not become a party to core international human rights 
instruments yet, but welcomed the opportunity given to the civil society to provide 
feedback on the draft national report. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Maldives stated that it was important to understand and appreciate the challenges 
Nauru was facing in fully promoting and protecting human rights because of its small size  
and its capacity constraints. Despite that, Nauru was making significant efforts and had also 
made some impressive achievements in the field of human rights. Maldives made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Italy took note of the National Action Plan for Women, the establishment of a 
Domestic Violence Unit by the Nauru Police Force and a safe house for victims of domestic 
violence.  Nonetheless, it remained concerned at the lack of specific legislation on violence 
against women and at the delay in the accession to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women after its signature in 2000. Italy was also 
concerned at the frequency and persistency of sexual abuse of children. Italy made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Chile noted that, as stated in the national report, Nauru was facing important 
challenges especially on poverty and food security, for which international assistance was 
needed. Chile stated that the international community and the United Nations should merge 
their efforts to meet Nauru&#8217;s request for assistance, particularly with regard to the 
elaboration of strategies to eradicate domestic violence. Climate change also posed an 
existential threat which undermined the whole set of human rights. Chile made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. New Zealand took note of Nauru&#8217;s delegation suggestions regarding potential 
improvements to the reporting obligations. Noting that there was no specific law on 
violence against women, New Zealand commended Nauru for stating in its national report 
that eliminating violence against women was a national priority. New Zealand enquired 
about steps being taken towards accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and about how Nauru intended to ensure its people&#8217;s enjoyment of their human 
rights, including access to information. New Zealand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Australia commended Nauru for its work in raising awareness on women&#8217;s issues 
domestically, and noted Nauru&#8217;s signature of, and intention to ratify Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It welcomed the establishment 
of a National Plan of Action on Women, of a safe house for women and children victim of 
domestic violence, and the establishment of a Domestic Violence Unit in the Police Force. </p>


<p>While being concerned that domestic violence and sexual harassment remained significant 
issues, Australia commended Nauru for its commitment to decriminalize homosexuality. 
Australia was pleased to be working in partnership with Nauru on approaches to these 
challenges. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Sweden noted that homosexuality was still illegal in Nauru and asked the delegation 
to elaborate on what actions were being taken to promote the rights of sexual minorities and 
whether the Government intended to ratify core international human rights treaties, such as 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Sweden stated that credible reports showed that 
Nauru had allowed Australian refugee camps in its territory and asked the delegation to 
elaborate on the status of refugees and asylum seekers, including if there was any plan to 
ratify and implement the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Argentina welcomed the active participation of Nauru in various regional 
mechanisms dealing with refugee issues. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Bolivia stated that Nauru had been colonized since 1888 until its independence in 
</p><p>1968. Unfortunately, colonizing powers were not interested in the welfare of Nauruans but 
exclusively in the intensive exploitation of phosphate mines. As a result, Nauru was now 
facing very serious environmental problems. Phosphate mining ravaged the natural 
environment of the island, provoking contamination of water, air and land and altering the 
culture and the lifestyle of its inhabitants, who were suffering serious diseases like diabetes 
and heart troubles, mainly due to malnutrition. This situation had very grave consequences 
on the enjoyment of human rights. Bolivia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Latvia was pleased to note the consultation of the civil society in the preparation of 
the national report. It appreciated the openness with which Nauru had approached the UPR 
dialogue and, in particular, the positive response given regarding the issue of standing 
invitations to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. Latvia made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. Trinidad and Tobago commended the Government of Nauru for its 25-year National 
Sustainable Development Strategy, which sets out the necessary reforms in policy and 
existing institutions, guided by the principles of good governance. Trinidad and Tobago 
noted the envisaged reform of the Constitution and appreciated steps taken to promote 
human rights while pursuing national economic development objectives. It believed that the 
establishment of the Domestic Violence Unit and of a safe house, and public awareness 
campaigns were the right steps in a larger strategy to deal with violence against women. 
Trinidad and Tobago made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Mauritius understood the challenges and constraints faced by Nauru, particularly in 
its slow recovery from a severe economic crisis and the impact of the climate change. 
Mauritius asked whether a new referendum, following that of February 2010 on 
constitutional amendments, would be carried out, provided that the current political 
stalemate was resolved. Mauritius made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Israel applauded Nauru&#8217;s efforts to initiate a constitutional review process, which 
sought to further include rights such as the right to privacy and personal autonomy, health 
services, education, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights and the rights of persons with 
disabilities, among other rights, into the Constitution. Israel also noted that despite financial 
crises, limited financial resources and its vulnerability to the climate change, Nauru has 
succeeded in maintaining a democratic and tolerant society. Israel made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Nauru reiterated that remarks and recommendations made were taken aboard in 
good spirit. Regarding access to information, the Cabinet was deliberating on specific laws, </p>


<p>particularly freedom of information bills. If the constitutional referendum had been 
adopted, it would have provided for public access to information. An access-to-information 
law will be tabled before the Parliament within the coming years. Information was currently 
provided to Nauruans to a cost, which was not meant to generate revenues but was purely 
administrative.  
</p>
<p>71. As regards the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,it  was new 
and was recently discussed in the region. Nauru had no problem in supporting it and the 
working group will look at this Convention. There was no focal point on disabilities in 
Nauru but it was a cross-sectoral issue. Nauru was looking at properly addressing the rights 
to access relevant services by persons with disabilities, as evidence in the most recent 
project on infrastructure building. Nauru has the &#8220;Able Disable&#8221; centre, which is a school 
for persons living with disabilities. The Education Bill referred to the special needs of 
people with disabilities in education. 
</p>
<p>72. Nauru had focal points from the Regional Rights Resource Team, who were in 
charge of teaching human rights and awareness to members of the public. 
</p>
<p>73. Regarding access to government information, Nauru had a Government information 
office which was responsible for ensuring awareness among the general population on the 
Government plans and activities. 
</p>
<p>74. Nauru recognized the importance of partnership with the civil society and the private 
sector, as it was the case in the National Sustainable Development Strategy. Nauru stated 
that homosexuality remained illegal, as the current criminal code dated back from 1899. 
There was a clear intent by the Government supported by the population to amend most of 
those laws and correct that situation. 
</p>
<p>75. Nauru did not agree with allegations regarding violations of the rights of refugees, as 
every attention was given to ensure the rights of these persons through the provision of 
services to them in an efficient and consistent manner. There were no restrictions to their 
freedom of movement and attention and care was provided to those people. In addition, the 
ratification of the Convention on Refugees was currently under consideration. 
</p>
<p>76. Nauru recalled that the Parliamentary Standing Committee was dealing with the 
political stalemate on the referendum. A survey was being conducted among a sample of 
1,000 voters (a large sample in Nauru&#8217;s context) to try to determine why people voted the 
way they did. This committee will continue its work over the coming months. There was 
nothing stopping the Government from doing what could be done through the Parliament, 
including the Bill on Access to Information or the Education Bill. These bills were 
generally well supported. 
</p>
<p>77. There would be deliberation in the committee about a new referendum. However, 
such a referendum required a majority of two thirds to pass and therefore, much thought 
was needed prior to its organization. In the meantime, Nauru could progress through bills 
such as the current Passport Bill, which would allow for travel documents for refugees. 
This bill was to be adopted during the February session. 
</p>
<p>78. Nauru thanked all delegations. 
</p>
