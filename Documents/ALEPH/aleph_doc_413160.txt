Significant accounting policies
The  accounting  policies  and  methods  followed  in  preparing  these  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  are  those  used  by
American Natural Energy Corporation (the “Company”) as described in Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2014 and 
2013  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  and  the  rules  of  the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and  do  not  conform  in  all  respects  to  the  disclosure  and  information  that  is  required  for  annual
consolidated  financial  statements.  The  year-end  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet  data  was  derived  from  audited  consolidated  financial
statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements
of the Company.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for fair statement have been
included in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2014 are not 
indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2014.
Reclassification of Prior Period Statements
Certain reclassifications of prior period consolidated financial statement balances have been made to conform to current reporting practices.
2
Going Concern, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company currently has a severe shortage of working capital and funds to pay its liabilities. The Company has no current borrowing capacity
with any lender. The Company incurred a net gain of $478,281 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to a gain on the settlement of
disputed revenue payables. The Company has a working capital deficit of $10,023,287 and an accumulated deficit of $26,215,079 at June 30,
2014 which leads to substantial doubt concerning the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due. The Company also has a
need for substantial funds to develop its oil and gas properties and repay borrowings as well as to meet its other current liabilities.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations,
realization  of  assets  and  liquidation  of  liabilities  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  As  a  result  of  the  losses  incurred  and  current  negative
working capital, there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities will be liquidated or settled for the
amounts recorded. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon adequate sources of capital and the Company’s 
ability to sustain positive results of operations and cash flows sufficient to continue to explore for and develop its oil and gas reserves and pay its
obligations.
7
American Natural Energy Corporation 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
June 30, 2014 and 2013
Management’s strategy has been to  obtain additional financing  or industry partners. It is management’s intention to raise  additional  debt or
equity  financing to  fund  its operations  and  capital  expenditures or  to enter  into  another transaction in  order to  maximize  shareholder value.
Failure to obtain additional financing can be expected to adversely affect the Company’s ability to pay its obligations, further the development of 
its properties, grow revenues, oil and gas reserves and achieve and maintain a significant level of revenues, cash flows, and profitability. There
can be no assurance that the Company will obtain this additional financing at the time required, at rates that are favorable to the Company, or at
all. Further, any additional equity financing that is obtained may result in material dilution to the current holders of common stock.

American Natural Energy Corporation 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
June 30, 2014 and 2013
As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company had an outstanding note to TPC Energy with a principal balance of $164,183. On
March 31, 2014, the Company extended the maturity of the note until March 31, 2015. The company evaluated the extension under FASB ASC
470-50 and FASB ASC 470-60 and concluded the revised term constituted a debt modification, rather than a debt extinguishment or a troubled
debt restructuring. There were no other changes to the terms of the note.
As of June 30, 2014, the Company had another outstanding note to TPC Energy with a principal balance of $250,000. On March 11, 2014, the
Company extended the maturity date of the note until March 11, 2015. There were no other changes to the terms of the note and TPC Energy
will continue to receive the 50% of the company’s interests in its share of the Liquidation Agents account distributions for an extra year until
March 11, 2015. The TPC note is included in Notes Payable – Related Parties on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. The company evaluated
the extension under FASB ASC 470-50 and FASB ASC 470-60 and concluded the revised term constituted a debt modification, rather than a
debt extinguishment or a troubled debt restructuring.
On February 17, 2011, the Company entered into a $500,000 note payable with Mike Paulk and Steven Ensz, directors of the Company, with an
annual  interest  rate  of  10%.  On  February  17,  2014,  the  Company  extended  the  note  payable  until  February  17,  2015.  There  were  no  other
changes to terms of the note. The Company evaluated the application of ASC 470-50 and ASC 470-60 and concluded that the revised terms 
constituted a debt modification rather than a debt extinguishment or a troubled debt restructuring. Principal payments totaling $45,000 were
made during the six months ended June 30, 2014.
The Company entered into a financing agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP during the first quarter of 2012. Proceeds of the
financing are to be used for the drilling and completion of wells included in the Company’s inventory of Proved Undeveloped reserves (“PUD”). 
The Company has a commitment for a total amount of $3 million, before fees and expenses, through the issuance of a series of $1 million
debentures. The debenture is secured by a first priority, perfected security interest and mortgage in oil and gas leases and properties. At no time
shall the investor funds exceed 65% of the drilling and completion cost of the PUD’s with the balance provided by the Company’s generated 
funds.
On January 29, 2014, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement with TCA Global Credit Master
Fund LP. The amendment provides for interest only payments pursuant to existing amended and restated debenture for the month of December
2013,  that  all  previous  outstanding  principal  and  accrued  and  unpaid  interest,  an  accommodation  fee  $200,000  for  entering  into  this  sixth
Amendment  and  all  outstanding  Redemption  Premium  fees  will  comprise  the  agree  upon  outstanding  amount  of  $2,196,609.  Principal  and
interest in the amount of $371,459 is due monthly, inclusive of all fees and redemption amounts. The Company evaluated the amendment under
FASB  ASC  470-50  and  determined  that  the  modification  was  substantial  and  qualified  as  a  debt  extinguishment.  The  additional  $200,000
accommodation fee and the remaining unamortized debt discount of $208,490 and were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
June 30, 2014 and 2013
During the six months ended June 30, 2014, payments totaling $645,211 were made to TCA debts. Prior to the sixth amendment, $47,533 of
debt discount were amortized. The total note principal balance of TCA debts on June 30, 2014 was $1,651,399.
On June 30, 2013, the Company extended the maturity date of note payable to Leede Financial to December 31, 2013. The other terms of the
note  payable  remain  unchanged.  The  Company  evaluated  the  application  of  ASC  470-50  and  ASC  470-60  and  concluded  the  revised  term
constituted a debt modification. As the note is denominated in Canadian dollars, the Company adjusted the face value of the note based on
fluctuations in exchange rates and recorded a foreign exchange loss of $916 during the six months ended June 30, 2014.
On August 1 2013, the Company converted its $48,000 accounts payable balance to Eaton Oil Tools to a note payable. Monthly payments of
$4,119 which include interest at the rate of 6% per annum were to be made through August 2014. At August 13, 2014, seven payments were past
due.
On April 14, 2014 the Company entered into a loan agreement with Pinon Energy providing for an advance of $250,000 to be used for working
capital purposes. The loan is payable upon the earlier of a re-financing of the Company’s secured debt or August 14, 2014 in the amount of 
$268,000 plus interest at a rate of 12% per annum. Pinon Energy is also to receive 250,000 shares of Company common stock. The note and all
interest totaling $274,799 were paid on July 7, 2014.
On June 24, 2014, the Company entered into a $989,751 note payable with Louisiana Oil Properties, Inc. together with simple interest at 4% per
annum due on or before October 31, 2014. This promissory note was the result of a settlement of disputed revenue payables resulting in a gain
recognized by the Company of $2,052.451.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
We currently are experiencing a severe shortage of working capital and funds to pay our liabilities. We have no current borrowing capacity with
any lender. We incurred a net gain of $478,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to a gain on the settlement of disputed revenue payables and
a net loss of $3,147,000 and $3,318,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. We have a working capital deficiency and an accumulated
deficit at June 30, 2014 which leads to substantial doubt concerning our ability to meet our obligations as they come due. We also have a need for
substantial funds to develop our oil and gas properties and repay borrowings as well as to meet our other current liabilities.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Report have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The independent registered public accounting firm’s 
report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an explanatory paragraph which states that we
have sustained a substantial loss in 2013 and have a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2013 that raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result
of our losses incurred and current negative working capital, there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities
will be liquidated or settled for the amounts recorded. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon adequate sources of capital and our
ability to sustain positive results of operations and cash flows sufficient to continue to explore for and develop our oil and gas reserves and pay our 
obligations.
A Comparison of Operating Results For The Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013
We recorded net income of $1,450,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to a net loss of $109,000 for the three months
ended June 30, 2013. During the three months ended June 30, 2014, our revenues were comprised of oil and gas sales totaling $470,000 compared with
oil and gas sales of $874,000 during the same period of 2013. Oil and gas prices decreased as well as production for the second quarter of 2014 as
compared to the second quarter of 2013. Our net average daily production for the three month period ended June 30, 2014 decreased by 45% over the
same period of the prior year, from 91 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 50 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. The weighted average price was
$104.23 per barrel of oil equivalent for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $105.78 per barrel of oil equivalent for the same period in
2013. Production from our existing wells is subject to fluctuation based upon which zones of wells are in production.
13
We had operating expenses of $670,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to operating expenses of $493,000 for the three
months ended June 30, 2013. Our general and administrative expenses were $303,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $369,000
for the three months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $66,000.
Interest and financing costs decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 at $402,000 and $506,000
respectively. Interest and financing costs were lower in the second quarter of 2014 due to lower amortization of note discounts.
Lease operating expenses of $142,000, production taxes of $24,000 and depletion, depreciation and amortization of $188,000 during the three
months  ended  June  30,  2014  changed  from  $226,000,  $103,000,  and  $227,000,  respectively,  during  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2014.  Lease
operating expenses were lower for the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to decreased production. Production taxes
decreased for the second quarter of 2014 as a result of decreased production. The decrease in depletion, depreciation and amortization for the second
quarter of 2014 is a result of decreased production.
During the three months ended June 30, 2014, we had a foreign exchange loss of $13,000 compared to a $432,000 foreign exchange gain for the
three months ended June 30, 2013. Our foreign exchange gains and losses arise out of an inter-company indebtedness we owe to our wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Gothic, which is payable in Canadian dollars, in addition to a note owed to a third party denominated in Canadian dollars. The foreign
exchange loss for the three months ended June 30, 2014 was caused by the weakening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar. The loss related to
the note denominated in Canadian dollars was $13,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2014
We recorded a gain of $2,052,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 as the result of the settlement of disputed revenue payables to a
royalty owner.
A Comparison of Operating Results For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013
We recorded net income of $478,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to a net loss of $605,000 for the six months ended
June 30, 2013. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, our revenues were comprised of oil and gas sales totaling $1,045,000 compared with oil and
gas sales of $1,872,000 during the same period of 2013. Oil and gas prices and production decreased for the first six months of 2014 as compared to the
same period of 2013. Our net average daily production for the six month period ended June 30, 2014 decreased by 42% over the same period of the prior
year, from 96 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 56 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil and gas prices decreased for the six month period ended
June 30, 2014 over the same period of the prior year. The weighted average price was $103.47 and $107.41 per barrel of oil equivalent for the six
months  ended  2014  and  2013  respectively.  Production  from  our  existing  wells  is  subject  to  fluctuation  based  upon  which  zones  of  wells  are  in
production.
14
We had operating expenses of $1,417,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to operating expenses of $1,454,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2013. Our general and administrative expenses were $648,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $857,000 for
the six months  ended June 30, 2013. General and  administrative expenses were higher for  the period ended June 30,  2013 primarily due to  higher
professional fees and higher payroll expense.
Interest and financing costs decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 at $795,000 and $1,012,000
respectively. Interest and financing costs were lower in the first two quarters of 2014 primarily as a result of lower amortization of note discounts.
Lease operating expenses of $281,000, production taxes of $81,000 and depletion, depreciation and amortization of $406,000 during the six
months  ended  June  30,  2014  changed  from  $516,000,  $177,000,  and  $596,000,  respectively,  during  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2014.  Lease
operating expenses were lower for the first two quarters of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to decreased production. Production taxes
decreased for the first two quarters of 2014 as a result of decreased production. The decrease in depletion, depreciation and amortization for the first two
quarters of 2014 is a result of decreased production.
During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we had a foreign exchange loss of $916 compared to a $692,000 foreign exchange gain for the six
months  ended  June  30,  2013.  Our  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  arise  out  of  an  inter-company  indebtedness  we  owe  to  our  wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Gothic, which is payable in Canadian dollars, in addition to a note owed to a third party denominated in Canadian dollars. The foreign
exchange loss for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was caused by the weakening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar. The loss related to the
note denominated in Canadian dollars was $916 for the six months ended June 30, 2014
During the six months ended June 30, 2014 we also amended the loan with TCA. The amendment qualified as debt extinguishment and $408,000
was recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment. We recorded a gain of $2,052,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 as the result of the settlement
of disputed revenue payables to a royalty owner. During the six months ended June 30, 2013 we also extended the repayment terms and rights on a
related  party  note  which  qualified  as  debt  extinguishment.  The  additional  rights  were  valued  at  $39,953  and  were  recorded  as  a  loss  on  debt
extinguishment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
To date, our production has not been sufficient to fund our operations and drilling program. At June 30, 2014, we do not have any available
borrowing capacity and have negative working capital of approximately $10.0 million.
15
We have substantial need for capital to develop our oil and gas prospects. Since 2001, we have funded our capital expenditures and operating
activities through a series of debt and equity capital-raising transactions, drilling participations and through an increase in vendor payables and notes
payable. We expect any future capital expenditures for drilling and development to be funded from the sale of drilling participations and equity capital.
It  is  management's  plan  to  raise  additional  capital  through  the  sale  of  interests  in  our  drilling  activities  or  other  strategic  transaction;  however,  we
currently have no firm commitment from any potential investors and such additional capital may not be available to us in the future.
A Comparison of Cash Flow For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013
Our  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  was  $476,000  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2014  as  compared  to  net  cash  provided  by
operating  activities  of  $77,000  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2013,  an  increase  of  $399,000.  The  increase  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating
activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was due to an increase in working capital of $623,000 and an increase in net income of $1,083,000 and
offset by a decrease in noncash items of $1,306,000. Changes in working capital items had the effect of increasing cash flows from operating activities
by $754,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2014 mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $689,000 and along
with a decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets of $65,000. Changes in working capital items had the effect of increasing cash flows
from operating activities by $132,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to a decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets of
$68,000 along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $64,000.
We used $18,000 of net cash in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to net cash used of $104,000 in 2013.
The cash used in investing in 2014 and 2013 was for the purchase and development of oil and gas properties.
Our net cash used in financing activities was $541,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to net cash provided of $105,000 for
the same period in 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, net cash outflows from financing activities were a result of the issuance of notes of
$250,000 offset by payments against outstanding notes of $731,000, of which $45,000 was to related parties, and payments of deferred financing costs
of $60,000. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, net cash inflows from financing activities were a result of the issuance of notes, net of fees, of
$1,449,000, of which $505,000 was to related parties, offset by payments against outstanding notes of $1,294,000, of which $69,000 was to related
parties, and payments of deferred financing costs of $50,000.
We have no other commitments to expend additional funds for drilling activities for the rest of 2014.
16
How We Have Financed Our Activities
Our activities since 2002 have been financed primarily from sales of debt and equity securities and drilling participations. These transactions
during this period of time included the following, among other previously reported financing transactions we entered into during the period:
We entered into a financing agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP during the first quarter of 2012. Proceeds of the financing were
used for the drilling and completion of wells included in the Company’s inventory of proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD”). We have a commitment for 
a total amount of $3.0 million, before fees and expenses, through the issuance of a series of $1.0 million debentures. The debenture is secured by a first
priority, perfected security interest and mortgage in oil and gas leases and properties. At no time shall the investor funds advanced exceed 65% of the
drilling and completion cost of the PUD’s with the balance provided by our generated funds. During the year ended December 31, 2012, three tranches
of TCA debt totaling $3 million were issued. The total note principal balance of TCA debts and related unamortized debt discounts on December 31,
2012 are $1,608,973 and $186,791, respectively.
In  March  2013,  the  fourth  tranche  TCA  debt  of  $1  million  was  issued.  The  debt  is  due  on  March  1,  2014  and  is  payable  monthly  with  a
mandatory redemption fee equal to 10% and interest of 5%. Out of $1 million debt proceeds, $500,000 was withheld for the future development of
wells, $55,550 was paid to TCA for various fees, and net proceeds of $944,450 were received by the Company. In July 2013 an additional tranche of
$750,000 was drawn by the Company under the same terms with net proceeds of $705,825 received by the Company after the payment of fees.
The Company will also pay TCA $100,000 in cash in lieu of a stock bonus related to the issuance of the note. Fees paid and to be paid in cash
totaling $155,550 to TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP were recorded as a debt discount.
In July 2013, the fifth tranche TCA debt of $750,000 was issued. The debt is due on August 1, 2014 and is payable monthly with a mandatory
redemption fee equal to 10% and interest of 5%. Fees totaling $44,175 were paid with net proceeds of $705,825 received by the Company. Along with
the issuance of the fifth tranche TCA debt, the Company combined all the outstanding TCA debts into one debt by entering into an amended debt
agreement with TCA. The amended debt has a principal of $2,290,548, accrues interest at 5% per annum, and is due on August 1, 2014. From August 1,
2013 through November we paid the amended TCA debt in monthly installments of $230,451.
On January 29, 2014, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement with TCA Global Credit Master
Fund LP. The amendment provides for interest only payments pursuant to existing amended and restated debenture for the month of December 2013,
that all previous outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, an accommodation fee $200,000 for entering into this sixth Amendment and all
outstanding  Redemption  Premium  fees  will  comprise  the  agree  upon  outstanding  amount  of  $2,196,609.  Principal  and  interest  in  the  amount  of
$371,459  is  due  monthly,  inclusive  of  all  fees  and  redemption  amounts.  The  Company  evaluated  the  amendment  under  FASB  ASC  470-50  and 
determined that the modification was substantial and qualified as a debt extinguishment. The additional $200,000 accommodation fee and the remaining
unamortized debt discount of $208,490 and were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment. Principal payments of $645,211 for the six months ended
June 30, 2014 along with accrued interest have been made.
17
On July 31, 2012, we received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange for the issuance of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock in a
private placement. All such shares were sold at $0.06 in the private placement, resulting in gross proceeds of $420,000.
On August 13, 2012, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Palo Verde Acquisitions, LLC (“Palo Verde”), pursuant to which we 
sold to Palo Verde (1) a $2,000,000 12% unsecured Convertible Debenture due August 13, 2014 (the “First Palo Verde Debenture”) and (2) warrants to 
purchase  up  to  20,000,000  shares  of  our  common  stock  at  a  purchase  price  of  $0.23  per  share  and  expiring  on  August  13,  2014.  The  aggregate
consideration received by us from Palo Verde for the First Palo Verde Debenture and the 20 million warrants was $2,000,000.
On December 31, 2012, we sold to Palo Verde (1) a $1,000,000 12% unsecured Convertible Debenture due December 31, 2014 (the “Second Palo 
Verde Debenture”) and (2) warrants to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.23 per share and expiring on
December 31, 2014. The aggregate consideration received by us from Palo Verde for the Second Palo Verde Debenture and the 10 million warrants was
$1,000,000. On July 1, 2014, the due date of the convertible debt was extended to January 2, 2016.
Future Capital Requirements and Resources
At June 30, 2014, we do not have any available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and our current assets are $239,000 compared
with current liabilities of $10.3 million. Our current liabilities include accounts payable, revenues payable, notes payable (a portion of which is past
due), and other current obligations. We have substantial needs for funds to pay our outstanding payables and debt due during 2014. In addition, we have
substantial need for capital to develop our oil and gas prospects. At June 30, 2014, we have no commitments for additional capital to fund drilling
activities in 2014.
Since 2001, we have funded our capital expenditures and operating activities through a series of debt and equity capital-raising transactions, 
drilling participations and, during the last two quarters of 2004 and all of 2005 and 2006, through an increase in vendor payables and notes payable. It is
our intention to raise additional capital through the sale of interests in our drilling activities or other strategic transaction; however, we currently have no
firm  commitment  from  any  potential  investors  and  such  additional  capital  may  not  be  available  to  us  in  the  future.  We  expect  that  any  capital
expenditures for drilling purposes during 2014 will be funded from the sale of drilling participations and equity capital.
18
Our business strategy requires us to obtain additional financing and our failure to do so can be expected to adversely affect our ability to grow
our revenues, oil and gas reserves and achieve and maintain a significant level of revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance we will obtain
this  additional  funding.  Such  funding  may  be  obtained  through  the  sale  of  drilling  participations,  joint  ventures,  equity  securities  or  by  incurring
additional indebtedness. Without such funding, our revenues will continue to be limited and it can be expected that our operations will not be profitable.
In addition, any additional equity funding that we obtain may result in material dilution to the current holders of our common stock.

Our common shares have no trading market in the United States, and there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may
develop for our common shares, the ability of the holders of common shares to sell their common shares in the United States or the price at which
holders would be able to sell their common shares. Any future trading prices of the common shares will depend on many factors, including, among
others, our operating results and the market for similar securities.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer performed an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In 
designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures, we  recognize  that  any  controls  and  procedures,  no  matter  how  well  designed  and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
report on Form 10-Q that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) information required to be
disclosed by us in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure by us; and (ii) information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. In our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31,
2013,  we  concluded  there  were  material  weaknesses  in  our  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  which  we  viewed  as  an  integral  part  of  our
disclosure controls and procedures. See our discussion at “Item 9A (T) - Controls and Procedures” on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2013.
In  order  to  mitigate  these  material  weaknesses  to  the  fullest  extent  possible,  all  financial  reports  are  reviewed  by  the  CEO  and  CFO.  All
unexpected  results  are  investigated.  At  any  time,  if  it  appears  that  any  control  can  be  implemented  to  continue  to  mitigate  such  weaknesses,  it  is
immediately implemented. As soon as our finances allow, we will hire sufficient staff and implement appropriate procedures to address the segregation
of duties and improve the closing process.

There  were  no  significant  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  identified  in  connection  with  the  evaluation  that  occurred
during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
