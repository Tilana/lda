form of any legend or legends which shall be borne by any such Global Security in addition to or in lieu of that set

(u)           any other terms of such series.
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination, and except as may
otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.
Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) herein and unless otherwise expressly provided with respect to a series of Securities,
the Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the Securityholders of Securities of a particular series,
reopen such series of Securities and issue additional Securities (“Additional Securities”) of such series having the
same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Securities of such series, except for the
public offering price, the issue date and, if applicable, the initial interest payment date and initial interest accrual date.
Any such Additional Securities, together with the initial Securities of such series, shall constitute a single series of
Securities under this Indenture; provided that if the Additional Securities are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax
purposes with the initial Securities of such series, the Additional Securities shall be issued under a separate CUSIP
10
number. No Additional Securities may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to
the series of Securities of which such Additional Securities would be a part.
Section 2.3            Authentication. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for
authentication. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 2, the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver
said Securities to or upon the receipt of a Company Order. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive
and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
(a)           a copy of any Board Resolution relating thereto and, if applicable, an appropriate record of any action taken
pursuant to such resolution;
(b)           an executed supplemental indenture, if any, relating thereto;
(c)           an Officer’s Certificate prepared in accordance with Section 14.6 which shall also state to the knowledge of
the signers of such Certificate that no Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities shall have occurred
and be continuing; and
(d)           an Opinion of Counsel prepared in accordance with Section 14.6 to the effect
(i)            that the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or by a
supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.1 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(ii)           that the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or by a
supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.2 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(iii)          that the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver such Securities;
(iv)          that the execution and delivery of such Securities by the Company have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company;
(v)           that such Securities have been duly and validly executed, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and
issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness,
11
good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity); and
(vi)          that the execution and delivery by the Company of such Securities and the performance by the Company of
its obligations thereunder will not constitute a default under or violate any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the
organizational certificate or bylaws of the Company.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver or cause to be authenticated and delivered any
Securities under this Section 2.3 if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not
lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee, or a trust
committee of directors or trustees and/or vice presidents shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee
to personal liability to existing Securityholders.
Section 2.4            Date and Denomination of Securities. The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered
form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.2. In the absence of
any such specification with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in
minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Securities of each series
shall be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers
of the Company executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee.
Every Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
The person in whose name any Security of a particular series is registered at the close of business on any record
date (as hereinafter defined) with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the
interest payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Security upon any
registration of transfer or exchange subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date; provided,
however, that if and to the extent that the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest
payment date, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Securities of such
series are registered on a subsequent record date established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Company
to the holders of such Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date, such record date to
be not less than 10 days preceding the date of payment of such defaulted interest. Except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 2.2 for Securities of a particular series, the term “record date” as used in this Section 2.4
with respect to any regular interest payment date, shall mean, the first day of the calendar month of such interest
payment date if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of such calendar month, and shall mean the fifteenth
day of the calendar month preceding such interest payment date if such interest payment date is the first day of a
calendar month, whether or not such day shall be a Business Day.
Interest on the Securities may at the option of the Company be paid by check mailed to the persons entitled thereto at
their respective addresses as such appear on the Security Register.
Section 2.5            Execution of Securities. The Securities shall be signed in the name and on behalf of the Company
by the manual or facsimile signature of its President, its Chairman of the
12
Board, its Chief Financial Officer, its Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer, or its Secretary or Assistant Secretary. Only
such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form herein recited, executed
by the Trustee by the manual signature of an authorized officer, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Company shall
be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and
that the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before
the Securities so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company,
such Securities nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed
such Securities had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Security may be signed on behalf of the
Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the
Company, although at the date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
Section 2.6            Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Securities. Securities of any series may be exchanged
for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of the same series of other authorized denominations. Securities to
be exchanged shall be surrendered, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or agency designated and
maintained by the Company for such purpose in Denver, Colorado or the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be
designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2, and
the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the
Security or Securities which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Each person
designated by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.2 as a person authorized to register and register
transfer of the Securities is sometimes herein referred to as a “Security Registrar.”
The Company shall keep, at each such office or agency, a register for each series of Securities issued hereunder (the
registers of all Security Registrars, collectively, the “Security Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register Securities and shall register the transfer of Securities as
in this Article 2 provided. The Security Register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being
converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times the Security Registrar shall be open for
inspection by the Trustee and any Security Registrar other than the Trustee. Upon due presentment for registration or
registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any designated office or agency, the Company shall execute
and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security
or Securities of the same series for an equal aggregate principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any
Security by any Security Registrar in the Security Register maintained by such Security Registrar, and delivery of
such Security, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such
Security. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall only be one Security Register for each series of
Securities.
13
No person shall at any time be designated as or act as a Security Registrar unless such person is at such time
empowered under applicable law to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations.
All Securities presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the
Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer or
exchange in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the applicable Securityholder or his
attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities, but the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
therewith.
The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for the period
of 15 days next preceding the selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and thereafter until the date of the
mailing (or other delivery in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depositary) of a notice of redemption of
Securities of that series selected for redemption, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption
in whole or in part except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be
redeemed.
Section 2.7            Global Securities. The provisions of this Section 2.7 shall apply only to Global Securities.
(a)           Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary
designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or nominee thereof or
custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes under this
Indenture.
(b)           Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security evidencing the Securities of any
series may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities of such series registered, and no transfer of a Global
Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global
Security or a nominee thereof unless (i) such Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
continue its services as Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary has been appointed within
90 days after such notice, or (ii) such Depositary ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the
Exchange Act when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and no successor
Depositary has been appointed within 90 days of the Company becoming aware of such failure to be so registered,
(iii) the Company determines at any time that the Securities of such series shall no longer be represented by Global
Securities, in which case the Company shall inform such Depositary of such determination and participants in such
Depositary may elect to withdraw their beneficial interests in the Securities from such Depositary, or (iv) any event
shall have occurred and be continuing that, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default
with respect to such series of Securities, and such exchange is requested by or on behalf of the Depositary in
accordance with customary procedures following the request
14
of a Beneficial Owner seeking to exercise or enforce its rights under the Securities of such series.
(c)           Subject to Section 2.7(b), any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or
in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such
names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(d)           Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a
Global Security or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global
Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global
Security or a nominee thereof.
(e)           Subject to the provisions of Section 2.7(g), the registered Securityholder may grant proxies and otherwise
authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take
any action which a Securityholder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.
(f)            In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 2.7(b), (i) the Company shall
promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of such certificated Securities in definitive, fully
registered form, without interest coupons, and (ii) the Trustee shall promptly exchange each beneficial interest in the
applicable Global Security for one or more certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest
coupons, in authorized denominations having an equal aggregate principal amount registered in the name of the owner
of such beneficial interest, as identified to the Trustee by the Depositary, and thereupon such Global Security will be
deemed canceled.
(g)           Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively, the “Agent Members”) nor any
other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act, shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to
any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global
Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and
any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes
whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of
the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the
Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any
other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons
governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
Section 2.8            Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities. In case any temporary or definitive Security shall
become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company (in the case of a mutilated Security) shall, and the
Company may in its discretion (in the case of a destroyed, lost or stolen Security), execute and, upon the written
request or authorization of any officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of
the same
15
series, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security,
or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a
substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required
by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also
furnish the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security
and the ownership thereof.
Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected
therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost
or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same
(without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to
the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the
destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
Every substituted Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.8 by virtue of the fact that any Security
is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the
destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture
equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities
shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any
and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other
securities without their surrender.
Section 2.9            Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series the Company
may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten).
Temporary Securities shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive
Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate
for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Security shall be
authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same
effect, as the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall
execute and deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of such series, and thereupon any or all temporary Securities
of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or
agency to be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in Denver, Colorado or the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 or at any of such other offices or
agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose in accordance with the provisions
of Section 4.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal
aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series. Such exchange shall be made by the Company
at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged,
16
the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
definitive Securities of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.10          Cancellation of Securities Paid, Etc. All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment,
redemption, repayment, exchange or registration of transfer shall, if surrendered to the Company, any Security
Registrar, any paying agent or any other agent of the Company or of the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and
promptly cancelled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be
issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee may
dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures and deliver a certificate of such
disposition to the Company or, at the written request of the Company, shall deliver cancelled Securities to the
Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a
redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.11          Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2 for
Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months.
Section 2.12          Form of Legend for Global Securities. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2
for the Securities evidenced thereby, every Global Security authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend
in substantially the following form (or such other form as a securities exchange or Depositary may request or require):
THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER
REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK
CORPORATION (“DTC”), OR A NOMINEE OF DTC. THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES
REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN DTC OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE
BY DTC TO A NOMINEE OF DTC, OR BY A NOMINEE OF DTC TO DTC OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF DTC.
UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC, TO THE
ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY
CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS
REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO.
OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY
TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS
WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
Section 2.13          CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use “CUSIP” numbers (if then
generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to
Securityholders; provided that any such notice may
17
state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers, either as printed on the Securities or as
contained in any notice of a redemption, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers
printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such
numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any changes in the “CUSIP” numbers of any series of
Securities.
ARTICLE 3
REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES
Section 3.1            Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article 3 shall be applicable to the Securities of any
series that are redeemable before their maturity, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2 for
Securities of such series.
Section 3.2            Notice of Redemption; Selection of Securities. In case the Company shall desire to exercise any
right to redeem all, or, as the case may be, any part of, the Securities of any series in accordance with their terms, it
shall fix a date for redemption and deliver in accordance with Section 14.3 (or otherwise deliver in accordance with the
applicable procedures of the Depositary) a notice of such redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to
the date fixed for redemption to the holders of Securities of such series so to be redeemed as a whole or in part at
their last addresses as the same appear on the Security Register and to the Trustee, except as the supplemental
indenture or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors to establish the terms of any series of Securities may
otherwise provide. The notice, if delivered in the manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have
been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice in accordance
with Section 14.3 (or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depositary) or any defect
in the notice to the holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which the
Securities of such series are to be redeemed (or if not then ascertainable, the manner of calculation thereof), the
place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that any
interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, and that on and after said
date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. Where the redemption price
is not ascertainable at the time the notice of redemption is given as aforesaid, the Company shall notify the Trustee of
said redemption price promptly after the calculation thereof. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be
redeemed, the notice of redemption shall specify the number or numbers of the Securities of that series to be
redeemed. If any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon
surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of that series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof will be issued. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall
be given by the Company or, at the Company’s request and with the notice information provided to the Trustee, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, and shall be irrevocable; provided that, in the latter case,
the Company shall give the Trustee at least ten days’ prior notice of the date of the giving of the notice (unless a
shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee). Any notice of
18
redemption may be conditioned upon the Company’s having received, on or prior to the Redemption Date specified in
the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.2, sufficient funds to redeem on such Redemption Date
all the Securities or portions thereof so called for redemption, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for
redemption.
On or prior to the Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.2, the
Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own
paying agent, shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.4) an amount of money sufficient to redeem
on such Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.2 all the Securities
or portions thereof so called for redemption, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. The
Company shall give the Trustee notice not less than 35 days (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the
Trustee) prior to the Redemption Date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.2 as to
the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed, and the Trustee shall select or cause to
be selected, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Securities of that series or
portions thereof to be redeemed. Securities of a series may be redeemed in part only in multiples of the smallest
authorized denomination of that series.
Beneficial interests in Securities represented by Global Securities shall be selected for redemption by the Depositary
therefor in accordance with its standard procedures. In the case of any redemption of Securities (a) prior to the
expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or (b) pursuant to an election
of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Securities, the Company shall furnish
the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction or
condition.
Section 3.3            Payment of Securities Called for Redemption. If notice of redemption has been given as provided
in Section 3.2 or Section 3.4, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series with respect to which such notice
has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the
applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, and on
and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities or portions of such
Securities, together with any interest accrued to said date) any interest on the Securities of such series or portions of
Securities of such series so called for redemption shall cease to accrue. On presentation and surrender of such
Securities at a Place of Payment in said notice specified, the said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be
paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued thereon to,
but excluding, the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that any regularly scheduled installment of interest
becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to holders of such Securities registered as
such on the relevant record date according to their terms.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the
same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the
Security so presented.
19
Section 3.4            Repayment at the Option of the Holder. Any series of Securities may be made, by provision
contained in or established pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a Board Resolution pursuant to Section 2.2

maturity, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest to the date of
repayment, on such notice as may be required; provided, however, that the holder of a Security may only elect partial
repayment in an amount that will result in the portion of such Security that will remain Outstanding after such
repayment constituting an authorized denomination, or combination thereof, of such Securities.

before each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series, set
aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders of such Securities a sum sufficient to pay such
principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, so becoming due and shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to
take such action and of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make
any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when the same
shall become due and payable.
(c)           Anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may, at any time, for the purpose
of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the
Trustee all sums held in trust by it, or any paying agent hereunder, as required by this Section 4.4, such sums to be

to each date of payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of that series if there has been a

the Trustee and the principal paying agent, if other than the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate instructing the Trustee
and such paying agent whether such payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of that
series shall be made to holders of the Securities of that series without withholding or deduction for or on account of
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of that series. If any such withholding

be withheld or deducted on such payments to such holders and shall certify the fact that additional amounts will be
payable and the amounts so payable to each holder, and the Company shall pay to the Trustee or such paying agent
the additional amounts required to be paid by this Section 4.6. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and
any paying agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without
negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in
reliance on any Officer’s Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section 4.6.

pursuant hereto to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable in respect
thereof pursuant to such terms, and express mention of the payment of additional amounts (if applicable) in any

Outstanding Securities of such series to be due and payable immediately, then upon any such declaration the same

provided in Section 6.13.
Section 6.3            Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.  The Company covenants that if

principal or premium becomes due and payable at Maturity; or
(c)           If the Company fails to pay the money it is required to pay the Trustee pursuant to the preceding paragraph
forthwith upon the demand of the Trustee, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may
institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the money so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding
to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities
of such series and collect the monies adjudged or
25
decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities of such series wherever situated.

clause (c) or (f) of the definition thereof occurs and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series (unless,
in the case of clause (f), otherwise provided for in the terms of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 2.2),
and holders of not less than a majority, in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series
direct, so long as such holders shall have provided the Trustee with such indemnity as it shall require and subject to
the provisions of Section 6.12, the Trustee shall, proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the holders
of the Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Indenture or the Securities of such series or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein or therein, or to enforce
any other proper remedy.

may, in its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate
judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit
in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or
to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Section 6.5            Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of Securities; Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities of any series may be prosecuted and enforced by
the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities of such series or the production thereof in any proceeding
relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an
express trust, and any recovery or judgment, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, shall be for the ratable benefit of
each and every holder of a Security of such series in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities
of any series or the property of the Company or such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of
whether the principal of the Securities of such series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the
payment of any overdue principal, premium, or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise,
(a)           to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and any premium and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Securities of such series and to
26
file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
agents or counsel) and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(b)           to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to
distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each holder of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee
and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the holders of Securities
of such series, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.6.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting any of the
Securities of any series or the rights of any holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim
of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.

respect of the Company’s obligations under this Indenture, shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates
fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such moneys, upon presentation of the several Securities in respect of
which moneys have been collected, and the notation thereon of the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender
thereof if fully paid:
FIRST:                  To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6;

interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) at the Overdue Rate
applicable to such Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the person entitled thereto;
THIRD:                 If the principal of the Outstanding Securities in respect of which such moneys have been collected

interest on the overdue principal, and premium, if any, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the
Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest, if any (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
applicable law), at the

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the holder of any Security of any series shall have the right,
which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and (subject to
Section 2.4, Section 2.6, and Section 4.1) interest on, such Security of such series, on the Stated Maturity therefor
specified in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date specified in the notice of
redemption given as provided in Section 3.2) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such
right shall not be impaired without the consent of such holder.
Section 6.9            Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Securityholder has instituted any
proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such holder, then and in every such
case the Company, the Trustee and each such holder shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be
restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the
Trustee and each such holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 6.10          Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the
Trustee or to each and every holder of a Security is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy, to the extent permitted by law, shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy
given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right
or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not, to the extent permitted by law, prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 6.11          Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any
Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article 6 or by law to the Trustee or to any holder of a Security may be exercised from time to time, and as often as
may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by such holder, as the case may be.
Section 6.12          Control by Securityholders. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series, provided that:
(a)           such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or with the Securities of such
series and would not involve the Trustee in personal liability,
(b)           the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction, and
(c)           such direction is not unduly prejudicial to the rights of the other holders of Securities of such series not
joining in such action.
29
Section 6.13          Waiver of Past or Existing Defaults. The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of any series on behalf of the holders of all the Securities of such series, by notice to the
Trustee, may waive any past or existing default or Event of Default hereunder with respect to the Securities of such
series and its consequences, except a continuing default:
(a)           in the payment of the principal of, any premium or interest on the Securities of such series, or
(b)           in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that under Article 10 hereof cannot be modified or amended
without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security of such series.
Upon any such waiver, such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.14          Notice of Defaults. The Trustee shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of a default with respect
to the Securities of any series, mail to all holders of Securities of such series, as the names and addresses of such
holders appear upon the Security Register, notice of all defaults with respect to such series known to the Trustee,
unless such defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice (the term “defaults” for the
purpose of this Section 6.14 being hereby defined to be the events specified in Section 6.1 or established with respect
to such Securities as contemplated by Section 2.2, not including the periods of grace, if any, provided for therein or
established with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 2.2, and irrespective of the giving of the
notices, if any, provided for therein or established with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 2.2);
provided, however, that except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if
any, on any of the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long
as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee or directors and/or Responsible Officers of
the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the holders of Securities of
such series.
Section 6.15          Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do
so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company expressly waives (to the extent that it may lawfully
do so) all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of
any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no
such law had been enacted.
Section 6.16          Undertaking to Pay for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Security
by such holder’s acceptance thereof, shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in
any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any
action taken, omitted or suffered by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of
30
such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made
by such party litigant.
ARTICLE 7
CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE
Section 7.1            Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee. With respect to the holders of any series of Securities
issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such
series and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred with respect to such series,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. If an Event of
Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred that has not been cured or waived, the Trustee shall
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with respect to such series, and use the same
degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of his or her own affairs.
No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its
own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(a)           prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series and after the curing
or waiving of all Events of Default with respect to such series that has occurred:
(i)            the duties and obligations of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of a series shall be determined
solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of
such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall
be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii)           in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of
the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to
the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions
which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a
duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need
not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein);
(b)           the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or
Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(c)           the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with the direction of the holders of Securities of any series pursuant to Section 6.7, relating to the
time, method and place of
31
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon
the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to Securities of such series; and
(d)           none of the provisions of this Indenture shall be construed as requiring the Trustee to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise to incur any personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the
exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds
or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
The provisions of this Section 7.1 are in furtherance of and subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act.
Section 7.2            Reliance on Documents, Opinions, Etc. In furtherance of and subject to the Trust Indenture Act,
and subject to the provisions of Section 7.1:
(a)           the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or other paper or document
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
(b)           any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by
a Company Request or a Company Order (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed);
and any resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company may be evidenced to the Trustee by a Board Resolution;
(c)           the Trustee may consult with counsel and any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization
and protection in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in
accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;
(d)           the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture
at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless
such Securityholders shall have offered reasonable security and indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the
costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby;
(e)           the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith and believed by it
to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
(f)            the Trustee shall not be bound to make any inquiry or investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, note or
other paper or document unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of any series affected then Outstanding; provided, however, that if the payment within a
reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs and expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such
investigation is, in the opinion
32
of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security conferred upon it by the terms of this Indenture,
the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such costs, expenses or liabilities as a condition to so
proceeding; and the reasonable expenses of such investigation shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the
Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand;
(g)           the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either
directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or
negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;
(h)           the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any default hereunder or Event of Default, unless a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof, or unless written notice of any event that is in fact
such a default or Event of Default is received by the Trustee at the Principal Office of the Trustee and such notice
references the Securities and this Indenture;
(i)            the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation,
its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities
hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder;
(j)            in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, punitive, indirect, or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action;
(k)           the Trustee may request that the Company deliver a certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or
titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which certificate may be
signed by any person authorized to sign an Officer’s Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in
any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded; and
(l)            in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its
obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without
limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural
catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software
and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts that are consistent with
accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
Section 7.3            No Responsibility for Recitals, Etc. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities shall be
taken as the statements of the Company (except in the Trustee’s certificates of authentication), and the Trustee
assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities, provided that the Trustee shall not be relieved of its duty to
authenticate
33
Securities only as authorized by this Indenture. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the
Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof.
Section 7.4            Ownership of Securities. The Trustee and any agent of the Company or of the Trustee, in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights it would have if
it were not Trustee or such agent.
Section 7.5            Moneys to be Held in Trust. Subject to the provisions of Sections 4.4, 12.4 and 12.5, all moneys
received by the Trustee or any paying agent shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the
purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by
law. Neither the Trustee nor any paying agent shall be under any liability for interest on any moneys received by it
hereunder except such as it may agree in writing with the Company to pay thereon. So long as no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, all interest allowed on any such moneys shall be paid from time to time upon
the written order of the Company, signed by an Officer.
Section 7.6            Compensation and Expenses of Trustee. The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the
Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, reasonable compensation (which shall not be limited by
any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and, except as otherwise
expressly provided, the Company shall pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this
Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all
persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from the
Trustee’s negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee for, and
to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith
on the part of the Trustee, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust and its
duties hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability in the
premises. The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.6 to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to
pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall survive the satisfaction and discharge
of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
As security for the performance of the payment obligations of the Company under this Section 7.6, the Trustee shall
have a lien prior to the Securities of each series upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such,
except funds held in trust for the payment of principal of, and premium or interest on, particular Securities. Such lien
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Without
prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee incurs expenses or
renders services after a default or Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(e) or Section 6.1(f) hereof occurs, the
expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expense of its agents and counsel) are
intended to constitute expenses of administration under U.S. Code, Title 11 or any other similar foreign, federal or
state law for the relief of debtors.
Section 7.7            Officer’s Certificate as Evidence. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1 and Section 7.2,
whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee
34
shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering any
action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed)
may, in the absence of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be
conclusively proved and established by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such Officer’s Certificate,
in the absence of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the
Trustee for any action taken, omitted or suffered by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.
Section 7.8            Disqualification: Conflicting Interests for the Trustee. The Trustee shall comply with the provisions
of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. To the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall not
be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of
more than one series or under the Indentures between the Company and the Trustee dated as of (a) February 7, 2011,
(b) November 8, 2011, (c) July 29, 2012 and (d) May 20, 2013.
Section 7.9            Eligibility of Trustee. The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States or any State, which (a) is authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers and (b) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority and (c) shall have
at all times a combined capital and surplus of not less than $10,000,000. If such corporation publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law, or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section 7.9, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation at any time shall be
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. No
obligor upon this Indenture of any Securities or person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with such obligor shall serve as Trustee. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.9, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in Section 7.10.
The provisions of this Section 7.9 are in furtherance of and subject to Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act.
Section 7.10          Resignation or Removal of Trustee.
(a)           The Trustee, or any Trustee or Trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to any
one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Company and by mailing notice of
such resignation to the holders of the applicable series of Securities at their addresses as they shall appear on the
Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor
Trustee or Trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed in the name of
and on behalf of the Company by a duly authorized officer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the
resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed with
respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, or any
Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities of the
35
applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 6.14, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor Trustee. Such court may
thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.
(b)           In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
(i)            the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act with respect
to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a
bona fide holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or
(ii)           the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.9 and Section 310(a) of
the Trust Indenture Act with respect to any series of Securities and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by
the Company or by any such Securityholder; or
(iii)          the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take
charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to such series and appoint a successor
Trustee with respect to such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed in the name of and on behalf of the
Company by a duly authorized officer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and
one copy to the successor Trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 6.14, any Securityholder who has been a
bona fide holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any,
as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to such
series.
(c)           The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of one or more series (each series
voting as a class) or all series at the time Outstanding may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series
or all series, as the case may be, and appoint with respect to the applicable series or all series, as the case may be,
a successor Trustee by written notice of such action to the Company, the Trustee and the successor Trustee.
(d)           Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor
Trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 7.10 shall become effective upon
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided in Section 7.11.
36
(e)           No predecessor Trustee shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any successor Trustee.
Section 7.11          Acceptance by Successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 7.10
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to any or all
applicable series shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance,
shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the
Company or of the successor Trustee, the Trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment (or due provision therefor) of
any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to
such successor Trustee all the rights and powers with respect to such series of the Trustee so ceasing to act. Upon
request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing in order more
fully and certainly to vest in and confirm to such successor Trustee all such rights and powers.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all)
series, the Company, the predecessor Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any
applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as
shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue
to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being
understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be Trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any
trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee.
No successor Trustee with respect to a series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 7.11
unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall, with respect to such series, be qualified under
Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act and eligible under the provisions of Section 7.9.
Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee with respect to any series as provided in this Section 7.11,
the Company shall give notice thereof to the holders of Securities of each series affected, by mailing such notice to
such holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security Register. If the Company fails to mail such
notice within ten days after the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall
cause such notice to be given at the expense of the Company.
Section 7.12          Succession by Merger, Etc. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted
or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to
which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, shall be the successor to the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be qualified
under
37
Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act and eligible under the provisions of Section 7.9, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.
If at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trust created by this Indenture with respect to one or
more series of Securities, any of such Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such
successor to the Trustee by merger, conversion or consolidation may adopt the certificate of authentication of any
predecessor Trustee, and deliver such Security so authenticated; and in case at that time any of such Securities shall
not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of
such successor to the Trustee or, if such successor to the Trustee is a successor by merger, conversion or
consolidation, the name of any predecessor hereunder; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force
which it is anywhere in such Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
Section 7.13          Appointment of Authenticating Agent. The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents
which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities issued upon original issue and
upon exchange, registration of transfer, or partial conversion or partial redemption or pursuant to Section 2.8, and
Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all
purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the
authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee’s certificate of authentication, such reference
shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a
certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent
shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the
laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act
as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $10,000,000 and subject to
supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section 7.13, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.13, such
Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section 7.13.
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,
or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be
a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent,
shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided that such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this
Section 7.13, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company.
The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such

CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS
Section 8.1            Action of Securityholders. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a specified
percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series may take any action (including the
making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the
fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be
evidenced (a) by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such Securityholders in
person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by the record of such Securityholders of Securities voting in
favor thereof at any meeting of such Securityholders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of
Article 9, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of such
Securityholders.
Section 8.2            Proof of Execution by Securityholders. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1, Section 7.2 and
Section 9.6, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy shall be sufficient if
made in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such
manner as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the
Security Register.
The record of any Securityholders’ meeting shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 9.7.
The Company may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Securityholders of Securities of any
series entitled to vote or consent to or revoke any action referred to in Section 8.1, which record date may be set at
any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or
reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and
thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, with respect to Securities of any series, only Securityholders
of Securities of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke
such vote or consent.
Section 8.3            Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or
of the Trustee may deem the person in whose name any Security shall
39
be registered upon the books of the Company to be, and may treat him as, the owner of such Security (whether or not
such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose
of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.4) interest, if any,
on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company
or of the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any holder for the
time being, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Security.
No Beneficial Owner of a beneficial interest in any Global Security held on its behalf by a Depositary shall have any
rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and such Depositary may be treated by the
Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such Security for all purposes
whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests of a Global Security or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests.
Section 8.4            Company-Owned Securities Disregarded. In determining whether the holders of the requisite
aggregate principal amount of Securities have concurred in any demand, request, notice, direction, consent or waiver
under this Indenture, Securities that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to
that such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct
or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such
determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such
determination; provided that, for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any
such demand, request, notice, direction, consent or waiver, only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned
shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding
for the purposes of this Section 8.4 if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right
to vote such Securities and that the pledgee is not a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under
direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In the case of a dispute as to such
right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee.
Section 8.5            Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound. At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing
to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.1, of the taking of any action by the holders of the percentage in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection
with such action, any holder of a Security which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders
of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at its principal office and upon
proof of holding as provided in Section 8.2, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as
aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and
upon all future holders of such Security, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon
such Security or any Security issued in exchange or substitution therefor.

such series; or
(n)           to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of holders of Outstanding Securities in

provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holder of each Security of

an amount sufficient or (y) Government Obligations, the scheduled payments of interest and principal in respect
thereof in accordance with their terms shall be sufficient, or a combination of (x) and (y) that shall be sufficient (in the
opinion of a nationally recognized Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee, which opinion need be given only if Government Obligations have been so
deposited), without consideration of any reinvestment to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such
Securities then Outstanding, including the principal of, and any premium and interest on, such Securities, to the date
of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Maturity thereof (including
earlier redemption), as the case may be;
(b)           the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company with respect
to the Outstanding Securities of such series; and
(c)           the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with
respect to the Securities of such series have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to any series of Securities, the
obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.6, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 7.5, if
money, Government Obligations, or a combination thereof shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to
subclause (ii) of clause (a) of this Section 12.1, and the obligations of the Company and the Trustee with respect to
the Securities of such series under Section 2.6, Section 2.7, Section 2.8, Section 2.9, Section 4.2, Section 4.4 and
Section 12.5 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
49
Section 12.2          Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.
(a)           Legal defeasance of the Securities of any series under Section 12.2(b) and covenant defeasance of the
Securities of any series under Section 12.2(c) shall be applicable to the Securities of each series, and the Company
may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such Securities, elect to have Section 12.2(b) or
Section 12.2(c) be applied to the Outstanding Securities of any series upon compliance with the conditions set forth
below in this Section 12.2.
(b)           Upon the Company’s exercise of the legal defeasance option above applicable to this Section 12.2(b) with
respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations
with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series on the date the conditions set forth in clause (d) of this
Section 12.2 are satisfied (hereinafter, “legal defeasance”). For this purpose, such legal defeasance shall mean that
the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding
Securities of such series, which shall thereafter be deemed to be “Outstanding” only for the purposes of the Sections
of this Indenture referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) immediately below, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations
under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of
the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive
until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the rights of holders of the Outstanding Securities of such
series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in clause (d) of this Section 12.2 and as more fully set forth in
such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Securities of
such series when such payments are due, (ii) the obligations of the Company and the Trustee under Section 2.6,
Section 2.7, Section 2.8, Section 2.9, Section 4.2, Section 4.4, Section 12.3 and Section 12.5 with respect to the
Securities of such series, (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, and (iv) this
Section 12.2. The Company may exercise its option under this Section 12.2(b) notwithstanding the prior exercise of
its option under clause (c) of this Section 12.2 with respect to the Securities of such series.
(c)           Upon the Company’s exercise of the above covenant defeasance option above applicable to this
Section 12.2(c) with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company shall be released from its obligations with
respect to the Securities of such series to comply with any term, provision or condition under Section 11.1 and
Section 4.7 (or any additional covenants applicable to any series of Securities as set forth in the related Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture) on and after the date the conditions set forth in clause (d) of this Section 12.2
are satisfied (hereinafter, “covenant defeasance”), and the Securities of such series shall thereafter be deemed to
be not “Outstanding” for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of holders (and the
consequences of any thereof) in connection with any such covenant, but shall continue to be deemed “Outstanding”
for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance shall mean that, with respect to the
Outstanding Securities of such series the Company may omit to comply with, and shall have no liability in respect of,
any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any
reference elsewhere herein to any such
50
covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and
such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 6.1(d) or otherwise with
respect to the Securities of such series, as the case may be, insofar as it relates to Section 11.1 and Section 4.7,
but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of such series shall be unaffected
thereby; provided that notwithstanding a covenant defeasance with respect to Section 11.1, any Person to whom a
sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made pursuant to Section 11.1, shall as a
condition to such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition, assume by an indenture
supplemental hereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed by such successor Person and delivered to the
Trustee, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.6 and the second to the last paragraph of this
Section 12.2.
(d)           The following shall be the conditions to application of clause (b) or (c) of this Section 12.2 to the
Outstanding Securities of any series:
(i)            The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another
trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 7.9 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Section 12.2
applicable to it) as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series for the
purpose of making the following payments, (x) money in an amount sufficient or (y) Government Obligations, the
scheduled payments of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms shall be sufficient, or a
combination of (x) and (y) that shall be sufficient (in the opinion of a nationally recognized Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, which opinion need be
given only if Government Obligations have been so deposited), without consideration of any reinvestment to pay and
discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities then Outstanding, including the principal of, and any premium
and interest on, such Securities, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and
payable) or to Maturity thereof (including earlier redemption), as the case may be.
(ii)           Such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound.
(iii)          No Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series or event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such deposit (other than an Event of Default resulting from noncompliance with any
covenant from which the Company is released upon effectiveness of such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance,
as applicable).
(iv)          In the case of an election under clause (b) of this Section 12.2, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that
51
(A)          the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a letter ruling, or there has been published by
the Internal Revenue Service a Revenue Ruling, or
(B)          since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax
law,
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the holders of the Outstanding
Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such
defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred.
(v)           In the case of an election under clause (c) of this Section 12.2, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be
subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.
(vi)          The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent to the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under clause (b) or (c) of this
Section 12.2 (as the case may be) have been complied with.
(vii)         If the Securities of such series are to be redeemed prior to Stated Maturity, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been
made.
Following the deposit referred to in clause (d) of this Section 12.2, the Trustee, upon the request and at the cost and
expense of the Company, will acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company’s obligations under the Securities
of such series and this Indenture with respect to such series except for the surviving obligations specified above.
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge, imposed on or assessed
against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to this Section 12.2 or the principal or interest received in
respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the holders of the
Outstanding Securities of any series.
Anything in this Section 12.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from
time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds
therefrom) held by it as provided in clause (d) of this Section 12.2 that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee,
are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a legal defeasance or
covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 12.2.
52
Section 12.3          Application of Trust Money. All money and Government Obligations (including the proceeds
thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section 12.3, the Trustee
and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the “Trustee”) pursuant to Section 12.1 or Section 12.2 in
respect of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance
with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any paying agent
(including the Company acting as its own paying agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled
thereto, of the principal, premium, if any, and interest for whose payment such money has or Government Obligations
have been deposited with or received by the Trustee; but such money and Government Obligations need not be
segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Section 12.4          Paying Agent to Repay Moneys Held. Upon the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture all
moneys then held by any paying agent of the Securities (other than the Trustee) shall, upon demand of the Company,
be repaid to the Company or paid to the Trustee, and thereupon such paying agent shall be released from all further
liability with respect to such moneys.
Section 12.5          Return of Unclaimed Moneys. Any moneys and Government Obligations deposited with or paid to
the Trustee for payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on Securities of any series and not
applied but remaining unclaimed by the holders of Securities of such series for two years after the date upon which
the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series, as the case may be, shall have
become due and payable, shall be repaid to the Company by the Trustee on written demand; and the holders of any
Securities of such series shall thereafter look only to the Company for any payment which such holders may be
entitled to collect and all liability of the Trustee with respect to such money shall thereupon cease.
Section 12.6          Reinstatement. If and for so long as the Trustee is unable to apply any money or Government
Obligations held in trust pursuant to Section 12.1 or 12.2 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order
or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the
Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the Securities will be reinstated as though no such deposit in trust
had been made. If the Company makes any payment of principal of or interest on any Securities because of the
reinstatement of its obligations, it will be subrogated to the rights of the Securityholders of such Securities to receive
such payment from the money or Government Obligations held in trust.
Section 12.7          Qualifying Trustee. Any trustee appointed pursuant to Section 12.2 for the purpose of holding trust
funds deposited pursuant to that Section shall be appointed under an agreement and shall provide to the Trustee a
certificate of such trustee, upon which certificate the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely, that all conditions
precedent provided for herein to the related legal defeasance or covenant defeasance have been complied with. In no
event shall the Trustee be liable for any acts or omissions of said trustee.
