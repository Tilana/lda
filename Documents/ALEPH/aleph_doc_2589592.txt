‘ WHY FERTILISER.....
- Growing global population
- Decreasing arable land per person
- Asian middle class to grow to 3 Billion people by 2030
- Australian agriculture challenge: rising to meet the demand
WHY SOP.....
- Supply constrained premium source of essential plant nutrient K
- Import replacement opportunity in Australia (+ chance to displace MOP!)
- Low salinity index = NIL chlorine introduced into soil, + Sulphur
- Overseas experience: brine SOP production has the lowest OPEX
WHY GOLDPHYRE.....
- Size, grade and lithology
- Location with logistics close to Australian market
- Simple, proven extraction method
- Value and peer comparisons

42:373.;  7.0 Simple Abstraction Method
t: ,4  '
\ \1- r ' ' . .
 ‘ Pumping v Trenchlng

The stratigraphy at the Lake Wells Project suits bore pumping, a proven abstraction

methodology with lower CAPEX than trenching

1. Crystal Peak Minerals Inc. estimate US$49mil|ion for playa/trench infrastructure at its
proposed 300ktpa SOP evaporation operation in the US

2. GPH is installing test-production bores for c.$125,000 each which become production
bores after testing — a full production bore field is significantly cheaper and simpler than a
trench network

Most major brine producers (inc. lithium), worldwide, utilise bore abstraction methods:

- Orocobre’s Olaroz Lithium Facility in Argentina extracts its brine using bores

- SQM’s Salar de Atacama in Chile extracts its brine using bores

- Rockwood Lithium in Chile extracts its brine using bores

In the eastern Goldﬁelds of Western Australia, brine abstraction from bore fields is common and high-yielding:

- Murrin Murrin 12G| per year

- Mt Keith 12G| per year

- St Ives 12G| per year

- Management’s strategy to exploit all options in ensuring the Lake Wells Potash
Project is developed quickly (first to market) and at the most efficient CAPEX spend

- Ideally located closest to logistics solution, which is vital for a bulk project

- Simple, tried and common bore field brine abstraction method proposed, without the
need for the more expensive, larger footprint trenching requirement

- High-grade core to the Resource located close to proposed evaporation pond sites

- Highly conducive sediment lithologies, with test-production bore pumping trial to
commence (see below)

- High demand, high value premium fertiliser product (SOP), with strong incentive to
capture the import replacement and first to market opportunity currently existing in
Australia

- Strong, supportive and highly experienced shareholder base in alignment with
management’s strategy

- Several potential share price accretive catalysts to unroll over the next 6 months
