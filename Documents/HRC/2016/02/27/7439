</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In October 2014, the Government of Colombia and the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights renewed, to 31 October 2016, the 1996 agreement that 
</p>
<p>established the country office of the High Commissioner in Colombia (OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Colombia). While reiterating the original mandate, the High Commissioner and the 
</p>
<p>Government agreed that, should an agreement for the termination of the conflict between 
</p>
<p>the Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&#8211;People&#8217;s Army 
</p>
<p>(FARC-EP) be signed, cooperation could be reformulated to include support to implement 
</p>
<p>relevant aspects of the peace accords.  
</p>
<p>2. OHCHR has offices in Bogota, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cali, Quibd&#243;, Medell&#237;n, 
</p>
<p>Neiva, Pasto and Villavicencio, prioritizing work in approximately 80 communities, mostly 
</p>
<p>in rural areas affected by the armed conflict. OHCHR-Colombia continued to contribute to 
</p>
<p>positive change through its monitoring, advocacy, public statements, good offices and 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation. It submitted periodic reports to government entities; acted as a 
</p>
<p>facilitator in conflicts affecting the rights of vulnerable communities; interacted daily with 
</p>
<p>the State and civil society to find solutions to human rights challenges; and contributed to 
</p>
<p>strengthening institutions.  
</p>
<p>3. In 2014, the OHCHR-Colombia reviewed its operations to transition from scenarios 
</p>
<p>of armed conflict to post-conflict scenarios. Its new agenda prioritizes activities on support 
</p>
<p>for victims of violations, land restitution, reparation, transitional justice, social dialogue and 
</p>
<p>other post-conflict issues, aimed at empowering communities and increasing the impact of 
</p>
<p>its advocacy with national and local authorities. In 2014, OHCHR conducted a study 
</p>
<p>documenting how the Government&#8217;s cooperation with the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>system has contributed to the improvement of the human rights situation in Colombia over 
</p>
<p>the past 16 years.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>4. In March and May 2014, legislative and presidential elections were held. President 
</p>
<p>Juan Manuel Santos was re-elected to a second four-year term and sworn in on 7 August.  
</p>
<p>5. Peace negotiations with FARC-EP continued in 2014. On 10 June, the Government 
</p>
<p>and the National Liberation Army (ELN) announced that they had begun talks seeking to 
</p>
<p>establish a general agreement to initiate peace negotiations. 
</p>
<p>6. Two years into the peace negotiations, the Government and FARC-EP have made 
</p>
<p>unprecedented progress towards ending five decades of armed conflict. In September, they 
</p>
<p>made public the preliminary agreements reached on rural reform, political participation and 
</p>
<p>illicit drugs. The parties also created a gender subcommission to review the agreements 
</p>
<p>from a gender perspective. The agreements make it clear that sustainable peace would be 
</p>
<p>pursued through rights-based structural changes focused on improving the lives of those 
</p>
<p>affected by the conflict. The peace negotiations encountered obstacles, including tensions 
</p>
<p>between institutions and political parties. On 16 November, the President suspended the 
</p>
<p>talks following the capture by FARC-EP of an army general and other military and related 
</p>
<p>personnel. Following the release of the captives, the parties agreed to resume talks on 10 
</p>
<p>December. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2014, the negotiators began discussions on the agenda item on victims of human 
</p>
<p>rights and international humanitarian law violations during the conflict. In a joint statement </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>outlining 10 principles to guide the discussion, the Government and FARC-EP 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that peace could only be achieved based on the recognition of past human 
</p>
<p>rights violations, on efforts to restore the rights of victims and on the participation of 
</p>
<p>victims in the peace process.
1
 The statement was followed by forums on and for victims 
</p>
<p>and by the unprecedented decision to hear, in person at the negotiating table, the 
</p>
<p>testimonies of 60 victims of violations committed by all parties.2 The process ensured that 
</p>
<p>victims invited to speak represented geographic, ethnic, gender, age and sexual orientation 
</p>
<p>diversity. The United Nations system (including OHCHR), the National University of 
</p>
<p>Colombia and the Catholic Church contributed to the organization of victims&#8217; forums and 
</p>
<p>their participation in the peace process. The High Commissioner considers that the 
</p>
<p>participation of victims is a means to empower and reframe them as survivors, rights 
</p>
<p>holders and contributors to peace. The restoration of their rights can transform the 
</p>
<p>conditions that contribute to the conflict. A negotiated end to the conflict could greatly 
</p>
<p>improve the human rights situation, not only by bringing an end to violence and conflict-
</p>
<p>related violations, but also by addressing issues such as rural development and political 
</p>
<p>participation.  
</p>
<p>8. Building on past Colombian efforts to learn from other international experiences, 
</p>
<p>mechanisms under discussion for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of 
</p>
<p>members of armed groups should take into account the lack of success in other peace 
</p>
<p>processes in preventing demobilized fighters from being recruited by criminal organizations 
</p>
<p>or armed groups. Priority attention should be given to the demobilization and reintegration 
</p>
<p>of children, preferably through an action plan that takes into account problems of access to 
</p>
<p>education and health care in most of rural Colombia and the risks of re-victimization or 
</p>
<p>recruitment by other groups.  
</p>
<p>9. Displacement continues, with yearly averages of 250,000 displaced persons since 
</p>
<p>2010. Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians suffer disproportionally from 
</p>
<p>displacement, even in urban areas such as Buenaventura and Tumaco. Violence in 
</p>
<p>marginalized areas of large and medium-sized cities limits the availability of safe zones for 
</p>
<p>relocation and perpetuates the displacement crisis.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Government and State institutions 
</b></p>
<p>10. OHCHR-Colombia collaborates with a wide range of State institutions, building 
</p>
<p>partnerships that contribute to improving the human rights situation, including with local 
</p>
<p>authorities in prioritized communities. The Colombian Constitution and national laws 
</p>
<p>provide a robust human rights framework that is, however, unevenly implemented across 
</p>
<p>the country. Unwillingness to accept responsibility for past extrajudicial executions has 
</p>
<p>undermined progress. Further progress has also been impeded by formalism and 
</p>
<p>bureaucratic hurdles.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR-Colombia continues to support the National Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>International Humanitarian Law System created in 2011.3 In September 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Government restructured its human rights programme, repositioning it directly in the 
</p>
<p>Presidency.4 A Minister-Counsellor on Post-conflict, Human Rights and Security was 
</p>
<p>appointed and a Human Rights Advisory Office was created under the Minister-Counsellor, 
</p>
<p>replacing the Presidential Human Rights Programme. It is too early to determine the impact

<p>of the abolishment of the presidential programmes for the comprehensive development of 
</p>
<p>the indigenous populations and for the Afro-Colombian, Negra, Palanquera and Raizal 
</p>
<p>populations but OHCHR will continue to monitor developments.  
</p>
<p>12. The High Commissioner appreciates the work of the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office 
</p>
<p>(<i>Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo</i>). Its interventions at a regional level, for example in the Choc&#243; 
</p>
<p>department,5 carried out jointly with OHCHR and other United Nations agencies, were 
</p>
<p>good examples of cooperation.  
</p>
<p>13. OHCHR-Colombia continued to work with the municipal ombudsperson&#8217;s offices 
</p>
<p>(<i>personer&#237;as municipales</i>), providing advice and capacity-building to the National 
</p>
<p>Federation of Municipal Ombudspersons and direct support in prioritized communities. 
</p>
<p>Municipal ombudsperson&#8217;s offices have critically insufficient human and material 
</p>
<p>resources. A proposed 2014 reform to address those shortcomings failed. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner considers it important to strengthen both the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office and 
</p>
<p>municipal ombudsperson&#8217;s offices, given their capacity to work throughout the country and 
</p>
<p>their potential to contribute to post-conflict peacebuilding.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of the human rights situation  
</b></p>
<p>14. The human rights context in Colombia is complex and multilayered. The country 
</p>
<p>has historically been characterized by asymmetric economic power and unequal access to 
</p>
<p>rights and public services. The 50 years of armed conflict have deeply divided the 
</p>
<p>population and created a culture of allies and enemies. The State has at times turned a blind 
</p>
<p>eye to violations committed by perceived allies, while viewing other sectors as possible 
</p>
<p>enemies, reinforcing patterns of inequality and alienation. Another layer is the modern and 
</p>
<p>growing Colombia, where rights and equality before the law are the predominant values. 
</p>
<p>For example, 25 years ago, urban middle-class human rights defenders would often be 
</p>
<p>considered enemies of the State as the armed conflict dominated mindsets. That has now 
</p>
<p>changed for many urban defenders. However, many rural human rights defenders still 
</p>
<p>confront hostility and a counter-insurgency construct. It is important to understand the 
</p>
<p>continuing dynamics between the layers, each dominated by different constructs (rule of 
</p>
<p>law, armed conflict, socioeconomic exclusion), to better facilitate positive human rights 
</p>
<p>change.  
</p>
<p>15. State presence is unequal in different geographic areas and social strata, affecting the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights. The most economically developed parts of Colombia, best 
</p>
<p>represented by prosperous areas of Bogota and other major cities, are vibrant and an 
</p>
<p>economic and cultural reference in the continent. Other realities are dominant in much of 
</p>
<p>rural Colombia, marginalized urban areas, ethnic communities, remote mining outposts and 
</p>
<p>areas affected by armed conflict and crime. This &#8220;other Colombia&#8221; suffers most from 
</p>
<p>violence, displacement, unequal access to health care, education, water, security, justice and 
</p>
<p>other services. It is still grounded on the discourses of armed conflict and socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>exclusion.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, OHCHR, Office for the Coordination 
</p>
<p>of Humanitarian Affairs, press release:

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>16. Basic access to health care and to education are recognized rights under Colombian 
</p>
<p>law, yet their distribution is skewed in favour of prosperous areas, when in fact those 
</p>
<p>services are necessary to break down existing inequalities. Even within a single department, 
</p>
<p>there is a striking difference between services available in different municipalities that goes 
</p>
<p>beyond the normal rural-urban divide. For instance, in the Department of Magdalena, 68 
</p>
<p>per cent of a specific basket of public services are concentrated in the municipality of Santa 
</p>
<p>Marta, while 21 of the remaining 29 municipalities are each home to less than 1 per cent of 
</p>
<p>this basket of services.6 Differences with respect to violence are also noteworthy, even 
</p>
<p>within a single city. For instance, in Cali, a city with one of the highest murder rates, 
</p>
<p>murders tend to be concentrated in specific neighbourhoods. By opening new offices, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR seeks to partner more effectively with the Government to help transform those 
</p>
<p>areas affected by conflict, violence and poverty. 
</p>
<p>17. Until these inequalities are addressed, human rights challenges will continue to 
</p>
<p>plague Colombia. Economic growth and resource exploitation can have negative impacts, 
</p>
<p>such as water scarcity, cultural decay, social conflict and environmental damage. This 
</p>
<p>affects the rights of vulnerable rights holders without being balanced by other positive 
</p>
<p>aspects such as infrastructure and public services, which tend to be concentrated in the 
</p>
<p>booming cities. Inequality goes well beyond socioeconomic rights and squarely violates 
</p>
<p>political rights, since those marginalized rights holders have reduced possibilities to 
</p>
<p>influence decisions that affect them. Structurally, the vibrant cities have greater political 
</p>
<p>power due to their populations and budget. Cases of corruption and links between local 
</p>
<p>economic elites and criminal networks further undermine the rights to political participation 
</p>
<p>and prior consultation that are designed to level the playing field.  
</p>
<p>18. Innovative approaches7 are needed for all Colombians to share the benefits and costs 
</p>
<p>of economic development; there is a need to prioritize expenditure of income generated 
</p>
<p>from economic development to progressively reduce the gaps in human rights enjoyment. 
</p>
<p>The exercise of economic, social and cultural rights should not be determined by place of 
</p>
<p>residence,8 whether a person lives in an urban or rural area, in a prosperous suburb or in an 
</p>
<p>ethnic community.  
</p>
<p>19. The prospects of a negotiated end to the armed conflict and economic growth 
</p>
<p>provide a unique opportunity to expand State presence, address inequality and improve 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights. This effort would require the commitment of all State 
</p>
<p>actors, with the support of demobilized armed groups and all society. Peace would also 
</p>
<p>require a culture of tolerance that defuses political polarization. Colombia is large enough 
</p>
<p>to accommodate different visions of development: exploitation of mineral resources, 
</p>
<p>industrialized agribusinesses and large-scale energy production can co-exist with 
</p>
<p>community-based mining, family farming, protection of traditional cultures of indigenous 
</p>
<p>and Afro-Colombian communities, and environmental protection.

</b></p>
<p>women and children face the greatest obstacles to enjoying their economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights. According to the National Department of Statistics (DANE), 24.8 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the population lives in poverty.
9
 In urban areas, the poverty rate is 18.5 per cent, while in 
</p>
<p>rural areas it is 45.9 per cent. Colombia is an upper-middle-income country, but one of the 
</p>
<p>most unequal in the region. 
</p>
<p>21. Choc&#243; Department, populated mostly by Afro-Colombians (82.1 per cent) and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples (12.7 per cent),10 provides a blatant example of inequality. Choc&#243; has 
</p>
<p>the highest percentage of population in monetary poverty: 63.1 per cent, in contrast with 
</p>
<p>Bogota, which has the lowest percentage, at 10.2 per cent.
11
</p>
<p> Those living in rural areas 
</p>
<p>suffer most from the negation of rights that characterizes poverty.  
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR-Colombia has offered assistance with Department for Social Prosperity 
</p>
<p>initiatives aimed at improving the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. Those 
</p>
<p>include More Families in Action (M&#225;s Familias en Acci&#243;n), a cash transfer programme for 
</p>
<p>families, conditioned upon children&#8217;s enrolment in school and having medical check-ups. 
</p>
<p>The United Network (Red Unidos) strategy, involving inter-institutional coordination, 
</p>
<p>assists extremely poor families through family and community support. Since poverty 
</p>
<p>unequally affects women,
12
</p>
<p> it is commendable that the More Families in Action programme 
</p>
<p>pays subsidies directly to women and includes benchmarks on women&#8217;s health and violence 
</p>
<p>against women. Regretfully, children with cognitive disability do not have access to the 
</p>
<p>subsidies because they do not enter the educational system. In 2015, OHCHR-Colombia 
</p>
<p>hopes to develop its work with the National Agency for the Eradication of Extreme 
</p>
<p>Poverty. 
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR notes that, particularly in rural areas, health services do not achieve 
</p>
<p>minimum standards of availability, access, acceptability and quality. For example, Afro-
</p>
<p>Colombians and indigenous children in Choc&#243; Department continue to die of preventable 
</p>
<p>and treatable diseases, such as gastroenteritis and respiratory infections, owing to obstacles 
</p>
<p>in access to adequate health services, clean water and basic sanitation. The maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality rate in the department is 341.63 per 100,000 live births, while in Bogota it is 
</p>
<p>42.05. Mortality of children under one year is 42.69 per 1,000 live births in Choc&#243;, 
</p>
<p>compared to 12.88 in Bogota.
13
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>24. The Ombudsperson&#8217;s 2014 special report on Choc&#243; noted that at least 95 indigenous 
</p>
<p>children under the age of five died of acute diarrhea, some belonging to communities of 
</p>
<p>people who returned to the Alto Andagueda area following land restitution.
14
</p>
<p> In Riosucio 
</p>
<p>municipality, the OHCHR-Colombia collected information on nine children who died from 
</p>
<p>acute diarrhea or respiratory infections between July 2013 and August 2014. The office is 
</p>
<p>working with the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office, the Victims Unit and others to address the 
</p>
<p>situation.

<p>25. The High Commissioner stresses how important it is that the State, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with its international obligations, invest to the maximum of its available resources15 in 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>26. Lack of political participation in decisions affecting those living in areas of mineral 
</p>
<p>exploitation, especially indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, continues to lead to 
</p>
<p>social unrest. Their right to prior consultation with regard to economic projects 
</p>
<p>implemented in their territories is still widely ignored. Although Colombia recognizes 
</p>
<p>international law, some high-level government officials have also publicly presented prior 
</p>
<p>consultation rights as an obstacle to development. Government legislative proposals to 
</p>
<p>regulate consultations limit the right of participation in the procedures for obtaining permits 
</p>
<p>and exploitation licences with regard to resource extraction and construction of 
</p>
<p>infrastructure in ethnic territories.  
</p>
<p>27. Large-scale economic activities, such as mining, raise concerns due to their 
</p>
<p>environmental and social impact, including pollution of water sources that affects food 
</p>
<p>production. Some ethnic communities have attributed increased child mortality in recent 
</p>
<p>years to mining that affects the water in their territories. There is a need for more 
</p>
<p>transparency, as well as scientific capacity to conduct adequate environmental impact 
</p>
<p>studies that are made accessible to State entities, such as the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office, and to 
</p>
<p>the public.  
</p>
<p>28. There has been a lack of significant progress in the 124 territorial protection 
</p>
<p>petitions made by ethnic communities through Constitutional Court mechanisms.16  
</p>
<p>29. Importantly, the Government and ethnic communities have nonetheless opened and 
</p>
<p>maintained dialogue. OHCHR-Colombia often facilitates that dialogue at national and 
</p>
<p>regional levels. 
</p>
<p>30. Social protests in 2014, such as the National Agrarian Strike and the Mining Strike, 
</p>
<p>were addressed by the Government through dialogue and negotiation. The agrarian 
</p>
<p>negotiating platform (Mesa &#218;nica Nacional de la Cumbre Agraria, &#201;tnica, Campesina y 
</p>
<p>Popular) brought together different rural movements in a national dialogue with the 
</p>
<p>Government. OHCHR-Colombia was asked to facilitate, moderate and provide technical 
</p>
<p>verification for the platform&#8217;s subcommission on human rights and guarantees. The office 
</p>
<p>also played a role in local and regional negotiating platforms. It facilitated agreements in 
</p>
<p>Cauca between the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia and the Government, 
</p>
<p>and assisted, and promoted international standards in, the Mesa de Putumayo, Mesa Minera 
</p>
<p>Nacional and Mesa Minera del Choc&#243; negotiating platforms. Those processes have created 
</p>
<p>a positive change in the relations of social movements with the Government, although 
</p>
<p>progress in obtaining and implementing agreements is mixed.  
</p>
<p>31. In July 2014, the Presidential Programme for Human Rights launched national 
</p>
<p>guidelines on businesses and human rights.17 Nevertheless, a public policy to define the 
</p>
<p>legal framework for business respect for human rights is still required and will be even 
</p>
<p>more pressing given the central role that the private sector should have in the sustainability 
</p>
<p>of peace efforts. Clear guidelines on environmental protection, prior consultation and 
</p>
<p>labour rights, as well as business commitments to the progressive advancement of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, are also needed.

<p>32. Corporate initiatives for human rights integration into business operations, such as 
</p>
<p>the Global Compact, Gu&#237;as Colombia (an initiative bringing together businesses, civil 
</p>
<p>society and Government) and the Mining and Energy Committee for Security and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, were strengthened in 2014, showing a growing trend for businesses operating in 
</p>
<p>Colombia to embrace the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Colombia contributed to the Gu&#237;as Colombia initiative by supporting the production of the 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on Decent Work and Land Acquisition.  
</p>
<p>33. Despite such progress, conflicts between businesses and communities persisted at 
</p>
<p>the local level. Some communities claimed that their economic, social, cultural and 
</p>
<p>environmental rights had been curtailed by oil, mining and power generation projects. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR-Colombia promoted dialogue between businesses and communities, observing 
</p>
<p>progress in the commitment of certain corporations. However, businesses need to integrate 
</p>
<p>the human rights perspective in their operations and business plans so that they take into 
</p>
<p>account human rights concerns and include preventive and mitigating measures. The office 
</p>
<p>is developing pilot projects on these issues, for example in El Bagre, Antioquia. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Victim reparation and land restitution  
</b></p>
<p>34. The High Commissioner welcomes the third year of implementation of the Victims 
</p>
<p>and Land Restitution Law (Law 1448/2011) and the decrees on reparation to indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples, Afro-Colombians and Roma.
18
</p>
<p> It commends the work of the Victims Unit and the 
</p>
<p>Land Restitution Unit. In 2014, OHCHR-Colombia submitted five reports to the Units, and 
</p>
<p>contributed to building dialogue and consensus between victims and institutions in 
</p>
<p>prioritized communities.  
</p>
<p>35. The above-mentioned legislation has the potential to transform the situation of 
</p>
<p>uneven development and armed conflict. While the vast dimension of the challenge is 
</p>
<p>recognized, there is some reluctance to acknowledge the myriad of difficulties faced in 
</p>
<p>coordinating a vast array of government and state entities at the local and national levels, 
</p>
<p>with differing capacities and political will, to implement the law. Measures of success 
</p>
<p>appear largely focused on number of people served, rather than on the transformative 
</p>
<p>impact on institutions, lives and society. The Victims Unit has excelled at providing 
</p>
<p>assistance to a record number of victims. The Land Restitution Unit and specialized 
</p>
<p>tribunals produced 723 restitution decisions between 2012 and October 2014.  
</p>
<p>36. In order to overcome ingrained resistance in some areas, competent authorities need 
</p>
<p>to act with resolve and dedicate sufficient resources. They also need to empower 
</p>
<p>communities by involving them more actively and to incorporate a gender perspective into 
</p>
<p>land access and return policies. There has been revictimization in the absence of real 
</p>
<p>guarantees of non-recurrence. Political and bureaucratic resistance at local levels will 
</p>
<p>continue insofar as economic incentives behind illegal occupation of land persist (for 
</p>
<p>example, the continued ability of some to profit from production on such land). Society as a 
</p>
<p>whole can contribute to eliminating those economic incentives. For instance, consumers 
</p>
<p>could express their choice for agricultural products from areas not affected by land grabs if 
</p>
<p>a proper product-labelling system were implemented. Foreign capital, development aid and 
</p>
<p>countries with trade agreements with Colombia should take these problems into account 
</p>
<p>when designing investment plans or import regulations, particularly considering that often 
</p>
<p>the production in occupied lands is export-related (banana, palm oil, minerals).  
</p>
<p>37. The High Commissioner welcomes the first land restitution decision issued by 
</p>
<p>courts concerning an indigenous community, the Embera Katio in Alto Andagueda, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 Decrees 4633/2011, 4634/2011 and 4635/2011. </p>

</p>
<p>Choc&#243;.19 The return of displaced communities living in Medell&#237;n, Antioquia, to their areas 
</p>
<p>of origin in La Puria, Carmen de Atrato, Choc&#243;, is an example of coordination between 
</p>
<p>local authorities and the Victims Unit of Choc&#243;, and of a more empowering and simple 
</p>
<p>procedure that integrates a differential approach. The High Commissioner calls for further 
</p>
<p>progress in land restitution for ethnic groups.  
</p>
<p>38. The High Commissioner welcomes regulatory progress in the recognition of the 
</p>
<p>rights of women to access land,20 as well as the incorporation of international standards on 
</p>
<p>women rights into some land restitution judgements. He also welcomes the adoption, in 
</p>
<p>June, of Law 1719/2014 on access to justice for victims of sexual violence, in particular 
</p>
<p>that related to the armed conflict. The Government also declared 25 May the national day 
</p>
<p>for the dignity of women victims of sexual violence in the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>39. In prioritized communities where land restitution processes are taking place, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR-Colombia conducts advocacy work with authorities to guarantee the rights of 
</p>
<p>participants. Rights of secondary occupants (third parties occupying land who were not 
</p>
<p>involved in forced dispossessions), although already recognized in Colombian legislation, 
</p>
<p>should be further protected in line with international principles on restitution and the return 
</p>
<p>of victims of forced displacement.  
</p>
<p>40. Frequent death threats against land activists and related impunity should be firmly 
</p>
<p>addressed. In Choc&#243;, security concerns have prevented ethnic communities from returning 
</p>
<p>to their lands. Claims that activists have links with insurgency are often given more 
</p>
<p>attention and resources than cases in which they are victims. In the Caribbean region in 
</p>
<p>2014, only one investigation of a threat resulted in preliminary charges; the person charged 
</p>
<p>was the alleged victim. The return of former paramilitaries following their release after 
</p>
<p>serving the maximum jail time stipulated by the Justice and Peace Law (Law 975/2005) 
</p>
<p>must be carried out in a way that favours their reintegration into society. In this light, it is 
</p>
<p>hoped that the programme developed by the Ministry of Justice to facilitate reintegration 
</p>
<p>taking into account security and other challenges will be successful.  
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR-Colombia highlights the role of the Monitoring Committee for Law 
</p>
<p>1448/2011, comprising the Comptroller, the Counsel-General, the Ombudsperson and 
</p>
<p>victims&#8217; representatives, as a mechanism for ensuring the law&#8217;s implementation. It also 
</p>
<p>notes the importance of compliance by relevant institutions with the recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in its 2014 report.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights and international humanitarian law violations related to the armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict: armed forces </b></p>
<p>42. OHCHR-Colombia documented violations of the right to life that the army 
</p>
<p>continues to qualify as &#8220;military errors&#8221;. On 4 March, in Las Bancas de Arauquita, Arauca, 
</p>
<p>a young farmer was killed in a military operation by the Quir&#243;n Joint Task Force. On 1 
</p>
<p>May, in Villa F&#225;tima, Anor&#237;, Antioquia, one farmer was killed and another was injured by 
</p>
<p>soldiers from the Bombona Battalion. On 26 September in Chamizo, Guachen&#233;, Norte del 
</p>
<p>Cauca, a farmer was killed at a Third Brigade checkpoint and, reportedly, there were 
</p>
<p>attempts to hide the body. The High Commissioner reminds the State that, when a civilian 
</p>
<p>is killed during military operations, classification of the incident as an unavoidable military 
</p>
<p>error must be made through a judicial decision based on objective impartial investigations. 
</p>
<p>The State has the obligation to provide reparation to victims, independently of disciplinary 
</p>
<p>measures or criminal proceedings. The High Commissioner considers it crucial that the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 Special Land Restitution Chamber, Superior Court of Antioquia, decision 007/2014, 23 September.

<p>Ministry of Defence strengthen its capacity to conduct timely, independent and transparent 
</p>
<p>investigations and that it deal with complaints from the perspectives of both individual and 
</p>
<p>State responsibility.  
</p>
<p>43. The United Nations uses the terms &#8220;extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; 
</p>
<p>for a wide range of violations of the right to life; among them, but not exclusively, the 
</p>
<p>killings committed by military personnel with the aim of inflating statistics, known as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;false positives&#8221;. In 2014, OHCHR-Colombia did not document any cases of &#8220;false 
</p>
<p>positives&#8221;. However, it documented other cases in which the armed forces attempted to 
</p>
<p>disguise victims of arbitrary killings as enemy combat casualties or rearranged the crime 
</p>
<p>scene to make it appear as self-defence. For example, on 23 February in San Pablo, Bol&#237;var, 
</p>
<p>a man was shot dead by members of the Marte Joint Task Force. It was alleged that the 
</p>
<p>killing had been in self-defence after the man, supposedly a guerrilla, shot at the soldiers. 
</p>
<p>Forensic reports suggest that the man did not use a firearm. On 2 August, in Las Nieves, 
</p>
<p>Apartad&#243;, Antioquia, a 17-year-old girl died from two bullets in her back during an 
</p>
<p>operation against FARC-EP by members of Mobile Brigade No. 24, Seventh Division. No 
</p>
<p>elements were found to suggest that she was a FARC-EP member.  
</p>
<p>44. Despite efforts that have been made, the High Commissioner is concerned about the 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate recognition and effective coordination between military forces and 
</p>
<p>indigenous authorities, and recalls the importance of Directive 16/2006, Policy of 
</p>
<p>Recognition, Prevention and Protection of Indigenous Communities, which provides for 
</p>
<p>coordination mechanisms that should be adhered to by all forces operating in indigenous 
</p>
<p>territories. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Human rights and international humanitarian law violations related to the armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict: organized armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia </b>&#8211;<b> </b>People&#8217;s Ar<b>my 
</b></p>
<p>45. The High Commissioner reiterates his full support for the peace negotiations in 
</p>
<p>Havana between the Government and FARC-EP. He reminds FARC-EP of its obligation to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and to protect in particular the 
</p>
<p>civilian population and infrastructure, and those who do not participate, or have ceased to 
</p>
<p>participate, in hostilities. In 2014 OHCHR-Colombia registered cases of use of 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate explosive devices that caused death or injury to civilians, and other 
</p>
<p>prohibited methods of war, as well as killings of wounded civilians and the use of children 
</p>
<p>in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>46. On 30 April, in San Calixto, Norte de Santander, a female teacher and a young girl 
</p>
<p>were seriously injured when elements of the 33rd Front of FARC-EP threw an 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate explosive device at a police station. On 14 May, the FARC-EP Daniel 
</p>
<p>Aldana Mobile Column threw hand grenades at the football pitch in Chilvi, Tumaco, 
</p>
<p>Nari&#241;o, where police officers were playing, killing two children, aged 12 and 13, and 
</p>
<p>injuring eight policemen. Initial reports that children participated in the attack turned out to 
</p>
<p>be false. The use of indiscriminate explosive devices by the FARC-EP Gabriel Galvis 
</p>
<p>Mobile Column on 30 July resulted in the death of a two-year-old girl in her home in 
</p>
<p>Calandaima, Miranda, Cauca.  
</p>
<p>47. On 26 April, in Ituango, Antioquia, an ambulance transporting one sick and one 
</p>
<p>injured person was intercepted by members of the 18th Front of FARC-EP, who killed the 
</p>
<p>injured man. On 10 March, between Florencia and Monta&#241;ita, Caquet&#225;, FARC-EP members 
</p>
<p>dressed as road maintenance workers attacked an army patrol, killing four soldiers and 
</p>
<p>injuring nine civilians (among them two 17-year-old children and one three-month-old 
</p>
<p>baby) in the crossfire. The High Commissioner reminds FARC-EP that international law 
</p>
<p>prohibits killing those wounded who do not participate in hostilities and attacking medical </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>vehicles and obliges all parties to take all feasible precautions, taking into account the 
</p>
<p>principles of military necessity, distinction and proportionality. 
</p>
<p>48. On 10 April, in Convenci&#243;n, Norte de Santander, a community leader was killed, 
</p>
<p>allegedly by FARC-EP, after he challenged the control of the group over the area. On 
</p>
<p>3 March, in La Mina, Cauca, an indigenous language teacher was killed. While the identity 
</p>
<p>of the perpetrators has not been ascertained, the man had previously received threats from 
</p>
<p>FARC-EP. On 5 November, in Toribio, Cauca, FARC-EP members killed two Nasa 
</p>
<p>indigenous guards. In March, in Tarra, Norte de Santander, an activist working in the field 
</p>
<p>of lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual and intersex rights was reportedly threatened by 
</p>
<p>FARC-EP and had to flee the town. 
</p>
<p>49. The use of children by FARC-EP persisted during 2014 and has disproportionately 
</p>
<p>affected children from ethnic communities. In one <i>cabildo </i>(indigenous authority and its 
</p>
<p>community) alone, OHCHR-Colombia received reports of 48 cases of recruitment of Nasa 
</p>
<p>children, allegedly by the 6th Front of FARC-EP.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) National Liberation Army</b> </p>
<p>50. ELN has committed human rights and international humanitarian law violations, 
</p>
<p>including killings of protected persons and the use of children. On 11 May, in Tame, 
</p>
<p>Arauca, alleged ELN members entered the Parreros indigenous reserve and killed two men. 
</p>
<p>On 3 June, in Saravena, Arauca, during an attack with explosives and gunfire, ELN 
</p>
<p>reportedly executed four policemen who were hors de combat<i>.</i> Also in Saravena, on 12 
</p>
<p>August, the Secretary of Social Development and his bodyguard were shot dead. ELN 
</p>
<p>claimed responsibility and accused the victims of challenging the group&#8217;s power in the 
</p>
<p>region. On 29 June, in Ca&#241;o Lim&#243;n, Arauca, 13 people in a church service within an oil 
</p>
<p>complex were injured in an attack with explosive devices. The same day, between Pitalito 
</p>
<p>and La Luna-1, Cesar, ELN kidnapped a geologist, whom they held captive until 26 
</p>
<p>August. A fisherman and his 13-year-old daughter were intercepted on the Apartad&#243; River 
</p>
<p>on 26 August and deprived of their liberty. The girl was released four days later but her 
</p>
<p>father was disappeared and is presumed dead. On 12 September, in Alto Baud&#243;, Choc&#243;, 
</p>
<p>ELN allegedly killed two Embera Dovida leaders from El Morro and Puerto Alegre. On 14 
</p>
<p>September, in Norte de Santander, ELN snipers killed two oil contractors repairing 
</p>
<p>infrastructure. ELN accepted responsibility, attributing the attack to a judgement error by 
</p>
<p>the commander in charge. ELN continued using children: OHCHR-Colombia documented 
</p>
<p>cases in Antioquia, Arauca and Choc&#243;.  
</p>
<p><b> B. State response to human rights violations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Response to past human rights violations  </b></p>
<p>51. Addressing past violations is a cornerstone in the construction of a post-conflict 
</p>
<p>Colombia. Justice, truth, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence for gross violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law by all actors, 
</p>
<p>promoted through judicial and extrajudicial mechanisms, are necessary for national 
</p>
<p>reconciliation and sustainable peace.  
</p>
<p>52. The State has already taken some steps towards providing a judicial response for 
</p>
<p>past violations committed by non-State armed groups. Non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>indicate there are between 2,200 and 3,000 guerrilla members serving prison terms for a 
</p>
<p>variety of crimes, and most guerrilla leaders have received sentences in absentia. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>53. OHCHR-Colombia takes note of the restructuring of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office 
</p>
<p>(Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n),
21
</p>
<p> aimed at modernizing and increasing efficiency in the 
</p>
<p>prosecution of organized crime and systemic crimes through strategic analysis and case 
</p>
<p>prioritization. Proper incentives and a culture change for prosecutors and investigators, 
</p>
<p>away from counterinsurgency dynamics to one where all victims are equal before the law, 
</p>
<p>are needed to make further progress.  
</p>
<p>54. Criminal investigations of community leaders for their alleged connection with 
</p>
<p>armed groups, despite insufficient grounds for prosecution, were recurrent. In the context of 
</p>
<p>the peace talks, this questionable strategy reduces the pool of social interlocutors. For 
</p>
<p>instance, a peasant leader in Montes de Mar&#237;a, Bol&#237;var, with experience in community 
</p>
<p>reconciliation in the Alta Monta&#241;a process has been awaiting trial since 9 September 2013 
</p>
<p>on charges related to alleged links with FARC-EP. In Curuman&#237;, Cesar, a lawyer who was 
</p>
<p>very active during social mobilizations was arbitrarily arrested by police on 9 August, 
</p>
<p>reportedly in execution of a warrant. He was released when prosecutors confirmed there 
</p>
<p>was no such warrant.  
</p>
<p>55. Regarding the State response for violations committed by its agents, in recent years, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR-Colombia has conducted in-depth analysis of the &#8220;false positive&#8221; executions. 
</p>
<p>Those consisted of the killing of civilians by army members who reported the dead as fallen 
</p>
<p>enemy fighters for the purpose of improving kill statistics, in turn obtaining financial 
</p>
<p>benefits, leave, promotions and other benefits. The Attorney General&#8217;s Directorate for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law had, by September 2014, opened 2,234 
</p>
<p>investigations against 5,014 members of the armed forces for aggravated murder or murder 
</p>
<p>of a protected person, concerning 4,382 victims (3,989 men, 231 women, 162 unidentified). 
</p>
<p>A number of the cases may not have sufficient merit or proof to move forward. The 
</p>
<p>Directorate does not deal with the whole universe of cases, as some are unreported while 
</p>
<p>others are with other units within the Attorney General&#8217;s Office or with the military justice 
</p>
<p>system. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office has successfully prosecuted 796 army members 
</p>
<p>(103 commissioned officers, including six colonels, 123 non-commissioned officers, 
</p>
<p>566 soldiers and 4 members with no rank registered). The High Commissioner notes the 
</p>
<p>efforts to investigate these cases and punish the perpetrators. However, a majority of 
</p>
<p>investigations remain in an initial phase. Most prosecutions have focused on low-ranking 
</p>
<p>personnel directly participating in the crimes and have not attempted to establish 
</p>
<p>responsibility, by act or omission, of commanding officers, in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>law standards.  
</p>
<p>56. An analysis of combat casualties and extrajudicial executions over a 10-year period 
</p>
<p>(2002&#8211;2011)22 shows a statistical correlation suggesting that actual combat figures and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;false positives&#8221; were driven by the same incentives and performance-measuring standards. 
</p>
<p>Both figures dropped dramatically when operational results criteria changed in late 2007 
</p>
<p>(see appendix). The high number of false positives (potentially 5,000 victims), the long 
</p>
<p>period during which the phenomenon occurred (2002&#8211;2010), the number of units involved, 
</p>
<p>the nature of the violation (right to life violated by extrajudicial execution of civilians), and 
</p>
<p>the fact that the operations were planned, support the idea that these violations can be 
</p>
<p>considered to be systematic under human rights law. This also raises serious questions 
</p>
<p>regarding the responsibility of those in the line of command who either knew, or should 
</p>
<p>have known, what was happening and did not take measures to address it.

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>57. In addition to the individual and command responsibilities for these crimes, the 
</p>
<p>office notes that their systematic nature reflects structural weaknesses in the security 
</p>
<p>institutions that should be addressed through transitional justice and security sector reform. 
</p>
<p>The peace negotiations provide opportunities for such reforms. The State must define the 
</p>
<p>future post-conflict role of the armed forces, taking responsibility for past violations into 
</p>
<p>account and reconfiguring their functions and internal accountability mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Congress should open a debate on how to deal with past violations, define the structural 
</p>
<p>changes needed and, for individual cases, clarify mitigating factors when meting out 
</p>
<p>penalties (for example, recognition of responsibility, remorse, restoration of victims&#8217; rights 
</p>
<p>and contribution to non-repetition) within the limits of international law. 
</p>
<p>58. The misguided belief by some in the armed forces that prosecutions for extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>executions are part of a &#8220;judicial war&#8221; against them represents a major obstacle. Denial of 
</p>
<p>responsibility by the armed forces and their political superiors perpetuates impunity, 
</p>
<p>undermines institutional legitimacy and erodes the rule of law. In prosecutions of past 
</p>
<p>violations all defendants have due process rights, including the right to appeal. 
</p>
<p>59. OHCHR-Colombia has looked into jurisdictional conflicts between ordinary and 
</p>
<p>military justice in murder investigations concerning active members of the army: none of 
</p>
<p>the 57 decisions rendered by the High Council of the Judiciary between January and August 
</p>
<p>2014 referred the case to the military courts. This qualitative change in the Court&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence is in conformity with international law.  
</p>
<p>60. Despite the Government&#8217;s consistent commitment to legal reforms contributing to 
</p>
<p>human rights, in the past two years the Ministry of Defence submitted to Congress five 
</p>
<p>proposals to expand military justice. The Centro Democr&#225;tico party submitted another 
</p>
<p>two.23 Five are under legislative debate and two were rejected by the Constitutional Court 
</p>
<p>on procedural grounds.24 United Nations and Inter-American human rights bodies have 
</p>
<p>repeatedly stated that certain provisions are contrary to the international obligations of 
</p>
<p>Colombia and ignore nationally and internationally defined limitations to military justice 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. Those under debate are of particular concern since they would extend military 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>including those already under investigation by ordinary justice. The bills include articles 
</p>
<p>from a previous draft act (2/2012) criticized in 2013 by the Human Rights Committee of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations (CCPR/C/107/2). In September 2014, 12 special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holders of the Human Rights Council stated that the approval of those proposals would 
</p>
<p>negatively affect the justice system and the rule of law.
25
</p>
<p> OHCHR-Colombia reiterates its 
</p>
<p>offer to advise authorities on needed military justice reform26 in conformity with 
</p>
<p>international standards.  
</p>
<p>61. The State has made progress in addressing some other past violations. On 
</p>
<p>28 October, the High Court of Bogota sentenced an army general to 35 years of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 Legislative Act 2/2012 (rejected on constitutional grounds); Statutory Bill 211/2013 (Senate),

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>imprisonment, confirming a 2011 first-instance decision. The officer was found guilty of 
</p>
<p>five enforced disappearances during operations to retake the Courthouse (Palacio de 
</p>
<p>Justicia) from members of the M-19 group in November 1985.  
</p>
<p>62. The High Commissioner welcomes progress in the prosecutions for the 
</p>
<p>psychological torture of a female journalist who was repeatedly threatened by the now 
</p>
<p>defunct Administrative Security Department (DAS), an intelligence agency. In 2014, three 
</p>
<p>former high-ranking DAS operatives pleaded guilty to aggravated torture in the case.  
</p>
<p>63. Allegations that a number of documents related to DAS illegal wiretapping of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, journalists, political opposition members and civil servants were 
</p>
<p>surreptitiously removed from the National Archives are of concern. 
</p>
<p>64. The High Commissioner considers that Government efforts to implement the 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Law should be redoubled in order to ensure the legality and legitimacy of all 
</p>
<p>intelligence operations. The recent hacking/wiretapping of political figures demonstrates 
</p>
<p>that State intelligence agencies continue to be linked with illegal activities. The human 
</p>
<p>rights spirit of recent intelligence legislation has yet to become the operational and doctrinal 
</p>
<p>anchor for intelligence agencies. 
</p>
<p>65. On 9 September, a court in Barranquilla ordered the exclusion from the procedure 
</p>
<p>and benefits of the Justice and Peace Law of a former paramilitary commander on the 
</p>
<p>grounds that he did not confess to crimes of sexual violence. This is the first decision to 
</p>
<p>exclude a beneficiary of the Justice and Peace Programme on the grounds of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence. Moreover, following the killing of two transgender women on 4 and 8 December, 
</p>
<p>the Attorney General&#8217;s Office announced on 10 December strategies to investigate crimes 
</p>
<p>against members of the lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual and intersex community that 
</p>
<p>might be motivated by the gender identity of the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Situation of human rights defenders </b></p>
<p>66. OHCHR-Colombia continued to document violations against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders in 2014. Up to October, the office registered 45 murders of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. Of those, 2 of the victims were women, 10 were indigenous people and 2 were 
</p>
<p>public officials working on human rights issues. Eleven victims had previously received 
</p>
<p>threats. For three of those killed, State protection measures were in effect. In one case, State 
</p>
<p>protection had been withdrawn after an analysis determined he faced no extraordinary 
</p>
<p>danger. Between January and December 2014, OHCHR-Colombia also documented the 
</p>
<p>attempted killing of 18 defenders. In nine of those cases, State protection measures were in 
</p>
<p>effect.  
</p>
<p>67. The number of threats against defenders in 2014 is of serious concern. While the 
</p>
<p>figures do not represent all cases, OHCHR-Colombia recorded 297 defenders who had 
</p>
<p>received threats either individually or collectively between January and October 2014. For 
</p>
<p>example, on 8 and 9 September 2014, 87 human rights defenders received collective death 
</p>
<p>threats by e-mail. According to the Foundation for Press Freedom, between 1 January and 
</p>
<p>10 October 2014 2 journalists were killed, 64 received death threats, 45 reported 
</p>
<p>interference in their work, 6 were reportedly illegally detained and 1 reported an attempt on 
</p>
<p>his life.  
</p>
<p>68. The national guarantees process (<i>Mesa Nacional de Garant&#237;as</i>), an initiative for 
</p>
<p>dialogue between the Government and civil society, resumed work on measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>the right to defend human rights. The High Commissioner expresses concern that, despite 
</p>
<p>the establishment of the process in 2008, it has yet to produce tangible results for better 
</p>
<p>prevention and protection mechanisms or, in particular, a public policy to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>defense of human rights. He considers that the process should focus on the development 
</p>
<p>and subsequent implementation of such a policy as a matter of priority.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>69. The High Commissioner recognizes State efforts to improve protection for defenders 
</p>
<p>at risk. Until October 2014, the National Protection Unit was providing protection to 7,519 
</p>
<p>people, including 1,775 defenders. The annual budget of the National Protection Unit 
</p>
<p>increased from US$ 181 million in 2013 to US$ 205 million in 2014. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner is concerned that reported bureaucratic and potential financial 
</p>
<p>mismanagement issues may represent an obstacle to protecting the physical integrity of 
</p>
<p>defenders.  
</p>
<p>70. Investigation and prosecution of perpetrators and dismantlement of the structures 
</p>
<p>supporting crime against defenders are keys to preventing new threats and attacks. The 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner is concerned by the lack of results of criminal investigations into 
</p>
<p>violations against defenders, in particular threats. OHCHR-Colombia will continue to 
</p>
<p>monitor criminal investigations into these cases. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Public security and criminal justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Citizen security  
</b></p>
<p>71. OHCHR-Colombia observed that, despite growing government efforts to implement 
</p>
<p>citizen security policies at a local level, implementation is still left to police commanders, 
</p>
<p>since municipal mayors fail to assume their guiding role to facilitate citizen participation 
</p>
<p>and accountability. Legal participatory mechanisms, such as municipal committees on 
</p>
<p>police and citizen participation have not been activated. As a result, focus on police 
</p>
<p>presence and control prevails over social, community and situational prevention strategies. 
</p>
<p>Prevention mechanisms at the local level are extremely weak, allocation of budget is 
</p>
<p>insufficient, and measures identified in municipal development plans and integral citizen 
</p>
<p>security plans are often not implemented. Those weaknesses were observed in, among 
</p>
<p>others, Tumaco, Nari&#241;o; Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca; Monter&#237;a, C&#243;rdoba; Ibagu&#233;, 
</p>
<p>Tolima; and Apartad&#243;, Antioquia. A potential peace agreement will require a strong focus 
</p>
<p>on citizen security. Evaluation of the citizen security strategies of the National Police is 
</p>
<p>needed in order to identify good practices and lessons learned.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Police 
</b></p>
<p>72. The High Commissioner welcomes the National Police&#8217;s commitment to improving 
</p>
<p>human rights conditions. OHCHR-Colombia and the Inspector General of the National 
</p>
<p>Police developed a joint monitoring project to implement five selected mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>prevention and human rights response in the National Police, which evaluated the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of human rights command-and-control mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR-Colombia continued to monitor police use of force and firearms. At the 
</p>
<p>request of the National Police, the office provided technical assistance for the draft 
</p>
<p>regulation on the use of force and firearms. The implementation of the regulation is 
</p>
<p>expected to contribute to ensuring the appropriate use of force, in particular in the context 
</p>
<p>of crowd control and management of mass demonstrations. Despite efforts by the police to 
</p>
<p>improve its procedures, presumed human rights violations still occurred. On 5 August, in 
</p>
<p>Currulao, Turbo, Antioquia, during a strike by banana plantation workers, one man died as 
</p>
<p>a result of police gunfire, 14 people were injured and others were allegedly ill-treated. On 4 
</p>
<p>April in Totoro, Cauca, the police allegedly mistreated two members of the Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Cabildo of Totoro. In Cali, Valle del Cauca, a 14-year-old girl lost an eye to splinters from 
</p>
<p>a stun grenade launched by the police during a Labour Day demonstration.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Penitentiary system  
</b></p>
<p>74. OHCHR-Colombia continued to observe the penitentiary system situation, where 
</p>
<p>inmates live with unacceptable levels of overcrowding and inadequate health care. In </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>October 2014, statistics compiled by the National Institute for Prisons and Penitentiary27 
</p>
<p>indicated 49.3 per cent overcrowding in Colombian prisons: 116,449 people are detained in 
</p>
<p>establishments designed for only 78,022.28 On 27 January 2014, Barranquilla Model Prison, 
</p>
<p>with 147 per cent overcrowding, suffered a fire that killed 17 and injured at least 30 more. 
</p>
<p>The Ombudsperson called for urgent structural measures to prevent the reoccurrence of 
</p>
<p>such episodes.  
</p>
<p><b> (d) Post-demobilization groups and organized crime 
</b></p>
<p>75. The main public security challenge remains violence by post-demobilization armed 
</p>
<p>groups linked to organized crime. Violence affects the rights of those living where such 
</p>
<p>groups dispute control of illicit revenues derived from the drug trade, extortion, illegal 
</p>
<p>mining, prostitution, trafficking in persons and illegal migration. The High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>is concerned by the long-term humanitarian impact, including mass displacement and 
</p>
<p>protection risks.  
</p>
<p>76. OHCHR-Colombia also observed greater connections between these groups and 
</p>
<p>transnational criminal networks, and synergies with guerrillas in areas such as southern 
</p>
<p>Bol&#237;var, Bajo Cauca, Antioquia and Urab&#225;. Human rights defenders, community leaders, 
</p>
<p>State agents and land restitution claimants were often threatened or attacked by the groups 
</p>
<p>because they opposed the groups&#8217; criminal or political interests. On 9 March, in Turbo, 
</p>
<p>Antioquia, the representative of an organization that denounced alliances between the post-
</p>
<p>demobilization group Clan Usuga (also known as the Urabe&#241;os or Autodefensas Gaitanistas 
</p>
<p>de Colombia) and the guerrilla groups was killed. On 12 May, in C&#225;ceres, Antioquia, a civil 
</p>
<p>servant was threatened by the Urabe&#241;os owing to her social work assisting a 10-year-old 
</p>
<p>child forced to join the group. The High Commissioner is particularly concerned by the 
</p>
<p>ongoing violence and murders by dismemberment in the city of Buenaventura, Valle del 
</p>
<p>Cauca. OHCHR-Colombia was informed of 11 cases, of which 3 were successfully 
</p>
<p>investigated, resulting in the arrest of seven people (three minors). 
</p>
<p>77. The police have taken action against these groups and a number of their members 
</p>
<p>have been arrested. During 2014, 850 members of the Urabe&#241;os, 211 of the Rastrojos, 51 of 
</p>
<p>the Bloque Meta, and 63 of the Libertadores del Vichada were arrested. However, a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive approach that combines police actions with justice administration and anti-
</p>
<p>corruption is needed, as is measurable improvement in economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>in the communities where these groups recruit. Post-demobilization groups maintain 
</p>
<p>capacity to corrupt State agents. Examples include the arrest of the Governor of La Guajira 
</p>
<p>Department for alleged links with a criminal organization and the arrest in C&#243;rdoba 
</p>
<p>Department of a member of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and four policemen for alleged 
</p>
<p>collaboration with the Urabe&#241;os.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>In the light of the findings of OHCHR-Colombia and the need to build on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government initiatives, the High Commissioner recommends that:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Peace negotiations should take into account the different views of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected by the armed conflict, such as victims of violations and displacement, women, 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>D/ESTADISTICAS/INFORMES_ESTADISTICOS/INFORME%20OCTUBRE%202014.pdf.  
</p>
<p> 28 The overcrowding rate reached 270 per cent in Cali prison (6,160 inmates in facilities with a capacity 
</p>
<p>of 1,667) and 476 per cent in Riohacha (576 inmates in facilities fit for 100).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>human rights defenders, ethnic communities and children used by armed groups, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>actively seek their participation. Special attention should be given to their specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances in truth, justice and reparation processes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In order to transition to a post-conflict scenario, Colombia should develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial and non-judicial means for society as a whole to confront past violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and international humanitarian law. Recognition of responsibility, 
</b></p>
<p><b>remorse, guarantees of non-recurrence and participation in transformative actions 
</b></p>
<p><b>could be linked to alternative or reduced sentences for all parties to the conflict, taking 
</b></p>
<p><b>into account that no amnesty is possible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes and other gross violations of human rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</b>&#8211;People&#8217;s Army <b>(FARC-
</b></p>
<p><b>EP) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) should respect human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law, including with regard to civilian infrastructure, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian population and members of State armed forces or organized armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>who do not participate, or have ceased to participate, in hostilities. They should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>cease the use of children in their ranks;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) State responses to violence by post-demobilization groups linked to 
</b></p>
<p><b>organized crime should use a comprehensive approach that takes into account police-
</b></p>
<p><b>led public security, the judicial fight against impunity, accountability of civil servants 
</b></p>
<p><b>to prevent corruption and measures to fight poverty and exclusion. The State should 
</b></p>
<p><b>invest in maximizing economic and work opportunities for youth that provide them 
</b></p>
<p><b>with viable alternatives to joining criminal groups;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) In order to ensure accountability for extrajudicial executions, enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances, sexual violence, child recruitment and killings of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders, the Attorney General</b>&#8217;s<b> Office should adopt investigation strategies based on 
pattern analysis and case prioritization, addressing different levels of responsibility and 
</b></p>
<p><b>identifying economic and other interests behind violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The State should strengthen its efforts to prevent and respond to attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>and threats against human rights defenders, including through comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation between national, departmental and local authorities and more effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations by law-enforcement agencies, in order to increase prosecution success 
</b></p>
<p><b>rates progressively, to reach those of other crimes (for example, insurgency-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>charges); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The Government should use the full potential of the Victims and Land 
</b></p>
<p><b>Restitution Law as a tool for social change for victims, creating alternative community 
</b></p>
<p><b>and institutional mechanisms that respond to their needs and incorporate a human-
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-based approach into reparation and restitution processes. The Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should address economic incentives and lack of political will at local levels and explore 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternatives to reduce bureaucracy </b>and ensure victims&#8217; direct participation<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) The National Development Plan and all central and local planning 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments should include benchmarks of progressive realization and measurable 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators with time estimations for their fulfilment and regular monitoring and

<p><b>reporting on progress. The Department for Social Prosperity and the Ministries of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Housing, Labour, Education and Health should strengthen their joint efforts to
