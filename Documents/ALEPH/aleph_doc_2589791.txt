CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Various statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-
Q (this "Quarterly Report") are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"). These forward-looking statements include statements, projections
and estimates concerning our operations, performance, business strategy, oil and natural gas
reserves, drilling program capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, the timing and
success of specific projects, outcomes and effects of litigation, claims and disputes, derivative
activities and potential financing. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words
such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "potential," "could," "may,"
"will," "foresee," "plan," "goal," "should," "intend," "pursue," "target," "continue," "suggest" or the
negative thereof or other variations thereof or other words that convey the uncertainty of future
events or outcomes. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. These
statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience
and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well
as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Among the factors that
significantly impact our business and could impact our business in the future are:
the volatility of, and substantial decline in, oil, natural gas liquids ("NGL") and natural gas prices,
which remain at low levels;
•revisions to our reserve estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices and uncertainties;
•impacts to our financial statements as a result of impairment write-downs;
•
•
•
•
•
•our ability to discover, estimate, develop and replace oil, NGL and natural gas reserves;
•uncertainties about the estimates of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves;
•changes in domestic and global production, supply and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas;
the ongoing instability and uncertainty in the United States and international financial and
consumer markets that could adversely affect the liquidity available to us and our customers and
the demand for commodities, including oil, NGL and natural gas;
•capital requirements for our operations and projects;
our ability to maintain the borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined
below) or access other means of obtaining capital and liquidity, especially during periods of
sustained low commodity prices;
restrictions contained in our debt agreements, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the
indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, as well as debt that could be incurred in the
future;
our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, fund our capital requirements
and generate future profits;
the potentially insufficient refining capacity in the United States Gulf Coast to refine all of the light
sweet crude oil being produced in the United States, which could result in widening price
discounts to world crude prices and potential shut-in of production due to lack of sufficient markets;
regulations that prohibit or restrict our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our oil and natural gas
wells and to access and dispose of water used in these operations;
•legislation or regulations that prohibit or restrict our ability to drill new allocation wells;
•our ability to execute our strategies, including but not limited to our hedging strategies;
•competition in the oil and natural gas industry;
changes in the regulatory environment and changes in international, legal, political, administrative
or economic conditions;
•drilling and operating risks, including risks related to hydraulic fracturing activities;
•risks related to the geographic concentration of our assets;
the availability and costs of drilling and production equipment, labor and oil and natural gas
processing and other services;
the availability of sufficient pipeline and transportation facilities and gathering and processing
capacity;
•
•
•
•
•
iii
•
the ability to successfully identify and consummate strategic acquisitions at purchase prices that
are accretive to our financial results and to successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets and
properties;
•our ability to comply with federal, state and local regulatory requirements; and
•our ability to recruit and retain the qualified personnel necessary to operate our business.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-
looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various factors, including those set
forth under "Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, under "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors"
and "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the
"2015 Annual Report"), and those set forth from time to time in our other filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These documents are available through our website or
through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval system at http://www.sec.gov.
In light of such risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-
looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly
Report, or if earlier, as of the date they were made. We do not intend to, and disclaim any obligation
to, update or revise any forward-looking statements unless required by securities law.

Laredo Petroleum, Inc.
Condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1—Organization
Laredo Petroleum, Inc. ("Laredo"), together with its subsidiaries, Laredo Midstream Services, LLC
("LMS") and Garden City Minerals, LLC ("GCM"), is an independent energy company focused on
the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, and the
transportation of oil and natural gas from such properties, primarily in the Permian Basin in West
Texas. LMS and GCM (together, the "Guarantors") guarantee all of Laredo's debt instruments. In
these notes, the "Company" refers to Laredo, LMS and GCM collectively, unless the context
indicates otherwise. All amounts, dollars and percentages presented in these unaudited
consolidated financial statements and the related notes are rounded and therefore approximate.
The Company operates in two business segments: (i) exploration and production and (ii) midstream
and marketing. The exploration and production segment is engaged in the acquisition, exploration
and development of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas.
The midstream and marketing segment provides Laredo's exploration and production segment and
third parties with products and services that need to be delivered by midstream infrastructure,
including oil and natural gas gathering services as well as rig fuel, natural gas lift and water delivery
and takeaway in and around Laredo's primary production corridors.
Note 2—Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies
a.    Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were derived from the historical
accounting records of the Company and reflect the historical financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods described herein. The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). All material intercompany transactions and
account balances have been eliminated in the consolidation of accounts. The Company uses the
equity method of accounting to record its net interests when the Company holds 20% to 50% of the
voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control the entity.
Under the equity method, the Company's proportionate share of the investee's net income (loss) is
included in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. See Note 14 for additional
discussion of the Company's equity method investment.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been audited by the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm, except that the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 is derived from audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of
management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all necessary
adjustments to present fairly the Company's financial position as of June 30, 2016, results of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Certain disclosures have been condensed or omitted from these unaudited consolidated financial
statements. Accordingly, these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
2015 Annual Report.
b.    Use of estimates in the preparation of interim unaudited consolidated financial statements
The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These
estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes
these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ. The interim results reflected in the
unaudited consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for other interim periods or for the full year.
Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, (i) estimates of the Company's reserves of oil,
NGL and natural gas, (ii) future cash flows from oil and natural gas properties, (iii) depletion,
depreciation and amortization, (iv) asset retirement obligations, (v) stock-based compensation, (vi)
deferred income taxes, (vii) fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition
and (viii) fair values of derivatives, deferred premiums and performance unit awards. As fair value is
a market-based measurement, it is determined based on the assumptions that would be used by
market participants. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best judgment.
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical
experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Such estimates and
assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets and volatile
equity and energy markets have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates
and assumptions. Management believes its estimates and
5

Condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)
assumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances. As future events and their effects cannot be
determined with precision, actual values and results could differ from these estimates. Any changes
in estimates resulting from future changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the
financial statements in future periods.
c.    Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact to previously
reported net loss, stockholders' equity or cash flows.
d.    Accounts receivable
The Company sells produced oil, NGL and natural gas and purchased oil to various customers and
participates with other parties in the development and operation of oil and natural gas properties.
The Company's accounts receivable are generally unsecured. Accounts receivable for joint interest
billings are recorded as amounts billed to customers less an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Joint interest operations amounts are considered past due after 30 days. The Company determines
joint interest operations accounts receivable allowances based on management's assessment of
the creditworthiness of the joint interest owners. Additionally, as the operator of the majority of its
wells, the Company has the ability to realize some or all of the receivables through netting of
anticipated future production revenues. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required
allowance, management considers historical losses, current receivables aging and existing industry
and economic data. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. Past due
amounts greater than 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for
collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is remote.

e.    Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGL and
natural gas. By removing a significant portion of the price volatility associated with future production,
the Company expects to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows
from operations due to fluctuations in commodity prices. These transactions are in the form of puts,
swaps, collars and, in prior periods, basis swaps.
Derivatives are recorded at fair value and are presented on a net basis on the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities. The Company nets the fair value of derivatives
by counterparty where the right of offset exists. The Company determines the fair value of its
derivatives by utilizing pricing models for substantially similar instruments. Inputs to the pricing
models include publicly available prices and forward price curves generated from a compilation of
data gathered from third parties. See Note 9 for discussion regarding the fair value of the
Company's derivatives. 
The Company's derivatives were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes for any of the
periods presented. Accordingly, the changes in fair value are recognized in the unaudited
consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. Gains and losses on derivatives are
included in cash flows from operating activities. See Notes 8 and 9 for discussion regarding the
Company's derivatives.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, depletion expense was $7.06 per barrel of oil
equivalent ("BOE") sold and $16.19 per BOE sold, respectively. For the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, depletion expense was $8.01 per BOE sold and $16.13 per BOE sold, respectively.
The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. Under
this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain related employee
costs, incurred for the purpose of finding oil, NGL and natural gas are capitalized and depleted on a
composite unit of production method based on proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Such
amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells, dry hole costs, lease
acquisition costs, delay rentals and other costs related to such activities. Costs, including related
employee costs, associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the
period incurred. Sales of oil and natural gas properties, whether or not being depleted currently, are
accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such
adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved
reserves of oil, NGL and natural gas.
The Company excludes the costs directly associated with acquisition and evaluation of
unevaluated properties from the depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not proved
reserves can be assigned to the properties. The Company capitalizes a portion of its interest costs
on its unevaluated properties. Capitalized interest becomes a part of the cost of the unevaluated
properties and is subject to depletion when proved reserves can be assigned to the associated
properties. All items classified as unevaluated property are assessed on a quarterly basis for
possible impairment or reduction in value. The assessment includes consideration of the following
factors, among others: intent to drill, remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations,
drilling results and activity, the assignment of evaluated reserves and the economic viability of
development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an
impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the
associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion.
The full cost ceiling is based principally on the estimated future net revenues from proved oil and
natural gas properties discounted at 10%. Per the SEC guidelines, companies are required to use
the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month
period prior to the end of the reporting period before differentials ("Benchmark Prices"). The
Benchmark Prices are then adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials,
marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead
("Realized Prices"). The Realized Prices are utilized to calculate the discounted future net revenues
in the full cost ceiling calculation.

Non-cash full cost ceiling impairment
(in thousands)
Full cost ceiling impairment expense is included in the "Impairment expense" line item in the
unaudited consolidated statements of operations and in the financial information provided for the
Company's exploration and production segment presented in Note 16.
g. Long-lived assets and inventory
Impairment losses are recorded on property and equipment used in operations and other long-lived
assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. Impairment is measured
based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
Materials and supplies inventory used in developing oil and natural gas properties and midstream
service assets are carried at the lower of cost or market ("LCM") with cost determined using the
weighted-average cost method and are included in "Other current assets" and "Other assets, net"
on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The market price for materials and supplies is
determined utilizing a replacement cost approach (Level 2).
Beginning at March 31, 2016, frac pit water inventory used in developing oil and natural gas
properties is carried at LCM with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method and is
included in "Other current assets" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The market price
for frac pit water inventory is determined utilizing a replacement cost approach.
The minimum volume of product in a pipeline system that enables the system to operate is known
as line-fill and is generally not available to be withdrawn from the pipeline system until the
expiration of the transportation contract. The Company owns oil line-fill in third-party pipelines,
which is accounted for at LCM with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method and is
included in "Other assets, net" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The LCM adjustment
is determined utilizing a quoted market price adjusted for regional price differentials (Level 2).

h.    Debt issuance costs
Debt issuance fees, which are recorded at cost, net of amortization, are amortized over the life of the
respective debt agreements utilizing the effective interest and straight-line methods. The Company
capitalized $6.8 million of debt issuance costs during the six months ended June 30, 2015 mainly
as a result of the issuance of the March 2023 Notes (as defined below). No debt issuance costs
were capitalized in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company had total debt issuance
costs of $20.9 million and $23.9 million, net of accumulated amortization of $19.2 million and $17.0
million, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The Company wrote-off approximately $0.8 million of debt issuance costs during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as a result of changes in the borrowing base and aggregate elected
commitment of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which are included in the unaudited consolidated
statements of operations in the "Write-off of debt issuance costs" line item. During the six months
ended June 30, 2015, the Company wrote-off approximately $6.6 million of debt issuance costs as a
result of the early redemption of the January 2019 Notes (as defined below), which are included in
the unaudited consolidated statements of operations in the "Loss on early redemption of debt" line
item. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Company's senior unsecured notes are
presented in "Long-term debt, net" on the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheets.
Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Senior Secured Credit Facility are presented in

j.    Asset retirement obligations
Asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets are
recognized as a liability in the period in which they are incurred and become determinable. The
associated asset retirement costs are part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
Subsequently, the asset retirement cost included in the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset is charged to expense through depletion, or for midstream service asset retirement cost
through depreciation, of the associated asset. Changes in the liability due to the passage of time are
recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as corresponding accretion
expense.
The fair value of additions to the asset retirement obligation liability is measured using valuation
techniques consistent with the income approach, which converts future cash flows into a single
discounted amount. Significant inputs to the valuation include: (i) estimated plug and abandonment
cost per well based on Company experience, (ii) estimated remaining life per well, (iii) estimated
removal and/or remediation costs for midstream service assets, (iv) estimated remaining life of
midstream service assets, (v) future inflation factors and (vi) the Company's average credit adjusted
risk-free rate. Inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous
assumptions and judgments including, in addition to those noted above, the ultimate settlement of
these amounts, the ultimate timing of such settlement and changes in legal, regulatory,
environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions
impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment
will be made to the asset balance.
The Company is obligated by contractual and regulatory requirements to remove certain pipeline
assets and perform other remediation of the sites where such pipeline assets are located upon the
retirement of those assets. However, the fair value of the asset retirement obligation cannot currently
be reasonably estimated because the settlement dates are indeterminate. The Company will record
an asset retirement obligation for pipeline assets in the periods in which settlement dates become
reasonably determinable.

presented:

k.    Fair value measurements
The carrying amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, undistributed revenue and royalties, accrued
capital expenditures and other accrued assets and liabilities approximate their fair values. See
Note 5.f for fair value disclosures related to the Company's debt obligations. The Company carries
its derivatives at fair value. See Note 9 for details regarding the fair value of the Company's
derivatives.
l.    Treasury stock
Laredo's employees may elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy their tax
withholding obligations that arise upon the lapse of restrictions on their stock awards. Such treasury
stock is recorded at cost and retired upon acquisition.
m.    Compensation awards
Stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized, is included in "General and
administrative" in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations over the awards' vesting
periods and is based on the awards' grant date fair value. The Company utilizes the closing stock
price on the grant date, less an expected forfeiture rate, to determine the fair value of service vesting
restricted stock awards and a Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair values of service
vesting restricted stock option awards. The Company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation prepared by
an independent third party to determine the fair values of the performance share awards and, in
prior periods, the performance unit awards. The Company capitalizes a portion of stock-based
compensation for employees who are directly involved in the acquisition, exploration and
development of its oil and gas properties into the full cost pool. Capitalized stock-based
compensation is included as an addition to "Oil and natural gas properties" in the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6 for further discussion regarding the restricted stock
awards, restricted stock option awards, performance share awards and performance unit awards.
n.    Environmental
The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
These laws, among other things, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may
require the Company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of
petroleum or chemical substances at various sites. Environmental expenditures are expensed in the
period incurred. Liabilities for expenditures of a non-capital nature are recorded when
environmental assessment or remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Such liabilities are generally undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments is fixed and readily
determinable. Management believes no materially significant liabilities of this nature existed as of
June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

Note 4—Divestiture
a. 2015 Divestiture of non-strategic assets
On September 15, 2015, the Company completed the sale of non-strategic and primarily non-
operated properties and associated production totaling 6,060 net acres and 123 producing
properties in the Midland Basin to a third-party buyer for a purchase price of $65.5 million. After
transaction costs reflecting an economic effective date of July 1, 2015, the net proceeds were $64.8
million, net of working capital adjustments and post-closing adjustments. The purchase price,
excluding post-closing adjustments, was allocated to oil and natural gas properties pursuant to the
rules governing full cost accounting.
Effective at closing, the operations and cash flows of these properties were eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the Company, and the Company has no continuing involvement in the
properties. This divestiture does not represent a strategic shift and will not have a major effect on
the Company's operations or financial results.

Note 6—Employee compensation
The Company has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"), which provides for the granting of
incentive awards in the form of restricted stock awards, restricted stock option awards, performance
share awards, performance unit awards and other awards. In the second quarter of 2016,
shareholders approved an increase in the maximum number of shares of the Company's common
stock issuable under the LTIP from 10,000,000 shares to 24,350,000 shares (the "Amendment").
The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards expected to vest over
the requisite service period as a charge against earnings, net of amounts capitalized. The
Company's stock-based compensation awards are accounted for as equity instruments, and in prior
periods, its performance unit awards were accounted for as liability awards. Stock-based
compensation is included in "General and administrative" in the unaudited consolidated statements
of operations. The Company capitalizes a portion of stock-based compensation for employees who
are directly involved in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas
properties into the full cost pool. Capitalized stock-based compensation is included as an addition
to "Oil and natural gas properties" in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets.
a.    Restricted stock awards
All restricted stock awards are treated as issued and outstanding in the accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements. Per the award agreement terms, if an employee terminates
employment prior to the restriction lapse date for reasons other than death or disability, the awarded
shares are forfeited and canceled and are no longer considered issued and outstanding. If the
employee's termination of employment is by reason of death or disability, all of the holder's
restricted stock will automatically vest. Historically, restricted stock awards granted to officers and
employees vest in a variety of vesting schedules including (i) 33%, 33% and 34% per year
beginning on the first anniversary date of the grant, (ii) 50% in year two and 50% in year three, (iii)
fully on the first anniversary of the grant date and (iv) fully on the third anniversary of the grant date.
Restricted stock awards granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the
grant date.

The vesting of certain restricted stock awards could result in federal and state income tax
expense or benefit related to the difference between the market price of the common stock at the
date of vesting and the date of grant. See Note 7 for additional discussion regarding the tax
impact of vested stock awards.
The Company utilizes the closing stock price on the grant date to determine the fair value of service
vesting restricted stock awards. As of June 30, 2016, unrecognized stock-based compensation
related to the restricted stock awards expected to vest was $44.3 million. Such cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.26 years.
b.    Restricted stock option awards
Restricted stock option awards granted under the LTIP vest and are exercisable in four equal
installments on each of the four anniversaries of the grant date. The following table reflects the stock

The restricted stock options expected to vest as of June 30, 2016 had $6.1 million aggregate
intrinsic value.
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of
restricted stock option awards and recognizes the associated expense on a straight-line basis over
the four-year requisite service period of the awards. Determining the fair value of equity-based
awards requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock option awards will be
outstanding prior to exercise and the associated volatility. As of June 30, 2016, unrecognized stock-
based compensation related to restricted stock option awards expected to vest was $13.5 million.
Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.55 years.

United States Treasury yields as of the grant date were utilized for the risk-free interest rate
assumption, correlating the treasury yield terms to the expected life of the option.
As the Company had limited exercise history at the time of valuation relating to terminations and
modifications, expected option life assumptions were developed using the simplified method in
accordance with GAAP.
(3)The Company utilized its own historical volatility in order to develop the expected volatility.     
In accordance with the LTIP and stock option agreement, the options granted will become
exercisable in accordance with the following schedule based upon the number of full years of the
optionee's continuous employment or service with the Company, following the date of grant:

No shares of common stock may be purchased unless the optionee has remained in continuous
employment with the Company for one year from the grant date. Unless terminated sooner, the
option will expire if and to the extent it is not exercised within 10 years from the grant date. The
unvested portion of a stock option award shall expire upon termination of employment, and the
vested portion of a stock option award shall remain exercisable for (i) one year following termination
of employment by reason of the holder's death or disability, but not later than the expiration of the
option period, or (ii) 90 days following termination of employment for any reason other than the
holder's death or disability, and other than the holder's termination of employment for cause. Both
the unvested and the vested but unexercised portion of a stock option award shall expire upon the
termination of the option holder's employment or service by the Company for cause.
c.    Performance share awards
The performance share awards granted to management in the second quarter of 2016 (the "2016
Performance Share Awards"), February 27, 2015 (the "2015 Performance Share Awards") and on
February 27, 2014 (the "2014 Performance Share Awards") are subject to a combination of market
and service vesting criteria. A Monte Carlo simulation prepared by an independent third party was
utilized to determine the grant date fair value of these awards. The Company has determined these
awards are equity awards and recognizes the associated expense on a straight-line basis over the
three-year requisite service period of the awards. These awards will be settled, if at all, in stock at
the end of the requisite service period based on the achievement of certain performance criteria.
The 1,742,469 outstanding 2016 Performance Share Awards have a performance period of January
1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, and any shares earned under such awards are expected to be
issued in the first quarter of 2019 if the performance criteria are met. The 475,518 outstanding 2015
Performance Share Awards have a performance period of January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017,
and any shares earned under such awards are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2018 if
the performance criteria are met. The 210,126 outstanding 2014 Performance Share Awards have a
performance period of January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, and any shares earned under such
awards are expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2017 if the performance criteria are met.

combination of market and service vesting criteria. These awards were accounted for as liability
awards as they were settled in cash at the end of the requisite service period based on the
achievement of certain performance criteria.
The 44,481 settled 2013 Performance Unit Awards had a performance period of January 1, 2013 to
December 31, 2015 and, as their performance criteria were satisfied, they were paid at $143.75 per
unit during the first quarter of 2016. The 27,381 settled 2012 Performance Unit Awards had a

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, compensation expense for the 2013
Performance Unit Awards is included in "General and administrative" in the Company's unaudited
consolidated statements of operations, and as of December 31, 2015, the corresponding liability is
included in "Other current liabilities" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Due to the
quarterly re-measurement of the fair value of the 2013 Performance Unit Awards as of June 30,
2015, compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was $0.7 million
and $1.7 million, respectively.
Note 7—Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income (loss) in the period that
includes the enactment date.
The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions for recognition and measurement in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements. To recognize a tax position, the Company determines whether it
is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution
of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that
meets the more-likely-than-not threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be
recognized in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The amount of tax benefit
recognized with respect to any tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is
greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company had no
unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions in the unaudited consolidated financial
statements as of June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes and the Texas franchise tax. Income tax

Income tax benefit
 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was not meaningful due to
the valuation allowance recorded. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the effective
tax rate was 36% and 35%, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate is affected by changes in
valuation allowances, recurring permanent differences and by discrete items that may occur in any
given year, but are not consistent from year to year.
A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more
likely than not that the related tax benefit will not be realized. On a quarterly basis, management
evaluates the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of
the deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of such allowances, if necessary. During the year
ended December 31, 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2016, in evaluating whether it was
more likely than not that the Company's net deferred tax assets were realizable through future net
income, management considered all available positive and negative evidence, including (i) its
earnings history, (ii) its ability to recover net operating loss carry-forwards, (iii) the existence of
significant proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, (iv) its ability to use tax planning

strategies, (v) its current price protection utilizing oil and natural gas hedges, (vi) its future revenue
and operating cost projections and (vii) the current market prices for oil, NGL and natural gas.
Based on all the evidence available, during the year ended December 31, 2015, management
determined it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets were not realizable, and
therefore recorded a valuation allowance of $676.0 million. During the six months ended June 30,
2016, an additional valuation allowance of $83.7 million was recorded.
The impact of significant discrete items is separately recognized in the quarter in which the discrete
items occur. The vesting of certain restricted stock awards could result in federal and state income
tax expense or benefits related to the difference between the market price of the common stock at
the date of vesting and the grant date. The exercise of stock option awards could result in federal
and state income tax expense or benefits related to the difference between the fair value of the stock
option at the grant date and the intrinsic value of the stock option when exercised. The tax impact
resulting from vestings of restricted stock awards and exercise of option awards are discrete items.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, certain shares related to restricted
stock awards vested at times when the Company's stock price was lower than the fair value of those
shares at the time of the grant. As a result, the income tax deduction related to such shares is less
than the expense previously recognized for book purposes. During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, certain stock options were exercised. No stock options were exercised during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The income tax deduction related to the intrinsic value
of the options was less than the expense previously recognized for book purposes. In accordance
with GAAP, such shortfalls reduce additional paid-in capital to the extent windfall tax benefits have
been previously recognized. However, the Company has not previously recognized any windfall tax
benefits. Therefore, such shortfalls are included in income tax expense.

forwards begin expiring in 2026. Additionally, these carry-forwards include windfall tax deductions
from vestings of certain restricted stock awards and stock option exercises that were not recorded in
the Company's income tax provision. The amount of windfall tax benefit recognized in additional
paid-in capital is limited to the amount of benefit realized currently in income taxes payable. As of
June 30, 2016, the Company had suspended additional paid-in capital credits of $4.5 million related
to windfall tax deductions. Upon realization of the net operating loss carry-forwards from such
windfall tax deductions, the Company would record a benefit of up to $4.5 million in additional paid-
in capital.
The Company's income tax returns for the years 2012 through 2015 remain open and subject to
examination by federal tax authorities and/or the tax authorities in Oklahoma and Texas, which are
the jurisdictions where the Company has or had operations. Additionally, the statute of limitations
for examination of federal net operating loss carry-forwards typically does not begin to run until the
year the attribute is utilized in a tax return.

Note 8—Derivatives
a. Derivatives
The Company engages in derivative transactions such as puts, swaps, collars and, in prior periods,
basis swaps to hedge price risks due to unfavorable changes in oil and natural gas prices related to
its production. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had 25 open derivative contracts with financial
institutions that extend from July 2016 to December 2018. None of these contracts were designated
as hedges for accounting purposes. The contracts are recorded at fair value on the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings. Gains
and losses on derivatives are reported on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations on
the "Gain (loss) on derivatives, net" line item.
Each put transaction has an established floor price. The Company pays its counterparty a premium,
which can be deferred until settlement, to enter into the put transaction. When the settlement price is
below the floor price, the counterparty pays the Company an amount equal to the difference
between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When
the settlement price is above the floor price, the put option expires.
Each swap transaction has an established fixed price. When the settlement price is below the fixed
price, the counterparty pays the Company an amount equal to the difference between the settlement
price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is
above the fixed price, the Company pays its counterparty an amount equal to the difference
between the settlement price and the fixed price multiplied by the hedged contract volume.
Each collar transaction has an established price floor and ceiling. When the settlement price is
below the price floor established by these collars, the Company receives an amount from its
counterparty equal to the difference between the settlement price and the price floor multiplied by
the hedged contract volume. When the settlement price is above the price ceiling established by
these collars, the Company pays its counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the
settlement price and the price ceiling multiplied by the hedged contract volume.
In the prior year, the oil basis swap transactions had an established fixed basis differential. The
Company's oil basis swaps' differential was between the West Texas Intermediate-Argus Americas
Crude (Midland) ("WTI Midland") index crude oil price and the West Texas Intermediate NYMEX
("WTI NYMEX") index crude oil price. When the WTI NYMEX price less the fixed basis differential
was greater than the actual WTI Midland price, the difference multiplied by the hedged contract
volume was paid to the Company by the counterparty. When the WTI NYMEX price less the fixed
basis differential was less than the actual WTI Midland price, the difference multiplied by the
hedged contract volume was paid by the Company to the counterparty.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company successfully completed a hedge
restructuring by early terminating the floors of certain derivative contract collars that resulted in a
termination amount of $80 million, which was settled in full by applying the proceeds to prepay the
premiums on two new derivatives entered into during the restructuring.

b. Balance sheet presentation
In accordance with the Company's standard practice, its derivatives are subject to counterparty
netting under agreements governing such derivatives. The Company's oil and natural gas
derivatives are presented on a net basis as "Derivatives" on the unaudited consolidated balance
sheets. See Note 9.a for a summary of the fair value of derivatives on a gross basis.
By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Company exposes
itself to credit risk and market risk. For the Company, market risk is the exposure to changes in the
market price of oil and natural gas, which are subject to fluctuations from a variety of factors,
including changes in supply and demand. Credit risk is the failure of the
22
Laredo Petroleum, Inc.
Condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)
counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative
contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, thereby creating credit risk. The
Company's counterparties are participants in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which is secured
by the Company's oil and natural gas reserves; therefore, the Company is not required to post any
collateral. The Company does not require collateral from its derivative counterparties. The
Company minimizes the credit risk in derivatives by: (i) limiting its exposure to any single
counterparty, (ii) entering into derivatives only with counterparties that meet the Company's
minimum credit quality standard or have a guarantee from an affiliate that meets the Company's
minimum credit quality standard and (iii) monitoring the creditworthiness of the Company's
counterparties on an ongoing basis.
Note 9—Fair value measurements
The Company accounts for its oil and natural gas derivatives at fair value. The fair value of
derivatives is determined utilizing pricing models for similar instruments. The models use a variety
of techniques to arrive at fair value, including quotes and pricing analysis. Inputs to the pricing
models include publicly available prices and forward curves generated from a compilation of data
gathered from third parties.
The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured at fair value, based on the priority
of inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets are
categorized based on inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:
Level 1
—
Level 2
—
Level 3
—
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value for which values are based on unadjusted quoted
prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that management has the ability to
access. Active markets are considered to be those in which transactions for the assets or
liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an
ongoing basis.
 
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value for which values are based on quoted prices in
markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Substantially all of these inputs are
observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the price risk management
instrument and can be derived from observable data or supported by observable levels at
which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
 
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value for which values are based on prices or valuation
techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair
value measurement. Unobservable inputs are not corroborated by market data. These inputs
reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would
use in pricing the asset or liability.
When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy in a liquid
environment, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company
conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on an annual basis. Changes in the
observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or
liabilities. Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are recognized and reported in the period in
which the transfer occurred. No transfers between fair value hierarchy levels occurred during the
three or six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.

These items are included as "Derivatives" on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets.
Significant Level 2 assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in
the mark-to-market analysis of derivatives include each derivative contract's corresponding
commodity index price, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data.
The Company's deferred premiums associated with its derivative contracts are categorized as
Level 3, as the Company utilizes a net present value calculation to determine the valuation. They
are considered to be measured on a recurring basis as the derivative contracts they derive from are
measured on a recurring basis. As derivative contracts containing deferred premiums are entered
into, the Company discounts the associated deferred premium to its net present value at the contract
trade date, using the Senior Secured Credit Facility rate at the trade date (historical input rates
range from 1.69% to 3.56%), and then records the change in net present value to interest expense
over the period from trade until the final settlement date at the end of the contract. After this initial
valuation, the net present value of each deferred premium is not adjusted; therefore, significant
increases (decreases) in the Senior Secured Credit Facility rate would result in a significantly lower
(higher) fair value measurement for each new contract entered into that contained a deferred
premium; however, the valuation for the deferred premiums already recorded would remain
unaffected. While the Company believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are
reliable, different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates; therefore, on
a quarterly basis, the valuation is compared to counterparty valuations and a third-party valuation of
the deferred premiums for reasonableness.

b. Fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis
The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets and inventory, if any, at fair value on
a nonrecurring basis. For purposes of fair value measurement, it was determined that the
impairment of long-lived assets and inventory are classified as Level 3, based on the use of
internally developed cash flow models. See Note 2.g for discussion regarding the Company's
impairment of (i) materials and supplies for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015 and (ii) line-fill for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The accounting policies for impairment of oil and natural gas properties are discussed in Note 2.f.
Significant inputs included in the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment
analysis include the Company's estimate of operating and development costs, anticipated
production of evaluated reserves and other relevant data. See Note 2.f for discussion regarding the
prices used in the calculation of discounted cash flows and the Company's first-quarter 2016 and
second-quarter 2015 full cost ceiling impairments.
Note 10—Net loss per share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution
of non-vested restricted stock awards, performance share awards and outstanding restricted stock
options. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, all of these potentially dilutive
items were anti-dilutive due to the Company's net loss and, therefore, were excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per share.

Note 11—Credit risk
The Company's oil, NGL and natural gas sales are made to a variety of purchasers, including
intrastate and interstate pipelines or their marketing affiliates and independent marketing
companies. The Company's joint operations accounts receivable are from a number of oil and
natural gas companies, partnerships, individuals and others who own interests in the oil and natural
gas properties operated by the Company. The Company's sales of purchased oil are made to one
customer. Management believes that any credit risk imposed by a concentration in the oil and
natural gas industry is offset by the creditworthiness of the Company's customer base and industry
partners. The Company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material trade and other
receivables to determine collectability.
The Company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility. These
transactions expose the Company to potential credit risk from its counterparties. In accordance with
the Company's standard practice, its derivatives are subject to counterparty netting under
agreements governing such derivatives; therefore, the credit risk associated with its derivative
counterparties is somewhat mitigated. See Notes 2.e, 8 and 9 for additional information regarding
the Company's derivatives.
Note 12—Commitments and contingencies
a.    Litigation
)
)
From time to time the Company is involved in legal proceedings and/or may be subject to industry
rulings that could bring rise to claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company has
concluded that the likelihood is remote that the ultimate resolution of any pending litigation or
pending claims will be material or have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
b.    Drilling contract
The Company has committed to several drilling contracts with a third party to facilitate the
Company's drilling plans. One of these contracts is for a term of multiple months and contains an
early termination clause that requires the Company to potentially pay penalties to the third party
should the Company cease drilling efforts. This penalty would negatively impact the Company's
financial statements upon early contract termination. The future commitment of $3.0 million as of
June 30, 2016 is not recorded in the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets.
Management does not currently anticipate the early termination of this contract in 2016.
c.    Firm sale and transportation commitments
The Company has committed to deliver for sale or transportation fixed volumes of product under
certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. If not
fulfilled, the Company is subject to minimal volume penalties. These commitments are normal and
customary for the Company's business. Future commitments of $400.2 million as of June 30, 2016
are not recorded in the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The Company's
production has been equivalent or greater than its delivery commitments during the most recent
year, and management expects such production will continue to exceed the Company's future
commitments. However, in certain instances, the Company has
27
Laredo Petroleum, Inc.
Condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)
used spot market purchases to meet its commitments in certain locations or due to favorable pricing.
Management anticipates continuing this practice in the future. Also, if production is not sufficient to
satisfy the Company's delivery commitments, the Company can and may use spot market
purchases to fulfill the commitments.
 
d.    Federal and state regulations
Oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations are subject to extensive federal
and state laws, rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can
result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases
the cost of doing business and affects profitability. The Company believes that it is in compliance
with currently applicable federal and state regulations related to oil and natural gas exploration and
production, and that compliance with the current regulations will not have a material adverse impact
on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. These rules and regulations are
frequently amended or reinterpreted; therefore, the Company is unable to predict the future cost or
impact of complying with these regulations.
 
e.    Other commitments
See Notes 2.i, 15.a and 19.b for the amount of and discussion regarding the commitments to the
Company's non-consolidated variable interest entity ("VIE").
Note 13—2015 Restructuring
Following the fourth-quarter 2014 drop in oil prices, in an effort to reduce costs and to better position
the Company for ongoing efficient growth, on January 20, 2015, the Company executed a company-
wide restructuring and reduction in force (the "RIF") that included (i) the relocation of certain
employees from the Company's Dallas, Texas area office to the Company's other existing offices in
Tulsa, Oklahoma and Midland, Texas; (ii) closing the Company's Dallas, Texas area office; (iii) a
workforce reduction of approximately 75 employees and (iv) the release of 24 contract personnel.
The RIF was communicated to employees on January 20, 2015 and was generally effective
immediately. The Company's compensation committee approved the RIF and the related severance
package. The Company incurred $6.0 million in expenses during the six months ended June 30,
2015 related to the RIF. There were no comparative amounts recorded in the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
Note 14—Variable interest entity
An entity is referred to as a VIE pursuant to accounting guidance for consolidation if it possesses
one of the following criteria: (i) it is thinly capitalized, (ii) the residual equity holders do not control
the entity, (iii) the equity holders are shielded from the economic losses, (iv) the equity holders do
not participate fully in the entity's residual economics, or (v) the entity was established with non-
substantive voting interests. In order to determine if a VIE should be consolidated, an entity must
determine if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is that variable
interest-holder possessing a controlling financial interest through: (i) its power to direct the activities
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) its obligation to
absorb losses or its right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the
VIE. In order to determine whether the Company owns a variable interest in a VIE, a qualitative
analysis is performed of the entity's design, organizational structure, primary decision makers and
relevant agreements. The Company continually monitors its VIE exposure to determine if any
events have occurred that could cause the primary beneficiary to change.

Gathering & Processing, LLC, a Texas limited liability company formed on October 12, 2012, and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries (together "Medallion"). See Note 19.b for discussion regarding a
contribution made to Medallion subsequent to June 30, 2016.
LMS holds 49% of Medallion's ownership units. Medallion was established for the purpose of
developing midstream solutions and providing midstream infrastructure to bring oil, NGL and natural
gas to market. LMS and the other 51% interest-holder have agreed that the voting rights of
Medallion, the profit and loss sharing, and the additional capital contribution requirements shall be
equal to the ownership unit percentage held. Additionally, Medallion requires a super-majority vote
of 75% for all key operating and business decisions. The Company has determined that Medallion
is a VIE. However, LMS is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE because LMS
does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect Medallion's economic
performance. As such, Medallion is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with the
Company's proportionate share of Medallion's net income reflected in the unaudited consolidated

statements of operations as "Income from equity method investee" and the carrying amount
reflected in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets as "Investment in equity method investee."
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, Medallion continued expansion activities on
existing portions of its pipeline infrastructure in order to gather and transport additional third-party oil
production. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, Medallion began recognizing revenue
due to its main pipeline becoming fully operational. See Note 15.a for discussion of items included
in the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements related to Medallion.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company negotiated a buyout of a minimum
volume commitment to Medallion, which was related to natural gas gathering infrastructure
Medallion constructed on acreage that the Company does not plan to develop. The portion of the
buyout that was related to the Company's minimum volume commitment for future periods was $3.0
million and is included in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations in the line item
"Minimum volume commitments" for the period in which the buyout was settled.

Note 18—Recent accounting pronouncements
In March, April and May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), issued new
guidance in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to address the following potential
implementation issues of the new revenue standard: (a) to clarify the implementation guidance on
principal versus agent considerations, (b) to clarify the identification of performance obligations and
the licensing implementation guidance and (c) to address certain issues in the guidance on
assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed
contracts and contract modifications at transition. The effective date and transition requirements for
the amendments in these updates are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for
the guidance issued in May 2014 and August 2015 to Topic 606. These updates are effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that
reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard.
In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance in Topic 323, Investments—Equity Method and
Joint Ventures, to eliminate the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting
when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of
ownership interest or degree of influence. The amendments in this update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The
amendments in this update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in
the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method.
Early application of the amendments in this update is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements upon
adoption of this standard.
In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance in Topic 718, Compensation—Stock
Compensation, which seeks to simplify the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this
update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods
within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be
reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects
early adoption must adopt all of the applicable amendments in the same period. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements
upon adoption of this standard.
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance in Topic 842, Leases. The core principle of the
new guidance is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases in
the statement of financial position. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a
liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to
use the underlying asset for the lease term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a
lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the
lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to
terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be
included in the measurement of lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably
certain to exercise that purchase option. Reasonably certain is a high threshold that is consistent
with and intended to be applied in the same way as the reasonably assured threshold in the
previous leases guidance. In addition, also consistent with the previous leases guidance, a lessee
(and a lessor) should exclude most variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease
liabilities, other than those that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments.
For leases with a term of
36

Condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements
(Unaudited)
12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of
underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election,
it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a
lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous GAAP. There continues to be a
differentiation between finance leases and operating leases. In transition, lessees and lessors are
required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a
modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of
optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to
the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct
costs for leases that commenced before the effective date and the ability to use hindsight in
evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. An
entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that
commence before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is
modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for
all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum
rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. The amendments in this
update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early application of the amendments in this update is permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements upon adoption of this standard.
In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance in Topic 330, Inventory, which seeks to simplify the
measurement of inventory. The amendments in this update apply to inventory that is measured
using all methods excluding last-in, first-out and the retail inventory method. The main substantive
provision of this guidance is for an entity to change the subsequent measurement of inventory,
within the scope of this guidance, from LCM to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net
realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The amendments in this update are
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of
the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this
standard.
In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance in Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
—Internal-Use Software. The amendments in this update provide guidance to customers about
whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license
element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud
computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the
arrangement as a service contract. The guidance will not change GAAP for a customer's accounting
for service contracts. In addition, the guidance in this update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16.
The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
including interim periods within those annual periods and should be applied prospectively to all
arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. The
Company elected to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 on a prospective basis, and the
adoption did not have an effect on its unaudited consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and industry-specific
guidance in Subtopic 932-605, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas—Revenue Recognition. The core
principle of the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those goods or services. The new
standard also requires significantly expanded disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative
information of an entity's nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The standard creates a five-step model that requires companies to
exercise judgment when considering the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and
circumstances. The standard allows for several transition methods: (a) a full retrospective adoption
in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or (b) a modified retrospective
adoption in which the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial
statements, including additional disclosures of the standard's application impact to individual
financial statement line items. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements
upon adoption of this standard.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report as well as our audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report. The following discussion
contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected
performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about
future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please
see "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Except for purposes of the
unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto included elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report, references in this Quarterly Report to "Laredo," "we," "us," "our" or similar
terms refer to Laredo, LMS and GCM collectively unless the context otherwise indicates or requires.
All amounts, dollars and percentages presented in this Quarterly Report are rounded and therefore
approximate.
Executive overview
We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development
of oil and natural gas properties, and the transportation of oil and natural gas from such properties,
primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas. Since our inception, we have grown primarily through
our drilling program coupled with select strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.
Our financial and operating performance for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included the
following:
Oil, NGL and natural gas sales of $102.5 million, compared to $125.6 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015;
Average daily sales volumes of 47,667 BOE/D, compared to 46,532 BOE/D for the three months
ended June 30, 2015;
Net loss of $71.4 million, compared to net loss of $397.0 million, including a non-cash full cost
ceiling impairment of $488.0 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2015; and
Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $107.8 million, compared to $117.9 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2015. See page 55 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA.
Our financial and operating performance for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included the
following:
Oil, NGL and natural gas sales of $175.7 million, compared to $243.7 million for the six months
•
ended June 30, 2015;
•Average daily sales volumes of 46,935 BOE/D, compared to 47,007 BOE/D for the six months
•
•
•
•
•
•
ended June 30, 2015;
Net loss of $251.8 million, including a non-cash full cost ceiling impairment of $161.1 million,
compared to net loss of $397.5 million, including a non-cash full cost ceiling impairment of $488.0
million, for the six months ended June 30, 2015; and
Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $203.8 million, compared to $236.5 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. See page 55 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA.
Reserves, pricing and non-cash full cost ceiling impairment
Our results of operations are heavily influenced by oil, NGL and natural gas prices, which have
significantly declined and remain at low levels. Oil, NGL and natural gas price fluctuations are
caused by changes in global and regional supply and demand, market uncertainty, economic
conditions and a variety of additional factors. Since the inception of our oil and natural gas activities,
commodity prices have experienced significant fluctuations, and additional changes in commodity
prices may affect the economic viability of, and our ability to fund, our drilling projects, as well as the
economic valuation and economic recovery of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.
Our reserves as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are reported in three streams: oil, NGL
and natural gas. Net book value of evaluated oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the full
cost ceiling amount as of June 30, 2016. As such, we did not record a second-quarter non-cash full
cost ceiling impairment. See Note 2.f to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for prices used to value our reserves and additional discussion of
our full cost impairments in prior periods.
40
We have entered into a number of derivatives, which have enabled us to offset a portion of the
changes in our cash flow caused by price fluctuations on our sales of oil, NGL and natural gas as
discussed in "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Potential future low commodity price impact on our full cost impairment
Oil, NGL and natural gas prices have remained low in the third quarter of 2016. If prices remain at or
below the current low levels, subject to numerous factors and inherent limitations, and if all other
factors remain constant, we will incur an additional non-cash full cost impairment in the third quarter
of 2016, which will have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of proved reserves and accounting for
oil and natural gas properties in future periods. In addition to unknown future commodity prices,
other uncertainties include (i) changes in drilling and completion costs, (ii) changes in oilfield
service costs, (iii) production results, (iv) our ability, in a low price environment, to strategically drill
the most economic locations in our multi-stack horizontal targets, (v) income tax impacts, (vi)
potential recognition of additional proved undeveloped reserves, (vii) any potential value added to
our proved reserves when testing recoverability from drilling unbooked locations and (viii) the
inherent significant volatility in the commodity prices for oil and natural gas exemplified by the large
swings in recent months.
Each of the above factors is evaluated on a quarterly basis and if there is a material change in any
factor it is incorporated into our internal reserve estimation utilized in our quarterly accounting
estimates. We use our internal reserve estimates to evaluate, also on a quarterly basis, the
reasonableness of our reserve development plans for our reported reserves. Changes in
circumstance, including commodity pricing, economic factors and the other uncertainties described
above may lead to changes in our reserve development plans.
We have set forth below a calculation of a potential future full cost impairment. Such implied
impairment should not be interpreted to be indicative of our development plan or of our actual future
results. Each of the uncertainties noted above has been evaluated for material known trends to be
potentially included in the estimation of possible third-quarter effects. Based on such review, we
determined that the impact of decreased commodity prices is the only significant known variable
necessary in the following scenario.
Our hypothetical third-quarter 2016 full cost ceiling calculation has been prepared by substituting (a)
$36.24 per barrel for oil, (b) $10.97 per barrel for NGL and (c) $1.64 per MMBtu for natural gas (the
"Pro Forma Prices") for the respective Realized Prices as of June 30, 2016. All other inputs and
assumptions have been held constant. The Pro Forma Prices use a slightly modified Realized
Price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for oil,
NGL and natural gas on the first day of the month for the 11 months ended August 1, 2016, with the
price for August 1, 2016 held constant for the remaining twelfth month of the calculation. Based on
these inputs, the implied third-quarter impairment would be $38 million. We believe that substituting
the Pro Forma Prices in our June 30, 2016 internal reserve estimates may help provide users with
an understanding of the impact of known trends on our September 30, 2016 full cost ceiling test and
in preparing our year-end reserve estimates.
Recent developments
Acquisition of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 9,200 net
acres of additional leasehold interests in western Glasscock and Reagan counties within our core
development area (which includes production of approximately 300 net barrels of oil equivalent per
day from existing vertical wells) for an aggregate purchase price of $125.0 million. As of July 13 and
July18, 2016, we have closed portions of this acquisition for $92.7 million and $1.65 million,
respectively. The closings on the remaining interests, which are subject to certain preferential
purchase rights and consents, are expected to occur as such rights and consents are satisfied or
obtained during the third and fourth quarter of 2016.
July 2016 equity offering
On July 19, 2016, we completed the sale of 13,000,000 shares of Laredo's common stock for net
proceeds of $136.3 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, which
were used to repay borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We granted the
underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,950,000 shares of Laredo's common
stock on the same terms. On August 4, 2016, the underwriters provided notice of the full exercise of
the option. The sale of the additional 1,950,000 shares of Laredo’s common stock pursuant to the
option is expected to close on August 9, 2016 and will result in net proceeds of $20.5 million, after
underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
41
Core areas of operations
The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive
production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production
rates. As of June 30, 2016, we had assembled 128,504 net acres in the Permian Basin.
Sources of our revenue
Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of produced oil, NGL and natural gas within the
continental United States and the sale of purchased oil, and our revenues do not include the effects
of derivatives. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our revenues were comprised of sales of
54% produced oil, 10% produced NGL, 6% produced natural gas, 29% purchased oil and 1%
midstream services. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our revenues were comprised of
sales of 53% produced oil, 9% produced NGL, 7% produced natural gas, 29% purchased oil and
2% midstream services. Our oil, NGL and natural gas revenues may vary significantly from period to
period as a result of changes in volumes of production and/or changes in commodity prices. Our
sales of purchased oil revenue may vary due to changes in oil prices and market differentials. Our
midstream service revenues may vary due to oil throughput fees and the level of services provided
to third parties for (i) gathered natural gas, (ii) gas lift fees and (iii) water services.

The volumes presented are based on actual results and are not calculated using the rounded
numbers presented in the table above.
Realized oil, NGL and natural gas prices are the actual prices realized at the wellhead adjusted
for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and
other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The prices presented are based on
actual results and are not calculated using the rounded numbers presented in the table above.
Hedged prices reflect the after-effect of our hedging transactions on our average sales prices.
Our calculation of such after-effects includes current period settlements of matured derivatives in
(4)accordance with GAAP and an adjustment to reflect premiums incurred previously or upon
settlement that are attributable to instruments that settled in the period. The prices presented are
based on actual results and are not calculated using the rounded numbers presented in the table

2016 Revenues
Oil revenue. Our oil revenue is a function of oil production volumes sold and average sales prices
received for those volumes. The decrease in oil revenue of $19.2 million, or 20%, for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, is mainly due
to a 22% decrease in average oil prices realized, partially offset by a 4% increase in oil production.
The decrease in oil revenue of $54.6 million, or 29%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, is mainly due to a 27% decrease in average oil
prices realized and a 2% decrease in oil production.
See "—Results of operations - midstream and marketing" for a discussion of our revenue from sales
of purchased oil.
NGL and natural gas revenues. Our NGL and natural gas revenues are a function of NGL and
natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. NGL
revenue of $14.1 million remained mostly unchanged for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in natural gas revenue of $3.9
million, or 30%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2015, is mainly due to a 28% decrease in average natural gas prices realized.
The decrease in NGL revenue of $4.1 million, or 15%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, is mainly due to a 20% decrease in average NGL
prices realized, partially offset by a 6% increase in NGL production. The decrease in natural gas
revenue of $9.3 million, or 34%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015, is mainly due to a 34% decrease in average natural gas prices
realized.

Lease operating expenses. Lease operating expenses, which include workover expenses,
decreased by $10.0 million, or 34%, and $21.8 million, or 35%, for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015. Previous investments in
field infrastructure, primarily in our four production corridors, including water takeaway and recycling
facilities and centralized compression, have lowered expenses and reduced well downtime. We
continue to focus on the usage and procurement of products and services related to direct operating
expenses.
Production and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased by $1.5 million, or
16%, and $4.2 million, or 22%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as
compared to the same periods in 2015. This change is mainly due to a decrease in production taxes
of $1.1 million and $3.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
same periods in 2015 as a result of the corresponding decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas
revenues. Production taxes are based on and fluctuate in proportion to our oil, NGL and natural gas
revenue.

G&A expense, excluding stock-based compensation, decreased by $2.5 million, or 15%, and $4.0
million, or 12%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the
same periods in 2015. One of the main contributors to these decreases was the expense incurred
for our 2013 Performance Unit Awards of $1.0 million and $1.7 million during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. There was no comparable expense during the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016. The performance criteria of these awards were satisfied on
December 31, 2015, were paid during the first quarter of 2016 and were accounted for as liability
awards.
Other significant contributors to the decreases in G&A expense, excluding stock-based
compensation, are (i) reduced personnel expenses and (ii) a decrease in professional fees primarily
due to a decrease in nonrecurring projects.

Stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, decreased by $0.2 million, or 3%, and $1.1
million, or 10%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the
same periods in 2015. As a result of stockholder approval of the Amendment to the LTIP at our 2016
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, on May 25, 2016, the restricted stock awards, restricted stock
options and performance awards that were contingent as of March 31, 2016 became granted on
May 25, 2016, at which time we began recording expense. For further discussion of our stock-based
compensation, see Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report.
The fair values for each of our restricted stock awards issued were calculated based on the value of
our stock price on the grant date in accordance with GAAP and are being expensed on a straight-
line basis over their associated requisite service periods. The fair values for each of our non-
qualified restricted stock options awards were determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model in
accordance with GAAP and are being expensed on a straight-line basis over their associated four-
year requisite service periods.
Our performance share awards are accounted for as equity awards and are included in stock-based
compensation expense. The fair values of the performance share awards issued were based on a
projection of the performance of our stock price relative to a peer group, defined in each
performance share awards' agreement, utilizing a forward-looking Monte Carlo simulation. The fair
values for each of our performance share awards will not be re-measured after their initial grant-date
valuation and are being expensed on a straight-line basis over their associated three-year requisite
service periods.
See Notes 2.m and 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report for additional information regarding our stock and performance based
compensation.
Restructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses were for the first-quarter 2015 RIF that was
undertaken to reduce expenses and better position ourselves for future operations in a low
commodity price environment. Restructuring expenses of $6.0 million were incurred during the six
months ended June 30, 2015. No comparable expenses were recorded during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. See Note 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the RIF.

further discussion of our non-cash full cost ceiling impairments, see Note 2.f to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Other less material
components of impairment expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are $1.0 million for

Total changes in loss on

The change in fair value of derivatives outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 is the result of the changing relationship between our
outstanding contract prices and the associated forward curves used to calculate the fair value of our
derivatives in relation to expected market prices. In general, we experience gains during periods of
decreasing market prices and losses during periods of increasing market prices. The change in loss
on derivatives, net for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 was partially offset by
proceeds received in a hedge restructuring in which we early terminated floors of certain derivative
contract collars, resulting in a termination amount due to us of $80.0 million. The $80.0 million was
settled in full by applying the proceeds to the premiums on two new

the same periods in 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Medallion, our equity
method investee, continued expansion activities on existing portions of its pipeline infrastructure in
order to gather additional third-party oil production. Medallion began recognizing revenue during the
first quarter of 2015 due to its main pipeline becoming fully operational. The Medallion pipeline
system transported 99,000 barrels of oil per day ("BOPD") and 35,000 BOPD for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 91,000 BOPD and 25,000 BOPD during the six

Interest expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 2%, and $9.2 million, or 16%, for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. These
decreases are primarily due to the early redemption of the January 2019 Notes on April 6, 2015,
which is partially offset by the issuance of the March 2023 Notes. The March 2023 Notes, which
began accruing interest on March 18, 2015, have both a lower interest rate and a lower principal
amount than the January 2019 Notes.
Loss on disposal of assets, net. Loss on disposal of assets, net decreased by $0.9 million and $1.5
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2015 as a result of lower losses related to the sales and write-off of materials and

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net
deferred tax asset due to uncertainties in the timing of the realization of our deferred tax assets.
Because of continued uncertainties in the oil and gas markets, we recorded an additional valuation
allowance of $83.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Due to the recording of
these valuation allowances, our effective rates for the current year are not comparable to prior years.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, our effective tax rate was 36% and 35%,
respectively. For further discussion of our valuation allowance, see Note 7 to our unaudited

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, certain shares related to restricted
stock awards vested at times when our stock price was lower than the fair value of those shares on
the grant date. As a result, the income tax deduction related to such shares is less than the expense
previously recognized for book purposes. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
certain stock options were exercised, for which the income tax deduction related to the options'
intrinsic value is less than the expense previously recognized for book purposes. There were no
stock options exercised during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. As a result of these
differences in book compensation expense and related tax deduction, the tax impact of these
shortfalls decreased by $0.2 million and increased by $1.2 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.
48
We utilize a one-pool approach when accounting for the pool of windfall tax benefits in which
employees and non-employees are grouped into a single pool. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
did not have any eligible windfall tax benefits to offset future shortfalls as no excess tax benefits had
been recognized, and therefore the tax impact of these shortfalls is included in income tax expense
for these respective periods. We expect income tax provisions for future reporting periods will be
impacted by this stock compensation tax deduction shortfall; however, we cannot predict the stock
compensation shortfall impact because of dependency upon the future market price of our stock.

G&A expense was allocated based on the number of employees in the midstream and marketing
segment as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. Certain components of G&A expense, primarily payroll,
(3)
(2)
(1)deferred compensation and vehicle expenses, were not allocated but were actual expenses for
each segment. Land and geology expenses were not allocated to the midstream and marketing
segment.
Depreciation and amortization were actual expenses for the midstream and marketing segment
with the exception of the allocation of depreciation of other fixed assets, which was based on the
number of employees in the midstream and marketing segment as of June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Other operating costs and expenses consist of accretion of asset retirement obligations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and restructuring expense and impairment
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. These are actual costs and expenses and were not
allocated.
Interest expense was allocated to the midstream and marketing segment based on gross
property and equipment and life-to-date contributions to the Company's equity method investee
as of June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Loss on early redemption of debt was allocated to the midstream and marketing segment based
on gross property and equipment and life-to-date contributions to the Company's equity method
investee as of June 30, 2015.

Natural gas sales. These revenues are related to our midstream and marketing segment providing
our exploration and production segment with processed natural gas for use in the field. The
corresponding cost component of these transactions are included in "Midstream service expenses."
See Note 16 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report for additional information on the operating segments.
Midstream service revenues. Our midstream service revenues from operations increased by $6.8
million and $14.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to the same periods in 2015. This increase is mainly due to (i) water service revenue that we began
recognizing in the third quarter of 2015 and (ii) an increase in volumes of natural gas provided for
natural gas lift mainly in our production corridors over the prior periods.
49
Sales of purchased oil. Sales of purchased oil decreased by $12.4 million and $12.1 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015
primarily due to the decrease in oil prices. We purchase oil from third parties in West Texas,
transport it on the Bridgetex Pipeline and sell it to a third party in the Houston market.
Midstream service expenses, including minimum volume commitments. Midstream service
expenses, including minimum volume commitments in 2015, increased by $5.6 million and $8.7
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.
Midstream service expenses primarily represent costs incurred to operate and maintain our (i) oil
and natural gas gathering and transportation systems and related facilities, (ii) centralized oil
storage tanks, (iii) natural gas lift, rig fuel and centralized compression infrastructure and (iv) water
storage, recycling and transportation facilities. The increases are due to continued expansion of the
midstream service component of our business.
Costs of purchased oil. Costs of purchased oil decreased by $10.4 million and $8.7 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015
primarily due to the decrease in oil prices. These costs include purchasing oil from third parties and
transporting it on the Bridgetex Pipeline.
G&A. Our consolidated G&A expense has decreased for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. See "—Results of operations consolidated" for a
discussion of these costs.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.1 million and $0.6
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015
due to the continued expansion of our midstream service infrastructure.
Income from equity method investee. We own 49% of the ownership units of Medallion. As such, we
account for this investment under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of
net income reflected in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations as "Income from equity
method investee" and the carrying amount reflected in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets
as "Investment in equity method investee." During the year ended December 31, 2015, Medallion
began recognizing revenue due to its main pipeline becoming fully operational. See Note 14 to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for
additional information regarding this investment.
Interest expense. Interest expense increased by $0.3 million and $0.4 million for three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. Interest is
allocated to the midstream and marketing segment based on its gross property and equipment and
life-to-date contributions to its equity method investee. We have expanded the midstream and
marketing component of our business and built out our service facilities in the past year in addition
to increasing our capital contributions to Medallion compared to prior periods, thereby increasing
the interest expense that is allocated to this segment. These increases are slightly offset by
significant decreases in our consolidated interest expense. See "—Results of operations
consolidated" for a discussion of these decreases.
Liquidity and capital resources
Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity
offerings, proceeds from senior unsecured note offerings, borrowings under our Senior Secured
Credit Facility and proceeds from asset dispositions. We believe cash flows from operations
(including our hedging program) and availability under our Senior Secured Credit Facility provide
sufficient liquidity to manage our cash needs and contractual obligations and to fund expected
capital expenditures. Our primary operational uses of capital have been for the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, LMS' infrastructure development and
investments in Medallion.
A significant portion of our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us. We
continually monitor the capital markets and our capital structure and consider which financing
alternatives, including equity and debt capital resources, joint ventures and asset sales, are
available to meet our future planned or accelerated capital expenditures. We may make changes to
our capital structure from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or
improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. Such financing alternatives, including capital
market transactions and debt repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our
liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be
material.
We continually seek to maintain a financial profile that provides operational flexibility. However, as
evidenced by the decline in our Realized Prices used in our reserves compared to the prior year,
the decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas prices may have a negative impact on our ability to raise
additional capital and/or maintain our desired levels of liquidity. As of August 2, 2016, we had
$745.0 million available for borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We believe that
our operating cash flow and the aforementioned liquidity sources provide us with the financial
resources to implement our planned
50
exploration and development activities. We use derivatives to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the
prices of oil, NGL and natural gas. As of August 3, 2016, approximately 95% of our anticipated oil
production for the last six months of 2016 is hedged at a weighted-average floor price of $67.13 per
Bbl and approximately 65% of our anticipated natural gas production for the last six months of 2016
is hedged at a weighted-average floor price of $3.00 per MMBtu.

For this illustration we utilized the July 26, 2016 (i) WTI index oil spot price of $42.92 per Bbl, (ii)
Mont Belvieu Purity Ethane-OPIS spot price of $7.77 (converted to $/Bbl), (iii) Mont Belvieu
Propane (TET)-OPIS spot price of $19.24 (converted to $/Bbl) and (iv) Waha natural gas spot
price of $2.65 per MMBtu. Prices used were held constant for all periods presented. Additionally,
we reduced our projected oil and natural gas hedge cash proceeds by the actual cash payments
required for deferred premiums for the calendar years presented.
By removing a significant portion of the price volatility associated with future production, we expect
to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations due to
fluctuations in commodity prices.
On September 15, 2015, we completed the sale of non-strategic and primarily non-operated
properties and associated production totaling 6,060 net acres and 123 producing properties in the
Midland Basin to a third-party buyer for a purchase price of $65.5 million. After transaction costs
reflecting an economic effective date of July 1, 2015, the net proceeds were $64.8 million, net of
working capital adjustments and post-closing cost adjustments.
On March 5, 2015, we completed the sale of 69,000,000 shares of Laredo's common stock for net
proceeds of $754.2 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
Entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus purchased 29,800,000 shares in the March 2015 Equity
Offering, following which Warburg Pincus owned 41.0% of our common stock.
On March 18, 2015, we completed an offering of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6
1/4% senior unsecured notes due 2023, which will mature on March 15, 2023 and bear an interest
rate of 6 1/4% per annum payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on March 15 and September 15
of each year, commencing September 15, 2015.
On May 16, 2016, we completed the sale of 10,925,000 shares of Laredo's common stock for net
proceeds of $119.3 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
51
As of June 30, 2016, we had $110.3 million outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility
and $1.3 billion in senior unsecured notes. We had $704.7 million available for borrowings under
our Senior Secured Credit Facility and $19.3 million in cash on hand for total available liquidity of
$724.0 million as of June 30, 2016.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we completed the sale of 13,000,000 shares of Laredo's common
stock for net proceeds of $136.3 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering
expenses, which were used to repay borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. We
granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,950,000 shares of
Laredo's common stock on the same terms. On August 4, 2016, the underwriters provided notice of
the full exercise of the option. The sale of the additional 1,950,000 shares of Laredo’s common
stock pursuant to the option is expected to close on August 9, 2016 and will result in net proceeds of
$20.5 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.
As of August 2, 2016, we had $1.4 billion in debt outstanding, $745.0 million available for
borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and $14.6 million in cash on hand for total
available liquidity of $759.6 million. A continued decline in oil and natural gas prices will negatively
impact our future borrowing base redeterminations.
Our derivative positions will help us stabilize a portion of our expected cash flows from operations in
the event of future declines in the price of oil and natural gas. See "Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" below.

Cash flows provided by operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $138.6 million and $114.3 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of $24.3 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was largely due to the price-related
decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas revenue during 2015; however, notable cash flow changes
consist of (i) a decrease in impairment expense of $328.5 million, (ii) a decrease in depletion,
depreciation and amortization expense of $68.4 million, (iii) an increase in loss on derivatives, net
of $49.9 million, (iv) an increase in working capital changes of $47.9 million and (v) a decrease of
$31.5 million related to our loss on the early redemption of our January 2019 Notes.
Our operating cash flows are sensitive to a number of variables, the most significant of which are
the volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices and production levels. Regional and worldwide

economic activity, weather, infrastructure, capacity to reach markets, costs of operations and other
variable factors significantly impact the prices of these commodities. These factors are not within
our control and are difficult to predict. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on
our financial position, see "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Cash flows used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $243.6 million and $429.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $186.0 million is mainly attributable to a
$177.5 million decrease in capital expenditures for oil and natural gas properties and a $30.7
million decrease in capital expenditures for midstream service assets. These changes partially
offset by a $28.2 million increase in investment in our equity method investee.

Capital expenditure budget
On May 10, 2016, our board of directors approved an increase to the capital expenditure budget of
approximately $75.0 million. Our revised capital expenditure budget is $420.0 million for calendar
year 2016, excluding acquisitions and investments in Medallion. We do not have a specific
acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. Since
we do not direct the expansion activities of Medallion as a 49% owner, we cannot predict future
capital commitments.
The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within
management's control. If oil, NGL and natural gas prices decline below our acceptable levels, or
costs increase above our acceptable levels, we may choose to defer a portion of our budgeted
capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of
liquidity and prioritize capital projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and
potential to generate near-term cash flow. Subject to financing alternatives, we may also increase
our capital expenditures significantly to take advantage of opportunities we consider to be attractive.
We consistently monitor and may adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success
or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing and joint venture
opportunities, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals,
the availability of rigs, reduction of service costs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash
flow and other factors both within and outside our control.
Cash flows provided by financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $93.2 million and $343.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our primary
sources of cash provided by financing activities were borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit
Facility and proceeds from our May 2016 Equity Offering, partially offset by payments on our Senior
Secured Credit Facility. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, our primary sources of cash
provided by financing activities were borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, issuance of
our March 2023 Notes and proceeds from our March 2015 Equity Offering, partially offset by our
payment in full of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and redemption of our January 2019 Notes.

Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which
matures November 4, 2018, had a maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion, a borrowing base and an
aggregate elected commitment of $815.0 million and $110.3 million outstanding.
The borrowing base under our Senior Secured Credit Facility is subject to a semi-annual
redetermination based on the lenders' evaluation of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. The
lenders have the right to call for an interim redetermination of the borrowing base once between any
two redetermination dates and in other specified circumstances. Effective May 2, 2016, in
connection with the lenders' regular semi-annual redetermination of the borrowing base, the
borrowing base and aggregate elected commitment amounts were each reduced to $815.0 million.
Principal amounts borrowed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are payable on the final
maturity date with such borrowings bearing interest that is payable, at our election, either on the last
day of each fiscal quarter at an Adjusted Base Rate or at the end of one-, two-, three-, six- or, to the
extent available, 12-month interest periods (and in the case of six- and 12-month interest periods,
every three months prior to the end of such interest period) at an Adjusted London Interbank Offered
Rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin based on the ratio of the outstanding amount on the
Senior Secured Credit Facility to the elected commitment. We are also required to pay an annual
commitment fee based on the unused portion of the bank's commitment of 0.375% to 0.5%.
Our Senior Secured Credit Facility is secured by a first-priority lien on certain of our assets,
including oil and natural gas properties constituting at least 80% of the present value of our proved
reserves owned now or in the future. Our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains both financial and
non-financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2016 and
expect to be in compliance with them for the foreseeable future.
Senior unsecured notes. The following table presents principal amounts and applicable interest
rates for our outstanding senior unsecured notes as of June 30, 2016:

Utilizing proceeds from the March 2023 Notes and the March 2015 Equity Offering, we redeemed
the January 2019 Notes in full on April 6, 2015. See Note 5.d to our unaudited consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for information regarding the early
redemption of the January 2019 Notes.
Refer to Note 5 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Annual Report

Quarterly Report for further discussion of the March 2023 Notes, January 2022 Notes, May 2022
Notes, January 2019 Notes and our Senior Secured Credit Facility.
As of August 2, 2016, we had a total of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding and $70.0
million outstanding on the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
Obligations and commitments
As of June 30, 2016, our contractual obligations included our March 2023 Notes, January 2022
Notes, May 2022 Notes, Senior Secured Credit Facility, drilling contract commitments, firm sale and
transportation commitments, derivative deferred premiums, asset retirement obligations and office
and equipment leases. From December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016, the material changes in our
contractual obligations included (i) a decrease of $42.0 million on our interest obligations for our
senior unsecured notes as semi-annual interest payments were made in January, March and May of
2016, (ii) a decrease of $27.6 million in our outstanding capital contribution commitment to our
equity method investee due to payments made to Medallion during first-quarter 2016, (iii) a
decrease of $25.5 million in our firm sale and transportation commitments, (iv) a decrease of $24.7
million outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, (v) a decrease of $7.3 million for drilling
contract commitments (on contracts other than those on a well-by-well basis) and (vi) a decrease of
$6.4 million in our performance unit liability awards as the 2013 Performance Unit Awards were
paid in first-quarter 2016.
Refer to Notes 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14 and 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of our contractual obligations.

Non-GAAP financial measures
The non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, this non-GAAP measure should be
considered in conjunction with net income or loss and other performance measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or loss or cash flow from operating activities.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such
as net income or loss, operating income or loss or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial
performance.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income or loss plus
adjustments for deferred income tax expense or benefit, depletion, depreciation and amortization,
bad debt expense, impairment expense, non-cash stock-based compensation, restructuring
expenses, gains or losses on derivatives, cash settlements received for matured derivatives, cash
settlements on early terminated derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives, interest expense, write-
off of debt issuance costs, gains or losses on disposal of assets, loss on early redemption of debt
and buyout of minimum volume commitment. Adjusted EBITDA provides no information regarding a
•
company's capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, working capital
movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary
use because those funds are required for debt service, capital expenditures and working capital,
income taxes, franchise taxes and other commitments and obligations. However, our management
believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because
this measure:
is widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company's operating
performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term, which can vary
substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of
assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;
helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from
period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and
 is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of operating
performance, in presentations to our board of directors and as a basis for strategic planning and
forecasting.
There are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance,
including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that
materially affect our net income or loss, the lack of comparability of results of operations to different
companies and the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different
companies. Our measurements of Adjusted EBITDA for financial reporting as compared to
compliance under our debt agreements differ.

Critical accounting policies and estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to
such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been
reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our
estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and
assumptions used in preparation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We believe
these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in
preparation of our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
In management's opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by our judgments and
estimates are (i) the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, (ii) estimation of
oil, NGL and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenues, (iii)
impairment of oil and natural gas properties, (iv) revenue recognition, (v) estimation of income taxes,
(vi) asset retirement obligations, (vii) valuation of derivatives and deferred premiums, (viii) valuation
of stock-based compensation and performance unit compensation and (ix) fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition. Management's judgments and estimates in these
areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including
engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from
these estimates as additional information becomes known.
There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and procedures during the
six months ended June 30, 2016. For our other critical accounting policies and procedures, please
see our disclosure of critical accounting policies in "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the 2015 Annual Report. Additionally,
see Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.
Recent accounting pronouncements
See Note 18 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
56
Off-balance sheet arrangements
Currently, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, a
drilling contract commitment and firm sale and transportation commitments, which are included in
"Obligations and commitments." See Note 12 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information.
57
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and
qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term "market risk," in our
case, refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and
in interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses,
but rather indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our
market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for hedging purposes, rather than for speculative
trading.
Commodity price exposure
Due to the inherent volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, we use derivatives, such as puts,
swaps, collars and, in prior periods, basis swaps to hedge price risk associated with a significant
portion of our anticipated production. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with
future production, we expect to reduce, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash
flows from operations due to fluctuations in commodity prices. We have not elected hedge
accounting on these derivatives and, therefore, the gains and losses on open positions are reflected
in earnings. At each period-end, we estimate the fair values of our derivatives using an independent
third-party valuation and recognize the associated gain or loss in our unaudited consolidated
statements of operations.
The fair values of our derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the
relevant price indices. As of June 30, 2016, a 10% change in the forward curves associated with our
derivatives would have changed our net positions to the following amounts:
(in thousands) 10% Increase 10% Decrease
Derivatives
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair values of our open derivative contracts were
$116.4 million and $276.2 million, respectively. Refer to Notes 2.e, 8 and 9 of our unaudited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional
disclosures regarding our derivatives.
Interest rate risk
Our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate and, as of June 30, 2016, we had
$110.3 million outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our January 2022 Notes, May
2022 Notes and March 2023 Notes bear fixed interest rates and we had $450.0 million, $500.0
million and $350.0 million outstanding, respectively, as of June 30, 2016, as shown in the table
below.

Counterparty and customer credit risk
As of June 30, 2016, our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables of (i) $121.6
million from the fair values of our open derivative contracts, (ii) $42.6 million from the sale of our oil,
NGL and natural gas production that we market to energy marketing companies and refineries, (iii)
$18.4 million from joint-interest partners, (iv) $15.0 million from sales of purchased oil and other
products and (v) $12.2 million from matured derivatives.
$—
% —
% 2.000 %
$110.3
We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of (i) our oil, NGL and natural gas receivables
with several significant customers and (ii) our midstream service product sales receivable with one
significant customer. On occasion we require our customers to post collateral, and the inability of
our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may
adversely affect our financial results.
We have entered into International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements ("ISDA
Agreements") with each of
58
our derivative counterparties, who also are lenders in our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The terms
of the ISDA Agreements provide the counterparties and us with rights of offset upon the occurrence
of defined acts of default by either a counterparty or us to a derivative, whereby the party not in
default may offset all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all derivative asset
receivables from the defaulting party.
Refer to Note 11 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report for additional disclosures regarding credit risk.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of Laredo's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Exchange Act), was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Laredo's
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on that
evaluation, these officers concluded that Laredo's disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of June 30, 2016. Our disclosure controls and other procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to Laredo's management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation of changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
60
PART II
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business, including proceedings for which we may not have insurance coverage. While many of
these matters involve inherent uncertainty, as of the date hereof, we are not party to any legal
proceedings that we currently believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider
the risks discussed in our 2015 Annual Report. There have been no material changes in our risk
factors from those described in the 2015 Annual Report. The risks described in the 2015 Annual
Report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us
or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition or future results.

Item 5.    Other Information
Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we may be required to disclose in our annual and
quarterly reports to the SEC, whether we or any of our "affiliates" knowingly engaged in certain
activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities targeted by
U.S. economic sanctions. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or
dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Because the SEC defines the term
"affiliate" broadly, it includes any entity under common "control" with us (with the term "control" also
being construed broadly by the SEC).
The description of the activities below has been provided to us by Warburg Pincus LLC ("WP"),
affiliates of which: (i) beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock and/or are
members of our board of directors and (ii) beneficially own more than 10% of the equity interests of,
and have the right to designate members of the board of directors of, Santander Asset Management
Investment Holdings Limited ("SAMIH"). SAMIH may therefore be deemed to be under common
"control" with us; however, this statement is not meant to be an admission that common control
exists.
61
The disclosure below relates solely to activities conducted by SAMIH and its affiliates that may be
deemed to be under common "control" with us. The disclosure does not relate to any activities
conducted by us or by WP and does not involve our or WP's management. Neither WP nor Laredo
has had any involvement in or control over the disclosed activities of SAMIH, and neither WP nor
Laredo has independently verified or participated in the preparation of the disclosure. Neither WP
nor Laredo is representing to the accuracy or completeness of the disclosure nor do WP or we
undertake any obligation to correct or update it.
We understand that one or more SEC-reporting affiliates of SAMIAH intends to disclose in their next
annual or quarterly SEC report that:
(a) Santander UK plc ("Santander UK") holds two frozen savings accounts and two frozen current
accounts for three customers resident in the United Kingdom ("UK") who are currently designated
by the United States ("US") under the Specially Designated Global Terrorist ("SDGT") sanctions
program. The accounts held by each customer were blocked after the customer’s designation and
have remained blocked and dormant through the first half of 2016. Revenue generated by
Santander UK on these accounts in the first half of 2016 was £7.31 whilst net profits in the first half
of 2016 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Banco Santander SA.
(b) An Iranian national, resident in the UK, who is currently designated by the US under the Iranian
Financial Sanctions Regulations ("IFSR") and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators
Sanctions Regulations, held a mortgage with Santander UK that was issued prior to any such
designation. The mortgage account was redeemed and closed on April 13, 2016. No further
drawdown has been made (or would be allowed) under this mortgage although Santander UK
continued to receive repayment installments prior to redemption. In the first half of 2016, total
revenue generated by Santander UK in connection with the mortgage was £434.64 whilst net profits
were negligible relative to the overall profits of Banco Santander SA. Santander UK does not intend
to enter into any new relationships with this customer, and any disbursements will only be made in
accordance with applicable sanctions. The same Iranian national also held two investment
accounts with Santander ISA Managers Limited. The funds within both accounts were invested in
the same portfolio fund. The accounts remained frozen until the investments were closed on May
12, 2016 and checks issued to customer on May 13, 2016. Total revenue in the first half of 2016
generated by Santander UK in connection with the investment accounts was £7.60 whilst net profits
in the first half of 2016 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Banco Santander SA.
(c) A UK national designated by the US under the SDGT sanctions program holds a Santander UK
current account. The account remained in arrears through the first half of 2016 (£1,344.01 in debit)
and is currently being managed by Santander UK Collections & Recoveries department.
(d) In addition, during the first half of 2016, Santander UK has identified an OFAC match on a power
of attorney account. A party listed on the account is currently designated by the US under the SDGT
and IFSR sanctions programs. During the first half of 2016, related revenue generated by Santander
UK was £129.21 whilst net profits in the first half of 2016 were negligible relative to the overall
profits of Banco Santander SA.
