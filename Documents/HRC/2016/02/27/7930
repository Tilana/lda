<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural 
rights, Farida Shaheed, visited Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 5 to 9 November 
</p><p>2012. The Special Rapporteur visited Kingstown, Sandy Bay and Union Island. She met 
with Government officials and statutory bodies working in the areas of culture and tourism, 
education, legal affairs and central planning. She also met with artists, teachers, historians, 
people involved in organizing cultural events and festivals, as well as representatives from 
civil society. In addition, she visited Sandy Bay Secondary School, the Secondary School 
of Union Island, and Boys Grammar School in Kingstown, as well as community radio 
stations. 
</p>
<p>2. Thorough discussions were held with all interlocutors on the achievements as well 
as the challenges of implementing cultural rights in the country, particularly with regards to 
history, cultural heritage and tourism. The Special Rapporteur considered these issues with 
a view to assisting the Government and other relevant actors in their efforts to address the 
challenges and obstacles they meet in this regard.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the invitation to undertake this 
first-ever visit conducted by a Special Rapporteur to the country, and expresses her 
gratitude to all those who have given her the benefit of their time and expertise. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context  
</b>4. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is an island country comprised of Saint Vincent, 
the main island, and the Grenadines, a chain of 32 islands and cays, of which only seven are 
inhabited. The country is relatively small, totalling 389 square kilometres, of which the 
main island comprises 344 square kilometres. It has a small population of about 100,000 
inhabitants, a situation that has its advantages as it offers the Government and its 
institutions the possibility of maintaining close links with the population. However, the 
situation also poses difficulties. As stressed by several interlocutors, the lack of a critical 
mass for collecting sufficient revenue from taxes impacts every aspect of life, including 
those relating to the implementation of cultural rights. In addition, the concentration of the 
population on the island of Saint Vincent, as well as the lack of human resources and 
expertise, present serious challenges to the country. 
</p>
<p>5. According to data from the Saint Vincent Statistical Office, the country&#8217;s population 
is mainly composed of people of African descent (72.84 per cent); about 20 per cent of the 
population identify themselves as &#8220;mixed,&#8221; 3.59 per cent as indigenous (Amerindian/Carib 
people, totalling about 3,800 persons), 0.82 per cent as White or Caucasian (about 800 
persons) and 0.57 per cent as Portuguese (about 600 persons). According to some estimates, 
approximately 6,500 people of Indian origin live in the country and are fully integrated in 
Saint Vincent society; however, only about 1.35 per cent of the population identified 
themselves as East Indian (about 1,400 persons) in the last population census. Minor 
portions of the population also identify themselves as Chinese (0.03 per cent) and 
Syrian/Lebanese (0.06 per cent).1  
</p><p>6. Religious communities in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are mainly Christian 
(Anglican: 17.75 per cent; Pentecostal: 17.61 per cent; Methodist: 10.86 per cent, Seventh 
Day Adventist: 10.22 per cent; Baptist: 9.96 per cent; Roman Catholic: 7.47 per cent).

</p>
<p>Rastafarians account for 1.48 per cent of the population, while about 8.83 per cent of the 
population declare that they have no religion.  
</p>
<p>7. According to the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Country Poverty Assessment 
2007-2008, Final Report, the difficulties the country has had in its programme of poverty 
reduction have to be seen against the decline of the banana industry, on which it was largely 
dependent, in the latter years of the 20th century as a new regime was put in place in the 
main export market and the World Trade Organisation rules became operative. The 
protection enjoyed by the banana industry was removed and other sectors providing sources 
of foreign exchange income were negatively affected. &#8220;Tourism was buoyant from time to 
time but the sector is small relative to the rest of the economy of St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines.&#8221; However, as also stated in the report, poverty and indigence have decreased 
from the 1995/1996 to 2007/2008.2 
</p>
<p>8. In 2008, levels of poverty were higher in the north-eastern part of Saint Vincent, in 
an area where the Callinagos (see below) were historically settled, than in the rest of the 
country. Interlocutors stressed that although this is still the case today, the gap has been 
decreasing; the assessment which would need to be confirmed by research. Interlocutors 
stressed in particular that considerable efforts in the area of education, as well as 
development of infrastructure linking the north-eastern and southern parts of the island, in 
particular Kingstown, has helped to alleviate poverty. The building of a bridge over the 
&#8220;dry river&#8221; in 2005 was mentioned many times, a crucial link which now allows people 
from the various communities to meet more often and to increase their economic, social and 
cultural relationships throughout the year. Previously, seasonal flooding impeded 
movements to and from this area. 
</p>
<p>9. According to numerous interlocutors, over the last decade, commendable efforts 
have been made by the Government to ensure better recognition of the country&#8217;s diverse 
cultural heritage, despite resource constraints. Public statements made at the highest level 
of the State were also referred to frequently as having created a climate favourable to 
cultural diversity.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Relevant constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>10. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy on the Westminster 
model within the Commonwealth of Nations. Its 1979 Constitution guarantees a list of 
human rights, including freedom of conscience (art. 9), freedom of expression (art. 10), 
freedom of assembly and association (art. 11), freedom of movement (art. 12), protection 
against discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, place of origin, political opinions, colour 
or creed (art. 13).3 The Special Rapporteur notes that although these provisions are of high 
importance for the protection of cultural freedoms, no specific provision is devoted to 
cultural rights per se. 
</p>
<p>11. In 2009, an important constitutional referendum was held, but it was defeated, with 
55.64 per cent of the population voting against the adoption of a new Constitution. The text 
included far-reaching reforms towards republicanism. New provisions relating to the

<p><b>A/HRC/23/34/Add.2

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>protection of economic, social and cultural rights had also been proposed, recognizing in 
particular the rights of Vincentians &#8220;to have their historical, cultural and other heritage 
respected, protected and preserved&#8221; and the right of people &#8220;to the enjoyment of freedom of 
culture and to cultural expression.&#8221;4 The Special Rapporteur regrets that such important 
provisions were not adopted. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Relevant laws and policies 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Government is currently finalizing its new cultural policy through a process 
which includes consultations with various stakeholders, including representatives of the 
Indian Heritage Foundation and the Garifuna Heritage Foundation, as well as social groups, 
such as artists and artisans. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that at the time of her 
visit, very few of the interlocutors she met were aware of the planned consultations. While 
commending the Government for its willingness to carry out wide consultations, she 
stresses that stakeholders need to be informed sufficiently in advance with proper 
documentation so as to ensure meaningful input from all stakeholders and broad ownership 
of the policy.  
</p>
<p>13. At present, the Government is also discussing its new strategy for tourism. The 
Special Rapporteur stresses the need to ensure coherence between cultural and tourism 
policies, through specific procedures and mechanisms. As the Government is aware, the 
development of tourism may well result in greater support for the local culture but can also 
have a detrimental impact on tangible and intangible cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Relevant institutions 
</b></p>
<p>14. There is still no national human rights institution in Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines. The draft 2009 Constitution provided for the creation of a Human Rights 
Commission and an Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. Under article 16 of the current Constitution, 
people may apply to the High Court for redress in case of breach of their fundamental 
rights, as enshrined in the Constitution. However, the Special Rapporteur did not receive 
any information indicating that this provision is resorted to. 
</p>
<p>15. Two national institutions engaged in matters related to culture are of particular 
importance and will likely be called to play an increasing role in the protection and 
promotion of cultural rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><i>  The National Trust 
</i></p>
<p>16. The Saint Vincent and the Grenadines National Trust is a non-profit statutory body 
established in 1969 with the mandate to, inter alia, locate, conserve and restore areas of 
beauty as well as buildings and objects of archaeological, architectural, artistic, historic, 
scientific or traditional interest. The Trust may declare places, buildings and objects as 
Protected National Heritage; make and keep inventories and educate the public about the 
historical assets and natural amenities of the country. 5  
</p>
<p>17. In 2007, the National Trust, in its own words, has secured the passage of &#8220;some of 
the most far reaching conservation legislation in the Caribbean. Act No. 37 of 2007 
authorises the Trust to declare as &#8216;Protected National Heritage&#8217; any place, building or 
object, which should be conserved, restored or protected on account of its national interest 
or archaeological, historic, artistic, architectural, scientific or traditional interest. Once a

</p>
<p>place, building or object has been declared a Protected National Heritage, it is a criminal 
offence to tamper with it.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>18. The Trust was dormant for some time; however, recognizing its importance, the 
Government appointed a new Board of Trustees in 2009 to spearhead its revitalization. The  
Policy statement and action plan 2009-20127 adopted by the Trust, lists its main objectives.  
</p><p>19. The revival of the Trust is welcome. The Special Rapporteur particularly appreciates 
the Trust&#8217;s intention to protect cultural heritage, including built heritage; promote 
archaeological research and study as one important component of history and memory; 
establish relationships with local communities and other relevant stakeholders so as to 
provide an opportunity for people to connect with their heritage and promote educational 
outreach, including through working with heritage clubs in secondary schools. She also 
stresses the importance of the Trust&#8217;s objective to document and give support to groups 
who are documenting or keeping alive cultural intangible heritage, and to seek to partner 
community groups to develop narrative on the historic and natural sites of the different 
regions of the country.8  In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, programmes are urgently needed 
on this matter.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes efforts undertaken by the Trust to widen its 
membership beyond an elite group of well-educated and/or well-off persons to encompass 
schools and grass-roots organizations. However, more efforts need to be undertaken in this 
respect. It is particularly important that efforts be made to inform people of the possibilities 
of becoming a member and the procedure to do so. On this matter, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the Trust&#8217;s plan to improve its website.9  
</p>
<p>21. Recommendations and requests by the Trust for Government action are channelled 
through the Ministry of Culture to the Cabinet, or to the Parliament, when relevant. The 
Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the Cabinet is not bound to respond to the 
recommendations submitted by the Trust, and is free to choose whether and when to act 
upon recommendations or postpone their consideration indefinitely. Moreover, it is only 
once the decision is taken by the Cabinet that the relevant recommendation of the Trust is 
made public. Therefore, the system lacks transparency as Vincentians may not be aware of 
some important recommendations made by the Trust, upon which the Government is not 
willing to take action. It therefore precludes wider participation in decision-making 
regarding cultural heritage matters. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur recommends that procedures be established to ensure that 
the Trust is systematically consulted prior to all development projects likely to impact on 
both tangible and intangible cultural heritage. For example, giving a seat to the Trust on the 
Planning Board may be one important mechanism to consider. Understanding that some 
privatized or semi-privatized islands may have their own local planning authorities, the 
Special Rapporteur also recommends that procedures be established to ensure systematic 
consultation of the Trust at the local level, regardless of ownership, in order to ensure 
cultural heritage is not adversely affected.  
</p>
<p>23. The Trust stated its intention to continue building on a shortlist of buildings under 
consideration for protected status and to send it to relevant ministries. The aim is to ensure 
that ministries register the Trust&#8217;s interests<b> </b>in the buildings and consult the Trust before

<p>taking any measures concerning these buildings.10 The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to respond positively to such requests. More generally, she draws the attention 
of the Trust and of the Government to her thematic report on the right of access to and 
enjoyment of cultural heritage (A/HRC/17/38), which she believes could be helpful in all 
the discussions mentioned in this section. 
</p>
<p><i>  The National Cultural Foundation 
</i></p>
<p>24. The National Cultural Foundation was created in 2001 by the Government, with the 
aim of establishing a statutory body that could respond more efficiently to the needs of the 
cultural sector than could the Government itself. The mandate of the Foundation is to 
stimulate and facilitate the development of dance, music, literature, drama, fine arts and 
culture generally; develop, maintain and manage theatres, libraries and other cultural 
facilities and equipment provided by the Government; organize cultural festivals; and do 
anything necessary or desirable to assist persons interested in developing cultural 
expression. 11  
</p>
<p>25. Although the Government had pledged to provide the Foundation with financial, 
administrative and technical support necessary to enable it to function as the lead institution 
in the cultural field, the Foundation has been dormant since 2010. The Special Rapporteur 
appreciates the Government&#8217;s efforts to revive the Foundation and to overcome financial 
and administrative constraints in this regard. She stresses again the importance of such a 
body for local artists and people involved in the promotion and safeguarding of the 
intangible cultural heritage of the country. She suggests that the terms of reference of the 
Foundation be developed following the arm&#8217;s length principle, where independent experts, 
in particular peers, are mandated for a limited time period to allocate funds and grants. This 
would provide greater guarantees for the respect of the right to freedom of artistic 
expression.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International framework  
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines has ratified the main United Nations instruments relevant to the implementation 
of cultural rights, with no reservation, as well as a number of relevant United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conventions. She is 
surprised, however, that the country has not ratified the Inter-American Convention on 
Human Rights and its Protocol on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; during her visit, 
the Special Rapporteur was not able to clarify the reasons for this situation. 
</p>
<p>27. Noting that the country has never accepted any facultative individual complaint 
procedure attached to United Nations human rights instruments, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government, as a first step, to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur understands the difficulties encountered by Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines in reporting to treaty bodies, due to a lack of financial and human 
resources. However, she is pleased to learn about efforts undertaken to enter into dialogue 
with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Noting that Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines has never submitted its initial report to the Committee on

</p>
<p><b> IV. Realizing cultural rights in Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines: good practices and challenges 
</b>29. Efforts by the Government to ensure  better recognition of the country&#8217;s diverse 
cultural heritage have included general support to the work undertaken by various 
organizations, such as the Garifuna Heritage Foundation. Concrete steps have been adopted 
to this end, including proclaiming as a national hero, in 2002, the Paramount Chief of the 
indigenous peoples, Joseph Chatoyer. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the Garifuna 
retrieval programme which was launched in 2002 by the Government, with the support of 
UNESCO and Belize. 
</p>
<p>30. The Government has also been supportive of the work of the Indian Heritage 
Foundation, a non-profit organization set up in 2006 with the task, among others, of raising 
awareness about the history and culture of East Indians in the country, the first of whom 
arrived in the mid-19th century following the abolition of slavery. In 2007, the Parliament 
officially recognized 1 June as Indian Arrival Day, and 7 October as Indian Heritage Day. 
A section on Indian history has also been introduced in textbooks. 
</p>
<p>31. Several booklets have been published on a variety of Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadine&#8217;s cultural heritage, such as traditional songs, customs and traditions, festivals. 
Although there have been difficulties in terms of their dissemination due to financial 
constraints, copies may be found in libraries. The establishment of a national calendar of 
cultural events has enabled promotion of said events.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the official recognition of the Rastafarian 
religion. Over the years, Rastafarian organizations have been increasingly involved in 
matters relating to history and cultural heritage, with a view to raising awareness about 
Africa, African descent and heritage. According to information received during the visit, 
today, Rastafarians confront a lesser degree of discrimination in their daily life. While the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes this positive development, she encourages the Government to 
further address the concerns raised by Rastafarians regarding the pursuit of their cultural 
and religious life without hindrance and stigmatization, including when it comes to the 
consumption of cannabis for religious purposes. The Special Rapporteur also encourages 
the Government to enact clear directives for prisons so as to ensure that Rastafarians held in 
prison will not have their dreadlocks cut.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to choose and express one&#8217;s identities: history, memory and self-
identification  
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the public desire for and commitment to 
retrieving and reviving parts of their cultural heritage, including history. This also leads to 
discussion regarding how individuals and groups identify themselves.  
</p>
<p>34. The efforts of Vincentians to research and write their nation&#8217;s history following 
independence in 1979 have met with many difficulties. One of the major challenges is that 
the archives of the colonizers constitute the main sources of information, which poses 
difficulties in terms of both access and content. In terms of access, archives are located 
primarily in England, with some in France, precluding access for most researchers. In terms 
of content, since the documents were prepared by the colonizers, they are necessarily biased </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>and hostile with regard to the colonized populations. It is only recently that Vincentians 
have started to gain access to alternative sources to retrieve their own history. 
</p>
<p>35. Research indicates that the Callinagos (or Kalinagos), later called the &#8220;Caribs&#8221; or 
&#8220;Yellow or Red Caribs&#8221; by the colonizers, constitute a third wave of Amerindians that 
settled in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines about AD 1200. They have left an important 
archaeological heritage by way of petroglyphs that have been found in various parts of the 
country. The meaning of the petroglyphs is still being researched. 
</p>
<p>36. Research also indicates that &#8220;by the first quarter of the 18th century, there was a 
relatively large number of persons of African descent, living on the island of Saint Vincent, 
who were not slaves&#8221;.12 These people would have arrived on the islands as a result of 
various events, including shipwrecks of slaving vessels off the coast of Saint Vincent and 
the Grenadines, the escape of slaves from Barbados, and possibly the visit by African 
traders to the West Indies before the Europeans. 
</p>
<p>37. It was stressed that before colonial conquest, Callinagos and African populations 
intermingled and married, resulting in a third group, referred to as the Garifuna.13 They 
were identified as &#8220;Black Caribs&#8221; by the European settlers and described as 
indistinguishable from the Callinagos &#8220;in terms of dress, diet, language and lifestyle &#8211; 
everything, in fact, except pigmentation and similar racial characteristics.&#8221; 14 However, 
there were also conflicts between the two groups.  
</p>
<p>38. The Garifuna story is described as unique, and &#8220;Garifuna people take pride in their 
past as a free people living for generations according to their own customs on Saint 
Vincent. Their language, passed down from the Amerindian side of their heritage, bears 
living witness to their radically different history&#8221;.15 Many of the interlocutors the Special 
Rapporteur met underlined that resistance by the Garifuna prevented early colonization of 
the island and delayed the introduction of slavery, which lasted about 50 years and ended 
between 1834 and 1838.  
</p>
<p>39. The Garifuna lost the war against the British at the end of the 18th century. Many 
were killed and the remaining Garifuna population, estimated at between 4,338 and 5,080 
men, women and children, was deported in 1796, first to Balliceaux, a small barren island 
off the coast of Saint Vincent and eight months later, in 1797, they were deported to 
Roat&#225;n, an island off the coast of Honduras. However, only about half of the deportees 
reached Roat&#225;n, as many had either died on Balliceaux, as a result of hunger, thirst and 
illness, or did not survive the journey. The year 1797 &#8211; referred to as the year of banishment 
&#8211; and its dramatic consequences is still present in the memory of the Garifuna people. 
Those who stayed on Saint Vincent were prohibited from retaining their culture, which was 
then completely lost.16 
</p>
<p>40. People identifying as Garifuna in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines today stated that 
during their youth, references to &#8220;Black Caribs&#8221; were still very pejorative, and that 
references to &#8220;Garifuna&#8221; started being used only in the 1990s. Garifuna identity is being 
revived, due in particular to the development of contacts with Garifuna populations settled

<p>in Honduras and Belize, who are descendants of the Garifuna who had been deported to 
Roat&#225;n, and who continued their traditions and maintained their culture. According to 
interlocutors, it was only in the relatively recent past that Vincentians discovered that about 
half of the Garifuna initially deported to Balliceaux had actually survived and continued 
their culture in other countries. 
</p>
<p>41. Today, some people in Saint Vincent refer themselves as Callinagos and refuse to be 
identified as Garifuna, stressing in particular the lighter colour of their skin and the place 
where they live, as well as, to a lesser extent, cultural specificities related to food and 
farming methods. Others refer to themselves as Garifuna, stressing that Garifuna 
encompasses the Callinago heritage mixed with African roots. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur appreciates that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines census is 
based on the principle of self-identification, through a questionnaire that includes questions 
on ethnicity. Efforts have been made at the Caribbean regional level to standardize the 
questionnaire, while leaving the possibility for countries to deviate from it and adapt the 
questions to their own specificity. 
</p>
<p>43. However, the option to identify as Garifuna is not available in the questionnaire, 
which contains entries such as &#8220;African/Black/Negro&#8221; and &#8220;Indigenous people 
(Amerindian/Caribs)&#8221;; although the Special Rapporteur notes that there is a box 
&#8220;Other/Specify&#8221;, where people could declare themselves as Garifuna or Callinago. In the 
last census, only 0.09 per cent of the population declared themselves as &#8220;Other&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur did not receive clear information on how the information 
compiled through this &#8220;Other&#8221; box is treated. Some officials stressed that efforts are made 
to minimize this category, with the enumerator categorizing people in boxes where he or 
she believes they belong. However, other officials denied the existence of such a practice. 
The Special Rapporteur recommends that this be clarified and that clear guidelines for 
enumerators be published in this respect. She also suggests that information collected under 
&#8220;Other&#8221; be taken into account, so as to assess whether there is need to reformulate the 
questions in the questionnaire.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur understands that the situation is very complex, in particular 
when population groups are in the process of retrieving culture(s) that have been lost or 
neglected. She stresses that population censuses may also be used to draw up, not a &#8220;racial&#8221; 
profile of the population, but a cultural profile, based on how people identify themselves in 
terms of cultural identity, cultural practices and common history. More generally, the 
Government may develop, in collaboration with relevant communities, indicators of 
cultural diversity which could be useful in terms of recognition, as well as for the planning 
institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to access cultural heritage, including one&#8217;s own history 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Researching, writing and teaching history  
</b></p>
<p>46. There seems to be a strong demand among Vincentians, and in particular the 
Garifuna and the Callinago people, to research and access their own history; however, they 
tend to encounter many obstacles.  
</p>
<p>47. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with local historians, teachers and other 
people interested in researching history, who stressed the lack of means. Lack of 
information and difficult access to archives that are located abroad were cited as important 
obstacles. The International Garifuna Research Centre make available all information that it 
is able to collect, but also has very limited resources.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>48. A main concern is that textbooks, which are developed at the Caribbean (regional) 
level, continue to have a European perspective, although significant achievements have 
been made since the 1970s in this respect. It is also of concern that textbooks do not 
sufficiently reflect the specific history of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and contain 
very little information on the Garifuna and Callinago peoples. The Special Rapporteur notes 
that the Government is positive about introducing the book <i>People on the Move, The Effects 
of Some Important Historical Events on the People of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</i>, by 
Vincentian historian, Edgar Adams, in secondary schools where it is already circulated. 
Rastafarian organizations also have raised their concerns in relation to the content of the 
school curriculum, which they find do not give sufficient space to the history of Africa.  
</p>
<p>49. Another concern is the extremely difficult task of motivating students to learn about 
Vincentian history when it is not a priority for the formal education system and when the 
examination, which is also set at the Caribbean (regional) level, does not include questions 
on such matters. Indeed, the Caribbean Examination Council for secondary level has 
limited space for local histories.  
</p>
<p>50. While it is impractical to develop textbooks or examinations exclusively for Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines, it is important to find ways to integrate local histories and 
literature into the school curriculum, including through the use of information and 
communication technologies. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts made 
by teachers to provide students with another version of history.   
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur particularly appreciates the establishment of heritage clubs 
in schools, which were started around 1997 at the initiative of teachers alarmed by students&#8217; 
poor knowledge of students of their local history and environment. Heritage clubs have 
multiplied since then, but the general feeling is that this is still insufficient, despite general 
support from the Government. Teachers experience their efforts as a personal struggle, and 
the number of students in history classes remains small. The Special Rapporteur had the 
pleasure to meet with the Executive Committee of one such club in Boys Grammar School 
in Kingstown, who explained their interest for history and cultural heritage, and their 
feeling that they did not know enough. 
</p>
<p>52. Schools can also become members of the National Trust and those having a heritage 
club generally avail themselves of that possibility. The Trust may accompany students on 
expeditions, on demand, but mostly this activity is conducted on an ad hoc basis. The 
relationship between schools and the Trust is unclear at the moment and would need to be 
properly organized.  
</p>
<p>53. Schools also develop extracurricular activities that enable students to have access to 
the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines heritage, through poetry, drama, song, dance or music 
(drums and steel pans). The Special Rapporteur learned that Sandy Bay Secondary School 
benefited during one year from the visit of a teacher from Belize, supported by UNESCO, 
who taught the Garifuna language. Regrettably, despite its success, the project could not be 
continued due to financial constraints and possibly also lack of follow-up by or 
discouragement on the part of the school itself. The Special Rapporteur was impressed that 
students she met remembered phrases in Garifuna from their lessons of the previous year, 
despite having virtually no opportunity to practice the language; the students were 
especially keen about artistic expression through traditional drums and dances.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur notes that efforts have also been made to disseminate 
knowledge about Vincentian history through lectures and diverse gatherings or radio 
shows, often with the support of the Government and the private sector. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Balliceaux  
</b></p>
<p>55. The island of Balliceaux (mentioned above) has become a place of pilgrimage. In 
the Yurumei Declaration, adopted at the First International Garifuna Conference, 
participants recommended that the island of Balliceaux be preserved and protected as a 
sacred heritage site for the use of future generations.17  
</p>
<p>56. According to information gathered during the visit, Balliceaux is a privately owned 
island, and development plans have been envisaged for it. Noting that any development 
plans has to be approved by the Government, the Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to consider the importance of Balliceaux island for the Garifuna people and to 
ensure that their relation to this island, as a site of remembrance, is respected and 
maintained. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Public beaches 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8217;s statement that all beaches in 
the country are public, including those on private islands; meaning that public access to 
beaches are always safeguarded. The Special Rapporteur recommends, however, that 
specific legislation be passed making it obligatory for all private proprietors to provide a 
thoroughfare for public access to beaches. She further recommends that the Government 
pay particular attention to beaches that are accessible to the public by boat only, as this may 
constitute a clear impediment to access in practice.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Support to artistic creativity and access to the arts and cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>58. There are numerous challenges in identifying, protecting and safeguarding the 
cultural heritage of all groups in the country, as well as ensuring that heritage remains part 
of a vibrant cultural life in a globalizing world. In this respect, interlocutors shared their 
concern about what they see as Americanization and Jamaicanization of their culture. 
</p>
<p>59. As in many countries, artists have a hard time making a livelihood out of their art, 
and face a paucity of spaces to meet, perform and practice. The Special Rapporteur notes 
that several projects are under discussion, in particular the Alba House, a training and 
development space for culture, which would also host civil society organizations working 
in the field of culture and cultural rights. In addition, the Government&#8217;s plan to establish a 
multi-functional cultural centre in Kingstown, which would host exhibitions and enable 
artists to perform and practice, is welcome. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to pursue its efforts in that direction. She further calls on the Government to 
support the development of such venues in the communities themselves. It is also important 
to ensure that meaningful consultations are conducted with the communities concerned as 
well as artists, so that centres meet expectations and are suited for cultural and artistic 
activities. Rastafarian organizations also have expressed their need for a space that could 
serve as a cultural institution. 
</p>
<p>60. According to information received, artisans encounter difficulties in their daily 
work, as they too need spaces to exhibit and sell their crafts. It is alleged that artisans in 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are in a very unstable and insecure situation, and do not 
get sufficient support from the Government. While vending on the street is illegal in 
Kingstown, it is alleged that the Town Board illegally charges artisans 5 East Caribbean 
dollars (approximately US$1.85) per day for the place they use in the street to sell their

<p>products, and that they remain at the mercy of the police who can decide to chase them off 
the street at any time.  
</p>
<p>61. Numerous festivals and cultural events rooted in tradition and history take place 
throughout the year, with support from the Government, the private sector or both. 
However, there is need to ensure that all the different islands and groups have equal 
opportunities to host and participate in events. Support from the private sector for the arts 
as well as for cultural activities should be encouraged, taking into consideration also the 
need to protect the freedom and autonomy of artists.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes in particular that small groups, such as the Maroons 
on Union Island, who have a distinct cultural identity and strive to maintain their particular 
traditions, including traditional dance and big drums, do not seem to receive sufficient 
attention and support. The Maroons seek opportunities to research and claim their cultural 
identity and pass cultural heritage to younger generations. Particular mention was made of 
the Maroon festival, which needs greater support. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts and steps taken by the 
Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, despite financial and human 
resources constraints, to ensure better recognition of cultural diversity in the country 
and protection of tangible and intangible cultural heritage. She also welcomes the 
support provided by the Government to various groups in their objective to protect 
and safeguard their cultural heritage and their quest for history.  
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> More needs to be done, however, and the Special Rapporteur wishes to make 
the following recommendations to the Government:  
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Ensure, when conducting wide consultations for drafting its cultural 
policy, that stakeholders are informed sufficiently in advance with proper 
documentation; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Ensure coherence between cultural and tourism policies, through 
specific procedures or mechanisms, and in particular adequate consultation of the 
National Trust; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Require cultural impact assessments prior to major private or public 
development projects; 
</b></p>
<p>(d)<b> Strengthen support to heritage clubs in schools, and find and support 
ways to integrate local histories and literature into the school curriculum, including 
through the use of information and communication technologies; 
</b></p>
<p>(e)<b> Support the dissemination of alternative history textbooks and the 
organization of extracurricular activities on Vincentian history in schools;  
</b></p>
<p>(f)<b> Address the issue at the Caribbean (regional) level on how local histories 
can be better reflected and incorporated in textbooks as well as examinations;  
</b></p>
<p>(g)<b> Address the issue of access to relevant archives located in countries such 
as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and France. This could 
include seeking support, including from these countries, for Vincentian historians to 
conduct their research abroad, for example through scholarships, and to have 
facilitated access thanks to the digitalization of archives;  </b></p>
