2. 
EVE  Investments  is  an  Australian  Securities  Exchange  Listed  Investment  Company  that  invests  in  technology  companies.  With  a 
preference for companies that have global scale, EVE is an investment partner that wants to help build ground breaking and enduring 
technology.  At  the  Company’s  AGM  shareholders  voted  to  change  the  Company’s  name  from  Energy  Ventures  Limited,  to  EVE 
Investments. This was another change in the Company’s refocussing from investments in mineral exploration to technology investment.
Review of Operations
First medical technology investment
EVE announced its first medical technology investment during the year, entering into a binding agreement to acquire a ~40% stake in 
Omniblend Innovation Pty Ltd for a consideration amount of $3.25 million, with a staged payment across two equal tranches. Through 
the agreement,  EVE has secured the right to publicly list Omniblend  within two years, providing EVE shareholders with preferential 
entitlement to participate in the listing.
Omniblend  Innovation’s  flagship  product  is  a  patented  food-grade  pre-meal  drink  called  GlucoControl,  which  helps  to  manage 
type 2 diabetes  and  pre-diabetes.  The  drink  has  been  clinically  shown  to  reduce  blood  glucose  level  peaks  by  35  per  cent  after 
carbohydrate  containing  meals.  Globally,  the  type  2  market  is  worth  US$60  billion,  with  over  387  million  people  living  with  type  2 
diabetes. With a marketing and distribution agreement already in place for Australia and New Zealand, GlucoControl is currently being 
rolled out across pharmacies. A representation deal has also been entered into with Global Brand Consulting LLC to seek distribution 
agreements for Omniblend Innovation in other territories under the trademark GlucoSmooth.
Corporate Review
During the year the Company completed two placements at $0.005 per share to raise approximately AU$883,000 before costs. After 
completing  due  diligence  on  Omniblend  Innovation  to  the  Company’s  satisfaction,  the  Company  conducted  a  Non-Renounceable 
Entitlement Issue raising AU$1.85 million at the same pricing as the placements.

3. 
This Remuneration Report outlines the remuneration arrangements which were in place during the year, and remain in place as at the 
date of this report, for the key management personnel of EVE Investments Limited. During the period the Company’s Directors were the 
only key management personnel of EVE Investments Limited.
Remuneration Report – Audited
The information provided in this remuneration report has been audited as required by section 308(3C) of the Corporations Act 2001.
Principles of compensation
The objective of the Group’s executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is competitive and appropriate for the 
results  delivered.  The  framework  aligns  executive  reward  with  achievement  of  strategic  objectives  and  the  creation  of  value  for 
shareholders, and conforms with market practice for delivery of reward. The Board ensures that executive reward satisfies the following 
key criteria for good reward governance practices:
 
 
 
 

competitiveness and reasonableness;
acceptability to shareholders;
performance linkage / alignment of executive compensation;
transparency; and
capital management.
The Group has structured an executive remuneration framework that is market competitive and complementary to the reward strategy 
of the organisation.
Alignment to shareholders’ interests:
 


has economic profit as a core component of plan design;
focuses on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering constant 
return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and
attracts and retains high calibre executives.
Alignment to program participants’ interests:
 
 
 

rewards capability and experience;
reflects competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth;
provides a clear structure for earning rewards; and
provides recognition for contribution.
The framework provides a mix of fixed and variable pay, and a blend of short and long-term incentives. As executives gain seniority with 
the group, the balance of this mix shifts to a higher proportion of ''at risk'' rewards. Currently no remuneration consultants are used by 
the Company in formulating remuneration policies.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board. It is primarily responsible for making recommendations to the Board on:
 
 
 

Non-Executive Director Fees;
Remuneration levels of Executive Directors and other key management personnel;
The over-arching executive remuneration framework and operation of the incentive plan; and
Key performance indicators and performance hurdles for the executive team.
Their objective is to ensure that remuneration policies and structures are fair and competitive and aligned with the long-term interests 
of the Company.

benefits at the executive’s discretion.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Reporting entity
1. 
EVE Investments Limited (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in Australia. The consolidated financial report of the Company for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2016 comprises the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
The consolidated financial report was authorised for issue by the Directors on 31 August 2016. 
2.  Basis of preparation 
a)  Statement of compliance 
These  general  purpose  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  (‘AASBs’) 
(including Australian Interpretations) adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (‘AASB’) and the Corporations Act 2001. 
The financial report of the Consolidated Entity also complies with IFRSs and interpretations as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board. EVE Investments Ltd is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.
Separate financial statements for EVE Investments Limited, as an individual entity, are no longer presented as a consequence of a change 
to the Corporations Act 2001. Financial information for EVE Investments Limited as an individual entity is included in note 25.
b)  New and amended standards adopted by the Group 
None of the new standards and amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 
2015 affected any of the amounts recognised in the current period or any prior period.
c)  Basis of measurement 
The financial report is prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair value through the 
profit or loss.
d)  Functional and presentation currency 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which is also the functional currency.  The Group previously 
presented the consolidated financial statements in US dollars and the comparative figures have been represented in Australian dollars.
e)  Going concern 
For the year ended 30 June 2016 the entity recorded a loss from continuing operations of $1,008,006 and had net cash outflows from 
operating activities of $645,763 and had working capital of $196,334. Furthermore, the entity has commitments of $1.6 million pertaining 
to the Tranche 2 investment in Omniblend Innovation Pty Ltd to increase the entity’s stake to approximately 40% (see notes 4 and 20). 
The ability of the entity to continue as a going concern and being able to continue to funds its operating and marketing activities is 
dependent on securing additional funding through a share placement to new or existing investors, or by raising equity by conducting an 
entitlement issue with existing shareholders.
These conditions indicate a material uncertainty that may cast a significant doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern 
and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Management  believe  there  are  sufficient  funds  to  meet  the  entity’s  working  capital  requirements  and  as  at  the  date  of  this  report. 
Subsequent to year end the entity expects to raise additional funds via either a placement to new or existing investors or by conducting 
an entitlement issue with existing shareholders.
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the entity is a going concern, which contemplates the continuity of normal 
business activity, realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business for the following reasons:


The directors have prepared cash flow projections that support the ability of the entity to continue as a going concern, subject 
to raising additional funds through equity as detailed above; and
The entity also has the ability to reduce its expenditure to conserve cash.
Should the company not be able to continue as a going concern, it may be required to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities other 
than in the ordinary course of business, and at amounts that differ from those stated in the financial statements and that the financial 
report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or liabilities that 
might be necessary should the entity not continue as a going concern.
f)  Use of estimates and judgments 
The preparation of a financial report in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires management to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The  estimates  and  associated  assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  various  other  factors  that  are  believed  to  be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. These accounting policies 
have been consistently applied by each entity in the Consolidated Entity.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical 
judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are 
described in the following notes:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016





Note 28 – Financial assets at fair value through Profit or Loss – The Group’s accounting policy for Impairment is set out in note 
26(h). If, after having losses are taken into account under this policy, the Directors conclude that the Group is unlikely to 
recover the investment, then the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the Profit or Loss.
Note 4 – Investments in associates – When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment 
in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets by comparing its recoverable amount (fair value less costs to sell) with its 
carrying amount.
Note 7 – Convertible note – The Group considers the recoverability of convertible notes it has been issued at each balance 
date and the asset is tested for impairment in accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.
Note 14 – Exploration & evaluation expenditure – The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation is set out in 
note  26(n).  If,  after  having  capitalised  expenditure  under  this  policy,  the  Directors  conclude that  the  Group  is  unlikely  to 
recover the expenditure by future exploration or sale, then the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the Profit or 
Loss.
Note 22 – Share-based payment arrangements - The Group measures the cost of equity settled share based payments at fair 
value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes model taking into account the exercise price, the term of the instrument, the 
impact of dilution, the share price at grant date, the expected volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield 
and risk free interest rate for the term of the instrument.
3.  Discontinued operations 
At the Company’s AGM, the Company’s shareholders approved an in-specie distribution of wholly owned subsidiary, Aurora Uranium 
Limited (“Aurora”). Aurora is an Australian registered public company which, through its US subsidiary Oregon Energy LLC, holds 100% 
of the Aurora Uranium Project in southeast Oregon. EVE shareholders at the record date of 26 November 2015, were allotted 1 Aurora 
share for each EVE share held.
The financial performance of the discontinued operation to the date of disposal, which is included in loss from discontinued operations

The fair value of the performance rights granted during the year is $342,546 (2015: $21,284). The value is based off the underlying share 
price  on  the  date  of  issue  and  likelihood  of  the  performance  right  hurdle  being  met.  At  each  reporting  date  the  likelihood  of  each 
performance right hurdle is reviewed by management and the share-based payment adjusted accordingly. During the period $66,355 of 
expense was recorded. In the prior year an expense of $21,284 was recorded. This value was based off the underlying share price on the 
date of issue and likelihood of the performance right hurdle being met. These 6,000,000 rights were issued to a consultant and vested 
upon issue of a metallurgical report to the Company’s satisfaction.

There were no commitments, contingent liabilities or contingent assets at the parent level at 30 June 2016.  
26.  Significant accounting policies 
a)  Basis of consolidation
i.  Subsidiaries
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  all  controlled  entities  of  EVE  Investments  Limited 
(“Company” or “Parent Company”) as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all controlled entities for the year then ended. EVE Investments 
Limited and its controlled entities together are referred to in this financial statement as the Group or the Consolidated Entity.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
ii.  Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
iii.  Associates (equity accounted investees)
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a 
shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for in the parent entity financial 
statements using the cost method and in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, after initially 
being recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of any accumulated impairments loss) identified 
on the acquisition.
The Group’s share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against 
the carrying amount of the investment, thereafter gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the associate.
b)  Discontinued operations 
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
 
 

represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
The profit or loss from discontinued operations, including prior year components of profit or loss, are presented in a single amount in 
the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. This amount, which comprises the after tax profit or loss of discontinued 
operations and the after tax gain or loss is further disclosed in note 3.
EVE INVESTMENTS LIMITED | Page 31
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
The disclosures for discontinued operations in the prior year relate to all operations that have been discontinued by the reporting date 
for the latest period presented.
Segment reporting
c) 
AASB 8 Operating Segments requires a ‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as 
that used for internal reporting purposes. The segments are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision maker.
d)
Foreign currency translation 
i.
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in AUD dollars. 
The  Directors  resolved  to  change  the  presentation  currency  and  present  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  AUD  dollars  from 
1 July 2015. The presentation in AUD dollars is consistent with internal management reporting. The change in presentational currency 
was applied retrospectively and the comparative represented.
ii.  Transactions and balances
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  dates  of  the 
transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at 
the foreign exchange ruling at that date. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income.
iii.  Group Companies
The functional currency of the Company is Australian dollars and foreign operations in the Group had a functional currency of US Dollars.
The  financial  results  and  position  of  operations  with  a  functional  currency  different  from  the  Group’s  presentation  currency  are 
translated as follows:
 

Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date; and
Income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group’s foreign currency translation 
reserve  in  the  Statement  of  Financial  Position.  These  differences  are  recognised  in  the  Statement  of  Profit  or  Loss  and  Other 
Comprehensive Income in the period the operation is disposed.
Exchange differences arising within the foreign currency translation reserve from the translation of foreign operations of entities which 
were discontinued by way of in-specie distribution during the year have been recognised against retained earnings as the transfer of 
entities was to members in whom there was common control.
In-specie distribution
e) 
The share capital of the Company is reduced by the fair value of the Investment that was returned to shareholders.
Revenue recognition
f) 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria 
must also be met before revenue is recognised:

Interest – Control of the right to receive the interest payment must exist.
Income tax
g) 
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable 
income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and 
to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting 
period  in  the  countries  where  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  and  associates  operate  and  generate  taxable  income.  Management 
periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax  regulation  is  subject  to 
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if 
it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted
EVE INVESTMENTS LIMITED | Page 32
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable 
amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  are  not  recognised  for  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amount  and  tax  bases  of 
investments in controlled entities where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it 
is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when 
the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset when the entity has a 
legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a new basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Impairment of assets
h) 
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  assesses  whether  there  is  any  indication  that  an  asset  may  be  impaired.  Where  an  indicator  of 
impairment  exists,  the  Group  makes  a  formal  estimate  of  recoverable  amount.  Where  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  exceeds  its 
recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the greater 
of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. It is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset's value in use cannot be estimated 
to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and it does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets 
or groups of assets, in which case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Contributed equity
i) 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options for the acquisition of a business are not included 
in the cost of the acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
If the entity reacquires its own equity instruments, e.g. as a result of a share buy-back, those instruments are deducted from equity and 
the associated shares are cancelled. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss and the consideration paid including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is recognised directly in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
j) 
Cash on hand and in banks and short-term deposits are stated at nominal value.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash includes cash on hand and in banks, and money market investments readily 
convertible to cash within two working days, net of any outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables
k) 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.
Financial assets
l) 
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at cost, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines 
the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date.
i.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of selling the receivable. They are 
included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date which are classified as non-
current assets. Loans and receivables are included in receivables in the Statement of Financial Position. Convertible note receivables are 
carried at amortised cost.
ii.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in the category if it is 
held principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Assets in the category are classified as current assets.
iii.
Impairment
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective 
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that
EVE INVESTMENTS LIMITED | Page 33
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be 
reliably estimated.
iv.  Subsequent measurement
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Details on how the fair value of financial instruments is determined are disclosed in note 28.
m)  Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
With the exception of mining property and development assets, depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a diminishing value basis over 
the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives in the current and comparative periods are as follows:

Plant and equipment
3-10 years
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in profit or loss. When 
revalued assets are sold, it is group policy to transfer any amounts included in other reserves in respect of those assets to retained 
earnings.
Exploration and evaluation costs
n) 
Exploration and evaluation costs, including the costs of acquiring licences, are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets on an 
area of interest basis. Costs incurred before the entities of the Group have obtained the legal rights to explore an area are recognised in 
the profit or loss.
Exploration and evaluation assets are only recognised if the rights of the area of interest are current and either:
i. 
ii.
the expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest; or
activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date, reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the 
existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area 
of interest are continuing.
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  if  (i)  sufficient  data  exists  to  determine  technical  feasibility  and 
commercial viability, and (ii) facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (see impairment 
accounting policy (h)). For the purposes of impairment testing, exploration and evaluation assets are allocated to cash-generating units 
to which the exploration activity relates. The cash generating unit shall not be larger than the area of interest.
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable, 
exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified from intangible 
assets to mining property and development assets within property, plant and equipment.
Costs of site restoration are provided over the life of the facility from when exploration commences and are included in the costs of that 
stage. Site restoration costs include the dismantling and removal of mining plant, equipment and building structures, waste removal, 
and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with clauses of the mining permits. Such costs have been determined using estimates of 
future costs, current legal requirements and technology on an undiscounted basis.
Any changes in the estimates for the costs are accounted for on a prospective basis. In determining the costs of site restoration, there is 
uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of the restoration due to community expectations and future legislation. Accordingly, the 
costs have been determined on the basis that the restoration will be completed within one year of abandoning the site.
Trade and other payables
o) 
Liabilities for trade creditors and other amounts are carried at cost which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in the future for 
goods and services received, whether or not billed to the Group. The amounts are unsecured and are usually payable within 30 days of 
recognition.
p)  Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
Employee benefits
q) 
Provision is made for the Group’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to reporting date. Employee 
benefits have been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs.
Provisions
r) 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal, equitable or constructive obligation to make a future sacrifice of economic benefits 
to other entities as a result of past transactions or other past events, it is probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be 
required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
EVE INVESTMENTS LIMITED | Page 34
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
s)
Earnings per share 
i.  Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing 
equity other than ordinary shares, by weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for 
the bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.
ii.  Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income 
tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of 
shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Share-based payments
t) 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Consolidated Entity’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair 
value determined at each reporting date.
u)  Goods and services tax 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
where the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is 
recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and receivables and payables are 
stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Statement of Financial Position.
Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows arising from investing and 
financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.
Comparative figures
v) 
When required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current 
financial year.
w)  New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been recently issued or amended but are not yet effective have not been 
adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2016.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments 
AASB 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules 
for hedge accounting. AASB 9 must be applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard is not expected 
to have a material impact on the Group.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
AASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace AASB 118 which covers contracts for goods and services 
and AASB 111 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control 
of a good or service transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards. The standard is 
not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
AASB 16 Leases  
AASB 16 eliminates the operating and finance lease classifications for lessees currently accounted for under AASB 117 Leases. It instead 
requires an entity to bring most leases onto its statement of financial position in a similar way to how existing finance leases are treated 
under AASB 117. An entity will be required to recognise a lease liability and a right of use asset in its statement of financial position for 
most leases. There are some optional exemptions for leases with a period of 12 months or less and for low value leases. The application 
date of this standard is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The standard is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group. 
27.  Financial risk management 
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses different methods to measure different 
types of risk to which it is exposed.
EVE INVESTMENTS LIMITED | Page 35
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units.
a)  Market risk
i.
Foreign currency risk
The  Group  previously  operated  internationally  and  had  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various  currency  exposures, 
primarily with respect to the United states dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised 
assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis 
(see table below) and cash flow forecasting.
The Group’s risk management policy is to form a natural hedge to foreign exchange fluctuations by holding funds in the currency the 
costs are forecast to be expended in. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period was has been 
assessed and there is no material impact to the Group.
ii.  Price risk
The Group is exposed to share price movements on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Group sensitivity to movement in 
the share prices of listed investments is shown in the summarised sensitivity analysis table below. The sensitivity is based on movements 
in the ASX Small Ordinaries Index (XSO).

b)  Credit risk 
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets, trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments), represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
Cash and short term liquid investment are placed with reputable banks, so no significant credit risk is expected.
The Group does not have any material exposure to any single debtor or group of debtors, so no significant credit risk is expected.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit rates:

Liquidity risk
c) 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an 
adequate  amount  of  committed  credit  facilities  and  the  ability  to  close  out  market  positions.  The  Group  manages  liquidity  risk  by 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Due to the 
dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims at maintaining flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines 
available with a variety of counterparties. Surplus funds are only invested in instruments that are tradeable in highly liquid markets.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings. The amounts disclosed in the table are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying amounts as the impact of discounting is not 
significant.

Fair value estimation
d) 
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current closing price.
Total gains or losses for the period included in revenue from continuing operations that related to assets held at the end of the reporting 
period are set out below:

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses 
a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their 
short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash 
flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Refer to note 28(c) for details of the Consolidated Entity’s assets measured and recognised at fair value as at 30 June 2016. 
28.  Determination of fair values 
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial 
assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. 
Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that 
asset or liability.
Trade and other receivables
a) 
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the reporting date.
b)  Share-based payment transactions 
The fair value of employee share options and performance rights is measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Measurement inputs 
include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic 
volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based 
on  historical  experience  and  general  option/right  holder  behaviour),  expected  dividends,  and  the  risk-free  interest  rate  (based  on 
government  bonds).  Service  and  non-market  performance  conditions  attached  to  the  transactions  are  not  taken  into  account  in 
determining fair value.
