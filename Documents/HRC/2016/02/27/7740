</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>Plurinational State of Bolivia and the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in the country during 2013. 
</p>
<p> The Bolivian economy performed positively during 2013. Levels of poverty and 
extreme poverty were reduced. The country surpassed the Millennium Development Goal 
on the right to safe drinking water two years before the deadline, and the school dropout 
rate at the primary level continued to decrease. 
</p>
<p> The country continued to develop measures to combat persisting racism and all 
forms of discrimination. The principles of non-discrimination were included in the 
communications programmes of public entities. The comprehensive implementation of the 
Policy of the Plurinational State of Bolivia against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination 
(Plan of Action 2012&#8211;2015) and the allocation of more resources to that end are, however, 
pending.

</p>
<p>Protecting the rights of indigenous peoples continues to present a challenge. The 
elaboration of a consensus draft legal framework on the right to consultation in conformity 
with international standards is noteworthy. Nevertheless, the lack of consultation on mining 
is a cause for concern. 
</p>
<p>Comprehensive Law No. 348 on Guaranteeing Women a Life Free from Violence 
was promulgated. It represents an important step towards the elimination of gender 
violence, which is on the increase. Given the situation, urgent implementation of the law is 
indispensable. The judicial branch (&#211;rgano Judicial), the School for Judges and the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office developed an accelerated training process for judges and prosecutors on 
the law&#8217;s application. 
</p>
<p>Many measures were taken to respond to the profound crisis in the administration of 
justice, including the analysis of structural problems with a view to improving access to 
justice, judicial independence and transparency, and institutional management. Delays, 
corruption, impunity and lack of resources in the judicial system persist. The office 
continues to monitor emblematic criminal proceedings, where progress is slow. 
</p>
<p>The reduction in complaints concerning the excessive use by the police of force in 
the context of social conflicts deserves mention. In the police and the military, cases of 
abuse by officials against subordinates during training exercises were registered, some 
serious enough to affect the right to life. Regarding the prison system, critical 
overcrowding in prisons and the excessive use of pretrial detention continue. 
</p>
<p>The present report describes activities conducted by the office and includes 12 
recommendations formulated by the High Commissioner to contribute to the improvement 
of the human rights situation in the Plurinational State of Bolivia.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In February 2007, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights signed an agreement with the Government of Bolivia to establish a country office 
with a mandate to monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country and to 
provide technical assistance to State institutions and civil society organizations. The 
agreement was approved by Congress on 13 July 2007 and renewed for a second time, in 
August 2013, until 21 August 2015.  
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 22 January 2013, during the presentation of his performance report to the 
Plurinational Legislative Assembly, the President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Evo 
Morales Ayma, introduced the 13 fundamental pillars of the Patriotic Agenda 2025,1 which 
focus primarily on the eradication of extreme poverty, the provision of basic public 
services, food security, sovereignty and equality. The Agenda was the subject of a 
consultation process throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>3. In April, the Plurinational Constitutional Court ruled on the constitutionality of the 
draft of Implementing Law No. 381, finding the participation of President Morales and the 
Vice-President, &#193;lvaro Garc&#237;a Linera, in the next elections to be constitutional, given that 
re-election would represent the second mandate since the adoption of the 2009 Constitution. 
The ruling was criticized by the political opposition, who considered that the President and 
Vice-President would thus be allowed a third consecutive mandate.  
</p>
<p>4. In July, the results of the 2012 National Population and Housing Census were 
published. Discrepancies between those results and the preliminary results made public in 
January 2013 caused controversy and protests. The final results reveal a very low rate of 
increase in the population of some departments and major cities, and indicate that the 
percentage of the population self-identifying as indigenous decreased from 62 to 41 per 
cent.2 At the request of the Government, a delegation of the Latin American and Caribbean 
Demographic Centre, an autonomous branch of the Economic Commission for Latin 
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), visited the Plurinational State of Bolivia in August 
to initiate a post-census evaluation.  
</p>
<p>5. The Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia transmitted a complaint to the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in relation to the denial of airspace 
by several European countries when President Morales and his delegation were returning 
from Moscow to La Paz on 2 July. The allegations of human rights violations were 
transmitted to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>6. Also in July, the Plurinational State of Bolivia presided at the first session of the 
open-ended intergovernmental working group on a United Nations declaration on the rights 
of peasants and other people working in rural areas, held in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>7. On 2 April, the Plurinational State of Bolivia acceded to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure and, on 12 July, 
</p>

<p>acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>8. During 2013, the Plurinational State of Bolivia was reviewed by three treaty bodies: 
the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families (16 and 17 April), the Committee against Torture (16 and 17 May) and the 
Human Rights Committee (14 and 16 October). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Plurinational State of Bolivia continued to develop measures to combat racism 
and other forms of discrimination. Public institutions included the principles of non-
discrimination in their communications programmes and the majority of media outlets 
stepped up their prevention campaigns. The Ministry of Education issued regulations 
prohibiting discrimination in schools, and the principles of non-discrimination are on 
display in numerous private and public locations. 
</p>
<p>10. The implementation of the Policy of the Plurinational State of Bolivia against 
Racism and All Forms of Discrimination (Plan of Action 2012&#8211;2015) registered limited 
progress, primarily because the Plan had not been formally adopted by the executive 
branch.3 The National Committee against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination, through 
its communications with the 14 ministries responsible for implementing the 17 programmes 
contained in the Plan of Action, noted that ministry officials had limited knowledge about 
the Plan and their respective responsibilities, and also noted the lack of an implementation 
strategy and corresponding institutional adjustments. In 2014, the National Committee will 
monitor the Plan&#8217;s implementation on the basis of indicators.4 
</p>
<p>11. The budget allocation for the National Committee has been insufficient for its 
institutional development and for the implementation of the Plan of Action. The National 
Committee was able to conduct only one annual session, thus failing to comply with its 
regulations, which call for a minimum of two sessions.  
</p>
<p>12. The Directorate-General for the Fight against Racism and All Forms of 
Discrimination reported that it had received 151 complaints of racism and/or 
discrimination, for the most part in urban areas and in the public service, relating to: sexual 
orientation (21); level of schooling (19); physical appearance (19); cultural identity (17); 
provenance (14); ideology (14); and age, disability or religion (25). Another 22 cases were 
dismissed. Only three were sent to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, including one involving 
violence against a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex 
community.  
</p>
<p>13. The office is concerned about the intolerance against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex community expressed by members of the Sucre Municipal Council 
during the elaboration of its Charter, namely, the members&#8217; rejection of that community and 
their failure to include specific policies of benefit to it. The Human Rights Committee 
expressed concern about impunity for acts of violence and discrimination related to sexual 
orientation and gender identity (CCPR/C/BOL/CO/3, para. 7).

</p>
<p>14. The office welcomes the establishment by the Ministry of Education of the Institute 
for Language and Culture of the Guaran&#237; People and the Institute for Language and Culture 
of Afro-Bolivian People, with the objective of developing the capacity for research and 
dissemination of information on the history and culture of those peoples, thus contributing 
to their right to cultural identity.  
</p>
<p>15. On 8 May, Law No. 370 on Migration was enacted, setting out provisions relating to 
the prevention of harassment and gender and sexual violence, as well as guarantees for the 
reunification of migrant families. Measures are still needed to prevent the dissemination in 
the mass media, including by the police, of stereotypes of foreigners suspected of 
involvement in crime. The Committee on Migrant Workers expressed its concern regarding 
the persistence of discrimination against migrants by the security forces 
(CMW/C/BOL/CO/2 and Corr.1, para. 22). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. The situation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights continues to present a challenge. One 
step forward has been the elaboration of a draft law on prior, free and informed consent and 
consultation of indigenous peoples, led by the Ministry of the Interior during an 18-month 
process consisting of three phases: elaboration, dissemination and systematization. The 
systematized proposal was approved by the majority of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations 
and is in line with international standards. With the agreement of those organizations, issues 
relating to compensation and participation in benefits were deferred to later discussions 
regarding new rules on mining and hydrocarbons. 
</p>
<p>17. The office continues to be concerned by the lack of consultation of indigenous 
peoples with regard to mining. The approaches by the Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy 
towards indigenous representatives did not generate the climate of trust required to draft a 
law to regulate consultations in that field. 
</p>
<p>18. In the area of hydrocarbons, the office monitored the implementation of the right to 
consultation in two emblematic cases: Alto Parapet&#237; and Takovo Mora. The office observed 
that relevant information was not always presented to communities in an accessible, timely 
and complete manner and in their own native language.  
</p>
<p>19. In Alto Parapet&#237;, the consultation was initiated after a private oil company had begun 
demarcating land with fencing, which had a negative impact on the affected communities. 
Additionally, through its monitoring work, the office registered some interference in the 
activity of indigenous organizations by civil servants and company staff and the 
conditioning of the provision of basic services on the signature of agreements. 
</p>
<p>20. During the consultation in Takovo Mora, the authorities annulled the initial 
agreement, thus generating a situation of reduced credibility and trust, which was later 
improved. Although the affected communities selected their representatives according to 
their customs in order to facilitate the consultation process, the Ministry did not employ the 
representatives, arguing that under the rules for public contracting, a person must have a 
high school certificate to receive remuneration from the State. This could constitute a 
violation of the rights of indigenous peoples to decide according to their own procedures, as 
set out in International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.  
</p>
<p>21. In the above-mentioned cases, the Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy was unable 
to comply fully with the right to consultation or with all its obligations to protect 
indigenous peoples from actions of third party contractors which could violate their rights. 
Nevertheless, the office recognizes the good will demonstrated and initiatives taken by the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Ministry, through its Vice-Ministry for Energy Development, to improve its performance in 
consultation processes through training and other technical cooperation efforts. 
</p>
<p>22. During 2013, initiatives to provide public services to communities in the Isiboro 
S&#233;cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS) were developed. With regard to 
the 2012 consultation concerning the proposed construction of a highway in TIPNIS, three 
reports were presented: one by the Ministry of Public Works, Services and Housing and the 
Ministry of the Environment and Water, the entities responsible for conducting the 
consultation; one by the Intercultural Service for Strengthening Democracy (SIFDE), the 
entity of the Plurinational Electoral Branch responsible for monitoring consultation 
processes; and one by non-governmental organizations, namely, the Permanent Human 
Rights Assembly of Bolivia (APDHB) and the International Federation for Human Rights 
(FIDH).  
</p><p>23. The reports by the ministries and SIFDE reveal that information relating to the 
inviolability of TIPNIS, the highway construction and measures for safeguarding and 
developing the territory was provided to the majority of communities on the very day of the 
consultation and that no social or environmental impact studies were presented. The reports 
also reveal a context of polarization and threats against those responsible for conducting the 
consultation. Additionally, some consultations lasted only a few hours and others were 
conducted at night.  
</p>
<p>24. According to SIFDE, the consultation process was conducted in 58 of the 69 
communities in TIPNIS: 15 agreed to the highway construction without conditions; 41 
agreed with conditions, including guarantees and safeguards; 2 rejected the initiative; and 
11 impeded the access of the consultation teams. 
</p>
<p>25. In their report, APDHB and FIDH detailed the concerns of 36 communities they 
visited during a two-week period, namely, the lack of agreement between the ministries and 
the TIPNIS Subcentral, one of the three representative organizations in the territory, for the 
realization of the consultation; the creation of parallel organizations in some communities 
where the consultation had been rejected and/or prevented; the organization of meetings 
outside the communities; and the delivery of assistance projects while the consultation was 
ongoing. 
</p>
<p>26. More than two years after the police intervention against participants in the Eighth 
Indigenous March to Defend the Isiboro S&#233;cure National Park and Indigenous Territory in 
Chaparina, Beni, on 21 September 2011, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has brought only 
two people into custody for investigation. The office is concerned about the slow pace of 
the judicial process.  
27. In June, violence was registered in TIPNIS, when leaders of the TIPNIS Subcentral 
prevented a meeting between community leaders (<i>corregidores</i>), accusing them of not 
respecting the territory&#8217;s rules and of supporting the governmental highway construction 
project. Gumercindo Pradel, president of the Indigenous Council of the South (CONISUR), 
affiliated with the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), was attacked. 
He accused TIPNIS Subcentral representatives of making an attempt on his life and 
considers that the ordinary justice system should punish the perpetrators. However, the 
TIPNIS Subcentral representatives consider that the incident occurred in the framework of 
the application of indigenous justice and therefore filed a conflict of jurisdiction suit before 
the Plurinational Constitutional Court, which ruled that both justice systems should suspend 
proceedings relating to the case pending determination of the applicable jurisdiction.  
28. The office welcomes the enactment, on 4 December, of Law No. 450 on the 
Protection of Highly Vulnerable Indigenous Nations and Peoples, aimed at establishing 
mechanisms and policies to prevent, protect and strengthen safeguards for the systems and 
ways of life of that population. It will be necessary for the implementing regulations and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>complementary rules to guarantee the collective rights of those peoples in an indivisible, 
comprehensive and interdependent way.  
</p>
<p>29. The office is concerned about the persistence of forced labour and servitude of 
numerous Guaran&#237; families.5 It noted a lack of follow-up to the comprehensive policies 
under the Transitional Interministerial Plan; they should have been implemented in 
accordance with a comprehensive development plan for the Guaran&#237; Peoples, which is still 
pending approval and implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>30. According to ECLAC, the economy of the Plurinational State of Bolivia performed 
positively in 2013. During the first trimester, the global index of economic activity 
registered 6 per cent growth, while the Government increased its tax collection by 19 per 
cent compared to the first trimester of 2012,6 thus permitting the continuation and extension 
of social programmes.  
</p>
<p>31. In December 2012, 78.9 per cent of the population had access to safe drinking water. 
The country exceeded the Millennium Development Goal on the right to safe drinking 
water7 two years before the deadline, thanks to the presidential programmes Mi Agua and 
Mi Agua II. In relation to the right to sanitation, it is still necessary to strengthen action to 
accelerate progress. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the right to housing, in 2013, 16,000 housing units with basic 
services were constructed; with respect to allocation, priority was given to vulnerable 
groups. Additionally, 866 housing units for victims of natural disasters related to the La 
Ni&#241;a phenomenon during the period 2010&#8211;2012 were allocated.8 
</p>
<p>33. Regarding the right to education, the Ministry of Education established the 
obligation of regular schools to enrol children with disabilities and to implement 
specialized syllabuses and methodologies for students with visual, auditory and mental 
disabilities.9 The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security incorporated 409 
people with disabilities into the workforce of public institutions. The office welcomes both 
measures, which represent progress in favour of vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>34. The Juancito Pinto benefit, a subsidy to encourage school attendance, was expanded 
to include students up to the fourth year of secondary school and students of specialized 
schools without age or grade limits. According to the Ministry of Education, the school 
dropout rate at the primary level was reduced from 1.82 per cent in 2011 to 1.69 per cent in 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>35. High rates of violence against children were reported in a Ministry of Education 
study on violence, ill-treatment and abuse in schools, which revealed that 88 per cent of the 
school population suffered some form of physical or psychological violence. The majority 
of victims are girls and adolescents. Male students, followed by teachers and fathers, are the 
principal agents of violence. In response, the Ministry elaborated a plurinational plan to 
prevent all forms of violence in the school environment, currently being validated by the

<p>educational community. The office praises that initiative, but remains concerned about the 
study&#8217;s findings.  
</p>
<p>36. Indicators for six human rights (food, education, health, work, housing and women&#8217;s 
right to a life free of violence), developed under the leadership of the National Institute for 
Statistics (INE) and the Ministry of Justice, with the support of the office, are now in use by 
25 public institutions. Approximately 335 indicators have been developed and 30 per cent 
of the data collected and is available. The development of indicators for the right to water 
was initiated.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>37. On 9 March, Comprehensive Law No. 348 on Guaranteeing Women a Life Free 
from Violence was promulgated, the result of more than a decade of efforts by women&#8217;s 
and other civil society organizations. The High Commissioner welcomed the law&#8217;s 
enactment, considering that it broadened women&#8217;s protection from various forms of 
violence and made the eradication of violence a State priority.10 That legislation 
complements other laws, adopted in 2012, that promote the full exercise of women&#8217;s 
rights.11 
</p>
<p>38. Law No. 348 is the first law to provide a comprehensive approach to combating 
violence against women through prevention, care, protection, prosecution and punishment. 
The Law criminalizes femicide, thus complying with recommendations made by the High 
Commissioner in her previous report (A/HRC/22/17/Add.2 and Corr.2, para. 91 (c)) and by 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2008 
(CEDAW/C/BOL/CO/4, paras. 24 and 25). 
</p><p>39. Regarding prosecution and punishment, complaints of violence against women were 
down by 70 per cent compared to the first semester of 2012.12 This may be explained by the 
fact that the legislation that was repealed had provided for multiple channels through which 
victims could file complaints, under family, administrative or criminal jurisdictions, while 
the new law permits complaints only through the criminal justice system. Pending the 
creation of specialized courts and prosecutors&#8217; offices, criminal judges and prosecutors 
have taken on the caseload. Although 592 criminal judges and prosecutors received training 
on the law, that effort may be insufficient to respond to the problem, given the crisis in the 
criminal justice system. To ensure an effective implementation of the new legislation, the 
necessary budgetary resources must be allocated at all corresponding levels of the State.  
</p>
<p>40. The Plurinational Constitutional Court defined the obligation of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to adopt, ex officio, protection measures and programmes for women 
victims of violence in conformity with international human rights standards.13 Specialized 
prosecutor&#8217;s offices for providing victims of violence and of trafficking with priority 
attention exist only in the capital city of each department. The creation of specialized 
prosecutor&#8217;s offices in the provinces and mobile offices is still pending. The Public

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>Prosecutor&#8217;s Office adopted protocols for cases brought under Law No. 348, including 
measures to protect and assist victims and to prosecute perpetrators of crimes against sexual 
liberty. 
</p>
<p>41. The Plurinational State of Bolivia still does not have a specific entity responsible for 
promoting gender policies in judicial institutions. The office received complaints from two 
female judges of alleged acts of physical and psychological violence within their own 
institution, which are currently under investigation by the criminal justice system. At the 
fourteenth Congress of Female Judges from Ibero-America, Bolivian judges formed a 
commission to promote gender policies and recommended the creation of gender units 
within judicial institutions. 
</p><p>42. For the first time, women were promoted to the rank of general, two in the police 
and one in the Armed Forces, representing a step towards gender equality and equity in 
police and military institutions.  
</p>
<p>43. The investigations into the killings of two elected female councillors in 2012, Juana 
Quispe Apaza of Ancoraimes municipality, La Paz, and Daguimar Rivera Ortiz, of 
Guayaramer&#237;n municipality, Beni, related to their political activity and to the fact that they 
were women, are still in the pretrial stage (A/HRC/22/17/Add.2 and Corr.2, para. 38). In 
the first case, two alleged intellectual authors, members of the Acoraimes Municipal 
Council, have been indicted. In the second, the indictment was expanded to include another 
elected municipal councillor, but the trial is pending since one judge recused himself and 
another resigned.  
</p>
<p>44. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, abortion is the third most common cause of 
maternal mortality. According to an investigation by Ipas Bolivia,14 approximately 185 
abortions are carried out daily under conditions of risk.15 Abortion is criminalized except in 
cases of rape, sex with a minor and incest or when the life of the mother is at risk, but prior 
judicial authorization is required (CCPR/C/BOL/CO/3, para. 9),  thus limiting access to safe 
abortion even in those cases. Since 2012, the Plurinational Constitutional Court has been 
reviewing a constitutional challenge of 13 articles of the Criminal Code, including those 
criminalizing abortion.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Administration of justice and the fight against impunity 
</b>45. The office considers that while numerous important measures have been adopted by 
the judicial authorities elected in 2011, those measures have not yet overcome the profound 
crisis in the administration of justice, characterized by structural problems such as 
corruption, delays, insufficient coverage of judicial services throughout the country16 and 
limited access to justice by vulnerable sectors of the population. Those and other problems 
have led to a worrisome judicial backlog and, ultimately, impunity.17  
46. Among the principal problems faced by the criminal justice system which often lead 
to violations of the rights of both victims of crime and the accused is the high number of 
pending cases: 75 per cent of the criminal investigations initiated during 2013 are pending

 According to the Council of Magistrates, only 43 per cent of the 339 municipalities have a judge (as 
</p>
<p>at 24 May 2013).  
 
</p>
<p>17
 According to the latest data available from the Council of Magistrates, in 2012 the overall 
</p>
<p>accumulated judicial backlog of unresolved cases was 54.92 per cent (396,482 pending cases). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.2

<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>resolution in 2014.18 Another is the excessive and prolonged use of pretrial detention, in 
some cases exceeding the maximum penalty possible for the crime under investigation. 
Corruption is another widespread problem in the judicial system.  
</p><p>47. The insufficient coverage of the judicial system is critical. Only 23 per cent of 
municipalities have a prosecutor,  there are only 69 public defenders nationally and the 
Institute of Forensic Investigation (IDIF) has only 65 experts and 54 forensic doctors 
nationally.19 
</p>
<p>48. Other problems in the criminal justice system are related to deficiencies in 
institutional management and to weak judicial control, including frequent changes of 
prosecutors and suspension of hearings; limited use of abbreviated procedures; abusive use 
by the parties of excusals, legal challenges and other dilatory recourses; and suspension of 
proceedings when one of the parties (generally the victim) does not push the process 
forward. The Felipe Moza case illustrates those issues. A former civic leader in Tarija, 
Mr. Moza was indicted for acts representing a danger of destruction and causing serious 
damage, punishable by up to four and six years of imprisonment, respectively, for his 
alleged involvement in the explosion of a gas pipeline in 2008 in Yacuiba. He has been held 
in pretrial detention for the past five years. The office is concerned that his time in 
detention is already equivalent to the sentence he would have to serve if convicted.  
</p>
<p>49. In the light of that situation, the judicial branch (comprising the Agro-Environmental 
Court, the Supreme Court of Justice, the Council of Magistrates and departmental tribunals) 
and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office analysed structural problems in the justice system,20 
identifying and adopting response measures, which were included in medium-term strategic 
institutional plans and in operational plans for 2014.  
</p>
<p>50. The judicial branch and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office adopted various institutional 
guidelines to promote judicial independence, and drafted regulations for their respective 
professional career systems. The Council of Magistrates and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
approved regulations on disciplinary procedures. The School for Judges and the School for 
Prosecutors designed the profile of future judges and prosecutors and their respective 
syllabuses for their introductory training, into which human rights were mainstreamed.  
</p>
<p>51. To foster transparency in the administration of justice, the transparency units of the 
judicial branch and of the Plurinational Constitutional Court conducted mid-year public 
accountability processes for the second consecutive year and began to coordinate with the 
Ministry of Institutional Transparency and the Fight against Corruption. The Court 
approved a Code of Ethics for its personnel and created an Internal Audit Unit.  
</p>
<p>52. In order to improve access to justice, the Council of Magistrates filled 96 judicial 
vacancies.21 Between 2012 and 2013, the number of judges increased by 5 per cent in 
relation to 2011.22 The judicial branch designed policies to reduce the high rate of backlog, 
to be implemented from 2014.

</p>
<p>53. The approved budget of judicial institutions23 was increased by 13 per cent in 
relation to 2012. Nevertheless, the budget for justice accounts for only 0.53 per cent of the 
overall State budget, an amount which is insufficient for the implementation of ongoing 
reforms needed to address grave insufficiencies and deficiencies in the administration of 
justice.  
</p><p>54. The Plurinational Constitutional Court delivered several judgements in which it put 
forward arguments based on human rights. In its judgement SCP No. 137/2013, the Court 
ruled as unconstitutional article 183.I.4 of the Law on the Judiciary &#8212; the article that gave 
the Council of Magistrates the power to suspend judges from the exercise of their functions 
following the opening of an official investigation &#8212;, arguing the need to protect the right of 
judges to the presumption of innocence, to due process and to not be subjected to advance 
punishment. Similarly, in SCP No. 2055/2012, published in 2013, the Court ruled as 
unconstitutional provisions contained in Framework Law No. 31 on Autonomy and 
Decentralization that allowed for the suspension of elected authorities following a formal 
indictment, considering it contrary to the presumption of innocence and the political rights 
of defendants.  
</p>
<p>55. Regarding indigenous jurisdiction, the Plurinational Constitutional Court defined 
criteria for the interpretation of Law No. 73 on Jurisdiction Demarcation concerning the 
personal, territorial and material competence of indigenous jurisdiction, in conformity with 
relevant international instruments and the Constitution.24 The judgement is in line with the 
relevant recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD/C/BOL/CO/17-20, para. 22). 
56. The office remains concerned about the accumulation of judicial complaints against 
some members of the political opposition and former public officials, mainly for the crime 
of corruption. In a positive development, the 2012 ruling of the Plurinational Constitutional 
Court on the unconstitutionality of the offence of defamation against public officials 
(<i>desacato</i>) led to the dismissal of such cases.  
57. In August, the opposition Senator, Roger Pinto, who sought asylum in the Embassy 
of Brazil in May 2012, crossed the border with the personal support of a Brazilian diplomat 
and without the authorization of the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. The 
Senator presented a petition for refugee status in Brazil claiming persecution. The Bolivian 
authorities have submitted to the Government of Brazil documented evidence in relation to 
criminal cases against him.  
</p>
<p><b>  Judicial trials of emblematic cases  
</b>58. The office continued to monitor emblematic criminal proceedings. In addition to the 
general problems in the criminal justice system described above, the office observed that 
trials in those cases often were of very limited duration, did not begin on schedule, were 
constantly interrupted by recesses and were conducted in a disorderly fashion, which 
affected compliance with the right to a fair trial of victims and defendants. 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Proceedings against the former President, Gonzalo S&#225;nchez de Lozada, for the tragic 
events of October 2003 (Black October case)

<p>responsibility for acts in 2003 that caused the deaths of more than 60 people and wounded 
</p><p>400. In 2013, the Supreme Court of Justice initiated a second request for the extradition of 
former President S&#225;nchez de Lozada from the United States of America for those events.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Violent racist events of May 2008 in Sucre 
</b>60. On 24 May 2008, an opposition group attempted to prevent the visit of President 
Morales to Sucre, leading to confrontations with the public security forces. Some 60 
indigenous people who supported the visit of the President were held against their will by 
members of the opposition group and were insulted, beaten, harassed and forced to kneel in 
the public plaza; several were injured. With regard to judicial proceedings, in February 
2013 the court declared, in response to a request from 15 defendants, that the statute of 
limitations had expired for 5 of the 11 crimes for which they had been charged. The trial is 
at the stage of statements by defendants. The office echoes the recommendation of the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, requesting the Government to intensify its efforts to eradicate 
impunity in those cases and to improve assistance to victims of racial violence 
(A/HRC/23/56/Add.1, para. 95). 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Massacre at El Porvenir  
</b>61. Regarding the trial for the violent incidents of September 2008 in Pando during an 
indigenous march, which led to the deaths of 13 people and left over 50 injured, conditional 
house arrest was granted to the principal defendant for health reasons and, for the same 
reasons, there have been few hearings. The oral proceedings are at the final stage of the 
presentation of documentary evidence. In April, one of the accused was released from 
detention after having been deprived of his liberty without a judicial order since December 
2010.  
</p>
<p><b> (d) Alleged terrorist group dismantled in Santa Cruz 
</b>62. On 16 April 2008, an alleged terrorist group was dismantled in the city of Santa 
Cruz in a police operation in which two foreign nationals were killed. Currently, 39 people 
have been charged: 22 are facing trial (6 are in detention) and 17 were declared to be 
fugitives. The case was relocated from Tarija back to Santa Cruz owing to the health 
problems of one of the accused. The trial is at the stage of the reception of oral declarations 
of defendants. 
</p>
<p>63. In its opinion No. 63/2011 of November 2011, the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention qualified as arbitrary the detention, since April 2009, of a Hungarian citizen, 
El&#337;d T&#243;&#225;s&#243;. In the framework of the case of the dismantled terrorist group, the opinion was 
again presented to the Bolivian courts by Mr. T&#243;&#225;s&#243;&#8217;s lawyers in 2013. The courts denied 
the petition without any written reasoning or pronouncement on the opinion of the Working 
Group. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was also informed of the case at 
its 149th session. 
</p>
<p>64. An opposition legislator accused the main prosecutor responsible for the 
investigation of the case of manipulating evidence, which may have affected the chain of 
custody. The public prosecutor later resigned and is currently under investigation for 
alleged extortion from some of the defendants. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Rights of victims of unconstitutional regimes  
</b></p>
<p>65. The rights of victims of human rights violations committed during the 
unconstitutional regimes from 1964 to 1982 have still largely not been addressed, although, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>in a positive development, in December the Senate approved a draft bill to create a truth 
commission. The draft is currently before the Chamber of Deputies, which has announced 
that consultations will be held with organizations that have relevant experience and interest. 
</p>
<p>66. With regard to reparation to victims, provided for under Law No. 2640 of 2004, the 
office remains concerned that a high percentage of reparation requests filed have been 
dismissed owing to the heavy burden of proof imposed on victims. Additionally, the office 
regrets that the payments made in cases where reparation was approved cover only 20 per 
cent of the amount agreed.  
</p>
<p>67. The remains of Hugo Boh&#243;rquez Fern&#225;ndez, a victim of enforced disappearance and 
member of the National Liberation Army, were returned to his family. However, the 
whereabouts of more than 150 persons who disappeared between 1964 and 1982 remain 
unknown. There has been no progress in the criminal proceedings for some of those cases, 
nor in obtaining access to information contained in military archives, which has led to the 
impunity of the perpetrators of those crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to life and physical integrity  
</b></p>
<p>68. Although complaints regarding the excessive use of force in the context of social 
conflicts decreased in 2013, the office is concerned about the slow progress of 
investigations for cases from the past, in particular those relating to the events in Caranavi 
in 2010 and in Mallku Khota in 2012.  
</p>
<p>69. The office is concerned about new cases of alleged ill-treatment by officials of their 
subordinates, particularly conscripts and cadets, during training in the police and the Armed 
Forces. In February, in the context of a military training exercise, a sub-lieutenant, Ceooly 
Espinal Prieto, died under unclear circumstances. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office concluded in 
its final report that the State was responsible for the harm to the physical integrity and, 
ultimately, the death of sub-lieutenant. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office also reported on the case 
of a conscript, Freddy Rodr&#237;guez U&#241;o, who in September was allegedly subjected to torture 
at a military post in Atocha, Potos&#237;. In November, a police cadet, Cinthia Poma, died, 
allegedly as a consequence of ill-treatment and punishment inflicted during physical 
exercise sessions. The investigation into the case continues.  
</p>
<p>70. In contrast, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office charged the suspects in the case of a sub-
lieutenant, Grover Poma, who died in 2011 as a result of beatings by other soldiers and 
trainers during military combat training. Nevertheless, the legislative assembly has not yet 
taken action on the recommendation of the Plurinational Constitutional Court, contained in 
its ruling No. SCP 2540/2012 on the Poma case, that the Military Criminal Code and the 
Military Code of Criminal Procedure be adjusted so as to guarantee that human rights 
violations are judged by the ordinary justice system, in compliance with the Constitution 
and international standards. 
</p>
<p>71. The office is concerned that cases of lynching still occur, and is also concerned 
about the lack of effective initiatives by State authorities at the national, departmental and 
local levels, including effective public prevention campaigns, to combat that phenomenon. 
As at September 2013, 37 cases of lynching or attempted lynching had been registered, 
resulting in 10 deaths, including that of a 17-year-old boy.25 Lynching tends to occur in the 
periphery of urban areas with limited or no State presence. Insufficient intervention by the 
police and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office hinders the prevention of such incidents and

</b></p>
<p>limits subsequent investigations. Nevertheless, the adoption of Law No. 458 on the 
Protection of Complainants and Witnesses on 19 December represents progress. The office 
observed that judicial proceedings have produced insufficient or no results. 
</p><p>72. The legislative assembly has not yet modified the definition of the crime of torture 
under article 295 of the Criminal Code, which is not in conformity with international 
standards, either with regard to the elements of the crime or its punishment. 
</p>
<p>73. According to data provided by the State to the Committee against Torture, the police 
dealt with 42 individual cases of ill-treatment and torture, while the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office registered 36 complaints between March 2006 and February 2013. The 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office informed the Committee that it had issued 91 decisions related to 
torture and ill-treatment between 2007 and 2012 (CAT/C/BOL/CO/2, para. 10). The office 
echoes the recommendations made by the Committee against Torture that the State 
establish a centralized public register for complaints of torture, which should include 
information about corresponding investigations, prosecutions and criminal or disciplinary 
sanctions.26 
</p>
<p>74. On 30 December, Law No. 474 creating the Torture Prevention Service (SEPRET) 
was adopted. While the law indicates that SEPRET will serve as the national preventive 
mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, pending since 2007, the office is 
concerned that the mechanism&#8217;s independence will be compromised by its dependence on 
the Ministry of Justice and that its mandate and powers have not been defined by law.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Right to personal liberty and the situation in prisons  
</b></p>
<p>75. Structural problems in the prison system continued. Overcrowding and overuse of 
pretrial detention, with pretrial detainees representing 83.3 per cent of the prison 
population, are issues of particular concern. According to the Directorate-General of 
Prisons, there are more than 13,000 inmates in prisons with a capacity for approximately 
4,900. The Committee against Torture expressed alarm about the extent of overcrowding 
and referred to a number of other problems, including cases of sexual violence, particularly 
against female detainees, restrictions of visiting hours, the transfer of minors from 
rehabilitation centres and the lack of separation of persons in preventive detention and those 
convicted of crimes, as well as the need to improve medical attention (CAT/C/BOL/CO/2, 
para. 18).  
</p><p>76. The situation described above has caused protests by inmates. Through Presidential 
Decree No. 1723,27 the Government reopened the possibility of granting pardons and 
amnesties. Nevertheless, the impact of those measures continues to be limited and other 
types of measures are urgently required to reduce the prison population.  
</p>
<p>77. The office is concerned about the lack of effective State control in prisons, which are 
essentially under the control of the inmates themselves. The authorities have been unable to 
prevent or control acts of violence. The most serious incident occurred in August in 
Palmasola Prison in Santa Cruz, when a group of inmates attacked inmates in another

 Presidential Decree No. 1145 of 2012 had established and regulated the conditions for a previous 
</p>
<p>period of pardon; Presidential Decree No. 1723 of 2013 established similar conditions for pardons, 
and in addition included the granting of amnesty for those who were involved in proceedings that 
could carry prison sentences of fewer than four years. </p>

<p>sector, provoking a fire that killed 35 people, including one boy, and injured more than 50 
people. 
</p>
<p>78. Another cause for concern is the situation of children living in prisons with their 
detained relatives. According to the Directorate-General of Prisons, as at September, 
approximately 2,100 children were living in prisons. In June, a riot occurred in San Pedro 
Prison in La Paz, in reaction to the rape of a 12-year-old girl by her detained relatives. In 
response, the Government decided to evacuate children from the prison, a measure rejected 
by inmates. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office facilitated the signature of an agreement between 
detainees of the San Pedro prison and national authorities to evacuate children older than 11 
years old. Nevertheless, the Directorate-General of Prisons reported that in October 236 
children were still living in San Pedro Prison, of which 98 were between 6 and 13 years old. 
The office publicly expressed its opposition to that situation, which persists.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Human rights defenders and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>79. During 2013, fewer attacks against the media, journalists and press workers were 
reported than in previous years; the cases involved various categories of perpetrators.28 The 
most serious case occurred in Caranavi, La Paz, where two journalists of the La Voz de las 
Mayor&#237;as (Voice of the Majority) radio station were the object of attacks and intimidation, 
and transmission equipment was stolen and furniture burned by residents mobilized in the 
context of a municipal conflict. Few of the incidents have reached the courts and judicial 
action has been generally ineffective for those that have.  
</p>
<p>80. The draft law on transparency and access to public information proposed by the 
executive branch was sent to the legislative assembly. Although the draft represents 
significant progress, the office is concerned about the incompatibility of some provisions 
with international standards, particularly regarding restrictions on access to public 
information. There is also concern about provisions establishing that additional restrictions 
may be imposed via decree and about the lack of independence of the institution which 
would oversee respect for the rights protected under the law.  
</p>
<p>81. Statements by the Government accusing the Ombudsman, Rolando Villena, of 
acting in the interests of the opposition, following his request for the removal of a high-
level government official in relation to the Chaparina case, raised concern. Following the 
publication of his 2013 annual report, the Ombudsman expressed concern about the 
Government&#8217;s sensitivity to criticism. 
</p>
<p>82. The office considers that some of the grounds to revoke the legal status of civil 
society organizations set out in Supreme Decree No. 1597 of 5 June 2013, which regulates 
Law No. 351 on the Granting of Legal Status to social organizations, non-governmental 
organizations, foundations and civil non-profit entities, could limit the effective functioning 
of such entities. The grounds for revoking status relating to public interest and non-
compliance with sectoral policies and standards are of particular concern.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main activities of the office 
</b></p>
<p>83. In the framework of the project &#8220;Strengthening and increasing the independence of 
the judicial system in Bolivia&#8221;, financed by the European Commission and implemented in 
coordination with the Plurinational Constitutional Court and the judicial branch, the office

<p>helped organize 17 training programmes, including 20 public events, with the participation 
of 1,794 judicial staff and judges.  
</p><p>84. Under the same project, the office provided technical assistance aimed at 
strengthening the administration of justice, including to the Council of Magistrates, for its 
professional career system and disciplinary regime; to the judicial branch, to systematize 
the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Justice and design a communications and 
transparency policy; and to the Plurinational Constitutional Court, regarding the functioning 
of departmental coordination units and procedural management guidelines. Conciliation in 
judicial institutions was also promoted in collaboration with the judicial branch and the 
Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, as was coordination among judicial 
institutions and between judicial institutions and civil society and indigenous organizations, 
including through the Judicial Summit and the First National Meeting of Authorities of 
Indigenous Jurisdiction and the Plurinational Constitutional Court.  
</p>
<p>85. With the objective of strengthening the right of access to justice of women, the 
Council of Magistrates, with support from the office, organized the fourteenth Congress of 
Female Judges from Ibero-America, held from 26 to 28 November in Cochabamba, which 
concluded with the adoption of an important declaration with action points.  
</p>
<p>86. In the framework of the joint project &#8220;Support for the process of legislative 
development and implementation of the right to consultation and participation of 
indigenous peoples in Bolivia&#8221;, funded by the European Commission, the office conducted, 
in coordination with other United Nations agencies and national actors, 17 training and

for conducting consultations, and introduce modifications to guarantee that the 
realization of such consultations complies fully with relevant international standards;

investigate the complaints of violence against two female magistrates within their 
institution;  
</b></p>
