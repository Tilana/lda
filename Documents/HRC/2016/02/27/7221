</p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> The present study is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/RES/27/27 of 26 September 2014, in which the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights was requested to &#8220;commission a study on the 
</p>
<p>impact of technical assistance and capacity-building on the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to submit the report at its thirtieth session 
</p>
<p>within the framework of an interactive dialogue&#8221;. It is based on activities conducted 
</p>
<p>throughout the country between 2008 and the end of 2014 by the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>international NGOs, with the support of Member States.  
</p>
<p> During the period under consideration, the technical assistance provided by the 
</p>
<p>international community made it possible to achieve significant legislative and 
</p>
<p>institutional progress and improved conduct on the part of duty bearers and rights 
</p>
<p>holders. 
</p>
<p> The country&#8217;s legal framework has evolved, notably with the adoption in 2013 of 
</p>
<p>an Institutional Act giving courts of appeal jurisdiction over crimes of genocide, war 
</p>
<p>crimes and crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p> Institutional developments in the area of human rights include the establishment 
</p>
<p>of the human rights liaison entity and the Human Rights Defenders Protection Unit. 
</p>
<p>The National Human Rights Commission was set up in 2013 and its members were 
</p>
<p>appointed in 2015. 
</p>
<p> The fact that victims of sexual violence have gradually become aware of their 
</p>
<p>need for justice and assistance has helped to combat impunity for crimes under 
</p>
<p>international law and sexual and gender-based violence committed by senior officers 
</p>
<p>of the defence and security forces and by armed groups. A growing number of 
</p>
<p>members of those forces and groups have been found guilty of massacres, sexual </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-14279 <b>2/19 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>violence and looting, and have been given sentences including life imprisonment. 
</p>
<p> Capacity-building for the defence and security forces and civil society, together 
</p>
<p>with increased monitoring of human rights by civil society and the United Nations, the 
</p>
<p>publication of reports, advocacy and the above-mentioned sentences have all helped to 
</p>
<p>raise the authorities&#8217; awareness of their duties and to reduce the number of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. 
</p>
<p> The protection mechanisms set up in areas subject to armed attack in the east of 
</p>
<p>the country have helped provide better protection for the civilian population.  
</p>
<p> Despite the positive impact of the technical assistance provided by the 
</p>
<p>international community in the area of human rights, many problems remain. Impunity 
</p>
<p>is still a major concern. Remaining challenges related to the legal framework include 
</p>
<p>the fact that important legislation aimed at protecting human rights, and specifically 
</p>
<p>concerning human rights defenders, sex equality and gender, has not yet been adopted.  
</p>
<p> There are conflicts of mandate between institutions, for instance, between the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission and the human rights liaison entity, and there is 
</p>
<p>still no national mechanism for the prevention of torture, despite the fact that the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party to the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment. 
</p>
<p> Most interventions by the international community have concentrated on the east 
</p>
<p>of the country and have generally been short-term, which has not helped to produce 
</p>
<p>sustainable outcomes.

<p><b> </b>I.<b> </b>Introduction<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in resolution A/HRC/RES/27/27 of 26 September 
</p>
<p>2014, called upon the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) to commission a study on the impact of technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Congo. 
</p>
<p>2. Based on a review of the action taken by the United Nations and international 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with respect to the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights, the study evaluates the progress achieved as a result of these 
</p>
<p>activities, as well as its limits with regard to the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo. It covers the period from 2008 to 2014, with the 
</p>
<p>beginning of the year 2008 marking the start of the first United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Assistance Framework (UNDAF) with a post-crisis perspective after the presidential 
</p>
<p>election of 2006. 
</p>
<p>3. The study aims to measure the following elements: 
</p>
<p>&#61623; The relevance of action taken by the international community with respect to 
</p>
<p>human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; The effectiveness of such action in terms of results;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; The impact of technical assistance on the enjoyment of human rights;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; The inclusion of gender mainstreaming in all areas.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>II.<b> </b>Scope of the study<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. The study takes into account the 2008-2012 cycle and half of the 2013-2017 
</p>
<p>cycle of UNDAF, the country programmes of the different specialized institutions of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations and those of international NGOs. 
</p>
<p>5. It should be noted that UNDAF is aligned to the Government&#8217;s priorities with 
</p>
<p>respect to governance and human rights as outlined in the national Growth and 
</p>
<p>Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP).  
</p>
<p>6. The priorities with respect to human rights, which are set out in the 2006 and the 
</p>
<p>2011-2015 GPRSPs, are the following: improving the legal framework and access to 
</p>
<p>justice; training magistrates and court officers and creating a national judicial training 
</p>
<p>college; establishing an institution for the coordination of human rights affairs; 
</p>
<p>disseminating human rights conventions; improving conditions of detention; 
</p>
<p>improving the protection of vulnerable groups; and ensuring better management and 
</p>
<p>development of natural resources.  
</p>
<p>7. Four main themes emerge from the programme documents of some stakeholders 
</p>
<p>and from meetings with them and with the national authorities; they group the main 
</p>
<p>aspects of work related to human rights in the country:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Supporting the administration of justice in order to combat impunity;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Strengthening the national system for the protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>collaboration with international human rights mechanisms;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Protecting civilians in armed conflict;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Promoting economic and social rights.  
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>III.<b> </b>Methodology<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8. The study was carried out over three months by an OHCHR staff member 
</p>
<p>deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with institutional support provided 
</p>
<p>by a reference group composed of OHCHR, the United Nations Joint Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Office (UNJHRO) 1  and the United Nations Integrated Office in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo.  
</p>
<p>9. The study is based on the following methodology:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Inspection of various documents (in particular studies, reports, legislation and 
</p>
<p>programme documents); 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Discussions with members of local civil society to gain an understanding of how 
</p>
<p>they interpret the action taken by international organizations;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Submission of questionnaires to the principal actors from the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>government authorities and international NGOs in Kinshasa and the provinces; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; E-mail exchanges with stakeholders that are not resident in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Observer missions to Bas-Congo (Mbanza-Ngungu, Kimbemba and Lamba) on 
</p>
<p>income-generating activities and assistance to returned migrants; to Katanga 
</p>
<p>(Kalemie and Lubumbashi) on governance with respect to the exploitation of 
</p>
<p>natural resources and the protection of indigenous populations; to North Kivu 
</p>
<p>(Goma) on protection of civilians, combating sexual violence and care for 
</p>
<p>children demobilized by armed groups and victims of sexual violence; and to 
</p>
<p>South Kivu (Bukavu) on holistic care for victims of sexual violence. Visits were 
</p>
<p>made to the legal clinic at Mungunga, the War Child UK helpline centre in North 
</p>
<p>Kivu and the Panzi Foundation in South Kivu.  
</p>
<p>10. The following difficulties were encountered in conducting the study:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Lack of responses to requests for meetings and to questionnaires from some key 
</p>
<p>focal points; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Unavailability of documentation and of comprehensive detailed data on the 
</p>
<p>action taken by the international community throughout the period under 
</p>
<p>consideration; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Lack of institutional memory because of certain international actors having 
</p>
<p>moved elsewhere; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Inaccessibility of some locations in the west of the country (Equateur, Manie ma, 
</p>
<p>Kasa&#239;) due to the halt in air traffic following the gradual withdrawal of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic 
</p>
<p>of the Congo (MONUSCO); 
</p>
<p>&#61623; The relatively short length of time allocated to carry out the study.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>IV.<b> </b>Main interventions by the international community<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. Since 1996, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has suffered a series of wars 
</p>
<p>that have caused political instability and insecurity, economic failure and a

 UNJHRO was established in 2008 following the merger of the OHCHR office in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo (created in 1996) and the human rights component of the United Nations

</b></p>
<p>considerable delay in the country&#8217;s development. This situation has led to chronic 
</p>
<p>humanitarian crises and grave violations of human rights, in particular sexual and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>12. In response, the international community has taken significant measures in the 
</p>
<p>field of human rights. These have involved numerous international NGOs, 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO, whose human rights mandate is implemented by UNJHRO, and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Programme Management Team (PMT).2

<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Support for the administration of justice in combating impunity <b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. The political instability and insecurity in the country led to serious crimes and 
</p>
<p>mass violations of human rights by defence and security forces and by armed groups. 
</p>
<p>They included extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, sexual and gender -based 
</p>
<p>violence, property crime and forced labour.  
</p>
<p>14. In the absence of comprehensive data on the period under consideration, the 
</p>
<p>chart below shows the evolution of human rights violations and the number of victims 
</p>
<p>of those violations between 2011 and 2014.

<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Source:  Data from UNJHRO. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15. The above chart shows a slight decrease in the number of cases of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations during the period in question but a marked increase in the number of 
</p>
<p>victims. In total, 21,940 victims were recorded by UNJHRO between 2011 and 2014, 
</p>
<p>of whom 14,851 were men, 4,149 were women and 2,940 were children. Victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence were among the victims for whom comprehensive care was provided.

<p>political, economic, social and cultural, including the right to development 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/7/6/Add.4), the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, noted that survivors of rape in the Democratic Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Congo lacked appropriate care and were denied the compensation to which they were 
</p>
<p>entitled under international and Congolese law.

<p>17. The combined efforts of the American Bar Association, Avocats sans fronti&#232;res, 
</p>
<p>UNJHRO, Cordaid, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the International Center for Transitional Justice, 
</p>
<p>UN-Women, the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA), Physicians for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Track 
</p>
<p>Impunity Always (Trial), supported by a number of Member States, enabled 89 
</p>
<p>itinerant hearings to be organized by military and civil courts in the provinces of Bas -
</p>
<p>Congo, Equateur, Kasa&#239;-oriental, Katanga, North Kivu, Orientale, South Kivu and 
</p>
<p>Kinshasa between 2008 and 2014. The advocacy efforts of the international 
</p>
<p>community with respect to combating impunity for sexual violence were reinforced by 
</p>
<p>the mandates of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual 
</p>
<p>Violence in Conflict and the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence 
</p>
<p>in Conflict. 
</p>
<p>18. In 2013, UNJHRO provided legal assistance free of charge to 1,507 victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence in 12 legal clinics and 25 legal aid centres (throughout the country 
</p>
<p>apart from Orientale province), with funding from the Canadian International 
</p>
<p>Development Agency, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, 
</p>
<p>Belgium, Brazil and UK Aid. 
</p>
<p>19. According to figures from MONUSCO, there was a gradual increase in the 
</p>
<p>number of judgements issued with respect to sexual violence in comparison with the 
</p>
<p>total number of judgements issued by national courts between 2009 and 2014: from 14 
</p>
<p>per cent (2009/2010), to 17 per cent (2010/2011), 22 per cent  (2011/2012), 25 per cent 
</p>
<p>(2012/2013) and 23 per cent (2013/2014).  
</p>
<p>20. During the period in question, around 33,057 victims 3  of sexual violence 
</p>
<p>benefited from holistic care comprising legal, medical, psychosocial and social and 
</p>
<p>economic assistance provided by UNJHRO, UN-Women, OSISA, UNFPA and 
</p>
<p>UNICEF, often through local NGOs. In 2010, following work by the Panel on 
</p>
<p>Remedies and Reparations for Victims of Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic 
</p>
<p>of the Congo, UNJHRO and UNFPA provided joint social and economic assistance to 
</p>
<p>30 women who were victims of sexual violence in Songo -Mboyo (Equateur province). 
</p>
<p>At their request, they were given a boat for transporting fish so that they could sell 
</p>

</p>
<p>the international community, in 2014 for the first time, the Government of the

<p>21. In 2006, the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper diagnosed the

<p>judicial system as being ineffective and resulting in individuals resorting to 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial conflict resolution procedures, court decisions not being enforced and

 In December 2003, FARDC soldiers committed mass rapes of women and girls in Songo -Mboyo. 
</p>

<p>strengthening the training of judges and court officers with respect to ethics, 
</p>
<p>professional conduct and international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>23. Between 2008 and 2014, international stakeholders trained more than 25,000 
</p>
<p>court and prison personnel (civilian and military), of whom approximately 10 per cent 
</p>
<p>were women, in all the country&#8217;s provinces on the legal processes regarding crimes 
</p>
<p>under international law, sexual violence and other human rights violatio ns, forensic 
</p>
<p>examination, combating torture and management of cases concerning children in 
</p>
<p>conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p>24. The lack of coordination between the various international stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>between them and the Government, the absence of any sectoral policy or strategic plan 
</p>
<p>with respect to human rights as well as the lack of a judicial training college have led 
</p>
<p>to a duplication of capacity-building activities for staff of the justice system. Thus, 
</p>
<p>some of them have followed a number of similar training sessions organized by 
</p>
<p>different partners.  
</p>
<p>25. Between 2008 and 2014, the international community provided support in trials 
</p>
<p>brought for crimes under international law and grave human rights violations by 
</p>
<p>protecting and caring for victims, witnesses and their lawyers and facilitating the 
</p>
<p>travel of judicial personnel. As a result of those trials, 582 members of the Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and 367 members of the 
</p>
<p>national police force 5  were sentenced to between 3 and 20 years in prison. In 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the justice 
</p>
<p>system sentenced commanders and other senior officers of the defence and security 
</p>
<p>forces and members of armed groups, marking an important step in the fight against 
</p>
<p>impunity. Among these emblematic cases were the following:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; On 15 December 2014, the military court of South Kivu sentenced Colonel 
</p>
<p>Engangela, also known as &#8220;colonel 106&#8221;, to rigorous imprisonment for life and 
</p>
<p>20 years of penal servitude for crimes against humanity, torture, kidnapping and 
</p>
<p>sexual slavery committed against approximately 1,200 victims in South Kivu 
</p>
<p>between 2005 and 2007; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; On 9 August 2010, the military tribunal of the garrison of Bunia sentenced 
</p>
<p>Bernard Kakodo, commander of the Forces de r&#233;sistance patriotiques en Ituri 
</p>
<p>armed group, to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity following mass 
</p>
<p>killings of civilians, rape, slavery and pillage in Bunia (Orientale province) in 
</p>
<p>2002; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; On 4 June 2009, the military tribunal of the garrison of Kisangani sentenced 
</p>
<p>Colonel Thom&#8217;s, commander of the Ma&#239;-Ma&#239; militia group, to life imprisonment 
</p>
<p>for crimes against humanity against approximately 135 women, of whom 8 were 
</p>
<p>minors, in the village of Lieke Lesole, close to Kisangani (Orientale province), 
</p>
<p>in 2007.

<p>26. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
</p>
<p>expressed concern that 86 per cent of human rights violations in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo were committed by police or military personnel.  
</p>
<p>27. In a bid to remedy that situation, UNJHRO assisted the Ministry of Justice and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, notably in implementing a national judicial framework with respect to 
</p>
<p>detention. Between 2013 and 2014, UNJHRO and the Ministry visited national police 
</p>
<p>detention facilities and prisons throughout the country. The advocacy of UNJHRO 
</p>
<p>following these visits resulted in the release of 1,177 detainees for procedural

<p>irregularities and illegal detention. In addition, with the assistance of UNJHRO, 17 
</p>
<p>senior law enforcement officers were arrested and 5 were removed from the national 
</p>
<p>police force for serious human rights violations. Two illegal detention centres in 
</p>
<p>Kinshasa and Kisangani were also closed in 2014.  
</p>
<p>28. From 2008 to 2014, in all provinces in the country, UNJHRO, MONUSCO and 
</p>
<p>UNFPA trained around 421,856 members of FARDC, the national police force and the 
</p>
<p>national intelligence agency in combating sexual violence and promoting respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights and international humanitarian law. Together with UNICEF, they 
</p>
<p>designed training modules on combating sexual violence and on international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, which were added to the training programme of the national police 
</p>
<p>force and FARDC. 
</p>
<p>29. The chart below shows a decrease in the number of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>between 2011 and 2014, with 53 per cent of violations committed by members of 
</p>
<p>FARDC or the national police force in 2014. This reduction can be attributed to the 
</p>
<p>training they received and the trials of perpetrators of human rights violations. The 
</p>
<p>peaks observed in 2012 are explained by a resurgence in the activities of armed groups 
</p>
<p>in the east of the country.

<p>Africa, the International Rescue Committee, Magna Enfants en P&#233;ril and UNICEF, 
</p>
<p>with the support of Member States, created and subsequently handed to the 
</p>
<p>Government (Ministry for Gender, the Family and Children) a database on acts of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence committed between 2010 and 2014. The aim of this official database is 
</p>
<p>to map and coordinate action by the international community in nine provinces. A 
</p>
<p>major obstacle to updating the database is the reticence of certain partners to share 
</p>
<p>information which they consider belongs to them.

</p>
<p>consolidating the data on sentences handed out by national courts in cases of sexual

<p>violence. The assistance has consisted in developing tools for data collection, for data 
</p>
<p>analysis and for the production of statistical reports. UNJHRO has placed material

</b> 
</p>
<p>32. As a result of the advocacy of international actors during the period in question, 
</p>
<p>the Democratic Republic of the Congo has acceded to new international and regional 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments: 
</p>
<p>&#61623; The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Women in Africa (in June 2008), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections 
</p>
<p>and Governance (in June 2008) and the African Charter on the Rights and 
</p>
<p>Welfare of the Child (in February 2014);  
</p>
<p>&#61623; The Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (in September 2010);  
</p>
<p>&#61623; An act authorizing the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities was voted on in 2013 and the ratification process is currently 
</p>
<p>under way. 
</p>
<p>33. To date, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has still not become a party to 
</p>
<p>the following instruments: 
</p>
<p>&#61623; The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of Their Families;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>

</b> 
</p>
<p>34. In the report on her mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/13/22/Add.2) in 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders recommended that the drafting methodology of the Interministerial 
</p>
<p>Technical Committee on the drafting and follow-up to initial and periodic human 
</p>
<p>rights reports should be improved to enable it to meet reporting obligations in a timely 
</p>
<p>manner. 
</p>
<p>35. Between 2011 and 2012, the combined periodic reports to the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women and the Human Rights Committee were submitted with assistance received by 
</p>
<p>the Interministerial Technical Committee from UNJHRO, UNPD and UNICEF. </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-14279 <b>12/19 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>36. Reports remain to be submitted to the Committee against Torture (due in 2009), 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (due in 2011) and the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (due in 2013).  
</p>
<p>37. In the framework of the country&#8217;s participation in the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>(UPR) in 2009 and 2014, UNJHRO provided technical and financial assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Interministerial Technical Committee to facilitate the submission of the State party 
</p>
<p>reports. At the end of the second UPR cycle, the Government accepted 190 
</p>
<p>recommendations and took note of 39 others. 6  The support of UNJHRO made it 
</p>
<p>possible to draft a plan for implementation of the recommendations, including with the 
</p>
<p>help of funding from the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance.  
</p>
<p>38. During the period under consideration, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</p>
<p>received 5 visits from special procedures 7 in addition to 11 visits recorded before 
</p>
<p>2008. OHCHR provided the necessary support for the organization of these visits.  
</p>
<p>39. Civil society organizations submitted alternative reports to the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and to the UPR in 
</p>
<p>2014. Technical and financial assistance from UNJHRO, the Carter Center and the 
</p>
<p>Centre for Civil and Political Rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</p>
<p>contributed to the development of plans for implementation of the reco mmendations

<p>formulated by the above-mentioned bodies.

<p><b> </b>3.<b> </b>Legal and institutional framework<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>40. The 2009 report on the mission of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders highlights some shortcomings in the Congolese legal system, 
</p>
<p>in particular the absence of laws protecting human rights defenders, limiting the 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of military courts to offences committed by members of the armed forces 
</p>
<p>and the national police, in accordance with article 156 of the 2006 Constitution, and 
</p>
<p>protecting victims and witnesses, in application of article 68 of the Rome Statute, 
</p>
<p>which was ratified by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2002.  
</p>
<p>41. With the advocacy and technical assistance of the international community, the 
</p>
<p>Government adopted important legislation and regulations, including Institutional Act 
</p>
<p>No. 13/011B of 11 April 2013, on the organization, functioning and competence of the 
</p>
<p>ordinary courts, which gives courts of appeal jurisdiction over crimes of genocide, war 
</p>
<p>crimes and crimes against humanity, and Institutional Act No. 13/011 concerning the 
</p>
<p>establishment, organization and operation of the National Human Rights Commission, 
</p>
<p>adopted in 2013 in accordance with the Paris Principles. 8 Other laws were passed on 
</p>
<p>establishing a juvenile justice system and recognizing torture as a crime. However, 
</p>
<p>further efforts are required to achieve the adoption of more legislation, including on 
</p>
<p>the protection of victims, witnesses and human rights defenders.

<p>42. The human rights liaison entity, established in 2009 and composed of national 
</p>
<p>experts, UNJHRO and some international and local NGOs, is tasked with proposing 
</p>
<p>the necessary guidance for the effective protection of human rights, ensuring the 
</p>
<p>monitoring and implementation of the national plan for the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights and overseeing the drafting of initial and periodic reports on human 
</p>
<p>rights. The human rights liaison entity has not been in operation since it was 
</p>
<p>established although some members were appointed in 2010 and 2012. There is a 
</p>
<p>conflict of jurisdiction between the human rights liaison entity and some aspects of the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission, in particular with regard to examination of 
</p>
<p>issues giving rise to human rights violations and proposals for solutions,  as well as 
</p>
<p>evaluation of national activities in the human rights sphere. This situation could create 
</p>
<p>competition between the two institutions, in particular with respect to funding. The 
</p>
<p>same is true for the National Commission for Preparation of and Follo w-up to the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review and the Interministerial Technical Committee, both of 
</p>
<p>which are responsible for the submission of reports to the human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and for follow-up to their recommendations. Given that the National Commission has 
</p>
<p>never been fully operational, its functions could be integrated into those of the 
</p>
<p>Interministerial Technical Committee.  
</p>
<p>43. Technical assistance provided by Avocats sans Fronti&#232;res, UNJHRO, Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Watch and OSISA resulted in the adoption in 2011 of a ministerial decree 
</p>
<p>establishing a unit for the protection of human rights defenders. This unit has 
</p>
<p>difficulty in operating due to lack of adequate resources. In addition, the absence of 
</p>
<p>legislation on the protection of human rights defenders is a barrier to their legal 
</p>
<p>protection.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Protection of civilians in armed conflict<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44. The activities of armed groups in the east of the country are a major threat to the 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians and have resulted in numerous human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>large-scale displacements of populations. Armed groups seeking to extend their 
</p>
<p>influence and their control to rich territories do not hesitate to attack civilian 
</p>
<p>populations. In addition, in the context of operations against these armed groups, 
</p>
<p>members of the Congolese defence and security forces sometimes commit violations 
</p>
<p>of human rights and international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>1.<b> </b>Protection of civilians<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The security of people and their possessions has remained a concern in conflict 
</p>
<p>zones and in zones recovering from conflict. In response to these challenges, the 
</p>
<p>international community has contributed to the implementation of mechanisms for the 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians in the east of the country:  
</p>
<p>&#61623; UNJHRO, in collaboration with MONUSCO, established approximately 312 
</p>
<p>joint protection teams to prevent attacks on civilians in the east of the country 
</p>
<p>between 2009 and 2014. These teams have drawn up plans for protection in 
</p>
<p>different locations and have conducted 117,019 joint patrols;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Between 2013 and 2014, MONUSCO&#8217;s Civil Affairs Section and UNJHRO 
</p>
<p>supported several communities in developing more than 49 community civilian 
</p>
<p>protection plans. During this period, MONSUCO&#8217;s Civil Affairs Section 
</p>
<p>deployed 40 community liaison assistants throughout the communities 
</p>
<p>concerned; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; During the period in question, MONUSCO, Catholic Relief Services and Caritas 
</p>
<p>provided more than 900 mobile telephones and restored high frequency radio </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>communications networks in the provinces of Equateur, Katanga, North Kivu, 
</p>
<p>Orientale and South Kivu. As a result of that assistance, FARDC and 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO were able to take action to protect civilians;  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Between 2011 and 2012, UNJHRO established 93 MONUSCO early warning, 
</p>
<p>analysis and rapid response units, which received 1,890 early warnings relating 
</p>
<p>to threats of armed attacks against civilian populations.  
</p>
<p>46. Despite the results recorded and the adoption, in 2013, by humanitarian actors of 
</p>
<p>a directive on civilian and military coordination concerning information sharing and 
</p>
<p>the wider strategy of the United Nations for the protection of civilians, shortcomings 
</p>
<p>persist in coordination between the humanitarian actors, UNJHRO and MONUSCO 
</p>
<p>forces on information sharing and the prevention of risks of armed attacks on 
</p>
<p>civilians. Some members of working groups on protection are reluctant to share 
</p>
<p>information as a result of their strict interpretation of humanitarian principles 
</p>
<p>(neutrality and impartiality) since the integration with MONUSCO, in 2013, of the 
</p>
<p>Intervention Brigade, when it was given a mandate to fight in response to imminent 
</p>
<p>attacks upon civilians. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>2.<b> </b>Protection of children<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>47. On 4 October 2012, the Government and the special team of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>for the protection of children in armed conflict signed an action plan to combat the 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children in armed forces and armed groups, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolutions 1539 (2004), 1612 (2005), 1882 (2009) and 1998 (2011). 
</p>
<p>An interministerial committee and a joint technical working group, comprising the 
</p>
<p>Government and specialized agencies of the United Nations, 9  were set up to 
</p>
<p>implement the action plan. The MONUSCO Child Protection Section coordinates the 
</p>
<p>joint technical working group and identifies and removes children from armed groups.  
</p>
<p>48. According to report A/69/926-S/2015/409 (2015) on children and armed conflict 
</p>
<p>of the Secretary-General to the Security Council, at least 1,030 children (973 boys and 
</p>
<p>57 girls) were removed from armed groups in the provinces of Orientale and North 
</p>
<p>and South Kivu in 2014.  
</p>
<p>49. UNICEF and its partners provided comprehensive care to 863 child victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence in 2014. 
</p>
<p>50. Between 2012 and 2014, War Child UK supported the creation and transfer to the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Gender, Family and Children of a helpline covering the provinces of North 
</p>
<p>and South Kivu and Kinshasa. This centre responds to children who have been 
</p>
<p>demobilized from armed groups or who are victims of sexual violence. Between 2013 
</p>
<p>and 2014, social workers from the provincial division of social affairs in North Kivu 
</p>
<p>received and processed 10,945 calls. In March 2015, the special representative of the 
</p>
<p>Head of State tasked with combating sexual violence and the recruitment of child 
</p>
<p>soldiers launched a similar initiative at the national level. It is  important to ensure the 
</p>
<p>complementarity of these two mechanisms in order to better coordinate assistance to 
</p>
<p>the children concerned. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>3.<b> </b>Protection of internally displaced persons and returnees<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>51. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanita rian Affairs (OCHA), 
</p>
<p>approximately 2.7 million persons were displaced in the territory of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo and 1.4 million returnees were registered in 2014. 10

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. The resolution of land disputes relating to the return of displaced perso ns to their 
</p>
<p>places of origin led the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</p>
<p>(UNHCR) to support local dispute resolution committees, 700 of which have been set 
</p>
<p>up in the east of the country. Between 2013 and 2014, approximately 70 per cent of 
</p>
<p>land disputes were resolved, 20 per cent were referred to the law courts and 10 per 
</p>
<p>cent were not resolved.  
</p>
<p>53. Between October 2010 and January 2014, in the province of Bas -Congo, the 
</p>
<p>Comitato Internazionale Per Lo Sviluppo Dei Popoli provided food and medical and 
</p>
<p>logistical assistance &#8212; through local NGOs &#8212; to 10,000 Congolese who had been 
</p>
<p>expelled from Angola. The short duration of these projects and the way in which they 
</p>
<p>are funded negatively impacts the sustainability of the results obtained.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>4.<b> </b>Protection of indigenous peoples<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>54. According to the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2011-2015, 80 
</p>
<p>per cent of cases brought before the courts related to land disputes. Since 2012, there 
</p>
<p>have been recurrent inter-community disputes between the Luba and the Twas 
</p>
<p>(indigenous peoples) in the province of Katanga (Kabalo, Kalermie, Kongolo, 
</p>
<p>Manono, Moba and Nyunzu), causing the displacement of approximately 4,000 Twas. 
</p>
<p>These conflicts originated in discrimination against the Twas, including in relation to 
</p>
<p>access to land ownership. UNHCR, through its partnership with Search for Common 
</p>
<p>Ground, has run awareness-raising campaigns among internally displaced persons and 
</p>
<p>returnees on peaceful cohabitation. The dialogue established between communities 
</p>
<p>and local government, with technical support from UNJHRO and UNHCR, has led to 
</p>
<p>a calmer situation in Kalermie. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>D.<b> </b>Economic and social rights<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>55. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has significant natural resources which 
</p>
<p>are often exploited illegally. This situation remains a significant source of conflict and 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights, including economic and social rights. 11 The interventions 
</p>
<p>of international actors focus in particular on access to health and capacity -building in 
</p>
<p>local communities to allow their participation in drawing up plans for local 
</p>
<p>development with a view to improving their enjoyment of economic and social righ ts. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>1.<b> </b>Access to basic health care<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>56. According to demographic and health surveys, the number of women benefiting 
</p>
<p>from a skilled birth attendant in a medical facility rose from 74 per cent in 2007 to 80 
</p>
<p>per cent in 2014. 12  UNFPA and the United States Agency for International 
</p>
<p>Development carried out advocacy and technical assistance activities which resulted in 
</p>
<p>the drafting of a bill on reproductive health and a national strategic plan on family 
</p>
<p>planning in 2013. With the assistance of UNFPA, training for midwives was integrated 
</p>
<p>into the National Reproductive Health Programme and the work of the Ministry for 
</p>
<p>Higher and University Education. In addition, the combined efforts of Cordaid, the 
</p>
<p>World Health Organization, UNFPA and UNICEF resulted in the equipping of medical 
</p>
<p>facilities and the regular supply of medicines and health products, which led to an 
</p>
<p>improvement in the provision of reproductive health services. These improvements 
</p>
<p>were achieved through good strategic planning and coordinated efforts by the 
</p>
<p>international community working with national and provincial authorities.

<p><b> </b>2.<b> </b>Combating discrimination with respect to persons living with HIV<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>57. The overall level of tolerance towards persons living with HIV was estimated to 
</p>
<p>be 6.4 per cent in 2007. 13 The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and 
</p>
<p>UNFPA provided technical assistance towards the adoption of Act No. 08/011 of 14 
</p>
<p>July 2008 relating to the protection of the rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS and 
</p>
<p>affected persons. They supported the national multisector programme to combat AIDS 
</p>
<p>and the updating of the national strategic plan to combat HIV. The Governm ent 
</p>
<p>created units to combat HIV, centralizing the efforts of all its departments. Despite 
</p>
<p>those legal and institutional developments, the overall level of tolerance towards 
</p>
<p>persons living with HIV is 4.2 per cent (demographic and health survey 2014). This 
</p>
<p>slight decline in tolerance can be explained by the absence of measures accompanying 
</p>
<p>the law to protect persons living with HIV, the impunity of persons committing acts of 
</p>
<p>stigmatization and discrimination and the frequency of such acts. 14 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>3.<b> </b>Human rights with respect to natural resources<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>58. One of the principal objectives of the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy 
</p>
<p>Paper 2011-2015 is to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework in the mining 
</p>
<p>sector. Communities bordering extractive resource operations areas do not enjoy some 
</p>
<p>economic and social rights (the rights to health and education, access to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and fair and equitable compensation) as a result of their limited capacities to 
</p>
<p>form committees to defend their rights in the face of insufficient Government action to 
</p>
<p>protect them.  
</p>
<p>59. Between 2012 and 2014, UNJHRO, the Carter Center, Cordaid and OSISA 
</p>
<p>provided technical assistance to more than 3,000 members of civil society and local 
</p>
<p>communities to ensure that they were able to contribute to the revision of the Mining 
</p>
<p>Code. Thus, civil society formulated recommendations which were sent to the 
</p>
<p>Government to ensure that the needs of local communities were taken into account in 
</p>
<p>areas in which natural resources are extracted. The recommendations highlighted the 
</p>
<p>lack of consultation with local communities regarding their development and the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their economic and social rights. The new code has yet to be adopted.  
</p>
<p>60. The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2011-2015 also targets 
</p>
<p>improved management of the mining sector towards sustainable development of the 
</p>
<p>social environment. From 2012 to 2014, Cordaid supported the local communities of 
</p>
<p>Kolwezi and Fungurume (Katanga Province) in drawing up their local development 
</p>
<p>plans for 2016-2020 and 2015-2019, respectively. The plans aim to establish a 
</p>
<p>constructive dialogue between the communities, the companies Kamoa Copper SA and 
</p>
<p>Temke Fungurume Mining and the local authorities to ensure that development 
</p>
<p>priorities are taken into account and to protect the economic and social rights of the 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>61. Raising the awareness of national stakeholders, local communities and business 
</p>
<p>enterprises concerning the principles and norms of human rights in the context of the 
</p>
<p>exploitation of natural resources, in particular the John Ruggie principles, 15 should be 
</p>
<p>emphasized. The international community should make economic and social rights a 
</p>
<p>priority for intervention, including by providing the necessary assistance in this area to 
</p>
<p>all parties concerned. In addition, it should continue to support the Government in 
</p>
<p>order to combat the armed groups that are responsible for the illegal exploitation of 
</p>
<p>resources and the extreme insecurity that has engulfed the population.

</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>62. The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers of 2006 and 2011-2015 
</p>
<p>highlighted the negative impact of the socioeconomic situation on gender issues. With 
</p>
<p>the support of the international community, the Government has worked to reduce the 
</p>
<p>vulnerability of women from a legal and institutional standpoint.  
</p>
<p>63. Implementation of the 2006 Sexual Violence Act has been strengthened by 
</p>
<p>officers in the justice system and the defence and security forces. The National Gender 
</p>
<p>Policy and its plan of action were adopted in 2009 and integrated into the National 
</p>
<p>Strategy to Combat Gender-based Violence. In 2010, the Government adopted a plan 
</p>
<p>to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security.  
</p>
<p>64. In accordance with the recommendation of the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, advocacy by the international 
</p>
<p>community resulted in 2014 in the appointment of a personal representative of the 
</p>
<p>Head of State with responsibility for combating sexual violence and the recruitment of 
</p>
<p>child soldiers. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>VI.<b> </b>Conclusion<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65. The volatile political, security and economic context in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo raises numerous challenges in terms of human rights. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. The interventions of the international community have been relevant and 
</p>
<p>effective in dealing with these challenges. They have also helped to improve the 
</p>
<p>legal and institutional framework. They have furthermore contributed to 
</p>
<p>capacity<b>-</b>building for many national stakeholders, contributed to greater 
</p>
<p>awareness of obligations on the part of the authorities and greater knowledge of 
</p>
<p>human rights on the part of population groups and civil society. As a result, 
</p>
<p>considerable progress has been achieved in fighting impunity and numerous 
</p>
<p>interventions have led to greater protection of the civilian population in the east 
</p>
<p>of the country.  
</p>
<p>67. Nevertheless, the majority of technical assistance interventions were carried 
</p>
<p>out in emergency situations and were short<b>-</b>term. Sustainability and ownership of 
</p>
<p>the interventions proved to be a major challenge, both to those exercising their 
</p>
<p>rights and to those whose role it was to protect them. In addition, some 
</p>
<p>interventions by the international community were characterized by duplication 
</p>
<p>and competition and occasionally by a lack of coordination with other actors due 
</p>
<p>to the importance accorded by certain donors to specific issues or places or to the 
</p>
<p>desire for visibility and fund<b>-</b>seeking. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. There are still significant challenges in promoting and protecting human 
</p>
<p>rights that require sustained and strategic technical assistance from the 
</p>
<p>international community, as well as stronger coordination between international 
</p>
<p>partners and between stakeholders and the Government in identifying, 
</p>
<p>implementing and monitoring interventions &#8212; without forgetting to involve the 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries.<b> </b></p>
