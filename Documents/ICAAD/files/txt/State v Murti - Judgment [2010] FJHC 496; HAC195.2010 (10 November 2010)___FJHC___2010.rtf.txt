JUDGMENT

[1] The assessors have expressed unanimous opinions of guilty on all eight counts against the accused. I direct myself in accordance with the law and the evidence contained in my summing up. I closely observed the demeanour of the complainants when they gave evidence. They struck me to be genuine and truthful witnesses. I also observed the demeanour of the accused when he was cross- examined on his evidence.

[2] In my judgment the accused did not give truthful evidence. I accept the complainants' evidence and I reject the accused's evidence. I am satisfied of the accused's guilt on each count beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I accept the opinions of the assessors and convict the accused of all eight counts.
