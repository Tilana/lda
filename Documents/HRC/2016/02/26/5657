<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to 
Canada from 9 to 22 October 2007. The visit focused on four areas: homelessness; women and 
their right to adequate housing; Aboriginal populations; adequate housing and the possible 
impact of the 2010 Olympic Games on the right to adequate housing in Vancouver. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the State&#8217;s historically 
successful social housing programmes and commends a number of good practices. He notes with 
satisfaction that a majority of Canadian households are able to house themselves in the private 
market. As requested by his function, the Special Rapporteur focuses the remainder of the report 
and his recommendations on issues and sectors of the population that require the attention of the 
authorities.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur enumerates a number of factors impeding the effective 
implementation of the right to housing for all, including the non-recognition of a separate right to 
adequate housing, the absence of a definition of homelessness, the lack of a national housing 
strategy and issues resulting from the allocation of competencies to different levels of authority. 
The Special Rapporteur notes the concerns expressed about the rise in the number of the 
homeless and people in inadequate housing and living conditions, rising prices in the housing 
sector affecting an increasing number of people with various levels of income, and the decrease 
in public housing.  
</p>
<p> While referring and restating a number of recommendations addressed by other special 
procedures and treaty bodies to Canada, the Special Rapporteur concludes with a number of 
recommendations, including the need (a) to recognize the right to adequate housing by all levels 
of Government; (b) to adopt or amend legislation to protect the right to adequate housing; (c) to 
commit to a comprehensive national housing strategy with stable and long-term funding; (d) to 
adopt a comprehensive and coordinated national strategy for the reduction of homelessness and 
poverty; (e) to address the situation of Aboriginals in and off reserves through a comprehensive 
and coordinated housing strategy; (f) to refrain from any actions that could contravene the rights 
of Aboriginal peoples on Aboriginal land under claim until a settlement has been reached; and 
(g) to ensure equitable representation of all indigenous women in modern-day treaty negotiations 
and agreements. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission to 
Canada from 9 to 22 October 2007 to examine the status of realization of the right to adequate 
housing, particularly for the most vulnerable parts of the population. The visit focused 
particularly on four areas: homelessness, women and their right to adequate housing, Aboriginal 
peoples<b>1</b>&#8217; adequate housing and the potential impact of the 2010 Olympic Games on the right to 
adequate housing in Vancouver.  
</p>
<p>2. During the course of the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited urban and rural areas, 
including Montr&#233;al, Kahnawake territories, Edmonton, Little Buffalo and Lubicon, Vancouver, 
Musqueam territories, Toronto and Ottawa. The Special Rapporteur met with high-ranking 
federal and provincial officials as well as with representatives of Government agencies, 
including Mr. Michael Small, Assistant Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, Mr. Hector Goudreau, Minister of Employment and Immigration of Ontario, 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and to the 
Minister of International Co-operation.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with political parties&#8217; officials, including 
Mr. Jack Layton, leader of the New Democratic Party and with a large number of 
representatives of civil society organizations, community-based housing and homelessness 
service providers and representatives of Aboriginal peoples. He attended many public fora and 
received a large number of first hand testimonies. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of Canada for 
the invitation, the support it provided during and after the mission, including detailed 
information that has been crucial for the preparation of the report, and for its commitment to the 
constructive and frank dialogue that has been initiated. He regrets that time and report length 
constraints make it impossible to fully reflect in the report all comments received and hopes his 
successor and the Government will continue this productive dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Status of the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>5. Canada is a vast nation extending over 10 million square kilometres. Therefore, the State 
is faced with a wide range of difficulties and issues to secure adequate housing for all on its 
territory. According to the 2006 census, 81.1 per cent of the 31.6 million inhabitants live in 
urban areas of 10,000 population or more and just over half live in the ten largest urban areas. 
Based on the 2006 census, Canada has 12.4 million occupied dwelling units, of which 
55.3 per cent are single detached units. Most of this housing is privately owned, with about 
68.5 per cent of Canadian households owning the homes they occupy. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  In this report, the term &#8220;Aboriginal peoples&#8221; will refer to Indigenous peoples (Indians or &#8220;First 
</p>
<p>Nations&#8221;, Inuits and M&#233;tis) as this terminology is commonly used in Canada.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.3 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>6. Canada has ratified several international human rights instruments that recognize the right 
to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, creating 
obligations to take steps for the progressive realization of this right.  
</p>
<p>7. Canadian domestic law does not include any explicit recognition of the right to adequate 
housing - as an enforceable right or as a policy commitment. No such recognition is found in the 
Constitution Act of 1982, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in provincial 
or federal human rights legislation, in national, provincial or territorial housing legislation or in 
federal-provincial agreements. The rights contained in international human rights treaties ratified 
by Canada are not directly enforceable by domestic courts unless they have been incorporated 
into Canadian law by parliament or provincial legislatures. As such, the right to adequate 
housing as codified in article 11(1) of the ICESCR cannot be claimed on its own. Nevertheless, 
court decisions indicate that a ratified treaty that has not been incorporated into domestic law can 
and should be used to interpret domestic law. Courts have recognized that the broadly framed 
rights to equality and to &#8220;life, liberty and security of the person&#8221; in sections 15 and 7 of the 
Canadian Charter respectively provide considerable scope for courts to provide effective 
remedies to violations of the right to adequate housing in Canada.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>8. Federal and provincial/territorial human rights legislation, protects against discrimination 
in accommodation, and legislation which governs landlord-tenant relations provides procedural 
and substantive protections of security of tenure and other housing rights. Concerns have been 
raised both by treaty monitoring bodies and civil society about the need for enhanced protections 
in both of these areas. Accommodations that are not self-contained, or in which facilities are 
shared with the owner, are not covered by either type of legislation in most jurisdictions. In some 
provinces, security of tenure protection is almost non-existent. Moreover, there is no reference to 
the right to adequate housing as a guiding principle in any of this legislation. Private members&#8217; 
bills have been introduced in both the national Parliament (Bill C-382 - An Act to Provide for 
Secure, Adequate, Accessible and Affordable Housing for Canadians) and the Ontario 
Legislature (Bill 47 - Right to Housing Act, 2008) to explicitly incorporate the right to housing 
into domestic law.  
</p>
<p>9. In its 2006 review of the report submitted by Canada, the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, noted that most of its 1993 and 1998 recommendations have not been 
implemented, including &#8220;State&#8217;s restrictive interpretation of its obligations under ICESCR, in 
particular its position that it may implement legal obligations set forth in ICESCR by adopting 
specific measures and policies rather than by enacting legislation specifically recognizing 
economic, social and cultural rights, and consequent lack of awareness, in provinces and 
territories, of State&#8217;s legal obligations under ICESCR&#8221; as well as &#8220;lack of legal redress available 
to individuals when governments fail to implement ICESCR, resulting from insufficient 
coverage in domestic legislation of economic, social and cultural rights, as spelled out in 
</p>

<p>ICESCR; lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for these rights; practice of governments of 
urging upon their courts interpretation of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms denying 
protection of ICESCR rights, and inadequate availability of civil legal aid, particularly for 
economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Decentralized competencies and housing 
</b></p>
<p>10. Canada has a complex system of power sharing between three levels of government - 
federal (national), provincial/territorial, and local or municipal - with varying degrees of 
responsibility for environmental, financial, social and economic issues associated with housing 
and human settlements. For example, the federal government has taxation and monetary powers; 
plays an important role in relation to the financial services sector that funds most housing 
development, and in coordinating national standards related to housing and settlement activity; 
and is involved in income support and other aspects of social development.  
</p>
<p>11. Provincial and territorial governments are responsible for management of most of the 
resources within their boundaries, and they play a significant role in the provision of shelter and 
development of human settlements. They are responsible for the regulation of urban and rural 
development in most areas through planning legislation, and the regulation of building and 
housing standards through building and health codes. Most jurisdictions have laws and 
regulations in place which govern property transactions and landlord-tenant relationships. 
Provinces also administer land title and registration systems. Provinces and territories have 
primary responsibility for social housing, similar to other areas of social policy such as health, 
social services and education, and indeed, administer directly or indirectly most existing social 
housing programmes. 
</p>
<p>12. Municipal governments are established by, and are under the jurisdiction of, the provinces 
and territories. Municipalities have significant responsibilities relating to zoning, land and 
housing development, transportation, land use, and local infrastructure. In some larger 
metropolitan areas, two tiers of municipal government have been established (regional and 
local).  
</p>
<p>13. Most lands set aside for Aboriginals in Canada are subject to federal jurisdiction. Pursuant 
to the Indian Act, band councils have many local government powers. Other First Nation 
communities that are established through self-government agreements may enjoy wider powers. 
While Aboriginal people have a historic and treaty relationship with the federal government, an 
estimated 70 per cent of Aboriginal people live off reserve in urban, rural, remote and Northern 
communities. The Canadian Parliament recognized the special housing needs of Aboriginal 
people off-reserve in its 2005 budgetary legislation to create a series of affordable housing trust 
funds. One of the housing trust funds authorized by the 2005 legislation was a one-time payment

</p>
<p>of $300 million for off-reserve Aboriginal housing.<b>4</b> There has been no public accounting of the 
disposition of this funding, and at least $60 million allocated for off-reserve Aboriginal housing 
in the Province of Ontario remained unspent as of January 2009. 
</p>
<p>14. Canada has a history of cost-sharing social programmes for its non-aboriginal population 
which have provided an important framework for ensuring compliance with Canada&#8217;s 
obligations under international human rights law. For example, the Canada Assistance Act, in 
place for almost thirty years, required that provincial/territorial social assistance programmes 
provide assistance to those in need adequate to cover basic requirements including housing. This 
Act was revoked in 1996, however, and the adequacy requirement that was previously 
enforceable by courts has been lost.  
</p>
<p>15. In the area of housing, Canadian social programmes focus on providing subsidies for those 
who cannot afford adequate and suitable housing on their own. Cost-sharing arrangements 
involve federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments as well as the private and 
non-profit sectors. In its 1996 federal budget, the Canadian government announced a plan to 
transfer administration of most of its housing programmes to the provinces and territories. The 
federal government, in the transfer agreements, agreed to continue to fund existing 
commitments, but included a &#8220;step-out&#8221; provision in federal funding. 
</p>
<p>16. Municipal authorities are often on the forefront of requests related to adequate housing and 
have to deal with concrete situations. In his discussions with many of these authorities, the 
Special Rapporteur noted a perception that higher authorities have discharged their share of 
responsibility for providing adequate housing for the population to them, yet without providing 
them with adequate resources.  
</p>
<p>17. Provincial and territorial ministers responsible for housing have a tradition of regular, often 
annual meetings. Starting in the year 2000, the federal government joined with the provinces and 
territories for these national housing meetings. At their meeting in September of 2005, the 
provincial and territorial ministers issued guiding principles for future housing initiatives, and 
the federal government indicated its general support. Reportedly, since then little 
provincial/territorial ministers&#8217; joint work has been achieved.<b>5</b> 
18. Canada is one of the few countries in the world without a national housing strategy. The 
federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, along with civil society organizations 
(including the charitable sector) have introduced a series of one-time, short-term funding

</p>
<p>initiatives that have been described by housing experts in Canada as a &#8220;fraying patchwork&#8221;. This 
issue has been raised in various occasion including in the recent report by the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission (OHRC).<b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b>III.  GOOD PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>19. Adequate housing is increasingly recognized in Canada as a critical social determinant of 
health. Canada&#8217;s Chief Public Health Officer noted that the lack of adequate housing leads to a 
series of health concerns.<b>7</b> Public health authorities at the provincial and local levels across 
Canada have noted similar concerns. The Province of Ontario, through its health ministry, 
has committed to a &#8220;health equity&#8221; approach to health funding, and has identified housing - 
including supportive housing for those with special physical and mental health needs - as a key 
component.  
</p>
<p>20. In addition, adequate housing is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in a strong and 
competitive economy. A variety of Canadian business organizations (starting with the major 
chartered bank, TD Bank Financial Group)<b>8</b> have identified the economic importance of 
adequate housing in providing a good home for Canada&#8217;s diverse working population. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  State programmes and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>21. Funding for low-income and social housing goes back to initiatives in the late 1940s. 
Canada&#8217;s successful social housing programme was launched with amendments to the National 
Housing Act in 1973 and provided funding and financial backing through a variety of 
mechanisms to community-based non-profit, municipal non-profit, and resident-owned 
non-profit co-operatives. It produced more than half a million homes for low income people.<b>9</b> 
The programme provided capital subsidies to get the housing built and operating subsidies to 
ensure that a varying number of the units would be affordable to low and moderate-income 
households. The programme also provided financial guarantees to financial institutions so that 
non-profit developers could also access conventional financing.<b>10</b>

</p>
<p>22. Canada has a significant number of programmes relating to housing that are funded by the 
authorities at federal, provincial and municipal levels. Due to funding, programme and 
legislative differences in various parts of the country, the overall effect seems uneven and 
disorganized. Similarly, it has also been argued that lack of a national and coordinated national 
strategy on affordable housing or homelessness has led to high costs with little concrete impact 
on the situation. These concerns have also been expressed by local authorities.<b>11</b>  
</p>
<p>23. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit a number of centers 
and shelters accommodating homeless people, women fleeing from violence, Aboriginal women, 
persons living with HIV-AIDS, children with disabilities, and those suffering from drug 
addictions that were fully or partially funded by State programmes. 
</p>
<p>24. Starting in the mid 1980s, the federal government initiated a series of cuts in funding for 
the national housing programmes. In 1993, the federal government cancelled funding for new 
affordable housing under the 1973 initiative. In 1996, the federal government announced plans to 
transfer administration of most existing federal housing programes to the provinces and 
territories and in 1999, the federal government amended the National Housing Act with the 
stated goal of giving Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation more flexibility. It seems 
nevertheless that CMHC&#8217;s role in supporting new and existing affordable housing has continued 
to diminish. In recent years, CMHC has been engaged in providing mortgage insurance to 
property owners and has generated annual profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>25. In 1999, the federal government created the National Homelessness Initiative (NHI) to 
fund transitional housing and a range of services for homeless people in more than 
60 communities across the country. At the same time, the federal government increased the 
funding for Canada&#8217;s national housing rehabilitation programme. The funding for both these 
important housing initiatives was renewed three times, most recently for two years starting in 
December of 2006. In 2001, the federal government funded a one-time-only payment to a new 
affordable housing initiative (cost-shared with the provinces and territories and others) for a total 
federal commitment of $1 billion over eight years. In 2005, the federal Parliament authorized a 
one-time only payment of $1.6 billion in affordable housing funding, and $1.4 billion of this 
amount was allocated by the federal government starting in 2006. There seems to be a lack of 
information on these expenditures, including on the number of houses produced and the shelter 
costs the new housing. The Special Rapporteur commends the recent decision to earmark 
funding for housing and homelessness for five years and hopes that federal investments in 
housing will increase and be maintained.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>26. Some Provincial authorities have tried to find innovative solution to address inadequate 
housing and homelessness. For instance, the city of Montreal supported the creation of a legal 
clinic and a special prosecutor at Municipal Court in charge of problems linked to homelessness.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur also noted with interest Canada&#8217;s housing system&#8217;s concept of 
&#8220;housing continuum&#8221;, while noting the complexity that can result from the role played by 
multiple agencies.<b>13</b> This approach responds to different housing needs and preferences with a 
range of options, from temporary housing to permanent forms of accommodation, including 
homeownership. The &#8220;continuum&#8221; starts with those who face housing emergencies and the most 
severe situations, including the homeless and people who have lost their homes due to factors 
such as domestic violence. The &#8220;housing continuum&#8221; approach calls for them to be assisted to 
move on to more dignified and permanent forms of housing. The subsidized housing part of the 
housing continuum deals mainly with people who cannot afford to pay market rates for their 
housing. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada has primary responsibility for 
homelessness while CMHC provides most of the funding to subsidize housing. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Constitutional and human rights protections 
</b></p>
<p>28. Human rights in housing have been significantly advanced by the adoption of the Charter 
of Rights and by expansive protections from discrimination in federal and provincial/territorial 
human rights acts. Nevertheless, only Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador human rights 
legislation refer to social and economic rights. While it does not explicitly mention the right to 
adequate housing, Quebec&#8217;s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms guarantees to every person 
in need &#8220;the right for himself and his family to measures of financial assistance and to social 
measures provided for by law, susceptible of ensuring such person an acceptable standard of 
living.&#8221; (article 45). In 2006, Newfoundland and Labrador amended its Human Rights Code to 
include &#8220;source of income&#8221; as a specified prohibited ground upon which a person should not be 
denied occupancy of a commercial unit or a self-contained dwelling unit.  
</p>
<p>29. Given the absence of explicit provisions in Canadian law guaranteeing the right to 
adequate housing, the interpretation of the open-ended provisions of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms is critical for giving domestic effect to this right in Canada. Denial of the 
right to adequate housing to marginalized, disadvantaged groups in Canada clearly assaults 
fundamental rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, even if the Charter does not 
explicitly refer to the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>30. In a recent decision, Justice Ross recognizes that a significant number of people in the City 
of Victoria have no choice but to sleep outside in the City&#8217;s parks or streets. She states that the 
City&#8217;s Bylaw prohibition on erecting shelter is in effect at all times, in all public places in the 
City, and imposes upon those homeless persons, who are among the most vulnerable and 
marginalized of the City&#8217;s residents, significant and potentially severe additional health risks.

</p>
<p>She also states that &#8220;sleep and shelter are necessary preconditions to any kind of security, liberty 
or human flourishing&#8221; thus &#8220;that the prohibition on taking a temporary abode contained in the 
Bylaws and operational policy constitutes an interference with the life, liberty and security of the 
person of these homeless people.&#8221;<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>31. Human rights legislation in Canada affirms that equality for disadvantaged groups often 
requires governments or private actors to adopt positive measures to address the needs of 
disadvantaged groups. This principle offers important potential for providing effective remedies 
with respect to the right to adequate housing in Canada. Jurisprudence under human rights 
legislation in Canada has also broken new ground internationally in its recognition and 
prohibition of discrimination on the basis of poverty or income level in housing. Discrimination 
on the basis of poverty has been found to deny women, single mothers, social assistance 
recipients and other disadvantaged groups access to the most affordable rental housing or to 
affordable credit for homeownership.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the current review in Quebec if the effectiveness and 
enforceability of social and economic rights in its human rights legislation and also the work of 
the Ontario Human Rights Commission in relation to the right to adequate housing.<b>15</b> It is hoped 
that all human rights bodies in Canada will devote increasing attention to the crisis of 
homelessness and inadequate housing and seek effective remedies. 
</p>
<p>33. It appears that no action has been taken in response to the repeated recommendations of the 
CESCR to include economic, social and cultural rights in the Canadian Human Rights Act and in 
provincial/territorial human rights legislation. The exclusion of rights such as the right to 
adequate housing from the statutory mandate of national human rights institutions is of particular 
concern in view of the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative of the City of Montreal leading to the 
adoption of the Montreal Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. It contains 
commitments to ensure access to affordable and appropriate housing and recognizes the need for 
effective remedies by including a complaints mechanism to an ombudsperson. The Special 
Rapporteur hopes this practice will be replicated elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur was particularly impressed by the amount and quality of the work 
that is carried out by civil society organizations, service providers and academics on adequate 
housing using a human rights perspective.

<p>36. He also noted that civil society organizations and service providers are overwhelmed and 
facing great stress in their work and often heavily relying on voluntary contributions. Given the 
very high quality of research and academic work on housing, there is room for authorities in 
charge of programmes and policies to further use these elements in their work. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCERNS RELATED TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information received from the Government 
that 80 per cent of Canadian households are able to house themselves in the private market. The 
Special Rapporteur will focus his comments on the most vulnerable people and groups, those 
whose rights are allegedly denied, and on issues that may become problematic in the future for 
other parts of the population.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Affordability and core housing need 
</b></p>
<p>38. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) has established a definition of people 
living in &#8220;core housing need&#8221;. A household is said to be in core housing need if its housing falls 
below at least one of the adequacy, affordability or suitability, standards and it would have to 
spend 30 per cent or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative 
local housing that is acceptable (meets all three standards).<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>39. A household is not in core housing need if its housing meets all of the adequacy, suitability 
and affordability standards or if its housing does not meet one or more of these standards, but it 
has sufficient income to obtain alternative local housing that is acceptable (meets all three 
standards). In 2001, nationally there were an estimated 1.5 million households in core housing 
need, representing about 13.7 per cent of all households in Canada. 
</p>
<p>40. Statistics Canada reports that three million Canadian households - 24.9 per cent of the 
overall - are paying 30 per cent or more of their income on shelter. Spending 30 per cent or more 
of household income on shelter can potentially jeopardize the amount of money available for 
food, medicine, energy, transportation, childcare and other necessities, particularly for low 
income households. Income and shelter cost data from Canada&#8217;s 2006 Census released in May 
and June of 2008 seem to confirm the testimonies that the Special Rapporteur received during his 
fact-finding mission.<b>17</b>  
</p>
<p>41. The high number of households paying 30 per cent or more of income on shelter is due to 
the fact that shelter costs have increased 18.5 per cent from 2001 to 2006, which is substantially 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  Adequate dwellings are those reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs. - 
</p>
<p>Affordable dwellings cost less than 30 per cent of total before-tax household income. Suitable 
dwellings have enough bedrooms for the size and make-up of resident households, according to 
National Occupancy Standard (NOS) requirements.

</b></p>

Costs&#8221;, 2006 Census, p. 22, http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/shelter/

</p>
<p>higher than the inflation rate of 11.26 per cent over those same years.<b>18</b> Meanwhile, Statistics 
Canada reports that over that same time period, median earnings for the bottom 20 per cent of 
working Canadians fell by 3.1 per cent. Statistics Canada also reported that over the past quarter 
century, median earnings for the bottom 20 per cent of working Canadians fell by 20.6 per cent - 
in the face of large increases in the costs of shelter, energy, medicine, transportation, clothing, 
food and other necessities. At the same time, social assistance rates across the country are 
decreasing. Between 1989 and 2005, when the cost of living rose by 43 per cent, social 
assistance benefit rates declined in both absolute and relative terms in all provinces, except 
Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. As a result of cuts to benefits, welfare incomes stand 
at their lowest level since the mid-1980s. None of the provinces have welfare incomes that match 
Statistic Canada&#8217;s Low Income Cut Offs.<b>19</b> Indeed, in 2006, welfare incomes of single women 
averaged 40 per cent of this poverty line. 
</p>
<p>42. This situation puts additional pressure on households, especially on those already facing 
payment problems.<b>20</b> In Ontario, 66,746 renter households received applications for eviction in 
2006, an increase of 21 per cent since 1998, the year the tenant protection and rent regulation 
laws were substantially eroded. No official statistics on the number of person evicted is 
released.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Erosion of housing affordability is strong amongst tenant households, whose incomes are, 
on average, less than half of the household incomes of owner households in Canada. Despite 
increases in homeownership, recent private sector surveys have also pointed to growing 
affordability problems for this category.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>44. As the definition of core housing need is more restrictive than the human rights definition 
of adequate housing, the number of people living in inadequate housing may be higher than the 
available figures. For instance, General Comment 4 on the right to adequate housing in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, lists seven important aspects to

</b>  Idem, p. 21. 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  Statistics Canada does not measure poverty but defines a set of income cut-offs below which 
</p>
<p>people may be said to live in straitened circumstances, commonly seen as poverty lines (The 
Canadian Fact Book on Poverty 2000, by David P. Ross, Katherine J. Scott and Peter J. Smith, 
Canadian Council on Social Development, 2000, Chapter 2).

<p>this right.<b>23</b> In addition to affordability and habitability (which are contained in the core housing 
need definition), the key aspects include legal security of tenure, access to services, accessibility, 
location and cultural adequacy. There are no national statistics on this more complete definition 
of adequate housing. Therefore the number of households in inadequate housing may be much 
larger than the core housing need numbers indicate.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Public housing 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur observed a shortage of social housing stock across the country, 
despite significant construction during the period from 1973 to 1993. While 40 per cent of 
all housing in the Netherlands is social housing, 22 per cent in the United Kingdom and 
Sweden, 14 per cent in Germany, France and Ireland, and 10 per cent in Finland, Canada has 
only 5 per cent of its overall housing stock as social housing.<b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>46. The low level of new rental housing starts has been a consistent pattern for almost three 
decades, according to research studies. Since most low and moderate-income households cannot 
afford to enter the home ownership market, the small number of new rental construction has 
been identified as a cause for concern. According to rental market surveys from CMHC, the new 
rental housing tends to have rents higher than those of existing rental housing. Rent regulation 
legislation to protect rental housing affordability is under the jurisdiction of provincial 
governments, but there is an uneven system of rent regulation. In 1998, Ontario moved from rent 
regulation to &#8220;vacancy decontrol&#8221;, which places no control on the rent for a vacant unit. A 
relatively high mobility in the tenant population moving from one rental unit to another, as well 
as tenant evictions applications that have reached more than 60,000 annually,<b>25</b> means that a 
significant number of rental units become vacant annually and fall outside the rental regulation 
legislation. Other legislation to protect the legal security of tenure - including eviction legislation 
and legislation to control the demolition and conversion of rental properties - varies considerably 
from province to province and, in many parts of the country, is non-existent.  
</p>
<p>47. Metropolitan Toronto&#8217;s non-profit co-operative housing was recognized as a &#8220;global best 
practice&#8221; at the time of Habitat II. Most of the country&#8217;s co-op housing was built with the 
support of the national housing programme from 1973 to 1993, although some co-ops were built 
before this period and a number have been built in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec under 
provincial programmes. Specific issues facing housing co-operatives include repair issues for 
so-called &#8220;leaky&#8221; co-ops in British Columbia that were built to low standards; financing issues 
for co-ops funded under specific federal programme; and ongoing concerns about preserving 
and enhancing affordability through additional housing subsidies for lower income households 
living in co-ops. The federal government has recognized the positive experience of housing

</b>  The Special Rapporteur identified other specific and additional factors affecting the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing (see A/HRC/7/16, para. 5).

</p>
<p>co-operatives by agreeing to transfer administration of co-op housing programmes to an 
independent third sector agency that draws on the significant expertise of the Canadian 
co-operative housing movement. There has been relatively little new co-op housing built in 
Canada in recent years with the loss of federal and provincial housing funding.  
</p>
<p>48. The latest figures from Statistics Canada&#8217;s Survey of Government Revenue and 
Expenditures (based on the fiscal year ending in March of 2008) reveals a 43 per cent cut in 
federal housing spending over the previous year, dropping from $3.5 billion in 2007 to $2.01 
billion in 2008. Federal housing spending in 2008 is at its lowest level since 2003. Combined 
provincial and territorial housing spending increased from $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, mainly 
due to an increase of $260 million in housing spending recorded in the Province of Alberta from 
2007 to 2008. Most other provinces and territories did not add new housing dollars, despite the 
evidence of growing housing need across the country. 
</p>
<p>49. According to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, &#8220;CMHC estimates Canada will 
need 45,000 new rental units each year for the next 10 years just to keep up with current demand; 
at least half of these will have to be affordable units. At the same time, construction of new 
rental units has plummeted from 25,000 to fewer than 15,400 per year in the last decade. 
Demolition and conversion eats away at the affordable rental stock, while many affordable 
houses crumble.&#8221;<b>26</b> Some government officials expressed their concerns about the progressive 
&#8220;ghettoization&#8221; of public housing to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>50. Despite the legal prohibition of discrimination with respect to housing, investigations into 
social and private housing in Canada reveal the persistence of discrimination against some 
groups, including on the basis of race, country of origin, sex, age, marital status, family status, 
sexual orientation, disability and social condition (including poverty and reliance on social 
assistance).<b>27</b>  
</p>
<p>51. Many landlords operating in the private market continue to engage in discriminatory 
practices such as: screening-out tenants based on their social condition, source of income or 
because they receive social assistance; refusing to rent to single mothers, families with children; 
precluding young people and new immigrants from accessing accommodation because of their 
inability to provide landlord references, credit history, and substantial work history; refusing to 
accommodate persons with disabilities; and denying accommodation to 16 and 17 year olds 
living independently of parents.

</p>
<p>52. Figures indicate that some sectors of the population are disproportionately affected by 
inadequate housing conditions. Statistics Canada reports that immigrants face higher shelter 
costs (and lower incomes) than the Canadian-born population.<b>28</b>  
</p>
<p><b>V.  HOMELESSNESS 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the significant number of homeless in all 
parts of the country and by the fact that the Government could not provide reliable statistics on 
the number of homeless. During the mission, he came across particularly severe situations such 
as in Downtown Eastside in Vancouver. 
</p>
<p>54. It has been stated that the widespread and rapid growth of homelessness in Canada since 
the mid-1990s is unprecedented since World War II.<b>29</b> While the Homelessness Partnering 
Secretariat has estimated that there might be 150,000 homeless people across Canada, other 
experts have suggested that the actual number may be twice as large.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>55. While the issue has been under discussion for a long time, Canada still doesn&#8217;t have an 
official definition of homelessness.<b>31</b> The Special Rapporteur is of the view that reaching an 
agreed definition of homelessness that includes a deep understanding of the systemic causes of 
homelessness is the first step to address the issue and is of crucial importance to draw efficient 
and cost-effective programmes.  
</p>
<p>56. The heavy impact of inadequate housing and homelessness on health and life has been 
documented.<b>32</b> As early as 1999, the Human Rights Committee expressed concern that 
homelessness had led to serious health problems and even to death in Canada. It recommended 
&#8220;that the State party take positive measures required by article 6 to address this serious

<p>  See for instance, Parliamentary Research Branch, Homelessness, January 1999, PRB 99-1E 
(http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca). The parliamentary study makes a distinction between two 
categories of homeless persons: (a) visibly homeless: sleep on the streets and in places not 
designed for habitation and (b) invisibly homeless: live in substandard housing or people double 
up with others, sometimes even illegally, to escape living on the street. It also characterizes 
different types of homelessness: chronically homeless group; cyclically homeless group; 
temporarily homeless group and at risk of homelessness.

<p>problem.&#8221;<b>33</b> The federal government has committed a one-time-only allocation of $22 million per 
year for five years for a pilot project that will address mental health and homelessness.  
57. While there are no reliable national numbers on homelessness, local surveys in 
communities like Calgary,<b>34</b> Vancouver, Edmonton and Ottawa all report that homelessness 
continues to be on the rise.<b>35</b> The city of Victoria states that &#8220;pressures on the streets of Victoria 
are reaching a breaking point. Victoria needs a community-owned solution to end homelessness 
for its residents.&#8221;<b>36</b> So-called &#8220;tent cities&#8221; are another manifestation of homelessness in various 
locations throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>58. Nunavut is the only Canadian jurisdiction with a minister for homelessness. The federal 
government named a cabinet minister with responsibility for homelessness in 1999, but in 2008, 
that responsibility is one of several assigned to the federal Human Resources and Skills 
Development Canada. In some provinces, the responsibility for homeless services is scattered 
among a variety of departments, including health, social services, housing, corrections, education 
and policing. This situation, it is argued, can result in a lack of coordination of services and 
uneven service levels for different populations in different parts of the country.  
</p>
<p>59. In its most recent review of Canada&#8217;s periodic report, the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights called upon &#8220;federal, provincial and territorial governments to address 
homelessness and inadequate housing as national emergency by reinstating or increasing, where 
necessary, social housing programmes for those in need, improving and properly enforcing 
anti-discrimination legislation in the field of housing, increasing shelter allowances and social 
assistance rates to realistic levels, and providing adequate support services for persons with 
disabilities&#8221;.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p>60. The CESCR has also called on Canada to &#8220;implement a national strategy for reduction of 
homelessness that includes measurable goals and timetables, consultation and collaboration with 
affected communities, complaints procedures, and transparent accountability mechanisms, in 
keeping with ICESCR standards&#8221;.<b>38 </b>

<p>61. Several Canadian provinces have announced a commitment to implement a comprehensive 
poverty reduction strategy, including specific plans to target homelessness and housing 
insecurity. Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec, both have plans in place; and Ontario has 
announced in December the outline of its poverty reduction plan restricted to children. 
</p>
<p>62. The lack of action to address homelessness has a high cost for society not only in moral 
but also in financial terms. Studies have also attempted to quantify the financial impact of 
homelessness and housing insecurity. For instance, it is estimated that it costs taxpayers 
more than $50,000 per year to support each homeless resident in British Columbia<b>39</b> and $4.5 
and $6 billion annually for an estimated 150,000 homeless in Canada.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  WOMEN&#8217;S RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b>63. The lack of adequate and secure housing particularly impacts women who are 
disproportionally affected by poverty, homelessness, housing affordability problems, violence 
and discrimination in the private rental market.<b>41</b> During his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard 
many testimonies from women concerning their inadequate living conditions including derelict 
and overcrowded houses, and insufficient social assistance entitlements to meet the cost of 
housing and other living expenses, the lack of shelter spaces for homeless women and women 
fleeing violence.<b>42</b> Sexual abuse is a major cause and consequence of homelessness among 
young women. A recent study found that 1 in 5 homeless women interviewed reported having 
been sexually assaulted while on the streets or homeless.<b>43</b>  
</p>
<p>64. In some places across the country women attempting to leave abusive situations are either 
not given priority status for subsidized or government assisted housing or priority status is 
difficult to attain due to bureaucratic requirements that are hard to meet. With few housing 
options, women are given little choice but to return to abusive households, move from place to 
place (&#8220;couch surf&#8221;) among family and friends, or take a chance at the streets - all while running 
the risk of apprehension of their children by child protection agencies. Once a woman loses her

<p>children, it is very difficult for her to get them back. Her welfare entitlement is reduced making 
adequate accommodation (essential to get her children back) inaccessible.<b>44</b> The Ontario Human 
Rights Commission stated that it was &#8220;extremely troubled to hear that children in Ontario 
continue to be relinquished or apprehended by children&#8217;s aid societies because of inadequate 
housing - concerns that were previously noted by the CESCR.&#8221;<b>45</b> Despite efforts in this field, 
shelters are inexistent in some parts of Canada and shelter operators report that they cannot cope 
with the demand.  
</p>
<p>65. A 2006 CMHC-funded research report entitled &#8220;Housing Discrimination against Victims 
of Domestic Violence&#8221; found that discrimination against battered women by landlords exists. 
This builds on earlier research which found that women may face discrimination based on 
factors such as gender, ethnicity, and marital and social status. For example, landlords or 
property managers might refuse to rent to teenage mothers or low-income or visibly minority 
women. As in many places, women&#8217;s housing conditions and homelessness are related to 
poverty.<b>46</b> Statistics indicate that female-headed single parent families have the lowest incomes 
compared to other types of families. Women earn on average 30 per cent less than men for 
similar work.<b>47</b> Aboriginal lone-parent mothers have a poverty rate of 73 per cent. Lone parent 
families headed by women earned less than 60 per cent of the income of male-headed lone 
parent families in 2003.<b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>66. Women&#8217;s poverty has combined with the escalating costs of housing. In 2003, 72 per cent 
of unattached women aged 65 and over who rented were considered to have housing 
affordability problems, as did 42 per cent of renter families headed by lone mothers and 38 per 
cent of unattached female renters under the age of 65. 
</p>
<p>67. Because the majority of low-income women are tenants, access to affordable rental 
housing is central to addressing women&#8217;s homelessness. The federal government responsibility 
transfer for social housing programmes to the provinces/territories seems to have been made 
without ensuring equal benefit of federal spending in this area for women. Women are more 
likely than men to meet income qualifications for social housing and therefore more adversely 
affected by cuts to assisted housing.

<p>68. The inadequacy of supply of subsidized housing in relation to needs has generated waiting 
lists in largest cities exceeding 5 years, or even 10 years in Toronto. This prevents section of the 
population, including migrants, from accessing subsidized housing. Because of the shortage in 
subsidized housing, women have to rely on the private rental market, where they are often 
confronted with discriminatory practices mentioned above.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  ABORIGINAL PEOPLES&#8217; RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b>69. The Aboriginal peoples (Indians or &#8220;First Nations&#8221;, Inuits and M&#233;tis) of Canada make up 
approximately four per cent of the national population. Approximately half of the Aboriginal 
population lives in urban areas; the rest live in communities on or near what remains of their 
traditional lands across the entire country. First Nations&#8217; remaining lands - where collective title 
is clearly recognized - are called &#8220;reserves&#8221; and administered under the federal Indian 
Act. Inuits and M&#233;tis, as well as some Indians, do not live on reserves.<b>49</b> This system can lead 
to concerns in relation to ownership, possession, transfers, and management of lands on 
reserve.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>70. The federal government has accepted responsibility under the Indian Act and other 
legislation and programmes for Aboriginal people living on federal recognized reserves, 
including housing programmes. The 2009 federal budget contains a one-time-only allocation 
of $400 for on-reserve Aboriginal housing. The federal government provides an annual subsidy 
of $272 million for on-reserve Aboriginal housing. However, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed about the significant on-reserve housing problems in every part of the country. In 
addition, with a majority of Aboriginal people living in urban areas or in areas where their claim 
to land is not yet recognized, neither the federal government, nor the provinces or territories, 
accepts responsibility for funding Aboriginal housing initiatives. Aboriginal people are told that 
they have to compete with non-Aboriginal groups for any available housing or other funding. As 
already noted, since funding cuts of the 1990s and the transfer of administration of most federal 
housing programmes to the provinces and territories starting in 1996, there has only been a 
limited number of short-term, one-time funding initiatives for Aboriginal people living off 
reserve (except for the one-time allocation of $300 million in 2005). The practical effect is that 
very little new Aboriginal housing off-reserve has been funded in recent years, even though local 
studies in cities as diverse as Toronto and Edmonton show that a very significant number of 
people who are homeless are of Aboriginal ancestry.&#8221;<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>71. In his mission report to Canada, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples expressed concerns about the housing situation 
of Aboriginal peoples.<b>52</b> The Special Rapporteur recommended to the Government that it

<p>intensify measures to close the human development indicator gap between Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal Canadians, including on housing, that adequate housing in a large number of 
Aboriginal communities be declared a priority objective and that adequate credits, investment 
and other resources be appropriated to solve this urgent problem within the shortest possible time 
frame. 
</p>
<p>72. Overcrowded and inadequate housing conditions, as well as difficulties accessing basic 
services, including water and sanitation, are major problems for Aboriginal peoples. These 
challenges have been identified for many years<b>53</b> but progress has been very slow leaving entire 
communities in poor living conditions for decades.  
</p>
<p>73. Current figures on access to clean water are difficult to find, but the 2001 Aboriginal 
Peoples&#8217; Survey reported that 16 per cent of Aboriginal people in urban areas said that there 
were times of the year when their water was contaminated, and the number grew to 19 per cent 
among Aboriginal people in rural areas.<b>54</b> In Canada&#8217;s North, 34 per cent of Inuit people reported 
that there were times of the year when their water was contaminated.<b>55</b> In April 2008, Indian and 
Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) announced one-time funding of $165 million annually over 
two years to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation in First Nations communities. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur visited the Lubicon Lake territory to assess the situation in an area 
on which the Human Rights Committee (HRC) took a decision back in 1990.<b>56</b> In 2006, both the 
HRC and CESCR recommended that the Canadian authorities resume negotiations with Lubicon 
Lake Band and consult with Band before granting licences for economic exploitation of disputed 
land.<b>57</b>  
</p>
<p>75. During his field visit, the Special Rapporteur witnessed the poor living and housing 
conditions in this area. The community does not receive adequate basic services or access to 
water. Because of the non-resolved status of these lands, federal and provincial authorities do not 
agree on their competencies and responsibilities.

<p>76. Moreover, various extractive industries - such as TransCanada Pipeline - continue to work 
and to develop their activities on the territory under claim. These activities, which seem in 
contradiction with treaty bodies&#8217; recommendations and the right to self-determination and 
control over natural resources of this community, they have a direct impact on the human rights, 
including adequate housing of these communities because of the water and air pollution they 
generate and critical land area taken away from the communities.  
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  ABORIGINAL WOMEN&#8217;S RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b>77. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur met with many aboriginal women and 
associations. Aboriginal women face some of the most severe housing conditions and challenges 
in the country - whether they live off or on reserve or in rural, urban, northern or remote 
communities. Aboriginal women are often forced to relocate to urban areas as a result of 
circumstances beyond their control. Major issues affecting Aboriginal women include family and 
matrimonial real property laws on reserves, overcrowding, violence and homelessness. 
Aboriginal women with disabilities suffer from further barriers to affordable housing, both on 
and off reserve. 
</p>
<p>78. Studies show that Aboriginal women face a much higher rate of gender violence than 
non-Aboriginal women.<b>58</b> This includes violence in the family as well as racially motivated 
attacks carried out often with impunity in the larger society. The lack of protective legislation for 
women living on reserves, similar to that available to those living off reserve, constitutes an 
important barrier to the enjoyment of the right to housing and to a life free of violence. There are 
also concerns about the absence of emergency and transitional shelter on most reserves, which 
are even more pronounced in northern communities where geographic isolation is also a factor. 
</p>
<p>79. On reserve, housing concerns for Aboriginal women include gender discrimination as a 
consequence of the operation of the <i>Indian Act</i>, including the lack of matrimonial property 
protection. In all provinces and territories, legislation governing marital breakdown provides for 
equal sharing of assets between spouses; often, the main family asset being the house. Due to the 
constitutional division of powers, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that provincial 
legislation does not apply in cases where real property on reserve is affected by such breakdown. 
Some First Nations have adopted rules in regard to matrimonial property division. Yet, neither 
the <i>Indian</i> <i>Act </i>nor any federal legislation provides for a division of property on reserve upon 
marital breakdown. Such a legislative void results in dramatic results. In some cases, women - 
and their children - are forced to choose between staying in a bad and/or violent situation or 
leaving the matrimonial home. Often, the choice to leave results in the woman and her children  
</p>
<p>

</b>  See for example Douglas A. Brownridge, &#8220;Male partner violence against aboriginal women in 
</p>

</p>
<p>being forced to leave their community and/or become homeless.<b>59</b> While this has been discussed 
on many occasions,<b>60</b> debates are still on-going and little progress has been made the <i>Indian Act</i> 
has not yet been amended.<b>61</b>  
</p>
<p>80. In urban areas, the key housing concerns include discrimination in access to safe, quality, 
affordable, appropriate housing and insufficient emergency and transitional housing designed to 
meet the distinct needs of Aboriginal women.  
</p>
<p>81. Lack of affordable housing is impacted by and can lead to the criminalization of 
Aboriginal women. In their attempts to find and secure affordable housing with limited incomes, 
Indigenous women are at risk of exploitation by some landlords and gangs. Additionally, without 
affordable housing Aboriginal women face the threat of having their children apprehended by the 
state into the child welfare system.  
</p>
<p>82. The Federal Government has recognized the urgent need to provide for shelter for First 
Nations Women and their children on reserves fleeing from violence.<b>62</b> In 2007, the federal 
government announced one-time funding of approximately $5 million per year for five years 
for 35 shelters. However, these efforts seem to fall far short of what is needed to address the 
magnitude of the problem.  
</p>
<p><b>IX.  PREPARATION FOR THE OLYMPICS IN VANCOUVER 
</b></p>
<p>83. Mega-events, such as the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup or the Commonwealth Games, 
have been seen to impact enjoyment of the right to adequate housing. Although these events 
have many positive aspects for the host country, studies also show that they can trigger 
speculation and rapid increase in housing prices, lead to forced evictions to make way for the 
construction of infrastructure, city beautification or even criminalization of the homeless in areas 
near the events.<b>63</b>

</p>
<p>84. In the context of efforts to work with the International Olympic Committee to prevent any 
negative impact on the right to adequate housing the Special Rapporteur took the opportunity 
of his mission to look on the preparations taking place in Vancouver for the 2010 Olympic 
Games. 
</p>
<p>85. Vancouver has been an innovative city, incorporating in its bid the Inner-City Inclusive 
Commitment Statement, developed by inner-city community organizations and Government 
agencies, which seeks to address issues related to housing, civil liberties and public safety, health 
and social services, environment and transportation, to ensure accessible and affordable Games. 
The Special Rapporteur met with the CEO of Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 
Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) who expressed his commitment to ensure 
that the Games would contribute to improve the housing conditions of the poor as a positive 
legacy. 
</p>
<p>86. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the VANOC commitment, he remains concerned 
by information he received on the impact that the preparation for the Olympics could have on 
low-income housing residents, and particularly on low-income single resident hotel units 
situated in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood. Non-Governmental organizations estimated 
that since July 2003, Vancouver has lost more than 1400 low-income housing units which 
have been renovated or converted. Although the Olympics cannot be considered as the unique 
cause, the real estate speculation generated by the Olympics would appear to be a contributing 
cause. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about information he has received that the City 
of Vancouver is funding private security guards whose duties include moving the street homeless 
and those panhandling out of commercial areas. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about 
reports concerning ticketing homeless individuals for bylaw violations and seizure of their 
property in the lead up to the Games. 
</p>
<p><b>X.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that the legal recognition of the right to adequate 
housing is an essential first step for any State to implement the human rights to adequate 
housing of the people under its protection. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur strongly 
recommends that the right to adequate housing be recognized in federal and provincial 
legislations as an inherent part of the Canadian legal system. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>In line with previous recommendations made by the CESCR, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that human rights legislation in all Canadian jurisdictions be amended to 
fully include economic, social and cultural rights and that they be included in the mandates 
of all human rights bodies. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls for Canada to adopt a comprehensive and coordinated 
national housing policy based on indivisibility of human rights and the protection of the 
most vulnerable. This national strategy should include measurable goals and timetables, 
consultation and collaboration with affected communities, complaints procedures, and 
transparent accountability mechanisms. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.3 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur also supports the recommendation of the CESCR that 
homelessness and inadequate housing in Canada be addressed by reinstating or increasing, 
where necessary, social housing programmes for those in need, improving and properly 
enforcing anti-discrimination legislation in the field of housing, increasing shelter 
allowances and social assistance rates to realistic levels, and providing adequate support 
services for persons with disabilities&#8221;.64 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In order to design efficient policies and programmes, federal, provincial and 
territorial authorities should work in close collaboration and coordination and they should 
commit stable and long-term funding to a comprehensive national housing strategy. 
Federal, provincial and territorial authorities should also collaborate with authorities that 
are the closest to the need of the population such as municipal authorities, service providers 
and civil society organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The authorities should take advantage of the outstanding level of academic analysis of 
right to housing issues available in Canada to implement the detailed recommendations 
contained in the Ontario Human Rights Commission report. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The definition of &#8220;core housing need&#8221; should be revised to include all the elements of 
the right to adequate housing and the federal government should collect reliable statistical 
data on all such dimensions.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The federal government, along with the provinces and territories, should commit the 
necessary funding and resources to ensure access to potable water and proper sanitation. 
This is a particularly acute issue for Aboriginal people, both on-reserve and off-reserve, 
and Aboriginal people should be directly involved in the design, development and 
operation of appropriate water systems. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Canada should adopt a national strategy on affordable housing that engages all levels 
of government including Aboriginal governments, Aboriginal people, civil society and the 
private sector. The strategy will require permanent and adequate funding and legislation 
set within a rights-based framework.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Canada may need to embark again on large scale building of social housing. It should 
also consider providing subsidies including housing allowances or access to other 
cost-effective ways in order for low-income households to meet their housing needs.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Federal Government should work with the provinces and territories to ensure 
there is a consistent framework of tenant protection law that meets the standards required 
by human rights obligations.

</p>
<p>99. <b>Discriminatory practices in housing should be addressed by ensuring that victims 
have access to legal representation and, where a quick settlement is not reached, prompt 
access to hearings and remedies. Systemic and widespread discrimination should be 
investigated by human rights commissions and legal and practical solution implemented. 
Specific funding should be directed to groups particularly vulnerable to discrimination 
including women, Aboriginal people, the elderly, people with mental or physical 
disabilities, youth and migrants, to ensure they can challenge housing discrimination 
effectively.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the federal authorities to adopt an official definition of 
homelessness and to gather reliable statistics in order to develop a coherent and concerted 
approach to this issue.65 This should be fully inclusive of women&#8217;s, youth and children&#8217;s 
experiences of and responses to homelessness. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Canada should adopt a coordinated national strategy for reduction of homelessness 
that links the short-term measures (such as supports and temporary shelter for the 
homeless) with longer-term measures (to ensure the availability of permanent, affordable 
housing, along with income and employment supports). 
</b>102. <b>Reducing homelessness and the number of people living in inadequate housing 
requires Canada to adopt a comprehensive and coordinated national poverty reduction 
strategy. Whilst three provinces have already taken important steps in this direction, the 
federal government should also be active in this area. This must include a review of the 
income available through social assistance and minimum wage in light of actual housing 
costs and a timetable for ensuring an adequate income to cover housing costs. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>In view of the issues faced by women in regard to discrimination and inadequate 
living conditions as well as income disparity between men and women, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the mandate and funding of the Status of Women Canada 
(SWC) be fully reinstated including funding for advocacy for women&#8217;s equality. 
</b>104. <b>Sufficient income and housing assistance should be ensured to allow mothers to 
secure adequate housing and maintain custody of their children. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Federal and provincial governments should develop a comprehensive and 
coordinated housing strategy based on a human rights approach, in collaboration with 
Aboriginal governments and communities, to address effectively their responsibility to 
ensure adequate housing for on and off reserve Aboriginals. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>In reserves, there is a need to commit funding and resources to a targeted Aboriginal 
housing strategy that ensures Aboriginal housing and services under Aboriginal control.

<p>107. <b>Authorities should genuinely engage with Aboriginal communities to resolve as soon 
as possible land claims such as in the Lubicon region so that housing problems can be

<p><b>resolved on a longer-term basis. In the mean-time urgent steps should be taken to improve 
housing and living conditions regardless of the status of the land claims. Until a settlement 
is reached no actions that could contravene the rights of Aboriginal peoples over these 
territories should be taken. In that regard, a moratorium should be placed on all oil and 
extractive activities in the Lubicon region until a settlement. Moreover, activities of private 
companies on Aboriginal lands - regardless of the status of the claim - should be carried 
out only with consultation and approval of all Aboriginal and concerned communities. The 
Special Rapporteur reaffirms the importance of accountability of private actors and calls 
for respect for human rights in their activities, policies and projects. 
</b>108. <b>Federal, Provincial, Aboriginal and municipal governments should undertake 
gender-based analysis of Aboriginal housing concerns that is culturally relevant and 
developed with the participation of Aboriginal women.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Aboriginal women must have effective participation in decision-making - at all levels, 
and Aboriginal women with disabilities. For example, equitable representation of all 
Aboriginal women in modern day treaty negotiations and agreements could ensure that 
shelter and housing needs of Aboriginal women are adequately considered. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Implementation of matrimonial real property legislation aimed at addressing current 
inequalities faced by Aboriginal women living on reserves should be complemented by 
effective concomitant non-legislative changes such as access to justice initiatives. 
</b>111. <b>Vancouver Olympic officials, and other authorities, need to implement specific 
strategies on housing and homelessness that do not rely on criminalization of poverty, 
and to commit funding and resources to support their targets, including the construction 
of 3,200 affordable homes as set out by the City of Vancouver as its minimum requirement 
for social sustainability and echoed in community Olympic consultation processes. The 
social development plan should be designed and implemented with public participation, 
and progress should be independently monitored.
