Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
August 11, 2016
Introduction
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the significant factors that have affected the performance
of Pan American Silver Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Pan American”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) and such factors that may affect its future
performance. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,
2015 (the “2015 Financial Statements”), and the related notes contained therein, and the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (the “Q2 2016 Financial Statements”), and the related notes contained therein. All amounts in
this MD&A and in the Q2 2016 Financial Statements are expressed in United States dollars (“USD”), unless identified otherwise. The Company reports its
financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”). Pan American’s significant accounting policies are set out in Note 2 of both the 2015 Financial Statements and the
Q2 2016 Financial Statements.
This MD&A refers to various non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“non-GAAP”) measures, such as “all-in sustaining cost per silver ounce sold",
“cash costs per ounce of silver”, “working capital’, “adjusted earnings” and “basic adjusted earnings per share”, which are used by the Company to manage
and evaluate operating performance at each of the Company’s mines and are widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but do
not have standardized meaning. To facilitate a better understanding of these non-GAAP measures as calculated by the Company, additional information
has been provided in this MD&A. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled “Alternative Performance (Non-GAAP) Measures” for a detailed
description of “all-in sustaining cost per silver ounce sold”, “cash costs per ounce of silver”, “working capital”, “adjusted earnings“ and “basic adjusted
earnings per share”, as well as details of the Company’s by-product credits and a reconciliation of these measures to the Q2 2016 Financial Statements.
Any reference to “cash costs” or “cash costs per ounce of silver” in this MD&A should be understood to mean cash costs per ounce of silver, net of by-
product credits.

Q2 2016 Highlights and key notes
OperationS AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
· Silver Production of 6.33 million ounces
The Company produced 6.33 million ounces of silver in the three months ended June 30, 2016 (“Q2 2016”), a 5% decrease from that produced in the
comparable quarter of 2015 (“Q2 2015”). The quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects the anticipated production declines at the Alamo Dorado and Manantial
Espejo mines and lower silver production at the Dolores mine due to lower grades largely driven by mine sequencing. These declines were partially offset
by increased production at all other operations.
Silver production for the first half of 2016 (“H1 2016”) totalled 12.75 million ounces, on pace to achieve the annual forecast of 24.0 to 25.0 million ounces.
· Reduced Q2 Cash Costs
Consolidated cash costs per ounce of silver for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 were $5.57 and $6.81, respectively, representing
41% and 35% reductions to cash costs per ounce from the comparable periods of 2015. The decrease in cash costs was achieved through lower direct unit
operating costs per ounce at all mines and increased production of all by-product metals.
· Increased Gold and Base Metal Production
Pan American produced 48.4 thousand ounces of gold, 12.7 thousand tonnes of zinc, 5.0 thousand tonnes of lead and 4.4 thousand tonnes of copper in Q2
2016 representing a 9%, 38%, 43% and 2% increase from Q2 2015 production levels, respectively. The increase in quarter-over-quarter gold and base
metal production was driven largely by higher throughput rates and gold grades at the Dolores mine, and higher base metal grades at the Company’s La
Colorada mine and Peruvian operations.
· Progress on the La Colorada and Dolores Expansion Projects
The La Colorada mine expansion project reached a significant milestone with the completion of the construction and commissioning of the new sulphide
process plant in Q2 2016. Progress continued to advance on the development of the new mine shaft, underground mine development in support of the
future increased production levels, and construction of the new 115 kV power line to the site. Overall, the La Colorada expansion is advancing on budget
and remains on schedule to reach the planned 1,800 tonnes per day (“tpd”) ore production rate by the end of 2017.
The Dolores mine expansion projects also progressed during the quarter with the advancement of the new pulp agglomeration plant including the receipt of
the environmental permits to construct the new plant, the commencement of the civil earthworks, the ordering of the remainder of major process equipment,
and awarding the majority of the construction contracts. Underground development continued with a total of 684 metres of development during the quarter.
Infill diamond drilling from the underground excavations commenced. Overall, the Dolores expansion project is on budget and the Company anticipates
meeting a scheduled commissioning of the pulp agglomeration plant by mid-2017, while ramping up underground operations to the full 1,500 tpd design
capacity by the end of 2017.

Financial Results
Net earnings of $34.2 million in Q2 2016, or basic earnings per share of $0.22, represented a $41.5 million, or $0.27 per share increase from the Q2 2015
net loss of $7.3 million and basic net loss per share of $0.05, respectively. Adjusted earnings in Q2 2016 were $19.9 million, representing basic adjusted
earnings of $0.13 per share, which is $31.1 million, or $0.20 per share, higher than the comparable amounts in Q2 2015, respectively. Mine operating
earnings of $44.7 million in Q2 2016 were $45.7 million more than the $1.0 million in mine operating losses recorded in Q2 2015, and was achieved
through cost reductions and revenue increases. Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash operating working capital was $53.5 million, a $35.6
million increase from the comparative amount in Q2 2015, due largely to increased revenues and decreases in cash production costs and income taxes
paid.
· Reduced Q2 All-in Sustaining Costs per Silver Ounce Sold (“AISCSOS”)
Consolidated AISCSOS in Q2 2016 was $11.31 per ounce, a 22% reduction from the $14.46 per ounce in Q2 2015. The decline in quarter-over-quarter
AISCSOS resulted mainly from lower production costs, increased by-product credits and positive net realizable value (“NRV”) inventory adjustments at the
Manantial Espejo and Dolores mines.
· Strong Liquidity and Working Capital Position
The Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances of $204.2 million, and a working capital position of $399.3 million at
June 30, 2016, an increase of $26.6 million and $15.6 million, respectively, from March 31, 2016. Total debt outstanding was $58.8 million at the end of Q2
2016.

· Q2 Silver Production
Pan American’s Q2 2016 silver production of 6.3 million ounces was 5% lower than the 6.6 million ounces produced in Q2 2015. The majority of the
decrease was attributable to the anticipated production declines at Alamo Dorado and Manantial Espejo, as these two operations approach their planned
end of mine life, as well as a quarter-over-quarter decline at the Dolores mine. The decreases at these mines were offset by slightly higher silver production
at the other mines.
· Q2 By-Product Production
The following tables set out the Company’s by-product production for Q2 2016 and H1 2016 together with amounts for the comparable periods in 2015:

Gold production during Q2 2016 rose 9% from Q2 2015, driven primarily by higher gold production at the Dolores mine, where improved grades led to an
increase of 5.2 thousand ounces in Q2 2016 compared with Q2 2015.
During Q2 2016, Pan American also produced 12.7 thousand tonnes of zinc, 5.0 thousand tonnes of lead, and 4.4 thousand tonnes of copper, 38%, 43%
and 2% more than in Q2 2015, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increases in base metal production were driven mainly by higher grades at the
Company’s Peruvian mines and at La Colorada, with the exception of lower copper grades at Huaron.
· Q2 Average Market Metal Prices

Consolidated cash costs per ounce of silver in Q2 2016 and H1 2016 were $5.57 and $6.81, respectively, $3.87 (41%) and $3.72 (35%) lower than the
comparable cash costs per ounce in Q2 2015 and H1 2015, respectively. The substantial declines in cash costs were achieved through lower direct
operating costs at all mines, except San Vicente and La Colorada, and increased by-product credits from higher production of all by-product metals and
improved gold prices. The reduction in direct operating cost was particularly notable at Manantial Espejo, Alamo Dorado and Morococha. Each operation’s
cash costs are separately discussed in the “Individual Mine Performance” section of this MD&A.

Consolidated AISCSOS in Q2 2016 and H1 2016 were $11.31 per ounce and $12.21 per ounce respectively, representing a 22% and 15% reduction from
the $14.46 per ounce and $14.35 per ounce in Q2 2015 and H1 2015, respectively. The decline in quarter-over-quarter AISCSOS resulted mainly from
lower production costs, increased by-product credits and positive NRV adjustments at the Manantial Espejo and Dolores mines. The factors reducing
AISCSOS were partially offset by the impact of increased sustaining capital, primarily at Dolores where an expansion of the leach pad is in progress, and
by fewer silver ounces sold as a result of the timing of sales rather than production shortfalls. The decline in AISCSOS from H1 2015 to H1 2016 was the
result of similar factors with the exception of period-over-period NRV adjustments which had a lower impact on AISCSOS compared to quarterly periods.

Sustaining capital expenditures excludes $15.1 million and $30.8 million of investing activity cash outflow in Q2 2016 and H1 2016, respectively ($7.0
million and $15.7 million in Q2 2015 and H1 2015, respectively) related to investment capital incurred on the La Colorada expansion project, as
disclosed in the Project Development Update and Alternative Performance (non-GAAP) Measures sections of this MD&A.
The La Colorada mine produced 4% more silver in Q2 2016 compared with Q2 2015 due to increased silver grades offset by a slight decline in quarter-
over-quarter throughput. During Q2 2016, the mine produced 2.5 thousand tonnes of zinc and 1.4 thousand tonnes of lead, 20% and 41% more than in Q2
2015, respectively. The increase in base metals production was a function of improved zinc and lead grades of 25% and 44%, respectively.
The Q2 2016 cash costs of $7.66 per ounce of silver were $0.19 lower than the $7.85 per ounce cash costs in Q2 2015. The 2% decrease was the
combined effect of a 4% increase in payable silver ounces produced and a 5% increase in by-product credits per ounce, partially offset by a slight increase
in direct operating costs compared to a year ago. The increased by-product credits were driven by higher lead and zinc production partially offset by lower
lead and zinc prices.
Q2 2016 AISCSOS of $8.84 decreased 9% from $9.68 in Q2 2015, due primarily to a 13% increase in the amount of payable silver ounces sold and
increased lead and zinc by-product credits, partially offset by increased sustaining capital.
Sustaining capital expenditures at La Colorada during Q2 2016 totalled $3.5 million, a $1.3 million increase from the $2.1 million spent in Q2 2015. The
majority of the Q2 2016 sustaining capital spending is related to a tailings storage facility expansion, equipment replacements and rehabilitations, and
exploration drilling. Q2 2015 sustaining capital was mostly related to exploration drilling, mine equipment replacement and rehabilitation, processing plant
infrastructure, and access road upgrades.

Sustaining capital expenditures excludes $13.7 million and $21.5 million of investing activity cash outflow in Q2 2016 and H1 2016, respectively ($4.8
million and $12.8 million in Q2 2015 and H1 2015, respectively) related to investment capital incurred on Dolores expansion projects, as disclosed in the
Project Development Update and Alternative Performance (non-GAAP) Measures sections of this MD&A.

Silver production at Dolores in Q2 2016 was 13% lower than in Q2 2015, the result of lower grades largely driven by mine sequencing and decreases in
stacking rates, partially offset by a higher average ratio of silver produced to placed. Gold production of 25.4 thousand ounces in Q2 2016 was 26% higher
than the 20.2 thousand ounces produced in Q2 2015, primarily a result of the improvement in grades from mine sequencing.
Negative cash costs of $0.64 per ounce of silver in Q2 2016 were $8.98 per ounce lower than in Q2 2015. The significant decrease in cash costs was
largely due to increased by-product gold production and higher gold prices and lower direct operating costs, partially offset by lower payable silver
production. The decrease in operating costs continued to be primarily the result of the devalued Mexican peso and lower costs of certain consumables,
particularly fuel.
Q2 2016 AISCSOS of $14.30 increased $0.52 from $13.78 in Q2 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $9.4 million increase in sustaining capital
expenditures, further discussed below, and decreased silver sales volumes, partially offset by $4.2 million higher positive NRV inventory adjustments in Q2
2016 compared to Q2 2015, and a $5.6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in gold by-product credits driven by increased gold production and prices.
Q2 2016 sustaining capital expenditures at Dolores totalled $15.5 million, comprised primarily of open pit pre-stripping, leach pad expansion, and
investments in mine equipment rehabilitations. Sustaining capital in Q2 2016 increased by $9.4 million compared to Q2 2015, due primarily to the leach
pad expansion works now included in sustaining capital.

As anticipated, Alamo Dorado silver production in Q2 2016 was 31% lower than that in Q2 2015, primarily the result of lower silver grades from processing
of surface stockpiles as open pit mining operations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. Similarly, gold production decreased by 17%, primarily
due to lower grades contained in the surface stockpiles processed.
Cash costs for Q2 2016 were $13.54 per ounce of silver, an 11% decrease from $15.25 per ounce cash costs in Q2 2015. The decrease was attributable to
the termination of open pit mining activities, favorable currency exchange rate movements, reduced costs of certain consumables, and a $1.16 per ounce
increase in by-product credits from higher gold prices.
Q2 2016 AISCSOS of $12.77 decreased $3.85 from $16.62 in Q2 2015. The quarter-over-quarter reduction was attributable to an 18% decrease in direct
operating costs, which decreased for the same reasons as those discussed in cash costs and by a $1.2 million higher positive NRV inventory adjustment,
partially offset by a 19% reduction in the amount of silver ounces sold.
No capital expenditures were incurred at Alamo Dorado during 2016 or 2015.

Q2 2016 silver production at Huaron was 2% more than that produced in Q2 2015, primarily the result of slightly increased silver grades and recoveries
offsetting a slight decline in throughput rates. During Q2 2016, Huaron produced 5.2 thousand tonnes of zinc, and 2.7 thousand tonnes of lead, which was
65% and 56% more than in Q2 2015, respectively. Q2 2016 copper production of 1.7 thousand tonnes was 11% lower than Q2 2015 production. The
quarter-over-quarter increase in zinc and lead production was primarily a function of higher grades and recoveries, while copper production reflected lower
grades and recoveries on account of mine sequencing.
Cash costs per ounce of silver in Q2 2016 were $5.70, a 36% decrease from the $8.96 per ounce in Q2 2015. The reduction in cash costs was the result of
a 4% increase in payable silver ounce production; increased by-product base metal production, partially offset by lower base metal prices; and lower
operating costs, driven by cost benefits from mechanization efforts and favorable currency exchange rate movements.
AISCSOS of $10.05 in Q2 2016 was 29% lower than the $14.11 reported in Q2 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to: a $4.31 per ounce increase
in by-product credits from increased base metal sales volumes, which more than offset the decline in base metal prices; a 7% increase in the amount of
payable silver ounces sold; and decreased exploration and sustaining capital. The factors reducing AISCSOS were partially offset by increased treatment,
smelting and refining charges (“TCRCs”).
Sustaining capital expenditures at the Huaron mine during Q2 2016 totaled $2.3 million, comparable to $2.6 million in Q2 2015, and related primarily to
equipment replacements, exploration drilling, and a tailings storage facility expansion.

Q2 2016 silver production at Morococha was 2% more than that produced in Q2 2015, the combined result of higher throughput and silver recoveries
partially offset by lower grades. During Q2 2016, Morococha produced 3.9 thousand tonnes of zinc, 2.5 thousand tonnes of copper, and 0.7 thousand
tonnes of lead, representing increases of 68%, 6% and 40% over Q2 2015, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increases in base metal production were
primarily driven by higher grades as a result of mine sequencing, and higher zinc and lead recoveries.
Cash costs of $1.35 per ounce of silver were $8.43 per ounce, or 86% lower, than the $9.78 per ounce recorded in Q2 2015. The significant quarter-over-
quarter decrease was primarily the result of a 20% reduction in operating costs partially offset by slightly reduced by-product credits on lower base metal
prices. The decreased operating costs were driven by substantial productivity benefits obtained from mechanization efforts as well as favorable currency
exchange rate movements.
AISCSOS of $6.61 in Q2 2016 was 57% lower than the $15.18 reported in Q2 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to a reduction in production
costs, a 22% quarter-over-quarter decrease in TCRCs due to more favorable terms, a $2.28 per ounce increase in by-product credits from increased base
metal sales volumes, and a 14% increase in the amount of payable silver ounces sold. The factors reducing AISCOS were partially offset by increased
sustaining capital.
Sustaining capital expenditures at the Morococha mine during Q2 2016 totalled $2.4 million, up $0.9 million from Q2 2015. The increase is primarily related
to equipment refurbishments and replacements, Manuelita mine area deepening and exploration drilling.

Silver production at the San Vicente mine in Q2 2016 was 1.1 million ounces, a 10% increase from the 1.0 million ounces produced in Q2 2015. The higher
silver production was a result of a 4% increase in throughput rates and 5% higher silver grades. Zinc and lead production during Q2 2016 decreased by
32% and 20% respectively compared to Q2 2015 production, while copper production commenced with mine sequencing entering into higher copper grade
ore.
Q2 2016 cash costs of $12.27 per ounce of silver increased by 7% from Q2 2015, driven mainly from an increase in royalty payments triggered by the
receipt during the quarter of certain value added tax (“VAT”) refunds and from increased silver prices, and lower by-product credits on account of the
decreased zinc and lead production and prices, partially offset by higher payable silver production.
Q2 2016 AISCSOS increased by 43% to $16.97 from $11.88 in Q2 2015. The increase was largely driven by a 43% quarter-over-quarter decrease in the
amount of payable silver ounces sold as a result of the timing of shipments at quarter end, and the increased royalty payments. The delayed shipments
contributed to a 0.42 million ounce increase in silver inventories in the quarter. Partially offsetting these factors was the 30% quarter-over-quarter decrease
in direct operating costs and a $3.70 per ounce increase in by-product credits.
Sustaining capital expenditures at San Vicente during Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 totalled $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and were comprised
mainly of mine infrastructure, and equipment rebuilds and replacements.

Q2 2016 silver production at Manantial Espejo was 13% lower than in Q2 2015 due to a 9% decline in throughput rates that resulted from a two-week
labour related work stoppage, as well as harder ores encountered at the Concepcion pit. The decrease in production also reflects lower grades and
recoveries. Q2 2016 gold production of 19.2 thousand ounces was similar to the 19.5 thousand ounces produced in Q2 2015, a result of higher gold grades
compensating for lower throughput rates.
Q2 2016 negative cash costs of $2.40 per silver ounce were $8.58 per ounce lower than the $6.18 per ounce cash costs in Q2 2015. The main factors
driving the significant quarter-over-quarter decline were: a sharp devaluation of the local currency; lower diesel fuel prices; reduced royalties on account of
the legislative elimination of the export tariff and a new export credit; the tapering down of mining during the final stages of open pit mining; and higher by-
product credits from improved gold prices. These factors were partially offset by a decline in payable silver ounces produced.
AISCSOS in Q2 2016 decreased by $20.03 to negative costs per ounce of $(3.51) from $16.52 in Q2 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a 19%
quarter-over-quarter reduction in direct operating costs, a $5.2 million increase in positive NRV inventory adjustments, and $4.0 million less in sustaining
capital. Partially offsetting these factors was a 29% decrease in the amount of silver sold, primarily due to the timing of sales, as a portion of silver produced
in Q2 2016 was not sold until Q3 2016, which contributed to a 3.3 thousand ounce and 0.14 million ounce increase in gold and silver inventories,
respectively, in the quarter. By-product credits were reduced by $3.38 per ounce as a result of lower gold sales volumes, also attributable to the timing of
sales.
Sustaining capital expenditures at Manantial Espejo in Q2 2016 totalled $0.5 million, a $4.0 million decrease from the $4.5 million in Q2 2015. The quarter-
over-quarter decrease reflects the cessation of pre-stripping activities, which occurred in 2015. The Q2 2016 sustaining capital consisted primarily of
development drilling.

2016 Operating Outlook
Production
H1 2016 consolidated silver production of 12.75 million ounces is in line with the production rate required to achieve management’s full year
forecast range of 24.0 to 25.0 million silver ounces. With the expected silver production for the remainder of the year, management reaffirms the
annual silver production forecast, as indicated in the 2015 year-end MD&A.
H1 2016 gold production of 89.6 thousand ounces is also in line with the production rate required to achieve management’s full year forecast
range of 175.0 to 185.0 thousand ounces. With the expected gold production for the remainder of the year, management also reaffirms the
annual gold production forecast, as indicated in the 2015 year-end MD&A.
H1 2016 zinc, lead, and copper production of 25.5 thousand tonnes, 9.8 thousand tonnes and 8.3 thousand tonnes, respectively, were on-pace
with management’s 2016 annual guidance of 46.0 to 48.0 thousand tonnes, 15.0 to 15.5 thousand tonnes, and 13.0 to 13.5 thousand tonnes,
respectively. With the expected base metal production for the remainder of the year, management reaffirms the annual base metal production
forecasts, as indicated in the 2015 year-end MD&A.

· La Colorada Expansion Project
During Q2 2016, $15.4 million was invested in the La Colorada expansion project comprised primarily of: development of the new mine shaft;
completing the construction and commissioning of the new sulphide process plant; progressing with underground mine development in
support of the future increased production levels; and construction of the new 115 kV powerline to the site.
Pan American Silver Corp.17
Amounts capitalized for the project in the quarter were $0.3 million more than the project cash outflows, as a result of changes in accounts
payable balances ($0.6 million more in Q2 2015).
The following progress on the La Colorada expansion project was achieved during Q2 2016:
The new sulphide ore processing plant was successfully commissioned. The new plant began processing sulphide ore in late June 2016, achieving
production throughput rates of up to 1,400 tpd. The installation of a new filter press is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2016 (“Q4 2016”); in
·
the interim, the existing filters have adequate capacity to process the forecasted volumes of concentrate to be produced in the third and fourth quarters of
2016.
Plant throughput rates will be reduced to normal levels in Q3 2016 until the mine shaft and additional underground development have been completed,
·
which will allow for increased production from the underground mine commencing in the Q4 2016 and ramping-up to the targeted 1,800 tpd design rate in
2017.
The construction of the new La Colorada mine shaft progressed and is on schedule for completion and commissioning by the end of Q3 2016. As of the
·
end of Q2 2016, the shaft had been completed and outfitted down to the loading pocket level at a depth of 588 metres. As of June 30, 2016, only 30 metres
remained to be completed in the shaft, in addition to the completion and commissioning of the shaft loading pocket.
Underground mine development to support future increased production levels continued with 548 metres of development completed, and is on schedule to
·
be sufficiently advanced to permit the opening of new production areas in the Estrella vein by the end of Q3 2016 allowing steady ramp-up of production
throughout 2017 targeting the full 1,800 tpd design rate by the end of 2017.
Construction of the new 115 kV powerline to the La Colorada site continued to advance during the quarter, with energizing of the system anticipated in Q1
·
2017. In the interim, temporary sources of power have been established to operate the new sulphide plant and the new shaft.
Overall, the La Colorada expansion is advancing on schedule and on budget, with ore production ramp up to commence in late 2016 and
beyond as anticipated in the original project schedule.
·
Dolores Projects
During Q2 2016, the Company invested $12.6 million in the Dolores expansion projects comprised predominantly of: $7.1 million on the new pulp
agglomeration plant; $3.5 million to advance the new underground ramp decline; and $2.0 million for construction of a new power line.
Amounts capitalized for the projects in the quarter were $1.0 million less than the project cash outflows, as a result from changes in accounts
payable balances ($0.1 million less in Q2 2015).
The following progress on the Dolores expansion projects was achieved during Q2 2016:
Environmental permits to construct the new agglomeration plant were received in early May 2016, with major earthworks commencing at that time. All of
·
the major process equipment has been ordered, and most of the major construction contracts have been awarded.
Pan American Silver Corp.18
·Detailed engineering for the agglomeration plant was 90% complete as of the end of the quarter.
·The project Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (“EPCM”) team for the agglomeration plant construction was fully mobilized to site.
Underground development continued with a total of 684 metres of development on the north and south lateral drifts, two down-ramp accesses to lower
·
levels, and a series of diamond drill stations.
Construction of the power line and related infrastructure was completed by the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company
finalized a power supply agreement with the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (“CFE”) and expect to make the connection to the grid to energize the line
·
in August.
Overall, the Dolores expansion project is on budget and the Company anticipates meeting a scheduled commissioning of the pulp
agglomeration plant by mid-2017, while ramping up underground operations to the full 1,500 tpd design capacity by the end of 2017.
Apart from the Dolores expansion project and the installation of the new high voltage power line, the projects team has also continued the next
phase of the leach pad sustaining capital expansion at Dolores, which is scheduled for completion during 2016. This stage of expansion of the
leach pads will provide an additional 18 million tonnes of ore stacking capacity.

· Income Statement: Q2 2016 versus Q2 2015
Net earnings in Q2 2016 were $34.2 million, or basic earnings per share of $0.22. This represents an increase of $41.5 million or $0.27 per share
from the $7.3 million loss and $0.05 basic loss per share recorded in Q2 2015. The majority of the quarter-over-quarter earnings increase was due
to a $45.7 million increase in mine operating earnings, which was primarily attributable to decreased cost of sales and increased revenues from
higher quantities of metal sold and a quarter-over-quarter increase in provisional price adjustments on concentrate sales. Net gains on the sale
of interests in exploration properties of $17.9 million were largely offset by higher income taxes.

  $34,226
Revenue for Q2 2016 was $192.3 million, a 10% increase from the $174.2 million recognized in Q2 2015. The major factors behind the revenue
increase were an $8.9 million positive variance in settlement adjustments on concentrate shipments, an $8.0 million variance from higher
quantities of metals sold, a $4.9 million variance from a quarter-over-quarter decrease in TCRCs, partially offset by a $3.8 million negative price
variance from lower realized base metals prices.
The following table reflects the metal prices realized by the Company and the quantities of metal sold during each quarter. Realized silver and
gold prices in Q2 2016 increased by 3% and 5%, respectively from Q2 2015 prices. Copper, lead and zinc decreased 20%, 14% and 12%,
respectively, from prices realized in Q2 2015.
The quantities of all metals sold in Q2 2016 were higher than in Q2 2015 for all metals sold except for silver which decreased 11%. Quarter-over-
quarter sales volumes for zinc, lead, copper, and gold increased 82%, 43%, 14% and 2% respectively, which was a direct result of increased
production.

Mine operating earnings of $44.7 million in Q2 2016 were $45.7 million higher than the $1.0 million of mine operating losses generated in Q2 2015.
Mine operating earnings are equal to revenue less cost of sales, substantially the same as gross margin. The increase in mine operating
earnings was the combined result of the previously discussed $18.1 million increase in revenue, and a $27.6 million quarter-over-quarter
decrease in cost of sales, driven largely by reduced production costs of $22.8 million and a $6.9 million reduction in depreciation and
amortization expense.
Pan American Silver Corp.21
The decrease in consolidated production costs in the quarter was attributable to lower direct operating costs as well as a $10.6 million positive
quarter-over-quarter variance in NRV inventory adjustments. Production costs generally continue to benefit from reductions in labour and
consumable raw materials costs, aided by favorable exchange rate changes. The operations that made the most significant contributions to
production cost reductions were Manantial Espejo and Morococha. Decreased mining activities at Alamo Dorado and Manantial Espejo also
drove cost reductions. The positive NRV inventory adjustment variance was primarily related to Manantial Espejo and Dolores, where $3.9
million and $4.2 million positive NRV inventory adjustments were recognized in Q2 2016, respectively, compared to negative adjustments of $1.3
million and $nil in Q2 2015, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization of $29.8 million in Q2 2016 was $6.9 million, or 19% lower than the $36.7 million recorded in Q2 2015. The reduced
depreciation was attributable to the quarter-over-quarter decrease in depreciable assets resulting largely from asset impairment charges taken in
2015, and from the decrease in sales volumes at certain mines. The decline in depreciation was most significant at the Manantial Espejo and
Alamo Dorado mines.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense, including share-based compensation expense, was $7.1 million in Q2 2016, $2.3 million more than
the $4.8 million expensed in Q2 2015. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by accrued bonuses in Q2 2016, principally for restricted
share unit cash compensation which references the Company’s share price. Share-based compensation expense for Q2 2016 was $0.9 million,
comparable to the $0.8 million expense recorded in Q2 2015.
Exploration and project development expenses of $2.7 million in Q2 2016 were similar to the $2.5 million incurred in Q2 2015. Exploration and
project development expenditures during both periods related to activities near the Company’s existing mines, at select greenfield projects, and
to the holding and maintenance costs associated with the Navidad project. Navidad costs were approximately $1.0 million in Q2 2016 compared
to approximately $1.9 million in Q2 2015.
Foreign exchange (“FX”) losses in Q2 2016 were $1.6 million, $2.6 million more than the $1.0 million FX gains recorded in Q2 2015. The Q2 2016
losses were primarily driven by the devaluation of the Mexican peso (“MXN”) and the Argentine peso (“ARS”) on the Company’s monetary
assets denominated in those currencies. The Canadian dollar (“CAD”) FX rate remained relatively flat in Q2 2016, as such there was no
significant FX effect on CAD treasury balances in Q2 2016. The Q2 2015 FX gains were driven by the effect of a CAD appreciation on CAD
treasury balances, and from FX gains from ARS devaluation on ARS denominated debt held in Q2 2015 and not Q2 2016. These Q2 2015 gains
offset losses experienced with MXN devaluation on MXN denominated monetary assets.
Gain on sale of mineral properties, plant and equipment for Q2 2016 was $17.9 million compared $0.1 million Q2 2015. The significant quarter-
over-quarter increase is primarily attributable to the gain recognized in Q2 2016 on the sale of 75% of the shares in Compania Minera Shalipayco
S.A.C. ("Shalipayco") for $15.0 million in cash and a one percent (1%) net smelter returns royalty with a fair value of $3.3 million. Shalipayco is the
owner of the Shalipayco zinc development project located in the departments of Pasco and Junin, Peru.
Investment income for Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 totalled $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and consisted mainly of interest income and net
gains from the sales of securities within the Company’s short-term investment portfolio.
Interest and finance expense for Q2 2016 was $2.5 million, comparable to $2.3 million recorded in Q2 2015. The expenses were comprised of
accretion of the Company’s closure liabilities, and interest and fees associated with the revolving credit facility, short-term loans, and leases.
Pan American Silver Corp.22
Income tax expense for Q2 2016 was $13.5 million, a $14.6 million increase from the $1.1 million income tax recovery in Q2 2015.  The tax expense
(recovery) in each quarter was comprised of current and deferred income taxes. The increase in income tax expense was primarily a
consequence of the effects of various temporary and permanent differences, as shown in the table below. These items resulted in effective tax
rates that vary considerably from the comparable period, and from the amount that would result from applying the Canadian federal and
provincial statutory income tax rates to earnings before income taxes. The main factors that affected the effective tax rates for Q2 2016 and Q2
2015 were foreign tax rate differences, FX rate changes, non-recognition of certain deferred tax assets, mining taxes paid, and withholding taxes
on payments from foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects that these and other factors will continue to cause volatility in effective tax rates
in the future.

· Statement of Cash Flows Q2 2016 versus Q2 2015
Cash flow from operations in Q2 2016 was $66.0 million, $45.4 million more than the $20.6 million generated in Q2 2015. The increase was due to
a $35.6 million increase in operating cash flow before working capital changes and a $9.9 million increase in cash flow from changes in non-cash
working capital. The increase in operating cash flow before working capital changes was driven primarily by increased cash revenues,
decreases in cash production costs, and lower cash income taxes paid.
The major difference in quarter-over-quarter working capital movements arose on the timing of trade and other accounts receivables
(“Receivables”). Receivables changes in Q2 2016 resulted in a $5.1 million source of cash, $10.0 million more than the $4.9 million use of cash in
Q2 2015.
Investing activities used $33.4 million in Q2 2016, inclusive of $15.0 million generated on the sale of Shalipayco and $4.7 million generated on net
sales of short-term investments. The balance of Q2 2016 investing activities consisted primarily of spending $52.8 million on mineral property
plant and equipment capital at the Company’s mines and projects. In Q2 2015, investing activities generated $63.9 million inclusive of $92.7
million generated on the net sale of short-term investments and $29.6 million spent on mineral property plant and equipment.
Pan American Silver Corp.
23
Financing activities in Q2 2016 used $3.8 million compared to $11.7 million in Q2 2015. Cash used in financing activities in Q2 2016 consisted of
$1.9 million paid as dividends to shareholders, $1.5 million in short-term debt payments and $0.8 million of lease repayments. In Q2 2015, $7.6
million was paid as dividends, and $5.1 million of lease payments were made, partially offset by $1.2 million in short-term debt proceeds received
(net of repayments).
· Adjusted Earnings Q2 2016 versus Q2 2015
Adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that the Company considers to better reflect normalized
earnings as they eliminate items that may be volatile from period to period, relating to positions that will settle in future periods, and items that
are non-recurring. Neither adjusted earnings nor basic adjusted earnings per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and
are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled “Alternative Performance (Non-GAAP) Measures” for a detailed description of “adjusted
earnings” and “basic adjusted earnings per share”, and a reconciliation of these second quarter measures to the Q2 2016 Financial Statements.
Adjusted earnings in Q2 2016 was $19.9 million, representing a basic adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, which was $31.1 million, or $0.20 per
share, higher than Q2 2015 adjusted net losses and basic losses per share of $(11.2) million, and $(0.07), respectively. The following graph
illustrates the key factors leading to the change from adjusted net losses for Q2 ended 2015 to the adjusted net income in Q2 2016:
· Income Statement: H1 2016 versus H1 2015
Net earnings in H1 2016 were $36.1 million, or a basic earnings per share of $0.23, representing an increase of $63.2 million or $0.41 per share
from the $27.1 million loss and $(0.18) basic loss per share recorded in Q2 2015. The majority of the quarter-over-quarter earnings increase was
due to a $59.8 million increase in mine operating earnings, which was primarily attributable to decreased cost of sales.

Revenue for H1 2016 was $350.5 million, similar to the $352.3 million recognized in H1 2015. The major factors behind the comparable revenues
in each period were a $20.7 million price variance from lower metal prices realized for all metals except gold; largely offset by an $11.0 million
positive variance in settlement adjustments on concentrate shipments, a $5.4 million variance from higher quantities of metals sold, and a $2.6
million period-over-period increase in TCRCs.
Realized prices for all metals sold in H1 2016 were lower than prices realized in H1 2015, other than for gold, which increased 1%. Realized silver
prices declined 3%, while copper, zinc and lead decreased 17%, 13% and 6%, respectively.
The quantities of all base metals sold in H1 2016 were higher than in H1 2015 with zinc, lead and copper increasing 51%, 34% and 29%,
respectively. Silver and gold sales volumes decreased by 7% and 10%, respectively. The decrease is the result of shipment timing rather than
production shortfalls, as shipment delays were experienced at Manantial Espejo at the end of June 2016.
Mine operating earnings of $61.4 million in H1 2016 were $59.8 million higher than the $1.7 million generated in H1 2015. The increase in mine
operating earnings was primarily the result of a $61.5 million period-over-period decrease in cost of sales driven by reduced production costs
and depreciation and amortization expense, which more than offset the previously discussed $1.8 million decrease in revenue.
The majority of the decrease in consolidated production costs was from the Manantial Espejo, Dolores, Alamo Dorado and Morococha
operations. Costs continue to benefit from reductions in labour and consumable raw materials costs, aided by favorable exchange rate changes,
and by decreased mining activities at Alamo Dorado and Manantial Espejo. Also improving period-over-period costs was a $2.0 million increase
in positive NRV inventory adjustments. There was a consolidated $12.5 million positive NRV inventory adjustment that reduced production
costs in H1 2016 compared to a consolidated $10.5 million positive NRV inventory adjustment in H1 2015.
Depreciation and amortization of $59.1 million in H1 2016 was $18.1 million, or 23% lower than the $77.2 million recorded in H1 2015. The reduced
depreciation was attributable to the decrease in depreciable assets that resulted largely from asset impairment charges taken in 2015, and from
the decrease in sales volumes at certain mines. The decline in depreciation was most significant at the Manantial Espejo, Alamo Dorado, and
Morococha mines.
Pan American Silver Corp.25
General and administrative (“G&A”) expense, including share-based compensation expense, was $12.9 million in H1 2016, $2.4 million more than
the $10.5 million expensed in H1 2015. The period-over-period increase was driven by accrued bonuses recorded in Q2 2016, principally for
restricted share unit compensation, which references the Company’s share price. Share-based compensation expense for H1 2016 and H1 2015
was $1.6 million.
Exploration and project development expenses of $4.0 million in H1 2016 were $2.3 million lower than the $6.2 million incurred in H1 2015. H2
2016 and H2 2015 exploration and project development expenditures related to activities near the Company’s existing mines, at select greenfield
projects, and on the holding and maintenance costs associated with the Navidad project. Navidad costs were approximately $1.0 million in H1
2016 compared to approximately $4.6 million in H1 2015.
FX losses in H1 2016 were $3.3 million, $2.0 million less than the $5.4 million in H1 2015. The H1 2016 losses were lower than in H1 2015 primarily
due to the CAD FX rate movements in each period, and its effect on CAD denominated treasury balances. The CAD appreciated to the USD by
approximately 6% in H1 2016 compared to an approximate 8% devaluation in H1 2015. The FX gains on CAD treasury balances in H1 2016
partially offset losses primarily from MXN devaluation on MXN denominated assets, while the FX losses on CAD treasury balances in H1 2015
added to losses from MXN devaluation on MXN denominated assets.
Investment income for H1 2016 and H1 2015 totalled $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively and consisted mainly of interest income and net
gains from the sales of securities within the Company’s short-term investment portfolio.
Interest and finance expense for H1 2016 was $4.3 million, comparable to $4.5 million recorded in H1 2015. The expenses were comprised of
accretion of the Company’s closure liabilities, and interest and fees associated with the revolving credit facility, short-term loans, and leases.
Income tax expense for H1 2016 was $17.6 million, a $12.0 million increase from the $5.6 million income tax expense recorded in the same period
of 2015.  The tax expense in both periods was comprised of current and deferred income taxes. The increase in income tax expense was
primarily a consequence of the effects of various temporary and permanent differences as shown in the table above. The main factors that
affected the effective tax rates for H1 2016 and H1 2015 were foreign tax rate differences, FX rate changes, mining taxes paid and withholding
taxes on payments from foreign subsidiaries.
· Statement of Cash Flows H1 2016 versus H1 2015
Cash flow from operations in H1 2016 generated $66.8 million, $34.4 million more than the $32.4 million generated in H1 2015. The operating cash
flow increase was due to a $56.6 million increase in operating cash flow before working capital changes and a $22.2 million decrease in cash flow
from changes in non-cash working capital. The increase in operating cash flow before working capital changes was driven primarily by
decreases in cash production costs and lower cash income taxes paid.
The major difference in quarter-over-quarter working capital movements arose on the timing of trade and other receivables (“Receivables”) and
changes in inventory and payables balances during the periods. Receivables changes in H1 2016 resulted in a $17.2 million use of cash, $14.7
million more than the $2.5 million use of cash in H1 2015. Inventory balance changes resulted in a $5.9 million source of cash in H1 2016, $8.0
million less than the $13.9 million source of cash in H1 2015.
Pan American Silver Corp.26
Investing activities used $43.7 million in H1 2016, inclusive of $40.7 million generated on net sales of short-term investments and $15.0 million
generated on the sale of Shalipayco. The balance of H1 2016 investing activities consisted primarily of spending $97.7 million on mineral
property plant and equipment. In H1 2015, investing activities generated $30.5 million inclusive of $91.5 million generated on the net sale of
short-term investments and $62.0 million spent on mineral property, plant, and equipment.
Financing activities in H1 2016 used $7.4 million compared to $26.7 million in H1 2015. Cash used in financing activities in H1 2016 consisted of
$3.8 million paid as dividends to shareholders, $2.7 million in short-term debt payments and $1.5 million of lease repayments. In H1 2015, $26.5
million was paid as dividends, $6.5 million in short-term debt proceeds were received (net of repayments), and $6.4 million of lease payments
were made.
Adjusted Earnings H1 2016 versus H1 2015
Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled “Alternative Performance (Non-GAAP) Measures” for a detailed description of “adjusted
earnings” and “basic adjusted earnings per share”, and a reconciliation of these periodic measures to the Q2 2016 Financial Statements.
Adjusted earnings in H1 2016 was $23.4 million, representing basic adjusted earnings per share of $0.15, which was $54.5 million, or $0.36 per
share, higher than H1 2015 adjusted net losses and basic losses per share of $(31.1) million, and $(0.21), respectively. The following graph
illustrates the key factors leading to the change from adjusted net losses for 2015 to the adjusted net income in H1 2016:
Pan American Silver Corp.27
Liquidity Position
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2016, was $149.9 million, which was an increase of $29.5 million from the $120.4
million balance at March 31, 2016. The balance of the Company’s short-term investments at June 30, 2016, was $54.3 million, which was a
decrease of $2.9 million from the $57.2 million balance at March 31, 2016. The combined liquidity increase in Q2 2016 of $26.6 million resulted
primarily from $66.0 million generated in operating cash flow, $15.0 million generated on the sale of mineral properties offset by $52.8 million in
capital expenditures used on mineral properties, plant and equipment and $3.8 million used in financing activities, which included $1.9 million of
dividend payments.
Pan American’s investment objectives for its cash balances are to preserve capital, to provide liquidity and to maximize returns. The Company’s
strategy to achieve these objectives is to invest excess cash balances in a portfolio of primarily fixed income instruments with specified credit
rating targets established by the Board of Directors, and by diversifying the currencies in which it maintains its cash balances. The Company
does not own any asset-backed commercial paper or other similar, known, at-risk investments in its investment portfolio.
Working capital at June 30, 2016, was $399.3 million, which was an increase of $15.6 million from March 31, 2016, working capital of $383.7
million. As previously described, the increase in working capital was due to the $26.6 million increase in cash and short-term investments, along
with a net $11.0 million decrease in other working capital accounts. The other working capital account movements arose primarily from a $15.9
million decrease in current income taxes receivable, net of current tax payables, a $7.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, offset by a $12.4 million increase in inventories.
On April 15, 2015 the Company entered into a new $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility with a 4-year term (the “Credit Facility”) and
upfront costs of $3.0 million. On May 31, 2016, the Company amended its Credit Facility by extending the term by one year, with additional
upfront costs of $0.4 million. As part of the amendment, the financial covenants were amended to require the Company to maintain a tangible net
worth (exclusive of any prospective write-downs of certain assets) of greater than $1,036.4 million plus 50% of the positive net earnings for each
subsequent fiscal quarter. In addition, the financial covenants continue to include the requirement for the Company to maintain: (i) a leverage
ratio less than or equal to 3.5:1; and (ii) an interest coverage ratio more than or equal to 3.0:1. As of June 30, 2016 the Company was in
compliance with all covenants required by the Credit Facility.
The terms of the Credit Facility provide the Company with the flexibility of various borrowing and letter of credit options. With respect to loans
drawn based on the average annual rate of interest at which major banks in the London interbank market are offering deposits in US dollars
("LIBOR"), the interest margin on such loan is between 2.125% and 3.125% over LIBOR, depending on the Company's leverage ratio at the time
of a specified reporting period. On December 29, 2015, the Company made a $36.2 million drawdown on the Credit Facility by way of LIBOR loan
at an annual rate of 2.55%. As of June 30, 2016, and at the date of this MD&A, $36.2 million remained drawn on the Credit Facility through LIBOR
loans with an average annual rate of 2.55%.
The Company’s financial position at June 30, 2016, and the operating cash flows that are expected over the next twelve months lead
management to believe that the Company’s liquid assets are sufficient to satisfy our 2016 working capital requirements, fund currently planned
capital expenditures for existing operations, and to discharge liabilities as they come due. The Company remains well positioned to take
advantage of further strategic opportunities as they become available. Liquidity risks are discussed further in the “Risks and Uncertainties”
section of this MD&A.
Pan American Silver Corp.28
The impact of inflation on the Company’s financial position, operational performance, or cash flows over the next twelve months cannot be
determined with any degree of certainty.
Capital Resources
Total attributable shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2016, was $1,333.4 million, an increase of $36.2 million from December 31, 2015. As of June 30,
2016, the Company had approximately 152.1 million common shares outstanding for a share capital balance of $2,300.4 million (December 31,
2015, 151.9 million and $2,298.4 million). The basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 152.0 million and 151.6 million
for the quarters ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 1.4 million stock options outstanding, with exercise prices in the range of CAD $9.76 to
CAD $40.22 and a weighted average life of 54 months. Approximately 0.9 million of the stock options were vested and exercisable at June 30,
2016, with an average weighted exercise price of CAD $19.96 per share.

A part of the Company’s operating and capital expenditures is denominated in local currencies other than USD. These expenditures are
exposed to fluctuations in USD exchange rates relative to the local currencies. From time to time, the Company mitigates part of this currency
exposure by accumulating local currencies, entering into contracts designed to fix or limit the Company’s exposure to changes in the value of
local currencies relative to the USD, or assuming liability positions to offset financial assets subject to currency risk. The Company held cash
and short-term investments of $6.7 million in CAD, $8.5 million in MXN, $1.4 million in Peruvian soles (“PEN”), $1.8 million in Argentine pesos,
and $3.6 million in Bolivian bolivianos at June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding collars made up of put and call contracts on its foreign currency exposure of MXN purchases
with a nominal value of $31.4 million and settlement dates between July 2016 and June 2017. The positions have a weighted average floor of
$17.33 and an average cap of $19.70. The Company recorded losses of $0.4 million and $nil on the MXN forward contracts in the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and recorded losses of $0.2 million and $nil during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Risks relating to FX rates are discussed in the “Risks and Uncertainties” section of this MD&A.
From time to time, Pan American mitigates the price risk associated with its base metal production by committing some of its future production
under forward sales or option contracts. Risks relating to metal prices and hedging activities undertaken in relation to metal prices are
discussed in the “Risks and Uncertainties” section of this MD&A.
Pan American Silver Corp.29
During 2016, in order to limit its exposure to lower zinc prices on a portion of its zinc production, the Company used put and call contracts to
collar the prices on 13,965 tonnes of zinc, of which contracts for 11,435 tonnes remained outstanding at June 30, 2016. The outstanding
contracts have a weighted average floor and cap of $1,804 and $2,084, respectively.  The outstanding contracts have settlement dates between
July 2016 and April 2017.  The Company recorded losses of $1.3 million and $nil on zinc positions during the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively; and recorded losses of $1.4 million and $nil on zinc positions during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Further, in 2016, in order to limit its exposure to lower lead prices a portion of its lead production, the Company used put and call contracts to
collar the prices on 3,720 tonnes of lead, of which contracts for 2,480 tonnes remained outstanding at June 30, 2016. The outstanding contracts
have a fixed minimum price of $1,650 and a maximum price of $1,965 per tonne.  The outstanding contracts have settlement dates between July,
2016 and February, 2017.  The Company recorded losses of $0.2 million and $nil on lead positions during the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively; and recorded gains of $nil and $nil on lead positions during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
During Q1 2015, the Company entered into diesel swap contracts designed to fix or limit the Company’s exposure to higher fuel prices (the
“Diesel Swaps”). The Diesel Swaps had an initial notional value of $13.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015 (“Q4 2015”), the Company
entered into additional Diesel Swaps with an initial notional value of $12.5 million.  A total of $4.5 million of the notional amounts of the Diesel
Swaps remained outstanding as of June 30, 2016. The Company recorded gains of $1.5 million and $0.9 million on the Diesel Swaps during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015; and recorded gains of $1.2 million and $1.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.
Other than the contracts described above, there were no other gains or losses on any commodity or foreign currency contracts in either the
three or six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015.
The Company maintains short-term bank loans in Argentina, which at June 30, 2016, had a balance outstanding of $16.9 million (December 31,
2015: $19.6 million). These loans were denominated in USD and ARS as at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and were drawn for the
purposes of short-term cash management and to partially offset the FX exposure of holding local currency denominated financial assets.
The carrying value of the conversion feature on convertible notes assumed by the Company in the Minefinders transaction, which was settled in
December 2015, was at fair value; while cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to
the relatively short periods to maturity of these financial instruments.
The Company had the right to pay all or part of the liability associated with the Company’s previously outstanding convertible notes in cash on
the conversion date. Accordingly, the Company classified the convertible notes as a financial liability with an embedded derivative. The financial
liability and embedded derivative were recognized initially at their respective fair values. The embedded derivative was recognized at fair value
with changes in fair value reflected in profit or loss and the debt liability component is recognized as amortized cost using the effective interest
method. Interest gains and losses related to the debt liability component or embedded derivatives were recognized in profit or loss.
During the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a gain (loss) on the revaluation of the conversion feature of the convertible
notes of $nil and $0.05 million, respectively.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. The classification of financial instruments and the significant
assumptions made in determining the fair value of financial instruments are described in note 4 of the Q2 2016 Financial Statements.
Closure and Decommissioning Cost Provision
The estimated future closure and decommissioning costs are based principally on the requirements of relevant authorities and the Company’s
environmental policies. The provision is measured using management’s assumptions and estimates for future cash outflows. The Company
accrues these costs initially at their fair value, which are determined by discounting costs using rates specific to the underlying obligation. Upon
recognition of a liability for the closure and decommissioning costs, the Company capitalizes these costs to the related mine and amortizes such
amounts over the life of each mine on a unit-of-production basis except in the case of exploration projects for which the offset to the liability is
expensed. The accretion of the discount due to the passage of time is recognized as an increase in the liability and a finance expense.
The total inflated and undiscounted amount of estimated cash flows required to settle the Company’s estimated future closure and
decommissioning costs as at June 30, 2016, is $109.4 million (December 31, 2015 - $107.2 million) which has been inflated using inflation rates of
between 1% and 17%. The inflated and discounted (using discount rates between 1% and 17%) provision on the statement of financial position
as at June 30, 2016, was $57.6 million (December 31, 2015, is $50.5 million). Spending with respect to decommissioning obligations at the Alamo
Dorado and Manantial Espejo mines is expected throughout 2016, while the remainder of the obligations are expected to be paid through 2035
or later if mine lives are extended. Revisions made to the reclamation obligations in Q2 2016 were primarily a result of increased site disturbance
related to the La Colorada expansion project and from the ordinary course of operations at the mines. These obligations will be funded from
operating cash flows, reclamation deposits, and cash on hand.
The accretion of the discount charged to Q2 2016 and H1 2016 earnings as finance expense were $1.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively (Q2
2015 and H1 2015 - $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively). Reclamation expenditures incurred during Q2 2016 and H1 2016 were $1.4 million
and $2.0 million, respectively (Q2 2015 and H1 2015 - $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively)
Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have a current or future effect on its financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, that are material.
The Company had the following contractual obligations at June 30, 2016:

Related Party Transactions
A company owned by a director of the Company was paid approximately $0.1 million and $0.1 million for consulting services in Q2 2016 and H1
2016, respectively (2015 - $nil and $nil, respectively).  These transactions are in the normal course of operations and are measured at the
exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the parties.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On July 11, 2016, Maverix Metals Inc. (formerly, MacMillan Minerals Inc.) and the Company closed the previously announced plan of arrangement
(the "Arrangement") pursuant to which Maverix Metals Inc. acquired 13 royalties, precious metals streams and payment agreements (the
"portfolio") from the Company.
As part of the Arrangement, MacMillan changed its name from MacMillan Minerals Inc. to Maverix Metals Inc. (“Maverix”), and its common shares
commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSXV") on July 12, 2016, under the stock symbol "MMX".
Pan American Silver Corp.32
Pan American received 42,850,000 common shares and 20,000,000 common share purchase warrants (the "Warrants") in exchange for the
portfolio. The PAS Warrants are exercisable for five years, with one-half exercisable at CAD$0.70 (US$0.546) per share and the other half
exercisable at CAD$1.00 (US$0.78) per share. Following the close of the Arrangement, Maverix had a total of 79,837,856 issued and outstanding
common shares, of which the Company holds approximately 54 percent on a non-diluted basis.
In management’s opinion, this transaction represents an attractive opportunity to unlock value for a group of its assets that have gone largely
unrecognized by the market. As the majority shareholder, Pan American will maintain meaningful upside exposure and leverage to these assets,
and to Maverix’s ability to grow the portfolio, led by a trusted and experienced management team.  Please refer to the news release of July 11,
2016, for further details.
Alternative Performance (non-GAAP) Measures
·
AISCSOS
AISCSOS is a non-GAAP financial measure. AISCSOS does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and is therefore unlikely to
be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We believe that AISCSOS reflects a comprehensive measure of the full cost
of operating our consolidated business given it includes the cost of replacing silver ounces through exploration, the cost of ongoing capital
investments (sustaining capital), general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affect the Company’s consolidated earnings
and cash flow. To facilitate a better understanding of this measure as calculated by the Company, the following table provides the detailed
reconciliation of this measure to the applicable cost items, as reported in the consolidated income statements for the respective periods:

Pan American Silver Corp.33
As part of the AISCSOS measure, sustaining capital is included while expansionary or acquisition capital (referred to by the Company as
investment capital) is not. Inclusion of sustaining capital only is a better measure of capital costs associated with current ounces sold as
opposed to investment capital, which is expected to increase future production. For the periods under review, the below noted items associated
with the La Colorada expansion project, and Dolores’ leach pad and other expansionary expenditures are considered investment capital
projects.

· Cash Costs per Ounce of Silver, net of by-product credits
Pan American produces by-product metals incidentally to our silver mining activities. We have adopted the practice of calculating the net cost of
producing an ounce of silver, our primary payable metal, after deducting revenues gained from incidental by-product production, as a
performance measure. This performance measurement has been commonly used in the mining industry for many years and was developed as a
relatively simple way of comparing the net production costs of the primary metal for a specific period against the prevailing market price of that
metal.
Cash costs per ounce metrics, net of by-product credits, are utilized extensively in our internal decision making processes. We believe they are
useful to investors as these metrics facilitate comparison, on a mine by mine basis, notwithstanding the unique mix of incidental by-product
production at each mine, of our operations’ relative performance on a period by period basis, and against the operations of our peers in the
silver industry on a consistent basis. Cash costs per ounce is conceptually understood and widely reported in the silver mining industry.
However, cash cost per ounce of silver is a non-GAAP measure and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and the
Company’s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities.
To facilitate a better understanding of these measures as calculated by the Company, the following table provides the detailed reconciliation of
these measures to the production costs, as reported in the consolidated income statements for the respective periods:

· Adjusted Earnings and Basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share
Adjusted earnings is a non-GAAP measure that the Company considers to better reflect normalized earnings as it eliminates items that may be
volatile from period to period, relating to positions which will settle in future periods, and items that are non-recurring. Certain items that become
applicable in a period may be adjusted for, with the Company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items
and conversely, items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation. The Company adjusts certain items in the periods that they
occurred but does not reverse or otherwise unwind the effect of such items in future periods.
The following table shows a reconciliation of adjusted loss and earnings for the three and six months ending June 30, 2016 and 2015, to the net
earnings (loss) for each period.

Risks and Uncertainties
The Company is exposed to many risks in conducting its business, including but not limited to: metal price risk as the Company derives its
revenue from the sale of silver, zinc, lead, copper, and gold; credit risk in the normal course of dealing with other companies; FX risk as the
Company reports its financial statements in USD whereas the Company operates in jurisdictions that utilize other currencies; the inherent risk of
uncertainties in estimating mineral reserves and mineral resources; political risks; and environmental risks and risks related to its relations with
employees.  These and other risks are described below and in Pan American’s Annual Information Form (available on SEDAR at
www.sedar.com), Form 40-F filed with the SEC, and the 2015 Financial Statements. Readers are encouraged to refer to these documents for a
more detailed description of some of the risks and uncertainties inherent to Pan American’s business.
·
Foreign Jurisdiction Risk
Pan American currently conducts operations in Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Bolivia. All of these jurisdictions are potentially subject to a number
of political and economic risks, including those described in the following section. The Company is unable to determine the impact of these risks
on its future financial position or results of operations and the Company’s exploration, development and production activities may be
substantially affected by factors outside of Pan American’s control. These potential factors include, but are not limited to: royalty and tax
increases or claims by governmental bodies, expropriation or nationalization, lack of an independent judiciary, FX controls, import and export
regulations, cancellation or renegotiation of contracts and environmental and permitting regulations. The Company currently has no political
risk insurance coverage against these risks.
All of Pan American’s current production and revenue is derived from its operations in Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Bolivia. As Pan American’s
business is carried on in a number of developing countries, it is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:
expropriation or nationalization without adequate compensation, particularly in jurisdictions such as Argentina and Bolivia that have a history of
expropriation; changing political and fiscal regimes, and economic and regulatory instability; unanticipated changes to royalty and tax
regulations; unreliable or undeveloped infrastructure; labour unrest and labour scarcity; difficulty obtaining key equipment and components for
equipment; regulations and restrictions with respect to imports and exports; high rates of inflation; extreme fluctuations in currency exchange
rates and the imposition of currency controls; the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts, and uncertainty regarding
enforceability of contractual rights; inability to obtain fair dispute resolution or judicial determinations because of bias, corruption or abuse of
power; difficulties enforcing judgments generally, including judgments obtained in Canadian or United States courts against assets and entities
located outside of those jurisdictions; difficulty understanding and complying with the regulatory and legal framework respecting the ownership
and maintenance of mineral properties, mines and mining operations, and with respect to permitting; local opposition to mine development
projects, which include the potential for violence and property damage; violence and more prevalent or stronger organized crime groups;
terrorism and hostage taking; military repression and increased likelihood of international conflicts or aggression; and increased public health
concerns. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are illustrated well by circumstances in Bolivia and Argentina.
The Company’s Mexican operations, Alamo Dorado and La Colorada, have suffered from armed robberies of doré in the past. The Company has
instituted a number of additional security measures and a more frequent shipping schedule in response to these incidents. The Company has
subsequently renewed its insurance policy to mitigate some of the financial loss that would result from such criminal activities in the future,
however a substantial deductible amount would apply to any such losses in Mexico.
Pan American Silver Corp.40
Local opposition to mine development projects has arisen periodically in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and such opposition has
at times been violent. There can be no assurance that similar local opposition will not arise in the future with respect to Pan American’s foreign
operations. If Pan American were to experience resistance or unrest in connection with its foreign operations, it could have a material adverse
effect on Pan American’s operations or profitability.
In early 2009, a new constitution was enacted in Bolivia that further entrenched the government’s ability to amend or enact laws, including those
that may affect mining, and which enshrined the concept that all natural resources belong to the Bolivian people and that the state was entrusted
with its administration.
On May 28, 2014, the Bolivian government enacted Mining Law No. 535 (the “New Mining Law”). Among other things, the New Mining Law
established a new Bolivian mining authority to provide principal mining oversight (varying the role of COMIBOL) and set out a number of new
economic and operational requirements relating to state participation in mining projects. Further, the New Mining Law provided that all pre-
existing contracts were to migrate to one of several new forms of agreement within a prescribed period of time. As a result, we anticipate that our
current joint venture agreement with COMIBOL relating to the San Vicente mine will be subject to migration to a new form of agreement and may
require renegotiation of some terms in order to conform to the New Mining Law requirements. We are assessing the potential impacts of the New
Mining Law on our business and are awaiting further regulatory developments, but the primary effects on the San Vicente operation and our
interest therein will not be known until such time as we have, if required to do so, renegotiated the existing contract, and the full impact may only
be realized over time. In the meantime, we understand that pre-existing agreements will be respected during the period of migration and we will
take appropriate steps to protect and, if necessary, enforce our rights under our existing agreement with COMIBOL. There is, however, no
guarantee that governmental actions, including possible expropriation or additional changes in the law, and the migration of our contract will not
impact our involvement in the San Vicente operation in an adverse way and such actions could have a material adverse effect on us and our
business.
On June 25, 2015, the Bolivian government enacted the new Conciliation and Arbitration Law No. 708 (the “New Conciliation and Arbitration
Law”), which endeavors to set out newly prescribed arbitral norms and procedures, including for foreign investors. However, whether the New
Conciliation and Arbitration Law applies specifically to pre-existing agreements between foreign investors and COMIBOL, and how this new
legislation interacts with the New Mining Law, remains somewhat unclear. As a result, we await clarification by regulatory authorities and will
continue to assess the potential impacts of the New Conciliation and Arbitration Law on our business.
Meanwhile, under the previous political regime in Argentina, the government intensified the use of price, foreign exchange, and import controls
in response to unfavourable domestic economic trends. Among other the things, the Argentine government has imposed restrictions on the
importation of goods and services and increased administrative procedures required to import equipment, materials and services required for
operations at Manantial Espejo. In support of this policy, in May 2012, the government mandated that mining companies establish an internal
function to be responsible for substituting Argentinian-produced goods and materials for imported goods and materials and required advance
government review of plans to import goods and materials. In addition, the government of Argentina also tightened control over capital flows
and foreign exchange in an attempt to curtail the outflow of hard currencies and protect its foreign currency reserves, including mandatory
repatriation and conversion of foreign currency funds in certain circumstances, informal restrictions on dividend, interest, and service payments
abroad and limitations on the ability of individuals and businesses to convert Argentine pesos into USD or other hard currencies, exposing us
to additional risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation. While a new federal government was elected in Argentina in late 2015 and
has since taken steps to ease some of the previously instituted controls and restrictions, particularly relaxing certain rules relating to the inflow
and outflow of foreign currencies, many of the policies of the previous government continue to adversely affect the Company’s Argentine
operations. It is unknown whether these recent changes will be lasting, what, if any, additional steps will be taken by the new administration, or
what financial and operational impacts these and any future changes might have on the Company. As such, the Company continues to monitor
and assess the situation in Argentina.
Pan American Silver Corp.41
In most cases, the effect of these risks and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and, in many cases, their occurrence is outside of our
control. Although we are unable to determine the impact of these risks on our future financial position or results of operations, many of these
risks and uncertainties have the potential to substantially affect our exploration, development and production activities and could therefore have
a material adverse impact on our operations and profitability. Management and the Board of Directors continuously assess risks that the
Company is exposed to, and attempt to mitigate these risks where practical through a range of risk management strategies, including employing
qualified and experienced personnel.
·
Metal Price Risk
Pan American derives its revenue from the sale of silver, zinc, lead, copper, and gold. The Company’s sales are directly dependent on metal
prices that have shown significant volatility and are beyond the Company’s control.
Pan American Silver takes the view that its precious metals production should not be hedged, thereby, allowing the Company to maintain
maximum exposure to precious metal prices. From time to time, Pan American mitigates the price risk associated with its base metal production
by committing some of its forecasted base metal production under forward sales and option contracts, as described under the “Financial
Instruments” section of this MD&A. Decisions relating to hedging may have material adverse effects upon our financial performance, financial
position, and results of operations. Since base metal and gold revenue are treated as a by-product credit for purposes of calculating cash costs
per ounce of silver and AISCSOS, these non-GAAP measures are highly sensitive to base metal and gold prices.
The Board of Directors continually assesses the Company’s strategy towards its base metal exposure, depending on market conditions. If metal
prices decline significantly below levels used in the Company’s most recent impairment tests, especially for an extended period of time, the
Company may need to reassess its price assumptions, and a significant decrease in the price assumptions could be an indicator of potential
impairment. A description of the impact of metal price changes on certain Company assets is included in the Key Assumption and Sensitivity
sections included in both the 2015 Financial Statements (included in Note 11), and in this MD&A (included in the Income Statement analysis
section).
·
Trading and Credit Risk
The zinc, lead, and copper concentrates produced by us are sold through long-term supply arrangements to metal traders or integrated mining
and smelting companies. The terms of the concentrate contracts may require us to deliver concentrate that has a value greater than the payment
received at the time of delivery, thereby introducing us to credit risk of the buyers of our concentrates. Should any of these counterparties not
honour supply arrangements, or should any of them become insolvent, we may incur losses for products already shipped and be forced to sell
our concentrates in the spot market or we may not have a market for our concentrates and therefore our future operating results may be
materially adversely impacted. For example, the Doe Run Peru smelter, a significant buyer of our production in Peru, experienced financial
difficulties in the first quarter of 2009 and closed. We continued to sell copper concentrates to other buyers but on inferior terms. The Doe Run
Peru smelter remains closed and we are owed approximately $8.2 million under the terms of our contract with Doe Run Peru. We continue to
pursue all legal and commercial avenues to collect the amount outstanding.
Pan American Silver Corp.42
As at June 30, 2016, we had receivable balances associated with buyers of our concentrates of $47.5 million (December 31, 2015 - $21.3 million).
All of this receivable balance is owed by twelve well known concentrate buyers and the vast majority of our concentrate is sold to those same
counterparts.
Silver doré production is refined under long-term agreements with fixed refining terms at four separate refineries worldwide. We generally retain
the risk and title to the precious metals throughout the process of refining and therefore are exposed to the risk that the refineries will not be able
to perform in accordance with the refining contract and that we may not be able to fully recover our precious metals in such circumstances. As
at June 30, 2016, we had approximately $38.8 million contained in precious metal inventory at refineries (December 31, 2015 - $21.4 million). We
maintain insurance coverage against the loss of precious metals at our mine sites, in-transit to refineries, and while at the refineries.
Refined silver and gold are sold in the spot market to various bullion traders and banks. Credit risk may arise from these activities if we are not
paid for metal at the time it is delivered, as required by spot sale contracts.
We maintain trading facilities with several banks and bullion dealers for the purposes of transacting our trading activities. None of these facilities
are subject to margin arrangements. Our trading activities can expose us to the credit risk of our counterparties to the extent that our trading
positions have a positive mark-to-market value.
Management constantly monitors and assesses the credit risk resulting from our concentrate sales, refining arrangements, and commodity
contracts. Furthermore, management carefully considers credit risk when allocating prospective sales and refining business to counterparties.
In making allocation decisions, management attempts to avoid unacceptable concentration of credit risk to any single counterparty.
From time to time, we may invest in equity securities of other companies. Just as investing in Pan American is inherent with risks such as those
set out in this MD&A, by investing in other companies we will be exposed to the risks associated with owning equity securities and those risks
inherent in the investee companies.
·
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they come due. The volatility of the metals markets can impact
our ability to forecast cash flow from operations.
We must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term business requirements, taking into account our anticipated cash flows from
operations, our holdings of cash and cash equivalents, and committed loan facilities.
Pan American Silver Corp.43
We manage our liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows. We have in place a rigorous reporting, planning and
budgeting process to help determine the funds required to support our normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis and our expansion
plans. We continually evaluate and review capital and operating expenditures in order to identify, decrease, and limit all non-essential
expenditures.
·
Exchange Rate Risk
Pan American reports its financial statements in USD; however, the Company operates in jurisdictions that utilize other currencies. As a
consequence, the financial results of the Company’s operations, as reported in USD, are subject to changes in the value of the USD relative to
local currencies. Since the Company’s revenues are denominated in USD and a portion of the Company’s operating costs and capital spending
are in local currencies, the Company is negatively impacted by strengthening local currencies relative to the USD and positively impacted by the
inverse. The local currencies that the Company has the most exposure to are the Peruvian soles (“PEN”), Mexican pesos (“MXN”) and Argentine
pesos (“ARS”). In order to mitigate this exposure, the Company maintains a portion of its cash balances in PEN, MXN and CAD and, from time to
time, enters into forward currency positions to match anticipated spending as discussed in this in MD&A in the “Financial Instruments” section.
The Company’s balance sheet contains various monetary assets and liabilities, some of which are denominated in foreign currencies.
Accounting convention dictates that these balances are translated at the end of each period, with resulting adjustments being reflected as
foreign exchange gains or losses on the Company’s income statement.
Our balance sheet contains various monetary assets and liabilities, some of which are denominated in foreign currencies. Accounting
convention dictates that these balances are fair valued at the end of each period, with resulting adjustments being reflected as foreign exchange
gains or losses on our statement of operations.
In addition to the foregoing, governmental restrictions and controls relating to exchange rates also impact our operations. In Argentina, for
example, the government has at times established official exchanges rates that were significantly different than the unofficial exchange rates
more readily utilized in the local economy to determine prices and value. Our investments in Argentina are primarily funded from outside of the
country, and therefore conversion of foreign currencies, like USD, at the official exchange rate has had the effect of reducing purchasing power
and substantially increasing relative costs in an already high inflationary market. Maintaining monetary assets in ARS also exposes us to the
risks of ARS devaluation and high domestic inflation.
·
Taxation Risks
Pan American is exposed to tax related risks, in assessing the probability of realizing income tax assets recognized, the Company makes
estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, applicable tax planning opportunities, expected timing of reversals of existing
temporary differences and the likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by applicable tax authorities. In making its
assessments, we give additional weight to positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Estimates of future taxable income are
based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. We consider relevant tax planning
opportunities that are within the Company’s control, are feasible and within management’s ability to implement. Examination by applicable tax
authorities is supported based on individual facts and circumstances of the relevant tax position examined in light of all available evidence.
Where applicable tax laws and regulations are either unclear or subject to ongoing varying interpretations, it is reasonably possible that
changes in these estimates can occur that materially affect the amounts of income tax assets recognized. Also, future changes in tax laws could
limit the Company from realizing the tax benefits from the deferred tax assets. We reassess unrecognized income tax assets at each reporting
period.
Pan American Silver Corp.44
· Claims and Legal Proceedings
Pan American is subject to various claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business
activities. Many of these claims relate to current or ex-employees, some of which involve claims of significant value, for matters ranging from
workplace illnesses such as silicosis to claims for additional profit-sharing and bonuses in prior years. Furthermore, we are in some cases, the
subject of claims by local communities, indigenous groups or private land owners relating to land and mineral rights and such claimants may
seek sizeable monetary damages against us and/or the return of surface or mineral rights that are valuable to us and which may impact our
operations and profitability if lost. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be
resolved unfavourably to us. We carry certain liability insurance coverage and establish provisions for matters that are probable and can be
reasonably estimated. In addition, we may be involved in disputes with other parties in the future that may result in litigation, which may result in
a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flow and results of operations.
Significant Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty in the Application of Accounting Policies
In preparing financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting estimates represent
management estimates and judgments that are uncertain and any changes in these could materially impact the Company’s financial statements.
Management continuously reviews its estimates, judgments, and assumptions using the most current information available.
Readers should also refer to Note 2 of the 2015 Financial Statements, for the Company’s summary of significant accounting policies.
Changes in Accounting Standards
There were no significant accounting standards or interpretations along with any consequential amendments, required for the Company to
adopt effective January 1, 2016.
Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) on July 24, 2014 and will replace
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 utilizes a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is
measured at amortized cost or fair value and a new mixed measurement model for debt instruments having only two categories: amortized cost
and fair value. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. Final amendments released on July 24, 2014 also introduce a new expected loss
impairment model and limited changes to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets. IFRS 9 is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the final standard and amendments on its
consolidated financial statements.
Pan American Silver Corp.45
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”) In May 2014, the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
completed its joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for IFRS and US GAAP.
As a result of the joint project, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and will replace IAS 18, Revenue, IAS 11,
Construction Contracts, and related interpretations on revenue. IFRS 15 establishes principles to address the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Companies can elect to use either a full or modified
retrospective approach when adopting this standard. On July 22, 2015, the IASB confirmed a one-year deferral of the effective date of IFRS 15 to
January 1, 2018. The Company is in the process of analyzing IFRS 15 and determining the effect on our consolidated financial statements as a
result of adopting this standard.
IFRS 16, Leases (“IFRS 16”) In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – Leases which replaces IAS 17 – Leases and its associated interpretative
guidance. IFRS 16 applies a control model to the identification of leases, distinguishing between a lease and a service contract on the basis of
whether the customer controls the asset being leased. For those assets determined to meet the definition of a lease, IFRS 16 introduces
significant changes to the accounting by lessees, introducing a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance
lease accounting, with limited exceptions for short-term leases or leases of low value assets. Lessor accounting remains similar to current
accounting practice. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early application permitted for
entities that apply IFRS 15. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the final standard is expected to have on its consolidated financial
statements.
IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows (“IAS 7”) Amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows were issued in January 2016 as part of the IASB’s
Disclosure Initiative.  The amendments require certain enhanced disclosures of the cash and non-cash components of changes in liabilities
resulting from financing activities and are required to be applied for years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.  The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the amendments on its consolidated financial statements.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of Pan American is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control, including internal controls
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards. It includes those policies and procedures that:
a)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Pan
American,
b)
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards, and that receipts and expenditures of Pan American are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and Pan American’s directors, and
Pan American Silver Corp.46
c)
are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Pan American’s
assets that could have a material effect on the annual financial statements or interim financial reports.
The Company’s management, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that due to its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended June 30, 2016 that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
