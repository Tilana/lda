fundamental freedoms for all, and accountability for all violations of human rights;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also welcomes </i>the engagement of the Government of Myanmar with Daw

electoral laws, as an important step towards enabling wider participation of political parties, 
including the National League for Democracy, in the by-elections of 1 April 2012, and 
urges the Government to work towards establishing a credible, inclusive and sustained 
process of close and ongoing dialogue with the democratic opposition and political, ethnic

Myanmar;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses continued grave concern</i> about remaining serious human rights 
violations, and strongly calls upon the Government of Myanmar to put an end to grave 
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including attacks against the 
civilian population, extrajudicial killings, internal displacement, the use of human shields 
and forced labour, confiscation and destruction of property, and conflict-related sexual 
violence, to undertake, without delay and with appropriate attention from the United 
Nations, a full, transparent, and independent investigation into all reports of such violations, 
and to bring to justice those responsible in order to end impunity for such acts, while

conscience, and to release such prisoners, without delay or conditions, and allow their full 
participation in the political process;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> the Government of Myanmar to ensure that the by-elections of 1 April

cooperation and the presence of international election observers and drawing lessons from 
the 2010 elections;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the increasing space for political activity, assembly, speech and the 
press and the stated intention of the Government of Myanmar to carry out media reform and

to ensure the freedom of assembly, association, movement and expression for all people in

areas, especially in Kachin State and the northern Shan State, and calls upon the authorities 
and all armed groups to protect the civilian population, in particular children and women, in 
all parts of the country and to use political means to maintain or re-establish ceasefire 
agreements with a view to ending armed conflicts in the country, with an inclusive political 
process also being a vital step towards ensuring long-term peace and national 
reconciliation;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Myanmar to continue to implement the
