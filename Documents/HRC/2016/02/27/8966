<p><b>Executive summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report examines the current political economic order that is often neglected in 
analyses of women&#8217;s human rights and violence against women, but profoundly affects both the 
prevalence of this violence and the efforts to eliminate it. Women&#8217;s physical security and 
freedom from violence are inextricably linked to the material basis of relationships that govern 
the distribution and use of resources, entitlements and authority within the home, the community 
and the transnational realm. Cultural rationales for limiting or negating women&#8217;s rights are thus, 
linked to particular material interests and inequalities on the ground. Nowhere in the world do 
women share equal social and economic rights or equal access to productive resources such as 
land, technology, capital and credit with men. 
</p>
<p> Economic globalization and development, and most urgently, the global economic 
recession, are creating new challenges for women&#8217;s rights as well as some new opportunities for 
advancing women&#8217;s economic independence and gender equality. The proliferation of armed 
conflicts, often caused by struggles to control power and productive resources, has also setback 
efforts to protect and prevent violence against women. Furthermore, post-conflict and post 
humanitarian crisis and natural disaster processes have tended to deepen gender inequalities in 
economic and political participation, thus further constraining women&#8217;s access to social and 
economic rights and affecting their vulnerability to violence. 
</p>
<p> Preventing violence against women and improving women&#8217;s situation in a neoliberal 
global environment requires a holistic approach to women&#8217;s rights. Yet a persistent problem in 
the human rights system is the dichotomous treatment of rights into civil and political on the one 
hand, and economic and social on the other. However, unless women can achieve economic 
independence or be empowered socially and politically, the human rights they hear about will 
remain abstract concepts. The report identities how lack of access to particular economic and 
social rights, such as the right to land, housing, and food are directly linked to the increased risk 
of violence against women. It reveals how economic and social security is crucial for both 
protecting and preventing violence against women. These findings have particular relevance in 
light of the predicted negative impacts of the economic crisis on women and their family&#8217;s 
livelihoods. 
</p>
<p> Current approaches to understanding and responding to violence against women must be 
broadened to take account of causes and consequences of violence evident in women&#8217;s poverty 
and labour exploitation, their socio-economic inequality with men, and their exclusion from 
political decision-making. In order to attend to prevention as well as protection and prosecution 
of violence against women, the report calls for mainstreaming violence against women 
assessments into all governance and public policies, and encourages the integration of initiatives 
to end violence against women within the larger struggle for social and economic equality within 
the human rights movement. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report addresses political economy and violence against women.<b>1</b> It aims to elucidate 
the aspects of global and local political economic environments that serve to either constrain or 
enable efforts to end violence against women. The report follows from the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
previous reports on &#8220;The due diligence standard as a tool for the elimination of violence against 
women&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/61), and on &#8220;Intersections between culture and violence against women&#8221; 
(A/HRC/4/34), where cultural discourses and global economic re-structuring were identified as 
major challenges to the achievement of gender equality and to the elimination of violence against 
women.<b>2</b> A viable strategy in addressing the issue of culture and violence against women must 
include a political economy perspective, which allows one to understand the material foundation 
and the underlying vested interests of cultural norms and practices. The current report aims to 
respond to that need.<b>3</b> Its political economy approach to violence against women is especially 
relevant in the context of the current global economic crisis. The crisis is predicted to have a 
disproportionate negative impact on women and girls&#8217; education, employment, and livelihoods, 
all of which the report shows are linked to their increased risks of violence, due in part to men&#8217;s 
responses to economic displacement and disempowerment. 
</p>
<p>2. Gender inequality in the enjoyment of economic and social rights makes women especially 
vulnerable to violence, exploitation and other forms of abuse.<b>4</b> Economic and social inequalities 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>1
</b>  The Special Rapporteur would like to thank Jacqui True, professor at the University of 
</p>
<p>Auckland New Zealand, for her research. The result of this research is contained in the present 
document. 
<b>2
</b>  The report builds on earlier reports on the impact of global restructuring and the attention to 
</p>
<p>economic and social rights by Radhika Coomerswamy, the previous Special Rapporteur on 
Violence against Women, its causes and consequences (E/CN.4/2000/68; E/CN.4/2001/73). 
<b>3
</b>  The report is based on a comprehensive review of literature, including reports from 
</p>
<p>United Nations and other international institutions, civil society organisations and research 
institutes. Additional inputs were provided through an expert consultation, an online discussion 
forum conducted over three weeks and from responses to two questionnaires sent to governments 
and non-governmental organizations/experts respectively. See the Annex for the lists of state 
responses to the questionnaire and of persons and organisations who were consulted or 
responded to the questionnaire. 
<b>4
</b>  In no country have women achieved the same enjoyment of economic and social rights as men. 
</p>
<p>Clair Apodaca has developed the WESHR achievement index of statistical data that measure 
progress in women&#8217;s economic and social rights in all countries that have ratified CEDAW 
across two time periods. She argues that aggregated data masks significant differences in the 
realisation of economic and social rights between males and females. &#8220;Women lag behind men in 
every indicator of economic and social rights&#8221; (Clair Apodaca. 1998. &#8220;Measuring Women&#8217;s 
Economic and Social Rights Achievement&#8221;, in <i>Human Rights Quarterly </i>20, 1: 151); Amnesty 
International, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR) and Women: A Fact Sheet.

</p>
<p>are identifiable risk factors for violence against women. At the same time, the prevalence of 
violence against women prevents women from being able to claim and enjoy their full human 
rights, including their economic and social rights. Data from around the world shows that women 
are more likely to enjoy the full range of their rights - including civil/political and 
economic/social rights and face less risks of violence in countries with greater gender equity; 
although they need not be the richest countries.<b>5</b> Within countries there is evidence that gender 
disparities in the enjoyment of human rights are greatest within poorer income groups.<b>6</b> 
3. The report develops a political economy approach to understanding and eliminating the 
causes and consequences of violence against women at all levels from the home to the 
transnational level. It goes beyond mere distributional issues to identify the entitlement structures 
that determine women&#8217;s access to productive resources and the challenges of neo-liberal policy 
environments. It also addresses the long standing feminist critique of the dichotomization 
between the &#8216;first generation&#8217; (civil and political) and &#8216;second generation&#8217; (economic, social, and 
cultural) rights as contained in the twin Covenants of 1966, namely the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR).<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>4. The first section of the report discusses the current limitations of human rights discourse 
and practice in recognizing and responding to the socioeconomic conditions that produce and 
sustain gender discrimination and violence. The second section explores how global processes 
such as neoliberal economic policies, armed conflict, natural disasters and other crises as well as 
reconstruction efforts have exacerbated violence against women and have hindered efforts to 
eliminate this violence. This is followed by an examination of the linkages between the lack of 
access to specific socio-economic rights and women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence. Particular 
attention is paid to the contexts in which violence against women occurs, as well as the risk 
factors and enabling conditions that the abrogation and enjoyment of specific economic and 
social rights represent. The report ends with conclusions and concrete recommendations for 
states, international institutions and non-state actors to respond to the structural causes and 
consequences of violence against women and ensure that women are able to achieve their full 
human rights.

<p>5. The report argues that economic destabilisation brought about by globalization processes 
and neoliberal policies purported by states and international economic institutions are 
heightening the conditions for, and increasing the extent of violence against women. Persistent 
and egregious violence against women is intertwined with the feminization of poverty, 
transnational labor exploitation, limitations on women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive rights and 
ongoing control of women&#8217;s mobility. The report concludes that an integrated approach to 
human rights, combining the obligations set out in the twin covenants on civil and political rights 
and economic, social and cultural rights is crucial for the realisation of women&#8217;s human rights 
and the elimination of violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  A POLITICAL ECONOMY APPROACH 
</b></p>
<p>6. Violence against women is a violation of human rights as established in international law. 
The forms of violence against women are often multiple and wide-ranging, including rape and 
sexual abuse, forced trafficking, intimate partner violence, female genital mutilation, maternal 
death, femicide, dowry deaths, honour killings, female infanticide, sexual harassment and forced 
and early marriage. The violation of the right to life, and liberty and security of the person, 
amongst others, shapes the enjoyment and fulfillment of all other human rights, including social 
and economic rights such as the right to work, health, social security, education, food, housing, 
water and land rights.  
</p>
<p>7. As well as a violation of human rights, violence against women is a form of systemic 
discrimination. Women are typically victims of violence because they are women, that is, based 
on gender constructions of women as inferior or subordinate to men within and across societies. 
As the CEDAW committee states, violence against women is that &#8220;directed against a woman 
because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately&#8221; (CEDAW General 
Recommendation No. 19, 11th session, 1992). Women are often subject to violence as a result of 
their gender subordination and multiple intersecting vulnerabilities between gender and their 
membership in ethnic, nationality, class, and other marginalised groups.  
</p>
<p>8. The international human rights framework has been slow to address women&#8217;s human 
rights. The bias toward violations of human rights in the public sphere has tended to privileged 
men and male victims. As a result marginalised groups of women were excluded from redress 
under international human rights law, and the principle of non-discrimination in the protection, 
prevention and enjoyment of human rights failed to be upheld. Further compounding the 
negative effects of this public-private division, violations of these rights have often been subject 
to both relativist and essentialist cultural discourses that overlook unequal and potentially 
exploitative hierarchical systems and treat women&#8217;s rights as expendable. 
</p>
<p>9. Responses to violence against women by governments and international organisations have 
been fragmented and treated in isolation from the wider concern for women&#8217;s rights and 
equality.<b>8</b> For example, data and analysis of women&#8217;s political representation, women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.6 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>economic opportunities and violence against women are frequently treated separately.<b>9</b> Proposed 
indicators and databases on violence against women are primarily aimed at measuring the 
prevalence of violence and the extent of state responses to prosecute and protect against 
violence. They do not identify the causal factors for this violence or target specific predictors of 
violence.  
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, legal and policy provisions to address violence against women have not for 
the most part, extended to the economic sphere or explored the economic causes and impact of 
violence against women. &#8220;When one thinks of women&#8217;s human rights issues, one usually thinks 
about violence against women and not about poverty, housing, unemployment, education, water, 
food security, trade and other related economic and social rights issues&#8221;.<b>10</b> The isolation of 
violence against women and sexual and reproductive rights in the women&#8217;s human rights 
movement from a broader struggle for social and economic equality has led to their perception as 
women-only problems.<b>11</b>  
</p>
<p>11. The Secretary-General&#8217;s (SG) 2006 in-depth study on violence against women 
(A/61/122/Add.1) has noted the lack of a comprehensive and integrated approach to violence 
against women.<b>12</b> This is evident for example, in the Millennium Development Goals which do 
not explicitly identify violence against women as a distinct goal. Similarly, the SG&#8217;s UNITE 
campaign launched in 2008 with the aim of stopping gender-based violence by 2015 mentions 
the structural, underlying causes and consequences of violence. But the campaign fact sheet does 
not sufficiently explore the linkages between the achievement of women&#8217;s rights to political 
participation, their degree of social and economic equality and the prevalence of violence against 
women. <b>13</b> The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the other 
hand has recognised the linkages between violence against women such as trafficking, domestic 
violence and exploitation, and women&#8217;s lack of enjoyment of economic and social rights in many 
of their comments on state reports.<b>14</b> In 2009 they expressed concern about the effects of the 
current international financial and economic crisis upon the full realization of the human rights

<p>of women and girls worldwide, including the potential increase in societal and domestic violence 
against women.<b>15</b> However, a systematic gender analysis of the socioeconomic conditions that 
may produce or increase violence against women has not been made available as of yet.  
</p>
<p>12. Such analysis of the current economic crisis is critical for developing viable solutions and 
upholding human rights standards. According to the International Labour Organisation, the 
impact of the economic crisis is expected to be more detrimental for women&#8217;s unemployment 
than for men&#8217;s in most regions of the world, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean.<b>16</b> 
Migrant women and domestic workers have been among the first to be laid off due to prevailing 
gender ideologies that consider their labour dispensable as well as their part-time, flexible and 
vulnerable work conditions.<b>17</b> In developing countries women&#8217;s incomes and family livelihoods 
will disproportionately suffer due to women&#8217;s employment concentration in export sectors such 
as manufacturing and high-value agriculture, the drop in remittances from migrant women&#8217;s care 
work and the tightened conditions for micro-finance lending to women farmers and 
entrepreneurs.<b>18</b> The World Bank predicts that up to 53 million more people will be driven to 
poverty in developing countries this year, bringing the total number of those living on less than 
$2 a day to over 1.5 billion. Girls in poor and low income countries with pre-existing low female 
schooling are highly vulnerable to being pulled out of school and may be led into sex work or 
trafficking as households cope with declining household income.<b>19</b> This will seriously jeopardize 
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals which aim to slash poverty, hunger, 
infant and maternal mortality, and illiteracy by 2015. These worrisome signs are likely to result 
in serious setbacks to the realization of gender equality and efforts to protect, prevent and 
ultimately, to eliminate violence against women. 
</p>
<p>13. By developing a political economy approach to violence against women this report aims to 
start filling a major gap in thinking and policy. A political economy approach avoids the 
compartmentalization and selective treatment of violence against women that disconnects the

<p>problem from its underlying causes and provides a framework for states and other actors to more 
fully realise their obligations to protect, prevent and fulfill women&#8217;s human rights whether in 
good or bad times.  
</p>
<p>14. Many UN agencies, governments, non-governmental organizations and experts agree that 
women&#8217;s social, political and economic <i>empowerment</i> is key to ending violence against women 
and the culture of impunity. Amnesty International Executive Director, Irene Khan asserts: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence is not only a human rights violation but also a key factor in obstructing the 
realisation of women&#8217;s and girl&#8217;s rights to security, adequate housing, health, food, 
education and participation. Millions of women find themselves locked in cycles of 
poverty and violence, cycles which fuel and perpetuate one another.&#8221; <b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>15. The 2008 African Development Forum called for attention &#8220;to underlying social and 
economic drivers of women&#8217;s vulnerabilities and equitable access&#8221;. They further stated that 
&#8220;weak economic power, subordinate social status and lack of voice define women&#8217;s experience 
across the continent&#8221; and that &#8220;within this context there are indications that violations against 
women are increasing.&#8221;<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Numerous similar observations and calls for action from women&#8217;s advocacy groups, 
development NGOs, and UN agencies suggest the need to widen the violence against women 
framework to take account of the structural causes and consequences of violence evident in 
women&#8217;s poverty and labour exploitation, their socio-economic inequality with men, and lack of 
political representation.  
</p>
<p>17. The recent attention to private sphere violations of human rights provides an opening for a 
deeper interrogation of the pervasive social and economic inequalities in the family household 
that create the conditions for abuse of power and various forms of violence. A political economy 
approach to violence against women challenges public/private and state citizenship boundaries 
implicit within the mainstream human rights system. This approach has the potential to increase 
our understanding of how social and economic rights relate to, and can be integrated with, civil 
and political human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Key elements of a political economy approach to violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>18. In contrast to conventional economics, a political economy approach makes explicit the 
linkages between the economic and the social and political. <b>22</b> From a political economy

</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  A political economy approach also highlights the considerable economic costs of violence 
</p>
<p>against women to individual women (and their capacities), government, business and society, as 
well as to future generations. These costs have been quantified as monetary estimates in many

Violence against Women&#8221;). They include direct costs to criminal justice, health, employment, 
and social welfare systems as well as opportunity costs of the failure to prevent violence. </p>

<p>perspective, power operates not only through coercion that may be visible and direct in its 
effects, but also through the material basis of relationships that govern the distribution and use of 
resources, benefits, privileges and authority within the home and society at large. Political 
economy shapes the institutional and ideological formations of society where gender identities 
and status are constructed and the boundaries of rights and freedoms determined.<b>23</b>  
</p>
<p>19. There are three key structural elements highlighted by the<b> </b>political economy approach that 
affect the likelihood and prevalence of violence against women. These three structures are 
explored in more depth in the following sections of this report. 
</p>
<p>20. The first structure is the gender division of labour within public and private spheres 
supported by gender ideologies that hold women primarily responsible for unremunerated, and 
often invisible social reproduction in the family household, thus creating inequalities in 
bargaining power in the household between men and women. As a result, despite remarkable 
increases in women&#8217;s education and employment in the public sphere, especially in developed 
countries, women still encounter intimate and interpersonal male violence in the private sphere. 
Caring professions in the public sphere and labour market akin to the unpaid work women 
traditionally do in the home are also devalued. The internationalization of reproductive work has 
extended this division of labour to the transnational realm as women workers from developing 
countries migrate to provide care services for families in wealthier countries. <b>24</b> The lack of 
sharing of reproductive roles between women and men constrains women&#8217;s public participation 
and their access to economic opportunities in the market. This structural inequality creates an 
exploitative hierarchy of roles that entraps many women in potentially violent environments. 
</p>
<p>21. The second element highlighted in this political economy analysis of women&#8217;s rights is the 
contemporary global, macro-economic environment. Capitalist free market competition has 
fuelled the transnational quest for cheap sources of labour and for investment conditions that 
maximise corporate profits. In this competition, corporations have exploited and deepened 
existing gendered inequalities in accessing productive resources such as capital, credit, land and 
education. For instance, they have employed young women migrant workers in &#8220;free trade&#8221; 
export-processing zones to take advantage of their &#8220;cheap&#8221; and &#8220;more flexible&#8221; labour, 
constructed as such by prevailing gender, class and racial ideologies.<b>25</b>

</p>
<p>22. Neoliberal trade, finance and economic stabilisation policies adopted by states have 
facilitated global competition. These policies have led to the expansion of women&#8217;s employment, 
intensification of their labour in the market and at home, and to the oft-noted feminisation of 
poverty; the latter being especially prevalent among some vulnerable groups of women due to 
women&#8217;s lower incomes, their caring responsibilities and their unequal access to productive 
resources.<b>26</b> Such poverty, marginalisation and lack of protective mechanisms render women 
easy targets for trafficking and other forms of violence and abuse. At the same time, neoliberal 
policies have reduced the state&#8217;s capacity to regulate and tax capital, resulting in an enforcement 
problem and difficulties in generating expenditure for social provisioning which could alleviate 
women&#8217;s poverty and vulnerability. Indeed the reduced enforcement and social security role of 
the state has also been accompanied by communal / &#8220;tribalizing&#8221; tendencies whereby non-state 
actors have gained power and influence in public discourse. These actors, often purporting 
religious fundamentalism, provide alternatives for education, health, housing and social support 
services for impoverished groups; at the same time they often also resist and undermine the 
universality of human rights, and in particular, women&#8217;s rights and claims to equality. <b>27</b>  
</p>
<p>23. However, the current financial crisis presents a crucial opportunity for governments, 
international institutions and other key actors to invest in social infrastructure and development 
to revive economic demand. Such investment has the potential to expand women&#8217;s economic 
opportunities and advance their rights, especially given women&#8217;s disproportionate employment 
in public services and responsibility for social welfare. Studies show that women&#8217;s economic 
participation and incomes contribute significantly to overall economic development and societal 
wellbeing; and their presence in financial and administrative institutions is associated with 
decreases in corruption.<b>28</b> Women tend to elect more conservative economic and financial 
investment options and receive better returns on their investments than men.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The third element of the political economy analysis of violence against women are the 
gendered dimensions of war/peace, which are intertwined with gender divisions of labour and

<p>the differential gender impacts of competitive globalization. Violent conflict, often related to 
control over power and productive resources, normalizes violence and spreads it throughout a 
society. Such generalized violence further undermines the material conditions for human rights 
and the prospect for peace. In particular, this state or group-sanctioned violence frequently 
celebrates masculine aggression and perpetuates impunity toward men&#8217;s violence against 
women. For instance, intimate violence against women greatly increases during and after 
conflict.<b>30</b> The Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women&#8217;s mission reports with respect to 
countries in conflict and post-conflict zones have shown the intimate link between violence 
against women, conflict and militarism.<b>31</b>  
</p>
<p>25. Conflict, war and the security agenda impoverish societies as they make trade-offs between 
military spending and spending for socioeconomic development and human rights protection; 
thus creating the conditions for severe violence against women.<b>32</b> Post-conflict reconstruction 
may involve neoliberal restructuring of the economy as well as the establishment of liberal 
political and legal systems, often with limited or no significant participation by women.<b>33</b> This 
restructuring may demand privatisation of public services and infrastructure which regresses 
women&#8217;s rights by placing a greater burden on their labour in the household.<b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>26. A political economy approach stresses that we cannot separate political stability and 
security from economic development, despite the prioritization of physical security and electoral 
machinery over social and economic security in many post-conflict situations. Insofar as women

<p>are unable to access their rights and basic services (to housing, food, health, education and so on) 
their vulnerability to violence increases. The culture of impunity toward violence against women 
that is often endemic during conflict situations may be perpetuated in peace time since women&#8217;s 
access to economic and social rights also affects their access to justice and physical security.<b>35 Integrating economic and social rights with civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>27. Efforts to transform the political-economic conditions that underlie violence against 
women and to effectively respond to the problem are greatly constrained by the dichotomization 
of the set of rights in the twin covenants, and the privileging of civil and political rights over 
economic and social rights.<b>36</b> The prevailing conception of economic, social and cultural rights 
as &#8220;aspirational&#8221; rights to be progressively realised depending on the resources available to the 
state, stands in contrast with civil and political rights which have been traditionally conceived as 
&#8220;obligatory&#8221; rights to be guaranteed in the immediate. It is a prioritization that has contributed to 
the continued subordination of women, and women&#8217;s human rights.  
</p>
<p>28. However, it is also argued that in fact both covenants assume &#8216;progressive realisation, that 
is, the continuous improvement of rights.<b>37</b> They both impose positive duties on governments to 
eliminate discrimination and hold governments legally responsible for ending violations 
immediately as far as possible.<b>38</b> &#8220;All human rights have an economic and material aspect&#8221;,<b>39</b> 
therefore, insufficient resources cannot be a defense against non-compliance with the Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<b>40</b> These rights too have minimal standards of 
compliance. States cannot for example, introduce macro-economic reforms or trade liberalisation 
policies that would undermine its compliance with obligations under the ICESCR.<b>41</b>

<p>29. Despite these human rights obligations, states have traditionally focused more on 
reforming judicial and governance structures to address human rights violations and less on 
preventive initiatives that may require fundamental alterations in economic and social structures. Yet, upholding economic and social rights in particular imposes &#8220;an affirmative obligation on 
states to meet basic needs&#8221; and this requires the implementation of practical strategies and 
methods to ensure that this outcome is achieved.<b>42</b> Advancing women&#8217;s economic and social 
rights in the context of global change and crisis situations is crucial not only to women&#8217;s 
enjoyment of civil and political rights, but also for preventing violence against women and 
protecting women and girls from the risks of violence and exploitation. Thus, a political 
economy approach to women&#8217;s rights compels us to rethink the dichotomisation of rights and 
search for ways to conceptually and practically realise the universal, indivisibility of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Economic rationales for eliminating violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>30. A political economy approach analyses the affect of economic and social inequalities on 
women&#8217;s enjoyment of their rights but it also highlights the economic costs of violence against 
women. These economic costs include direct costs as well as opportunity-costs of the failure to 
prevent violence to individual women (and their capacities), to government, business and 
society, and to future generations.<b>  </b> 
</p>
<p>31. In terms of the costs to individual women, gender-based violence in public and private 
spheres prevents women from being able to access economic opportunities, livelihoods and 
welfare benefits. Studies have shown that women who are victims of domestic violence typically 
earn less income across their lifetime than women who have not been victims of violence. For 
instance, one such study in Managua, Nicaragua, found that women victims of domestic violence 
earned just 57 per cent of the income of their unaffected colleagues.<b>43</b> A Bolivian rural women&#8217;s 
organisation found that it could not equally distribute agricultural land for farming to women and 
men unless they addressed the problem of domestic violence as part of their development  
work - the absences of women participants due to injuries suffered from domestic violence were 
too frequent.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The economic costs of violence against women to business and government are 
considerable. Health care, employment, productivity, and criminal justice costs have now been 
calculated in many states, in order to raise awareness of the problem of violence and the need for

<p>all organisations to collectively address it. For instance, the Australian government has estimated 
that violence against women costs government 14.2 billion dollars per annum. In another study, 
it was assessed that the cost of violence against women in the United Kingdom is equivalent to 
more than 550 euros per resident annually.<b>45</b> In Fiji, the cost of domestic violence has been 
calculated at $300 million per annum or about 7 per cent of Gross National Product.<b>46</b> Estimates 
of lost wages due to family violence amounted to 1.6 and 2.0% of Gross Domestic Product in 
Nicaragua and Chile respectively.<b>47</b> In the United States, preventive measures in the Violence 
against Women Act are considered to have saved the country 16.4 billion dollars.<b>48</b> In 2003, the 
Columbian national government spent approx US$73.7 mil (0.6% of their national budget) to 
prevent, detect and offer services to survivors of family violence. 
</p>
<p>33. It is considerably more difficult to quantify the costs of violence against women to a 
society and its development as well as to future generations. However, many studies have 
documented the impact of this violence on the children of women victims. Researchers in 
Nicaragua found that children of women who were physically and sexually abused by their 
partners were six times more likely than other children to die before the age of five, with one 
third of all child deaths in this setting being attributed to partner violence.<b>49</b> Violence against 
women hinders mothers from being able to take care of their families, trapping generations in a 
cycle of poverty. Wife abuse has been linked to decreased nutritional status in children due to 
women&#8217;s decreased chances of controlling income.<b>50</b> This creates a range of challenges for the

<p>health and education of future generations.<b>51</b> Similarly, the health of women who have suffered 
violence and HIV has a negative effect on their children as well as their economic activity; thus 
creating a cycle of poverty, poor health and vulnerability to more violence.<b>52</b> There is sound 
evidence that women who are economically independent and have some decision-making 
authority in the family will spend their income on food, healthcare, and education for their 
children.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>34. Violence against women needs to be systematically challenged on all levels if women&#8217;s 
human rights are to be realised and women&#8217;s economic and social status is to advance. Human 
rights commitments need to be combined with more instrumental economic rationales so as to 
focus attention on transforming the structural causes and consequences of violence against 
women. A human rights focus provides a powerful normative framework for holding states 
accountable and for empowering women as active claimants of rights. <b>54</b>  
</p>
<p><b>II. THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL CHANGE AND CRISES 
ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p>35. Patterns of violence against women, their causes and consequences are integrally linked to 
patterns of global transformation instigated by economic, political, military and natural 
environmental forces. This section aims to identify and address those linkages by focusing on 
strategic sites where political-economic processes can be seen to be maintaining or creating the 
structural gender inequalities that underpin violence against women. It points to the role and 
responsibility of states, corporations, international institutions and civil society actors in 
mitigating violence against women by attending to the underlying structural inequalities between 
women and men that are created and reinforced by macro-economic and state-building 
processes. 
</p>
<p><b>Violence against women:  the underside of global processes 
</b></p>
<p>36. Globalization has brought about a significant movement in the geographical location, 
occupation, and social position of women. It has expanded women&#8217;s formal economic 
participation, while leaving unchanged the underlying patriarchal structures that perpetuate 
women&#8217;s inequality with men, and their susceptibility to violence. Women&#8217;s labour has become 
part of the competitive dynamic of globalization, yet a large number of women workers in the

<p>informal economy, care sector and in unpaid work often fall outside of recognized labour 
standards and the human rights system. These women are highly vulnerable to new forms of 
gender-based violence associated with the displacement of populations, sex trafficking, 
home-based production, restrictive immigration and exploitation of local and migrant workers 
especially around special economic zones and large developments.   
</p>
<p>37. Structural adjustment policies imposed by international institutions have disproportionately 
affected women and &#8220;have led to increased impoverishment, displacement and internal strife 
resulting from the political instabilities caused by devaluing national currencies, increasing debt 
and dependence on foreign investment&#8221;.<b>55</b> Conflict, war and natural disaster have further 
impoverished societies as they make trade-offs between military spending and spending for 
social and economic development, creating conditions for severe violence against women.<b>56</b> 
Moreover, post-conflict and disaster reconstruction processes often maintain the culture of 
impunity toward violence against women and introduce new forms of gender discrimination in 
economic and political institutions that fuel violence against women and girls. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Competitive globalization 
</b></p>
<p>38. One of the ways we see economic globalization processes increasing or perpetuating 
violence against women is through men&#8217;s reactions to these processes and the loss of male 
entitlement they often bring about. Global competition seeks to lower the costs of production and 
to the extent that women&#8217;s labour is cheaper (because of the devaluation of women in the private 
sphere), firms may prefer to hire women over men especially in competitive, export-oriented 
industries. Thus, where neoliberal reforms and restructuring open up economies to global 
competition there may be more opportunities for women to enter the labour market and gain 
economic independence. In this context, some studies suggest that violence against women may 
actually rise as women assume non-traditional roles and gain greater access to these 
socio-economic opportunities and resources; this is despite the association between women&#8217;s 
employment and empowerment in indicators like the gender development index.<b>57</b> Women&#8217;s 
increasing economic activity and independence may be viewed as a threat which leads to 
increased male violence. This is particularly true when the male partner is unemployed, and feels 
his power undermined in the household.<b>58</b>

<p>39. Masculine identities that have been constructed as breadwinner identities, assuming control 
over income and resources as well as women, are threatened by women&#8217;s newly valued 
economic roles.<b>59</b> Where globalization processes undermine these masculine identities we have 
seen increased levels of violence. In the context of neoliberal restructuring and economic crises, 
men may be unable to find alternative employment which fulfils their visions of themselves as 
breadwinners. This may lead them to act out violently against women and children in the home 
and in public spaces compensating for the loss of economic control. Research evidence also 
shows that a reduction in male incomes challenges norms of masculinity and exacerbates 
tensions between men and women.<b>60</b> It has been argued, for example, that in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, the severely inequitable distribution of wealth is one of the chief factors fuelling a 
rise in the rates of domestic violence, which is also one of the highest rates in the world.<b>61</b> Yet, 
because conventional economic analysis and human rights law do not consider power dynamics 
in the household &#8220;the relationship between high returns to business and poverty and violence 
[against women] at the household level remains invisible&#8221;.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>40. In South Africa where there is a history of state-sponsored violence and the contemporary 
context includes significant levels of poverty, unemployment and crime, several forms of 
violence against women, including rape, are prevalent. In one epidemiological study, it has been 
argued that rape plays a crucial role in male peer group positioning and that it must be 
understood within the context of the limited number of other recreational opportunities available 
to poor, township and rural youth. &#8220;Competition over women has achieved overwhelming 
importance because it is one of the few available and affordable opportunities for entertainment

<p>and arenas where success may be achieved and self-esteem gained&#8221;.<b>63</b> Given the context of 
poverty, relationships and the input of resources they require may not be realistic options, and 
rape and violence may be more readily deployed to seek goals.  
</p>
<p>41. A recent study of fifteen men and their female partners recruited via two agencies that 
provide programs for victims and perpetrators of intimate violence, also reveals the intersection 
between men&#8217;s economic disempowerment and domestic violence against women.<b>64</b> The study 
investigated how in a globalising South Africa where there are more economic opportunities for 
women and rising male unemployment, men attempt to maintain their hold on dominant forms of 
masculinity through the perpetration of violence. Interviews with men revealed that their ideas of 
&#8220;successful masculinity&#8221; were linked to their ability to become or remain economic providers for 
the family. Men facing chronic unemployment described feeling powerless and employed this 
feeling as a justification for violence against women.<b>65</b>  
42. In a different context, that of globalising Kuwait, some men also appear to be reacting 
against liberalization through women. Studies examining the protest of Islamic fundamentalists 
against political, economic and cultural liberalization, have found that their resistance to 
economic restructuring is expressed through the prevalence of violence against women, which 
draws on traditional patriarchal discourses and objectifies women as symbols of liberalisation.<b>66</b> 
&#8220;[W]omen are implicated&#8230;not only because they are themselves objects of value and symbols 
of communal identity, but also because their emancipation introduces a new class of competitors 
for political and economic positions&#8221;.<b>67</b> In the struggle between tradition and economic 
liberalization women are subject to men&#8217;s violence in their quest to maintain their dominant 
masculine identity and place. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Free trade zones 
</b></p>
<p>43. Trade liberalization has facilitated the globalization of export-oriented, labour-intensive 
industries. The creation of free trade zones exacerbates gendered inequalities and creates 
unregulated environments in which violence against women thrives. These industries, set up in 
&#8220;free trade&#8221; or special economic zones exempt from many government regulations, have largely 
employed women&#8217;s labour; often young, migrant women from rural areas hired on temporary

<p>contract at lower wages than men with minimal benefits. Violence against women workers, 
including abuse of reproductive rights, sexual harassment, rape and femicide, has been prevalent 
in many of these free trade zones in developing countries.<b>68</b>  
</p>
<p>44. The cases of femicide in Ciudad Juarez on the US-Mexico border where &#8220;Maquiladora&#8221; 
factories are located, are an example of the destabilizing effects of neoliberal globalization. For 
instance, it is estimated that many of the more than 400 young women who have been murdered 
or disappeared in Ciudad Juarez since 1993 were employed in these factories.<b>69</b> Thousands of 
young rural women came to Mexico&#8217;s tax-free border cities when the 1992 NAFTA agreement 
liberalized trade with the United States and the Mexican government created these zones to 
attract foreign investment. It is argued that they were treated as dispensable workers and 
constructed as &#8220;cheap labour&#8221; (relative to men), leading to high male unemployment in the 
border cities and towns.<b>70 </b></p>
<p>45. Studies show that the influx of these young women workers resulted in lower wages for all, 
which combined with male unemployment lead to the development of resentment toward young 
women workers. In this context, it has been argued that multinational firms and the states 
concerned failed to protect these women from targeted, violent abuse.<b>71</b> It is further argued that 
just as women are emerging as new, consequential political and economic actors their citizen and 
human rights to personal security were dispensed with.<b>72</b>

<p>46. The femicides in Ciudad Juarez were the subject of the Commission&#8217;s first inquiry under 
the optional protocol of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (CEDAW) undertaken by the CEDAW Committee.<b>73</b> The report of the 
Committee revealed the inherent vulnerability to violence of women in the border city: &#8220;they 
were young, come from other parts of Mexico, living in poverty, working in <i>maquilas </i>where 
protection for their personal security was poor, subject to deception and force&#8221; (paras. 63-64). 
The Committee observed that the women did not enjoy their basic social and economic rights 
including the right to decent work, education, health care, housing, sanitation infrastructure and 
lighting (para. 289). The panel recommended ensuring compliance with the human rights 
provisions of CEDAW (para. 290).<b>74</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Trade liberalisation has heightened various forms of violence against women workers in 
other poor, developing countries. In Lesotho the rapid growth of the garment industry due to 
liberalization increased the employment opportunities for young women. Women took up these 
opportunities and often also the breadwinner role due to men&#8217;s retrenchment from unskilled mine 
work in South Africa. Women workers who were also mothers faced greater risk of maternal and 
child, perinatal mortality because their long and inflexible work hours made it difficult to care 
for themselves during pregnancy as well as for their babies by attending medical clinics, 
recuperating from birth, breastfeeding and so on.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>48. The liberalisation of industries may also involve importing foreign male workers. If the 
local economic context is impoverished, their presence may encourage the development of 
prostitution and sex trafficking as well as gender-based violence. For example, it is argued that 
liberalisation of the fisheries industry in the Pacific has encouraged the development of 
prostitution and sex trafficking on shore, and gender-based violence, which has been shown to 
rise during an economic recession or crisis such as the loss of markets. <b>76</b> A case study of Padang 
province in Papua New Guinea has linked the development of canneries by multinational firms 
to an increase in the sex-trade, child prostitution and HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many women 
working in fisheries processing plants in PNG and Fiji are unmarried and face problems of

<p>security and harassment, especially when they either live at cannery hostels or travel to and from 
their shifts in darkness.<b>77</b> In the Solomon Islands, local government officials have accused 
foreign logging companies not only of exploiting their natural forestry resources but of 
exploiting teenage girls. Loggers from Asian countries working for multinational companies are 
said to employ these girls to work as domestic live-in servants, subjecting them to sexual abuse 
and leaving them pregnant when they return home.<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Transitions to market economies 
</b></p>
<p>49. The destabilization of economic patterns in society by macro-economic policies, including 
structural adjustment policies that facilitate a states&#8217; global integration, is associated with 
growing inequalities and increasing levels of violence against women in several regions, 
including Latin America, Africa and Asia.<b>79</b> The market transitions in Central and Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union led to widespread increases in poverty, unemployment, 
hardship, income inequality, stress and violence against women. These factors also indirectly 
raised women&#8217;s vulnerability by encouraging more risk-taking behaviour, more alcohol and drug 
abuse, the breakdown of social support networks, and the economic dependence of women on 
their partners.<b>80</b> 
</p>
<p>50. Some have viewed Eastern Europe and Central Asia as &#8220;test regions&#8221; for judging the 
impact of neoliberal policies.<b>81</b> Rather than revealing positive impacts of market reform, almost 
all the countries in these regions have exhibited regressions in women&#8217;s economic and social

<p>status. <b>82</b> The biggest regression in the economic status of women has been in Eastern Europe 
according to Social Watch&#8217;s 2008 Gender Equity Index. As well as increases in rape and 
domestic violence, this region has seen hundreds of thousands of young women trafficked for 
prostitution and other indentured labour each year due to the consequences emanating from 
economic liberalization. 
</p>
<p>51. Women are often the hardest hit by economic transition, financial crises and rising 
unemployment. &#8220;Economic and political insecurity provoke private and public backlash against 
women&#8217;s rights that may be expressed through violence and articulated in the form of defending 
cultures and traditions&#8221;.<b>83</b> Widespread discrimination against girls and women in education, 
employment and business, and the lack of a state social safety net can mean they are not 
protected from violence when economies rapidly expand and contract. Economic liberalisation 
and export-oriented development in East Asia has had detrimental impacts on women and girls 
due to patriarchal family-firm structures and the lesser value attributed to women&#8217;s paid and 
unpaid labour. There is considerable evidence that economic growth in East Asian countries was 
accelerated by increasing women&#8217;s employment, while at the same time widening gender wage 
gaps in the labour market.<b>84</b> 
</p>
<p>52. When the Asian Financial Crisis hit in 1997-1998, the impact on women and girls was 
disproportionate. Girls were removed from school to help at home or they were forced to seek 
work in the sex sector to support household incomes as a result of cutbacks in public service 
jobs and salaries. <b>85</b> In some East Asian countries women&#8217;s paid labour intensified while in 
others, their labour participation shrunk. The resulting increased financial burdens strained

<p>intra-household relationships, boosted suicides, family violence and abandonment.<b>86</b> In the 
context of the current financial and economic crisis, such trends from past crisis could provide 
important lessons and point to more effective mitigation measures, policy reforms and solutions.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Migrant women workers 
</b></p>
<p>53. Economic globalization has increased the demand for women&#8217;s cheap labour, especially in 
the growing service sector. The employment and/or use of foreign-born women extends across 
an increasingly broad range of economic sectors, from prostitution and sex work, to domestic 
service and childcare, and including highly regulated occupations such as nursing.<b>87</b> Neoliberal 
structural reforms and the failure of development policies have created unemployment, reduced 
social services and increased poverty, requiring more women to become income-earners for their 
families. Migration has been one option for women to receive an income and provide economic 
security for their families and communities. Women are often chosen by their families to migrate 
based on the expectation that they will sacrifice themselves to a greater degree than men for the 
welfare of their families - i.e., work harder, remit a higher proportion of their earnings, spend 
less on themselves, and endure worse living conditions.<b>88</b> At the same time, the expansion of 
women&#8217;s labour market participation in developed countries and the reduction of state welfare 
provisions have fuelled a growing demand for workers in domestic and social services, 
especially caregivers of children, the elderly, sick and invalid persons. 
</p>
<p>54. Remittances from international migration in 2005 totaled US$251 billion and have had a 
significant impact on diminishing poverty in developing countries,<b>89</b> although these remittances 
have been falling since the onset of the financial crisis with households cutting back on services. 
The outcome is a significant feminizing of global survival - not just of the women themselves, 
but of their households and governments, particularly due to the impoverishment and 
indebtedness of economies in the global South.  
</p>
<p>55. Migration reinforces and deepens existing gender, race and class inequalities. It is a 
gendered process, inseparable from the devaluation of a broad range of jobs associated with 
&#8220;women&#8217;s work&#8221;, now carried out by a growing, mostly foreign female &#8220;serving class&#8221;

<p>especially in global cities and wealthy countries.<b>90</b> Neoliberal economic policies have increased 
the number of women migrating for work, the type of work they inevitably do and their situation 
of vulnerability to violence in this employment position. In 2005 women were nearly half of all 
economic migrants (95 out of 191 million) and they dominate in migration streams to developed 
countries. As well as financially supporting their families, the pressures for women to migrate 
may include escaping from an unhappy marriage or a violent husband, or the social pressure to 
marry in patriarchal societies.<b>91</b> 
</p>
<p>56. Violence may become part of the employment relationship due to the highly unequal 
power relations at work based on the combined oppressions of gender, class, nationality and 
ethnicity.<b>92</b> Migrant women workers are frequently exploited in poorly paid and often 
unregulated employment as nurses, maids, nannies and sex workers. They are inherently 
vulnerable to violence working in poor conditions with low social status, living in degrading 
housing situations, and lacking basic legal protections and opportunities for redress. Domestic 
workers do not enjoy the basic labour protections that most governments guarantee for other 
workers. They are typically excluded from standard labour laws such as minimum wage, regular 
payment of wages, a weekly day off and paid leave. Employers evade domestic labour laws and 
governments rarely monitor their observance in the domestic sphere.<b>93</b> Labour-sending countries 
often have an economic incentive to ignore their breach as they benefit from the high levels of 
remittances and may not wish to jeopardise their relations with relevant host countries. 
57. A study of foreign female domestic servants in Malaysia describes how the government&#8217;s 
export-led industrialization strategy is based on a system of social reproduction that brings

<p>often derision in the popular media. The poor treatment of domestic workers has to do with their 
location in the private sphere, where as non-family members they provoke fears and where the 
normative assumption that a man is king in his own household reigns.<b>95</b>  
</p>
<p>58. It has been argued that international institutions, employers, business, and national 
governments can be viewed as complicit in the human rights abuse and violence against migrant 
women given that domestic workers are not afforded the same basic labour protections 
guaranteed to other workers.<b>96</b> Structural inequalities in global trade regimes allow freedom of 
movement for investors and professionals typically from developed countries but limit the 
movement and rights of low-skilled workers usually from developing countries. Very few 
countries have ratified the international conventions that extend citizenship and labour rights to 
migrant workers. Just twenty-three per cent of states have ratified the 1949 ILO Convention on 
Migration for Employment, only ten per cent have ratified the 1975 ILO Convention Concerning 
Migration in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and the 
Treatment of Migrant Workers, and a mere seventeen per cent of states have signed the 1990 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families.<b>97</b> There are direct linkages between violence against migrant women workers 
and the failure of states to protect women&#8217;s economic and social rights by monitoring labour 
standards and ensuring access to adequate housing, education, and alternative employment 
opportunities.<b>98</b>

<p>59. Migrant women working in the sex sector and women and children trafficked for sexual 
exploitation face extreme vulnerabilities. Trafficking is the dark underside of migration and 
inseparable from processes of globalization and trade liberalisation.<b>99</b> Trafficking needs to be

production and services, and needs to be part of trade policy discussions at the World Trade 
Organisation.<b>101</b>  
</p>
<p>60. Increasing rates of trafficking are linked with women&#8217;s low socio-economic status and 
their lack of economic rights in the context of neoliberal globalization.<b>102</b> The majority of 
trafficked women have made a decision to migrate in search of better economic opportunities, 
not to be abducted, kidnapped, or to work in indentured labour conditions. State policies that 
treat trafficked women as criminals or mere victims in need of rescue and rehabilitation fail to 
take account of their economic agency and their human rights in the prevention, protection and 
prosecution of trafficking. States often seek to control women and police their bodies rather than 
empower them.<b>103</b> Indeed, some argue that it is not migration for sex work that should be 
abolished, but rather the power relations between trafficked women and traffickers that involves 
physical, psychological and economic violence against women as well as violation of many other 
human rights. When slavery was abolished, for instance, it was the power relationship that was 
abolished, not working in the cotton fields or in domestic work.<b>104</b> 
</p>
<p>61. Globalization introduces new vulnerabilities to violence, as well as offering potential for 
empowerment through labour migration. But neoliberal government policies that fail to attend to 
the basic social and economic entitlements of individuals and families make violence against 
women a more likely outcome than empowerment for women.<b>105</b> Restrictive immigration 
policies focused on national security and a narrow construal of economic interests lead to greater 
economic exploitation, physical abuse and violence against migrant women workers. Research

<p>evidence shows that where countries have male biased immigration laws, women migrants are 
more vulnerable to violence.<b>106</b> Rather than restricting women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; right to migrate and 
seek work, &#8220;the real challenge lies in creating the guarantees for them to do so safely and with 
dignity&#8221;.<b>107 </b>Migration can increase women&#8217;s self-esteem, personal autonomy and social and 
economic status. It may enable them to generate the income to become property owners in their 
local communities and to begin small businesses. It will almost certainly improve their 
bargaining position within the household and allow them to enjoy increased social recognition 
from the community as a whole - all of which are factors predicted and proven to lessen 
women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence.<b>108</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Women in post-crisis reconstruction and state-building 
</b></p>
<p>62. It is by now well-documented that sexual and physical violence against women increases 
as a direct result of armed conflict and humanitarian crises such as natural disasters. The large 
scale rape of women, for example, has been a military strategy in countless historical and recent 
conflicts.<b>109</b> The causes of armed conflict are often linked with attempts to control economic 
resources such as oil, metal, diamonds, drugs or contested territorial boundaries.<b>110</b> Violence 
against women may be one way to achieve this control. In the Ugandan civil war women were

</p>
<p><b>106
</b>  This is because of several reasons. Firstly, where women are admitted into the country as a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;dependent&#8221; on their husbands&#8217; visa, the power relations within the family shift, and there is an 
increase in the rates of domestic violence. Also in these situations women are unable to leave 
their abusive husbands because they may then lose their visa. Secondly, where women are 
unable to secure legal migration they may resort to trafficking or smuggling and working the 
informal sector where they are much more vulnerable to violence. Thirdly, where visa and 
migration laws do not give migrant women full access to social services such as counseling or 
heath care, they are more vulnerable to violence. Finally, where women&#8217;s visas are tied to their 
place of employment, they cannot leave without losing their immigration status, even if their 
employment situation is abusive. See: Varia, &#8220;Globalization Comes Homes&#8221;; and also, <i>Human

<p>feel themselves powerless and unable to fulfill their duty to protect their families.<b>117</b> This can 
arouse men&#8217;s resentment and erupt in violence against women family members, especially if 
women are the economic providers.<b>118</b> Indeed, women often become heads of households during 
times of conflict or in the aftermath of a disaster, as men may be out fighting, be killed, or elect 
to leave the affected area in order to look for work elsewhere. Women who are left behind thus 
become primarily responsible for their family&#8217;s survival. Even when a political settlement has 
been achieved organized crime may perpetuate political violence and violence against women.  
</p>
<p>65. Failure to address women&#8217;s social and economic rights in post-conflict situations, 
&#8220;contribute[s] to women&#8217;s economic poverty and material insecurity and thus, their vulnerability 
to being trafficked. Begging and prostitution, which may be resorted to as a means of redressing 
poverty, create further vulnerability to violence and trafficking&#8221;.<b>119</b> The invisibility of violence 
against women both during and after the conflict/disaster is over, exacerbates gender inequalities 
and marginalizes women in reconstruction and state-building processes despite UN Security 
Council Resolution 1325 (S. /RES/1325 (2000), which recognizes the right of women to 
participate in these processes.<b>120</b> This has been the case in Timor Leste, Afghanistan and Iraq, for 
instance, where few women have held decision-making positions in reconstruction or 
state-building agencies and efforts. Despite a UN directive in East Timor calling for thirty 
percent of all national and district hiring within every classification/level of employment to be of 
women, this commitment was not realized.<b>121</b> In Iraq only three out of twenty-five members of 
the US-led Coalition Provisional authority were women, there was only one woman in the 
interim cabinet, and no woman was part of the drafting committee for the interim constitution.

<p>66. The lack of political representation and participation of women is in part a consequence of 
the gender inequality in the enjoyment of economic and social rights and of women&#8217;s 
experiences of violence in the public realm. However, when this gender imbalance in 
decision-making is sanctioned by the international community, it reinforces local hostility 
toward women&#8217;s public involvement, including on religious grounds. Most women candidates 
refused to campaign in public in the lead-up to the January 2005 elections in Iraq because of 
fears of violence. Men feared violence too but the violence perpetrated against women has 
religious support.<b>122</b>  
</p>
<p>67. However, some research suggests women can be empowered in post crisis situations by 
transforming gender roles and women&#8217;s place in society.<b>123</b> Certainly, there are opportunities for 
addressing endemic problems in society and improving the economic and social rights of citizens 
during the rebuilding of societies after crises, but these opportunities often discriminate against 
women.<b>124</b> For example, in the early phases of state-building it is common to designate mass 
employment opportunities for men, such as road-building and housing construction, which 
typically offer quick employment to large numbers of men. But mass employment opportunities 
for women that are culturally acceptable are not typically planned or implemented. For example, 
in the first years of the Afghan reconstruction, external actors had a limited vision of women&#8217;s 
economic activity, such as in the form of sewing projects.<b>125</b> 
68. At the time of the UN transitional administration in East Timor (UNTAET) domestic 
violence against women was pervasive across the whole society.<b>126</b> In 2000, forty per cent of all 
offences committed against women were by male family members.<b>127</b> Some argue that 
international and Timorese policy makers turned their attention to establishing formal legal and 
political institutions rather than addressing as an equal priority, the basic economic and social 
needs of society, as well as the culture of impunity and the human rights violations rampant in

<p>the private sphere.<b>128</b> The eighty percent unemployment rate in urban areas partly explains the 
high prevalence of family violence. &#8220;Violence within the family became a way for men to 
reassert their domestic power&#8221;.<b>129</b> This situation in Timor is not atypical of other conflicts and 
reconstruction processes.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  Women&#8217;s survival strategies 
</b></p>
<p>69. Women&#8217;s survival strategies and mechanisms for coping in the context of economic 
austerity and competitive globalization have increased their vulnerability to violence. The 
erosion of state social security systems and the lack of economic security across many parts of 
the world has led to the feminisation of poverty and the exploitation of both paid and unpaid 
female labour. Migration for domestic or sex work and marriage under conditions of male 
violence can be seen in this light, shaped by the lack of better economic opportunities in local 
communities.  
</p>
<p>70. This report has identified a number of risk factors and groups of women and girls who are 
particularly vulnerable to violence due to their limited/lack of access to economic and social 
rights as a result of local patriarchal norms and global economic structures. The report has 
revealed the interconnectedness of human rights, namely between economic and social, and civil 
and political rights (in the twin covenants) and has highlighted the multiple, cross-cutting nature 
of violations suffered by women and girls. Violence against women is a violation of the right to 
life and to physical security but also of a whole range of economic and social rights. Increasingly 
women are organising to claim and defend their full economic and social rights in the context of 
gender injustices and gender-based violence they suffer in their workplaces, factories, homes and 
communities. This cross-cultural human rights activism targets global economic policies and 
actors as well as state and local patriarchal structures. 
</p>
<p>71. For many women - especially poor women, IDP and refugee women, survivors of conflict 
and disaster, women migrant workers, women in the informal sector, single mothers, indigenous 
women and others from minority ethnic groups, tribal groups and lower social castes - human 
rights are not a luxury that can only be addressed once national and global economic interests are 
secured or when a country is sufficiently wealthy. Even economic rationales for ending violence 
against women, such as those based on a determination of the costs to governments and business 
of failing to eradicate violence against women or the benefits of promoting greater gender 
equality and non-violence, will not help these women in the short to medium term. What is

social and economic rights are an integral and essential condition for addressing violence against 
women as well as other human rights violations.

<p><b>III.  VIOLATIONS OF WOMEN&#8217;S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>72. Globalization, conflict and post-conflict processes have deepened unequal gender 
structures, thus further constraining women&#8217;s access to social and economic rights. 
Governments, non-state actors and international organizations need to work together to create 
enabling conditions for the enjoyment of these economic and social rights. Doing so would 
represent a major step toward eliminating violence against women, its causes and consequences. 
This section focuses on the relationship between violence against women and violations of 
women&#8217;s economic and social rights, such as <i>inter alia</i>: the right to adequate housing, property, 
inheritance, food, water, education, health, and the right to decent work and social security. 
Without attention to the provision of basic economic and social rights, and gender equality in the 
enjoyment of these rights, efforts to protect and prevent violence against women are unlikely to 
be successful.  
</p>
<p><b>Overview of women&#8217;s status and violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>73. The United Nations Population Fund reports: &#8220;women and girls are three fifths of the 
world&#8217;s one billion poorest people, women are two-thirds of the 960 million adults in the world 
who cannot read, and girls are 70 per cent of the 130 million children who are out of school&#8221;.<b>130</b> 
They own less than two percent of the world&#8217;s property. Furthermore, the numbers of women 
dying as consequences of pregnancy and childbirth are essentially unchanged since the 1980s, at 
about 536,000 per year.<b>131</b> This overview of the status of women leads us to ask whether the 
greatest violence against women occurs in contexts where women&#8217;s social and economic rights 
are the least secure? 
</p>
<p>74. Using data from the World Health Organisation 2005 study on the prevalence of sexual 
violence perpetrated by a partner during a women&#8217;s lifetime in ten countries,<b>132</b> it has been found 
that there is a statistical correlation between countries scoring high on the gender development 
index (GDI) and those countries with lower rates of violence against women. Conversely, the 
lower the levels of human and gender development, the higher were the levels of violence 
against women.<b>133</b> Thus, women are more likely to enjoy economic and social rights and an

<p>environment enabling them to prevent at least some forms of violence, in countries with greater 
gender equity. According to the Social Watch Gender Equity Index for 2008, which ranks 
157 countries on their progress on gender equity in education, economic participation and 
political empowerment, income alone is no guarantee for gender equity. Countries with very 
high per capita incomes, such as Luxembourg and Switzerland, have the same equity level as 
Mozambique, a country with a much lower income level.<b>134</b> Among the countries with the 
highest achievement of gender equity is Rwanda, one of the poorest countries.  
</p>
<p>75. Violence against women is linked to women&#8217;s economic rights and status but not in a 
straightforward way.<b>135</b> One study found that all women except the wealthiest quintile 
experienced domestic violence in the Dominican Republic, and in Haiti women in the 3rd quintile 
were most likely to experience domestic violence while in Cambodia those in the poorest 
quintile were most likely to experience violence.<b>136</b> However, studies also suggest that violence 
against women may actually rise as women initially gain greater access to social and economic 
opportunities and resources, and in some settings, women in the poorest households may also be 
somewhat protected from violence.<b>137</b> Women&#8217;s increasing economic activity and independence 
is often viewed as a direct threat to male dominance, which may lead to increased male violence. 
&#8220;Where women have a very low status, violence is not &#8216;needed&#8217; to enforce male authority. 
Partner violence is thus usually highest at the point where women begin to assume 
non-traditional roles or enter the workforce&#8221;.<b>138</b> An example of this trend is the apparent increase 
in acid attacks in Bangladesh despite increases in the proportion of Bangladeshi women 
obtaining a higher education and in paid employment.<b>139</b> 
</p>
<p>76. Amartya Sen argues in <i>Development as Freedom </i>that greater economic independence 
gives women a &#8220;better deal&#8221; in intra-household distribution of resources.<b>140</b> Corroborating this 
argument, in one count-data analysis of instances of domestic violence it was found that less

</p>
<p>economic dependence is associated with less domestic violence against women.<b>141</b> To be sure, if 
women are economically and emotionally dependent on men they will be afraid of leaving 
violent family structures or seeking help, and may be unable to access alternative housing.<b>142</b> In 
patriarchal cultures where women&#8217;s sexual purity and ability to bear children is highly valued, 
being raped may bar a woman from accessing their only claim to economic resources, that is, 
through their relationships to men. Economic dependence or lack of economic opportunities 
leads women to become trafficked for prostitution or domestic slavery, or suffer forced marriage 
or sex, as has been documented in many countries. <b>143</b> 
</p>
<p>77. But there is also an indirect relationship between economic dependence and the prevalence 
of violence against women. Political science research reveals that where women hold the 
weakest position in the economy, in terms of their labour market participation and wages relative 
to men, their political preferences are the least distinct from men&#8221;.<b>144</b> That is, where women are 
economically dependent on men, they are likely to be politically subordinate as well. This 
political subordination typically results in women being underrepresented politically and in 
economic decision-making structures; thus lacking the influence over policies that might 
safeguard their interests and prevent or combat violence against women, such as policies that 
would promote effective, gender-sensitive criminal and civil justice systems and welfare 
provisions.<b>145</b> Without such policies, violence against women is unlikely to be identified as  
an important social issue, let alone prosecuted or prevented. As Navi Pillay, the UN  
High Commissioner for Human Rights, states: &#8220;Efforts to combat violence against women will 
never be fully successful while national legal frameworks to protect them, and grant them the 
possibility of economic and social independence remain inadequate&#8221;. <b>146</b>

<p>78. The remainder of this section examines the empirical connections between the enjoyment 
or lack thereof, of specific economic and social rights, women&#8217;s empowerment, and violence 
against women. This analysis reveals that violence against women acts as a barrier to women&#8217;s 
realization of their economic and social rights, but also that, in turn, the lack of access to these 
rights renders women inherently vulnerable to violence. The interconnectedness of economic and 
social rights is continually highlighted and the need for an integrated approach to their 
achievement is stressed, especially for the poorest and most marginalized women who are 
subjected to ongoing violence. 
</p><p>79. Women&#8217;s ability to access and control productive resources is an important exercise of 
their right to develop their human capabilities and live a dignified human life. Women&#8217;s status is 
significantly less than men&#8217;s in most societies, in large part because of the lesser control they 
have over economic and social resources. These resources include adequate housing, ownership 
or control over land and property, access to food and water, enjoyment of education and health, 
and access to paid employment and social security.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>80. The right to adequate housing includes not only security of tenure but also access to public 
services, and participation in the physical, social, legal and economic environments.  
</p>
<p>81. Lack of adequate housing can trigger violence against women and conversely, violence 
against women can lead to the violation of women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing.<b>147</b> Many women 
suffer violence in order to avoid homelessness or because of it. Those especially at risk of 
violence because they have difficulty accessing alternative housing include female 
internally-displaced persons or refugees, domestic workers, poor single mothers, and women 
living in States without safe shelters or affordable long term housing for abused women. Victims 
of domestic violence are also routinely denied access to housing due to discrimination on the part 
of landlords and others.<b>148</b> 
</p>
<p>82. Testimonies from women&#8217;s groups in several countries reveal that women remain subject 
to domestic violence and do not leave abusive relationships if they have no chance of securing 
independent housing. Domestic violence is closely linked to being able to make decisions about 
property and security of tenure. Ownership and control over property acts as a control in

<p>situations of domestic violence. Where women are unable to form autonomous households, they 
do not exercise freedom of choice over having a spouse or partner and over the allocation of their 
labour.<b>149</b>  
</p>
<p>83. Poor women living in urban, high-density housing are especially at risk of high rates of 
domestic violence. For example, women living in plantation line housing in Sri Lanka with three 
families to one dwelling reported being beaten by their husbands very often. Due to a lack of 
privacy in the dwelling the women felt uncomfortable having sexual relations with their 
husbands, which led to the violence.<b>150</b> Reports indicate that many women trying to escape 
violence in rural communities flee to cities and urban slums and end up in high density housing 
where they encounter many forms of abuse and violence.<b>151</b> During the course of a study on 
women in urban slums by the Centre for Housing Rights and Eviction, polygamous marriage 
unexpectedly emerged as an issue influencing why women moved and settled in slum areas. 
Women who had migrated to urban areas and who were wives in a polygamous arrangement 
reported that they needed to come to the city to financially support themselves and their children. 
As the third, forth, or fifth wife (sometimes higher), women reported that they and their children 
were not economically supported by their husbands and had to fend for themselves. <b>152</b> 
</p>
<p>84. Risk of violence is particularly acute for refugee and internally displaced women and girls 
(IDPs) in conflict situations. Women in refugee and IDP camps lack privacy and may be forced 
to live in the same quarters or in close proximity to male strangers, which decreases their 
security and increases their vulnerability. Studies show a high level of sexual violence in and 
around these camps. Moreover, once the conflict has ended women who are repatriated often no 
longer have houses or land to return to. This is due to a number of reasons, including destruction, 
their forced relocation to a different part of the country, discriminatory inheritance laws, lack of 
proper property titles, and secondary occupants. Forced marriages by military commanders in 
order to obtain homes or land inherited by women are reportedly common in Afghanistan.<b>153</b>  
</p>
<p>85. Projects that may involve large new developments or hosting events such as the Olympic 
Games often resort to forcibly expelling large populations of poor people from their homes and 
land to free up desired locations or build infrastructure for the event. The impact of these forced 
evictions, often by militia or armed forces, is profoundly devastating for women and is correlated 
with heightened rates of physical, psychological and economic violence against women before,

<p>during and after the evictions.<b>154</b> This is true both in terms of violence against women at the 
hands of state authorities, non-state actors, community members, as well as violence against 
women by their partners or relatives within the home.  
</p>
<p>86. The lack of adequate housing and resulting violence women are subjected to has also been 
found to be a problem both during and in the aftermath of natural and humanitarian disasters. A 
study of the housing reconstruction aspects of the international response to the tsunami in 
Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu revealed a disregard for women&#8217;s and girls rights.<b>155</b> Many more 
women than men died in the tsunami in both Sri Lanka and India, resulting in an unbalanced 
current sex ratio. While there were some surviving women-only households and many widowed 
heads of households, overall, male survivors outnumbered women in tsunami-hit areas. 
Moreover, instead of addressing women&#8217;s concerns, it is argued that the relief effort served to 
increase discrimination against them.<b>156</b> Compensation was generally handed out to male 
members of the family who, in many cases, did not share it with the women or surviving 
women-only households.<b>157</b> There was a large increase in documented cases of physical abuse, 
rape, forced and early marriage. These cases reveal a failure to properly consider and implement 
the gender dimensions of housing reconstruction.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Property, land and inheritance rights  
</b></p>
<p>87. The right to adequate housing is integrally related to the rights to property, land ownership 
and inheritance rights. Property rights and their enforcement are often dependent on the will of 
the men in family. For example, in the Karen community in Thailand/Myanmar, women can only 
inherit land if the family gives it to them. The gender gap in land ownership &#8220;is the single most 
critical contributor to the gender gap in economic wellbeing, social status and empowerment&#8221; in 
India and potentially in other developing countries.<b>158</b> Property is a livelihood sustaining asset 
that can generate income as well as security. Owning land gives women economic rights and 
opportunities to avoid situations where they are vulnerable to violence. It increases their 
bargaining power relative to men in both the family and in society at large.

<p>88. Two studies of Kerala and West Bengal respectively found that women&#8217;s property 
ownership often serves as a deterrent to domestic violence and is associated with a dramatically 
lower incidence of physical and psychological violence, both in the short and long term.<b>159</b> 
Battered women need independent economic means not just domestic violence laws, 
gender-sensitive policing, counselling and safe shelters.<b>160</b> Right to housing and right to land 
campaigns that are promoted to enhance women&#8217;s livelihood options should be broadened to 
embrace the link with domestic violence.<b>161</b> 
</p>
<p>89. Significant field research in Kenya also reveals the causal linkages between women&#8217;s lack 
of property rights and the high levels of violence inflicted against them. <b>162</b> Kenyan women own 
less than 1 per cent of the land while performing 70 per cent of agricultural labour.<b>163</b> &#8220;The 
denial of equal property rights has the effect of putting [them] at greater risk of poverty, disease, 
violence, and homelessness&#8221;.<b>164</b> Many women and social agencies testified that &#8220;when men 
control matrimonial property, women face increased risk of domestic violence&#8221;.<b>165</b> Women&#8217;s 
lack of property rights and experience of violence is also linked to poor health, increased rates of 
HIV/AIDS transmission, and low macro-economic growth. <b>166</b> Discriminatory property and

<p>estate laws lead to women&#8217;s economic vulnerability. <b>167</b> Women may yield to demands &#8220;for 
unprotected sex, despite the danger, as they often have nowhere to go, limited financial options 
(a Kenyan woman&#8217;s average earnings is less then half that of a man), limited land rights, and fear 
losing their children&#8221;.<b>168</b> Rural women in South Africa frequently live in female-headed 
households, in chronic poverty and are subject to spiralling levels of violence, as well as a 
disproportionately high prevalence of HIV. Many of these women were forcibly evicted from 
their ancestral land by the apartheid system.<b>169</b>  
</p>
<p>90. It is argued that widows are particularly at risk of violence due to succession laws and 
customs in Kenya that prevent women from inheriting property upon the death of their 
husbands.<b>170</b> Their lack of property rights may also result in violent cultural practices, in addition 
to the violence they face as a consequence of their newfound poverty as widows.<b>171</b> Some 
women upon the death of their husband face the threat of being violently evicted from their 
homes. Others are made to go through dangerous and unwanted cultural practices in order to 
receive their inheritance, such as widow &#8216;cleansing&#8217; or &#8216;widow inheritance&#8217; where they may be 
forced to engage in non-consensual sexual relations or to enter an unhealthy or abusive 
marriage.<b>172</b> Oral testimonies of individual women and project officers reveal that many women 
are unaware of their legal rights and given their socio-economic situation cannot access judicial 
processes.<b>173</b>  
</p>
<p>91. Women&#8217;s difficulty in claiming their rights to property and land is linked with other 
sex-discriminatory laws including male-biased marriage and divorce laws, and gender bias on 
land dispute bodies. Land dispute bodies which are typically made up of men exclude women 
from the decision making process. Situations of violent conflict reveal in a more blatantly direct 
way how violations of the right to property and land are inseparable from acts of physical 
violence against women. In many conflict situations combatants have used rape strategically in

<p>order to acquire women&#8217;s assets, including land and homes, some of which were needed for the 
war effort (for military gain), or indeed, were among the reasons for the conflict. Forced into 
poverty and often, displacement, women are far more vulnerable to ongoing violence.<b>174</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to food, food security 
</b></p>
<p>92. Women&#8217;s right to food is impaired by their limited access to and control over other 
productive resources as a result of discrimination in education, lower incomes, inequality in 
intra-household food distribution, inadequate public health care and exclusion from 
decision-making processes. Women disproportionately bear the impact of food supply crises, 
food price rises and the privatisation of the food supply. Their food and income insecurity 
frequently results in higher levels of violence against them. Women&#8217;s role as food providers and 
carers for their families, together with their general lack of property and labour rights, makes 
them particularly vulnerable to violence. For instance, in order to put food on the table for their 
families, women may go into prostitution, putting themselves at risk of violence and of 
HIV/AIDs. 
</p>
<p>93. Women and especially girls are also at high risk of being trafficked when they are unable 
to secure sufficient economic resources to purchase or produce food. It is argued that in Malawi, 
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund sponsored privatisation of the state marketing 
board (ADMARC) and the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR), which were used to keep the price of 
maize affordable, coupled with drought, flooding and mismanagement resulted in an ongoing 
food crisis. This crisis, it is maintained, led to increased levels of prostitution of women, and 
higher levels of HIV/AIDS in Malawian women.<b>175</b> 
</p>
<p>94. Poor rural women, IDPs and refugee women, and women living in conflict zones are at 
risk of violence in their efforts to provide food for themselves and their families. <b>176</b> Many 
women are raped and abused while seeking basic necessities such as water, food and firewood 
for cooking. This violence is perpetrated by a variety of actors, including local civilians, gangs, 
soldiers and other armed groups. In Sudan, rapes and other forms of sexual abuse have been 
frequently reported when displaced women and girls leave camp areas to gather firewood. <b>177</b> 
Lack of access to income sources has forced displaced women to collect firewood in the Kieni 
forest of Kenya, where they are reported to be subjected to abuse, including sexual abuse and

<p>severe beatings.<b>178</b> &#8220;Sexual violence against displaced women collecting fuel has become so 
common that camp workers in Darfur have abbreviated the phenomenon to &#8216;firewood rape&#8217;.&#8221; <b>179</b>  
</p>
<p>95. During displacement, women are often forced to &#8216;pay&#8217; for food with sex: &#8220;Demands for 
sexual services sometimes constituting an informal &#8216;currency&#8217; in which bribes are paid. 
Examples range from rape and assault by service providers to sexual harassment and 
psychological abuse&#8221;.<b>180</b> &#8220;In Liberia, displaced women have been forced to exchange sex for aid, 
including food from national and international peace workers, according to a report by Save the 
Children.&#8221; <b>181</b> Internally displaced women are very vulnerable to violence as a result of their 
economic resources being stripped from them during the displacement and their lack of access to 
economic resources afterward. They remain economically disadvantaged decades after the 
displacement. In some IDP camps, girls and women have reportedly been forced to engage in 
&#8220;survival sex&#8221; to obtain food or &#8220;transactional sex&#8221; in exchange for spending money or small 
objects.<b>182</b> There are reports as well that displaced women fleeing their homes or living in IDP 
camps have sometimes been forced into prostitution in order to survive or have fallen prey to 
traffickers. <b>183</b> Such violence against women has also been found to occur at the hands of 
International Peacekeeping and staff responsible for humanitarian operations.<b>184</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Right to water  
</b></p>
<p>96. The task of<b> </b>collecting and providing clean water for their families and communities 
exposes women to similar risks and challenges as those related to collecting food. Women often 
have to walk long distances to fetch water in communities where their movement in public 
spaces is greatly constrained by tradition, and they lack access to public services providing clean 
water. In Nazlet Fargallah, Egypt, women must walk to collect water, often in the dark, making 
them very vulnerable to violence.<b>185</b> Narratives of pregnant Nepalese women also describe how

<p>women labour to fetch water for their families and suffer miscarriages on the journey.<b>186</b> 
Likewise, there are reports of Nigerian women who are raped by men or mauled by wild animals 
on their way to collect water.<b>187</b> Contamination of the water supply also has a particularly 
detrimental impact on women. Because women collect the water with which they prepare the 
food they may be blamed for the health consequences, or they may have to travel ever greater 
distances to gather clean water if local sources are no longer available. Poor Bangladeshi women 
suffering from arsenic poisoning are socially ostracized, and get less medical attention and 
nutrition, therein increasing their chances of experiencing violence.<b>188</b> Reports of chemical 
saturation of the water supply on the US/Mexican border document how babies are poisoned in 
their mother&#8217;s wombs, while more women are diagnosed with breast cancer.<b>189</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>97. It is also argued that the privatization of water, encouraged by World Bank and IMF 
policies in some developing countries, has created natural monopolies leading to price rises and 
affecting poor people&#8217;s access to water. Because women make up the majority of those in 
poverty, women are more negatively affected by these policies. NGOs have documented the 
deleterious impact on women&#8217;s livelihoods as a result of the privatization of the DAWASA city 
water in Tanzania, in Cochabamab, Bolivia, and Onakry, Guinea.<b>190</b> The lack of access to clean 
water and the impoverishment that this represents increases women&#8217;s risk of violence. Women 
face spousal abuse and social censure when competing for access to clean water as has been 
documented in Coporaque, Peru.<b>191</b> The struggle for clean water is also reported to have affected 
intergenerational violence within the Native American culture resulting from the flooding of the 
Cree lands in Canada by the James Bay hydroelectric dam.<b>192

<p>98. By contrast easy access to clean water has been associated with girls and women&#8217;s 
empowerment and their protection from violence. Equitable access to water for productive use 
can address some of the root causes of poverty and gender inequality that fuel violence against 
women. It is linked to improved school attendance for girls, as they become free to go to school 
rather than being obliged to fetch water for their families. It also improves income-generating 
opportunities and access to economic resources that are known to lessen women&#8217;s vulnerability 
to violence. <b>193</b> However, property, land and inheritance rights must be addressed in tandem with 
water rights. Indeed, although land ownership is often a precondition for access to water, the 
reality is that women own title to less than two per cent of land and customs often prevent them 
from having <i>de facto</i> control over land - thus demonstrating the indivisibility of rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>99. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified violence against women as an 
underlying determinant of health.<b>194</b> That is, violence against women is associated with poor 
health and affects the right to health when the health system is unable to detect or manage the 
health consequences of this type of violence. A 2005 WHO cross-national study found that 
&#8220;women who at some time experienced physical or sexual violence, or both, reported health 
problems with greater probability than those women who never experienced violence by their 
partner. Women who experienced abuse declared having problems walking and in carrying out 
their daily work, feeling pains, loss of memory, dizziness [and miscarriage] in the four weeks 
preceding the survey&#8221;.<b>195</b> In all the countries surveyed an association was found between 
physical and sexual violence and the mental health problems of victims.  
</p>
<p>100. Violence against women affects women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health, which is a key 
aspect of women&#8217;s right to health.<b>196</b> The experience of violence adversely affects reproductive 
health regardless of wealth.<b>197</b> Survivors of violence against women have the right to adequate 
reparation and rehabilitation that covers their physical and mental health. But this support is

<p>often not provided.<b>198</b> Moreover, the privatization of health services may affect their access to 
healthcare, as the introduction of patient user-fees has been shown to greatly reduce women&#8217;s 
attendance at health clinics.<b>199</b> 
</p>
<p>101. As mentioned, violence against women is also considered to be a leading cause of 
HIV/AIDs, affecting women&#8217;s right to health.<b>200</b> Given the increasing feminisation of 
HIV/AIDs,<b>201</b> eliminating violence against women is a critical intervention to reduce the 
disease.<b>202</b> Women&#8217;s lack of sexual and reproductive rights makes them vulnerable to forced sex, 
contributing to increasing levels of HIV in women due to the injuries caused by this sexual 
abuse. Indeed, there is evidence that women who have been forced to have sex or have been 
raped, suffer greater exposure to HIV infection. Violence against women or fear of it also 
prevents many women from asking their partners to practice safe sex leading to higher HIV 
rates. In Soweto, South Africa, intimate partner violence has been identified with a prevalence of 
HIV 1.4 times higher.<b>203</b> In Rakai, Uganda, the prevalence of HIV increased significantly when 
women reported sexual coercion and the use of alcohol before having sex. <b>204</b> 
</p>
<p>102. Many women experience violence at the hands of their partners as soon as their diagnosis 
becomes known. In order to care for family members with HIV/AIDs, women may feel forced 
into high-risk work such as the sex industry or may keep children, especially girls, out of school 
in order to help with care duties - thereby entrenching the intergenerational transmission of 
poverty and violence.<b>205</b>

<p><b>F.  Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>103. Access to education is a crucial preventative factor for violence against women. Lack of 
education ensures women and girls have low status in society and are powerless relative to men. 
This gender power imbalance at home and in the public realm perpetuates and increases 
women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence.<b>206</b> Frequently girls and women&#8217;s right to education is violated 
by economic circumstances. For instance, when the cost of living and food are driven up by 
financial crisis, privatization or import liberalization, girls are far more likely to drop out of 
school than boys. Of the estimated 150 million children currently enrolled in primary school that 
will drop out before completion, at least 100 million will be girls.<b>207</b> Child marriage - a form of 
violence against girls - is associated with lower educational attainment for girls, limiting their 
employment opportunities and economic security. All these factors contribute to increased 
vulnerability to violence for women and girls, as well as limited access to social and economic 
resources and low levels of decision-making in the family.<b>208</b> 
</p>
<p>104. Although higher levels of education are generally associated with a lesser risk to women of 
experiencing violence, some studies find that there may be a greater risk of domestic violence 
with more education in middle-income developing countries. &#8220;Educated women know their 
rights and are therefore not prepared to follow orders unquestioningly. Asking questions leads to 
conflicts which then lead to violence&#8221;.<b>209</b> These findings can be interpreted as a patriarchal 
backlash against women&#8217;s newfound empowerment through education and the challenge that this 
represents to male domination in the family and in broader society. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Rights to work, livelihood and social security 
</b></p>
<p>105. Paid work generates income and livelihood for an individual woman and her family. In so 
doing, it prevents poverty, which is associated with increased risks of experiencing violence. 
Elements of poverty that lead to violence include crowded living conditions, limited scope of 
action, as well as psychological strain&#8221;<b>210</b> Disputes between spouses regarding financial 
difficulties such as over loan repayments under women&#8217;s microcredit programmes or male 
resentment of the woman&#8217;s earnings can also trigger conflicts that end in violence. <b>211</b> Yet, access

<p>to employment that provides a livelihood offers an alternative to staying in a violent marriage 
and increases women&#8217;s bargaining power in the Global North and the South.<b>212</b> Gender equality 
in income and employment has been shown to have a stronger impact on women&#8217;s status than 
gender equality in education.<b>213</b> Women&#8217;s income leverages change in their household 
bargaining power and can contribute to a reduction in patriarchal norms and traditions such as 
early marriage, polygamy, and discriminatory inheritance and land rights that perpetuate patterns 
of violence against women.<b>214</b> 
</p>
<p>106. Access to paid work that provides a livelihood can provide an alternative to traditional 
marriage, where there is a fear of violence in the marriage. In India, for example, there are 
reports that domestic violence has been used as a bargaining instrument to extract larger dowries 
from a wife&#8217;s family after the marriage has taken place. One study found that women whose 
families pay smaller dowries suffer increased risk of marital violence, as do women from richer 
families from whom resources can easily be extracted.<b>215</b> Providing income-generating 
opportunities for women outside of marriage and the marriage market would significantly 
improve their well-being by allowing women to leave an abusive husband, or increasing their 
bargaining power.<b>216</b> 
</p>
<p>107. However, even when women achieve their right to decent work, research reveals that their 
vulnerability to violence may be crucially affected by men&#8217;s employment situation. With 
competitive globalization, some men are finding themselves in precarious employment 
conditions, earning lower wages than their female partners and relatives, or even unemployed. 
Gender equality may be reached at the expense of men, in a sort of &#8220;equalizing down&#8221; rather 
than up. For instance, in Bangladesh disputes between spouses over loan repayments under 
women&#8217;s microcredit programmes funded by large banks and global development agencies have 
been one of the most frequent sources of domestic violence. An increase in women&#8217;s 
income-generating capability may perpetuate or increase occurrences of domestic violence rather

<p>  Economic models predict that women&#8217;s incomes and other financial support received from 
outside the marriage (family, welfare, shelters, divorce settlements, etc.) will decrease the level 
of violence in intact families because they increase the woman&#8217;s threat point. See A. Farmer and 
J. Tiefenthaler, 1997. &#8220;An Economic Analysis of Domestc Violence&#8221;, in <i>Review of Social

<p>than end it, as might be predicted. <b>217</b> Such situations represent an erosion of traditional male 
entitlement and patriarchal norms in many societies. Rather than resulting in progressive social 
adaptation, they may lead to a crisis of masculine identity for marginalized men and to vicious 
forms of violence against women. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>108. The most important deterrents to poverty for women of working age are the extent of 
women&#8217;s labour force participation in any given country and the degree of gender equality in the 
labour market. One best practice case is Sweden, where &#8220;good labour market conditions coupled 
with generous supplementary benefits minimize women&#8217;s poverty&#8221;.<b>218</b> At an aggregate level, this 
conclusion corroborates the findings of a study using the WHO dataset on domestic violence, 
which revealed that countries with greater gender equity in political and economic participation 
as revealed by the GDI index have a relatively lower prevalence of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>109. Some research has also considered the relationship between women&#8217;s employment, social 
welfare systems for mothers, and women&#8217;s poverty, particularly among single mothers and 
single elderly women. In addition to high levels of women&#8217;s workforce participation and gender 
equality in the labour market, this research shows that women are also buffered against the risks 
of poverty where public benefits such as, old age pensions, single mother benefits, childcare 
services for single mothers and services for elderly women are available. Women (especially 
single mothers) are particularly vulnerable to poverty given their high risk of income interruption 
due to their childcare (and other forms of care) responsibilities. Where countries fail to provide 
social security provisions, a trend toward the feminisation of poverty becomes evident, 
especially for single mothers and single elderly women. In Canada, raising social welfare 
benefits has been a successful strategy in fighting poverty, particularly for elderly women. <b>219</b> As 
this report has found in other literature, poverty is a major predictive factor for violence against 
women, and freedom from want is closely tied to freedom from fear. Thus, where public 
provisions are unavailable, it is likely that women will be unable to hold together autonomous 
households and be trapped in situations of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>110. Good labour market conditions coupled with generous supplementary benefits minimize 
women&#8217;s poverty, but women are also buffered against the risks of poverty and thus of violence, 
where there are public benefits such as, old age pensions, single mother benefits, childcare 
services for single mothers and services for elderly women.<b>220</b> Women&#8217;s right to work is not in 
itself a sufficient condition for preventing violence against women in the context of competitive

<p>globalization. Precarious employment, which is by nature temporary and insecure, has rapidly 
increased at the very same time as women have been entering the labour market <i>en masse</i>. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>111. In some Northern countries women have been encouraged to take on part-time 
employment that is low-paid and does not guarantee economic independence, job security or 
adequate benefits.<b>221</b> In many Southern countries, women have accepted precarious employment 
without social security benefits, including outside conventional labour standards in migrant 
labour markets or in free trade zones created by governments to attract foreign investment. For 
example, in Fiji economic subordination, including high female unemployment and a heavy 
concentration of women in low wage occupations, is considered by some to be a major factor 
underpinning the high prevalence of violence against women.<b>222</b> It is argued that women&#8217;s 
unemployment in that country has come about in large part due to trade liberalization which 
destroyed the viability of the local garment-processing and sugar industries in which mainly 
women worked. Women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence may thus increase in unfavorable and 
deteriorating work conditions, whereas where the employment is adequately remunerated and 
socially supported, women&#8217;s risk of violence may be greatly reduced.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>112<b>. Violence against women is a violation of the right to life and to personal security but 
also of a whole range of basic economic and social rights. Yet the differential treatment and 
implementation of the two Covenants (ICESCR and ICCPR) of rights remains a major 
barrier greatly limiting government and non-state actor efforts to achieve the full and 
equal realisation of women&#8217;s human rights in order to prevent VAW from occurring in the 
first place. 
</b></p>
<p>113<b>. Against this backdrop this report has examined the interconnections between the 
current global political economic order and women&#8217;s enjoyment of their human rights, in 
particular the implications for VAW; arguing that economic and social rights are essential 
in enhancing women&#8217;s capabilities and creating enabling conditions, such that women do 
not bear the brunt of globalization and economic crisis disproportionately, and can 
effectively avoid /resist the risk of violence.  
</b></p>
<p>114<b>. While competitive globalization has created new opportunities for some groups of 
women, it has disadvantaged others, who have entered the workforce under insecure and 
unregulated conditions, thus creating new risks and vulnerabilities to abuse and

<p><b>exploitation. At the same time, globalisation has undermined state capacity for 
enforcement and the provision of public goods and services. This has resulted in a return to 
community based enforcement and survival systems, which have not only intensified 
women&#8217;s work load in order to compensate for the erosion of crucial public services and 
entitlements but also subordinated women to increasingly conservative cultural discourses 
that challenge the universality of rights and equality of women.   
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> The feminisation of migration, along with feminization of the labour force, two 
important outcomes of globalization, hold new risks and vulnerabilities as well as 
opportunities for women&#8217;s empowerment. But neoliberal policies that fail to attend to the 
basic social and economic entitlements of individuals and families make violence a more 
likely outcome for women than their empowerment. Restrictive immigration policies 
focused on national security and a narrow construal of economic interests often limit the 
options of migrant women workers for safe and independent survival in an alien 
environment. The challenge lies in creating the guarantees for women to migrate safely and 
with dignity.223 </b> 
</p>
<p>116.<b> The current financial crisis, which clearly reflects the inherent instabilities of 
unregulated markets, offers a crucial opportunity for governments and international 
institutions to invest in public services and infrastructure to create jobs, improve 
productivity and revive economic demand. Such investment, if well designed, has the 
potential to expand women&#8217;s economic opportunities and enhance livelihood security. The 
state, no doubt, is not the only authority to be held accountable for violations of women&#8217;s 
human rights. Sovereignty in the new global order must be understood as the responsibility 
of nation-states, as well as the shared responsibility of the international community at 
large. Therefore, promotion and protection of women&#8217;s economic and social entitlements to 
prevent and protect them from violence must be pursued transnationally. The future of 
human rights and distributive justice will require democratizing cultural, political and 
economic hegemony. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>In view of the above discussion, a viable strategy to address the underlying 
socioeconomic causes of VAW must include, but not be limited, to the following broad 
guidelines, which apply to governments as well as local and international non-state actors: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(1) Creation of a gender sensitive knowledge-base 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop indicators and generate sex-disaggregated data on risk and preventive 
factors on VAW that include economic and political factors.

<p>&#8226; <b>Generate sex-disaggregated data on VAW, its causes and consequences in conflict, 
post-conflict and other reconstruction processes. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Document shortfalls in economic and social rights of women parallel to violations 
in political and civil rights.

programmes that address the economic and social dimensions of women&#8217;s 
empowerment in post-conflict and crisis societies. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Codify ES rights in enforceable national law, including guarantees for minimum 
level of income, food, healthcare etc.

<p>&#8226; <b>Evaluate all policies of governments and international financial institutions from a 
gender-perspective guided by ICESCR and CEDAW, with the view to prevent 
negative consequences for women of economic liberalisation, financial and 
structural adjustment policies and programmes, and trade agreements. At a 
minimum, these policies should &#8220;do no harm&#8221;.

<p>&#8226; <b>Factor in VAW, its causes and consequences in financing for development 
initiatives, including the Gender Equality Fund partnership and other funds

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that economic stimulus and reconstruction/recovery packages do not 
privilege physical over social infrastructure investment and/or support for men&#8217;s

<p>&#8226; <b>Establish intermediary institutions to manage and monitor the rights of foreign

<p>&#8226; <b>Use cross-national data on trends or patterns that reveal linkages between VAW
