<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report constitutes a review of the work and activities of the first Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, 
and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Miloon Kothari, since his appointment 
in 2000. It aims to provide a number of recommendations to the Council and the next mandate 
holder in relation to the main obstacles to the realization of the human right to adequate housing 
(lack of legislation and implementation of the right to adequate housing, homelessness, forced 
evictions, discrimination, access to water and basic services and affordability) and on the 
development of the mandate. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur confirms his broad interpretation of the right to adequate housing 
based on the indivisibility and universality of human rights and in this context he underlines the 
utmost importance that the struggle against discrimination plays in the realization of the right to 
adequate housing. He recalls the tools elaborated during his term (the Basic principles and 
guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement, the questionnaire on women and 
adequate housing, the questionnaire on the right to adequate housing, and the development of 
indicators to monitor progressive realization of the right to adequate housing) and encourages 
relevant actors to employ them, as well as to further develop and adapt them to national and local 
situations.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur strongly advocates a combination of a humanitarian and human 
rights approach to address the situation of millions of people living in grossly inadequate 
housing conditions and those facing homelessness and landlessness. To develop the mandate, 
he calls for stronger support and response from States and proposes the issues for further 
consideration, including the recognition of the link between access to land and the human 
right to adequate housing; rural areas; natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies; 
climate change; and the role of civil society. He finally addresses and reiterates a set of 
recommendations elaborated during his term and presented in his reports, including on women&#8217;s 
rights to housing, land, property and inheritance. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report constitutes a review of the work and activities of the first Special 
Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard 
of living and on the right to non-discrimination in this context since his appointment by the 
Commission on Human Rights in 2000 in its resolution 2000/9, later extended by the 
Commission in its resolution 2003/27 and the Human Rights Council in its resolution 6/27. 
</p>
<p>2. The report mainly focuses on obstacles to the implementation of the right to adequate 
housing and issues that would require further attention of the Human Rights Council in order to 
achieve the realization of the right to adequate housing. In the last section, the Special 
Rapporteur makes recommendations to the Council and the next mandate holder.  
</p>
<p>3. Given that this is his final annual report to the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to gratefully acknowledge the extensive support given to his mandate by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), especially by 
all his assistants, since the inception of the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  APPROACH TO THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b>4. Since the beginning, the Special Rapporteur has advocated, through his reports<b>1</b> and 
activities, a broad interpretation of the right to adequate housing. He has always adopted an 
approach stressing the indivisibility of human rights, without which the right to adequate housing 
loses its meaning. Through his work, the Special Rapporteur has demonstrated that existing 
interlinkages between the right to adequate housing and congruent human rights, such as the 
rights to food, water, health, work, land, livelihood, property, and security of person, as well as 
protection against inhuman and degrading treatment, non-discrimination and gender equality, are 
at the core of the realization of the right to adequate housing. His approach has been articulated 
in the definition that he has developed: &#8220;The human right to adequate housing is the right of 
every woman, man, youth and child to gain and sustain a safe and secure home and community 
in which to live in peace and dignity.&#8221; This definition, and the broad conception of the 
fundamental human right that it encompasses, has received validation from many different actors 
across the world.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has worked on various elements of the right to adequate housing. 
He subscribes fully to the interpretation given to the right to adequate housing by the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR).<b>2</b> In his work, he has identified additional 
elements that provide a more complete conception of this right, also taking into account its civil 
and political rights dimension. Through consultations and studies, the Special Rapporteur has

</b>  See for instance his first report, E/CN.4/2001/51. The reports of the Special Rapporteur are 
</p>
<p>available at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/housing/index.htm.

</b>  See in particular Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) 
</p>
<p>general comments Nos. 4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing (article 11 (1) of the Covenant) 
and 7 (1997) on the right to adequate housing (article 11 (1) of the Covenant): forced evictions. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16

</p>
<p>identified 14 elements arising from international treaty obligations and their interpretation by 
expert bodies. These elements, in their entirety, form the basis of a methodology that could be 
applied to assess both the realization and the extent of violations of the human right to adequate 
housing.<b>3</b> These elements are: 
</p>
<p>1.  Security of tenure; 
</p>
<p>2.  Public goods and services; 
</p>
<p>3.  Environmental goods and services (including land and water); 
</p>
<p>4.  Affordability (including access to finance); 
</p>
<p>5.  Habitability; 
</p>
<p>6.  Accessibility (physical); 
</p>
<p>7.  Location; 
</p>
<p>8.  Cultural appropriateness; 
</p>
<p>9.  Freedom from dispossession; 
</p>
<p>10.  Information, capacity and capacity-building; 
</p>
<p>11.  Participation in decision-making; 
</p>
<p>12.  Resettlement; 
</p>
<p>13.  Safe environment; 
</p>
<p>14.  Security (physical) and privacy.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. During his country missions and in his reports the Special Rapporteur has also identified 
particular protection measures in relation to the fulfilment of the right to adequate housing. One 
such protection measure has been the call for a combination of a humanitarian and a human 
rights approach to confront the situation of millions of people living in grossly inadequate 
housing conditions and those facing homelessness, landlessness, displacement and related 
violence.<b>5</b> These conditions are one reflection of the state of poverty that persists across the 
world and call for immediate measures to be taken by States.

</p>
<p>7. Another protective measure advocated by the Special Rapporteur has been the need for 
immediate recognition of the right to adequate housing, in law and policy and through budgetary 
commitment. This recognition, consistent with international human rights obligations needs to be 
followed up by implementation of the right. As the Special Rapporteur has stated, such measures 
are necessary as a bulwark against the relentless march of economic and social transformation 
which does not always favour the most vulnerable, including in relation to housing. The 
acquiescence and at times direct complicity of States in allowing markets unfettered dominance 
over housing and property rights is one of the major factors which makes adequate housing 
inaccessible to low and middle income communities. 
</p>
<p><b>II. MAIN OBSTACLES TO THE REALIZATION  
OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b></p>
<p>8. During his term, the Special Rapporteur has observed a number of obstacles to the 
realization of adequate housing which he wishes to briefly comment on before presenting 
recommendations at the end of this report.<b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Lack of legislation and implementation of the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>9. During his missions and contacts with official representatives, the Special Rapporteur has 
observed that a great many States do not have constitutional and legal provisions and policies on 
the right to adequate housing. In many cases, Governments have not made the necessary efforts 
to translate such international obligations into national legislation. In spite of the growing 
evidence from international and regional human rights bodies confirming the justiciability of the 
right to adequate housing, national legislative and policy frameworks and Court decisions in the 
majority of national jurisdictions, do not encompass the human rights aspects of adequate 
housing. The prevalent tendency is to view housing, land and property as marketable 
commodities rather than as human rights that call for the protection, first and foremost, of 
vulnerable communities, and for housing to be treated as a social good.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur has consistently supported the adoption of the proposed Optional 
Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which would further clarify 
the justiciability of the right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Homelessness 
</b></p>
<p>11. In his 2005 annual report,<b>7</b> the Special Rapporteur identified homelessness as one of the 
most visible and severe symptoms of the lack of respect for the right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>12. Developed countries are also gravely affected by this phenomenon. Although their 
financial resources are sufficient for achieving a high degree of realization of the right to 
adequate housing, they have not been able to prevent and resolve homelessness. In particular, 
homelessness as a result of housing affordability is severely impacting low-income families and 
progressing to include higher-level income households.  
</p>
<p>13. Causes for homelessness are diverse and multifaceted, including a lack of security of 
tenure, speculation in housing and land for investment purposes, and unplanned and forced urban 
migration. Added to this are destruction and displacement caused by forced evictions, conflicts, 
large-scale development projects or natural disasters.<b>8</b> 
14. Affordability, one of the elements of the right to adequate housing, constitutes one of the 
main factors of homelessness. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that 
urban &#8220;gentrification&#8221; processes, accompanied by rising property values and rental rates, are 
pushing low-income families into precarious situations, including homelessness.  
</p>
<p>15. The failure of legal systems to protect homeless and landless people across the world is 
coupled with a tendency to criminalize them and appears to be part of the trend towards 
increasing violence against them. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>16. Whilst the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1993/77 recognized forced 
evictions as a gross violation of human rights, and particularly the right to adequate housing, this 
phenomenon continues with full force.<b>9</b> This situation led the Special Rapporteur to devote one 
of his reports to this important issue<b>10</b> and to subsequently lead an effort to develop operational 
standards on the subject. 
17. Forced evictions constitute a violation of a wide range of human rights, and push people 
into poverty, homelessness and inadequate housing conditions. They have particularly adverse 
effects on women, children, and groups facing discrimination, such as indigenous peoples and 
minorities, and the socially and economically vulnerable and marginalized sectors of society.  
</p>
<p>18. Forced evictions result in displacement, loss of livelihood, property and belongings, and 
physical and psychological injury to those affected. The Special Rapporteur has proposed a 
range of measures that may be taken in order to address forced evictions, including: the adoption 
of national policies and legislation; the development by OHCHR of indicators on forced

<p>evictions; increased focus by treaty monitoring bodies on issues related to forced evictions; 
integration of work on forced evictions into the mandates of United Nations agencies and bodies 
and bilateral and multilateral initiatives.<b>11</b>  
</p>
<p>19. In order to give States and the international community practical tools to prevent the 
violation of the right to adequate housing as a consequence of forced evictions due to 
development projects, the Special Rapporteur presented a set of Basic principles and guidelines 
on development-based evictions and displacement to the Human Rights Council in his preceding 
report.<b>12</b> These guidelines address various situations including evictions planned or conducted in 
apparent pursuit of the &#8220;public good&#8221;, such as those linked to development and infrastructure 
projects (including large dams, large-scale industrial or energy projects, or mining and other 
extractive industries); land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal, slum upgrades, 
housing renovation, city beautification, or other land-use programmes (including for agricultural 
purposes); property, real estate and land disputes; major international business or sporting 
events; and, ostensibly, environmental purposes, as well as activities supported by international 
development assistance. 
</p>
<p>20. The guidelines offer several new prescriptions, based on information gathered worldwide 
since 1997, which render more clearly the obligations of States in this context. These include: the 
need for States to conduct comprehensive impact assessments in advance of evictions that take 
into account their differential impact on women, children and other vulnerable groups; calling 
for States to take intervening measures to ensure that market forces do not increase the 
vulnerability of low-income and marginalized groups to forced eviction; affirming the obligation 
of States to recognize the fundamental human rights of forcibly evicted persons to return, 
resettlement, and fair and just compensation; and the requirement that all affected persons be 
notified in writing and sufficiently in advance with a view to minimizing the adverse impact of 
evictions; the enumeration of detailed steps to be taken by States to protect human rights prior to, 
during and after evictions; and the establishment of stringent criteria for initiating and carrying 
out unavoidable evictions in exceptional circumstances. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the consideration of and decisions on forced evictions 
from various treaty bodies, including the link made by the Committee against Torture (CAT) 
between forced evictions and breaches of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<b>13</b>

<p>  The Committee against Torture (CAT) has considered that burning or demolishing houses 
may, in certain instances, amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
(article 16 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment). See for instance communication No. 161/2000, <i>Hajrizi Dzemajl et al. v. 
Yugoslavia</i>, para. 9.2 and CAT/C/XXVII/Concl.5, Conclusions and Recommendations of the 
Committee against Torture: Israel, para. 6 (j). </p>

</p>
<p><b>D.  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>22. In the context of the indivisibility and universality of human rights, it is important to 
recognize that the struggle against discrimination is of the utmost importance in achieving the 
right to adequate housing. The realization of the right to adequate housing in an environment free 
from discrimination will have a direct bearing on other congruent human rights, including the 
right to life, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to freedom of movement and 
residence, the right to protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family 
and home, and the right to participation in public affairs.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>23. Discrimination and segregation in housing can be based not only on grounds of race, class 
or gender, but can also result from poverty and economic marginalization.<b>15</b> The Special 
Rapporteur has expressed concern, in various mission reports, regarding the continued 
discrimination faced by ethnic and religious minorities and nomadic groups, as reflected in the 
disproportionately inadequate housing and living conditions of these groups; the considerable 
number of alleged cases of discriminatory land confiscation and forced evictions; discrimination 
against women with respect to housing rights, land, inheritance and property; and the poor and 
limited quantity and quality of basic services provided to informal settlements and low-income 
groups and neighbourhoods.  
</p>
<p>24. The placing of the discrimination aspects of housing within the context of the indivisibility 
and universality of human rights is critical. The realization of the right to adequate housing in an 
environment free from racial discrimination will have a direct bearing on other congruent human 
rights, including the right to life, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to freedom 
of movement and residence, the right to protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with 
privacy, family and home, and the right to popular participation.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Forced evictions based on ethnic grounds intensify inequality, social conflict, segregation 
and &#8220;ghettoization&#8221;, and invariably affect the poorest, most socially and economically vulnerable 
and marginalized sectors of society.<b>17</b> The Special Rapporteur has brought these issues to the

</p>
<p><b>E.  The human right to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>26. As stated by the Special Rapporteur throughout his mandate, access to water is a 
prerequisite to the realization of a range of human rights, including the right to adequate housing. 
A house is not liveable without access to potable water. As a human right, the right to water 
should entitle everyone, on the basis of non-discrimination, to sufficient, safe, physically 
accessible and affordable water, which is of an acceptable quality, for personal, domestic and 
subsistence uses. In his 2003 report,<b>19</b> the Special Rapporteur emphasized the importance of 
water and sanitation in the context of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>27. While the CESCR general comment on the right to water<b>20</b> and current Human Rights 
Council debates have been landmarks in the recognition of the right to water as a human right, 
the poor and other marginalized groups have the greatest difficulty in accessing sufficient and 
safe water and adequate sanitation. In many slums and informal settlements around the world, 
having no water connection means that residents have to pay higher prices to buy water. In rural 
areas, women and children often have to walk great distances in search of water to meet 
minimum household needs. Diseases associated with contaminated drinking water and 
unsanitary living conditions are among the leading causes of ill-health, and a significant 
contributor to infant and child mortality in developing countries.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The consequences of inadequate or no access to water are particularly devastating for 
women and children. When water is not readily available, they are the ones that have to spend a 
large amount of time finding and fetching it. Inadequate access to water in rural areas also leads 
to a vicious circle of lower agricultural yields for subsistence and income generation, deepening 
poverty. This has a detrimental impact on health, security and education. 
</p>
<p>29. Lack of sanitation facilities affects both men and women, but sanitation needs and 
demands differ with gender. Women have particular privacy, dignity and personal safety needs 
and concerns. The lack of sanitation facilities at home can often force women and girls to use 
secluded places outside, exposing them to the risk of sexual abuse. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>F.  Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>30. Across the world, the growing unaffordability of housing, land and property, is responsible 
for increasing the number of people who are homeless and have to resort to living in inadequate 
and insecure housing conditions. The inability or unwillingness of States to control speculation 
and rein in rising rental and home prices through appropriate intervention in the market, is a 
major obstacle to the implementation of the right to adequate housing. 
31. Trends reveal that this affordability crisis is affecting not only the poor but also 
low-income groups and even the middle class. More and more people are suffering from the 
impact of rising prices of housing and land, especially in urban areas. This results in additional 
people defaulting on their rents or mortgages.  
</p>
<p>32. Many factors, including speculation on land and housing, explain this situation. Urban 
renewal, city beautification, and the creation of so-called world class cities have contributed to 
boosting property prices in cities, diverted land use for higher income groups and pushed the 
poor further to the periphery.  
</p>
<p>33. The resulting creation of spatially separated settlements for the rich and the poor in urban 
and rural areas, has at times been described by the Special Rapporteur as &#8220;urban and rural 
apartheid&#8221;. He has also warned about the fact that an increasing number of housing 
developments are being built for the wealthy, while the poor are being evicted or forced to live in 
slums or inadequate housing without access to basic civic services. Slums and squatter 
settlements arise in part due to the colossal gap in the supply of affordable housing in the formal 
sector. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about reductions in public housing expenditure, 
pressures on rental housing, and declining housing and civic services subsidies for the poor. 
</p>
<p>34. The affordability crisis is further aggravated by the lack of housing finance for the 
bottom 20 to 25 per cent of the population. As pointed out in numerous country mission reports<b>22</b> 
there is an urgent need for Governments to reorient, and make more flexible, housing finance 
institutions and instruments so that lower income groups can access resources.  
</p>
<p>35. The subprime market crisis that originated in the United States in 2007 has exposed the 
irresponsible practices of banks, real estate entities and local and national Governments and 
international financial institutions that continue to present the homeownership model as the 
panacea for the global housing crisis. The Special Rapporteur emphasises that this preference for 
market-driven homeownership is misplaced and undermines the housing rights of poor and 
middle-income groups across the world. A human rights-based approach would instead appear to 
call for a continuum of approaches, placing equal emphasis on different tenure options ranging 
from hostels, boarding homes, rental, cooperative, land sharing and so forth.

<p><b>III. THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE HOUSING  
FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Women and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>36. Through his work, the Special Rapporteur has placed particular emphasis on the gender 
dimension of the right to adequate housing. In its resolution 2002/49 entitled &#8220;Women&#8217;s equal 
ownership of access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to 
adequate housing&#8221;, the Commission on Human Rights entrusted the Special Rapporteur with the 
additional task of conducting a global study on women and adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>37. To achieve this objective, the Special Rapporteur conducted a range of dialogues with 
States and civil society, elaborated a questionnaire on women and adequate housing,<b>23</b> and 
organized seven regional consultations, reflected in his three reports on this question.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Critical factors affecting women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing and land are lack of secure 
tenure; lack of information about women&#8217;s human rights; lack of access to affordable social 
services; lack of adequate laws safeguarding women&#8217;s equal rights to housing, land, property and 
inheritance; lack of access to credit and housing subsidies; bureaucratic barriers preventing 
access to housing programmes; rising poverty and unemployment; and discriminatory cultural 
and traditional practices. The Special Rapporteur notes that a State&#8217;s obligation to eliminate 
gender discrimination is one of immediate effect and failure to do so constitutes a human rights 
violation. 
</p>
<p>39. There is an urgent need to address multiple forms of discrimination that women face on 
grounds including race, class, ethnicity, caste, health status, disability, income, sexual 
orientation, and other factors. An intersectional approach to gender discrimination is essential to 
address the multiple forms of discrimination faced by women.<b>25</b> Other categories of women may 
face further discrimination due to their status, including women affected by domestic violence, 
women in rural and remote areas, women affected by HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, women with 
newborn children, and single women, including single mothers. 
</p>
<p>40. The work on women and housing has clearly demonstrated the clear link between violence 
against women and the human right to adequate housing, and the crucial importance of an 
intersectional approach to the problem. In its resolution 2005/25, the Commission on Human

<p>  Study by the Special Rapporteur on Women and adequate housing, E/CN.4/2005/43. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16

</p>
<p>Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, in the elaboration of model provisions to protect 
women&#8217;s rights in housing and domestic violence legislation, to ensure women&#8217;s full and equal 
access to national legal aid schemes to protect their housing, land and property rights in cases of 
divorce, inheritance and domestic violence. These model provisions are under preparation. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur encourages OHCHR to publish a study which will analyse and 
present the wealth of material, testimonies, and case studies generated by the work on women 
and housing. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Children and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>42. Since his first report<b>26</b> the Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the international 
community to the integral link between children&#8217;s housing rights and living conditions and their 
cognitive, physical, cultural, emotional and social development, particularly as children are 
disproportionately vulnerable to the negative effects of inadequate and insecure living 
conditions.<b>27</b> A house must be perceived as a home, a stable point in a child&#8217;s life she/he can 
return to with a sense of safety and security. 
</p>
<p>43. Numerous reports have documented an increase in the number of homeless children around 
the world and the plight of children living in distressed housing. This is reflected in the 
conditions and circumstances of children living in slum and squatter settlements, on streets and 
other perilous locations, and in shelters made of hazardous materials. The situation of children 
living in especially difficult circumstances requires special and urgent attention. These include: 
children with physical and mental disabilities; victims of natural and human-made disasters; 
refugee children; street children; slum and migrant children; orphans and destitute children; 
children affected by HIV/AIDS (including children of parents with HIV/AIDS and AIDS 
orphans as well as those infected); child prostitutes; children of sex workers; children in conflict 
with the law; and child labourers. 
</p>
<p>44. In accordance with the provisions of article 20 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Special Rapporteur has recommended that States should ensure that &#8220;no child will be 
subjected to discrimination with regard to his or her right to adequate housing on the grounds of 
his or her parents&#8217; race, colour, national or ethnic origin, sex, property or other status, and that 
special protection and assistance be provided to children living in the streets and those 
temporarily or permanently deprived of a family environment&#8221;.<b>28</b>

</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  During his term, the Special Rapporteur has particularly noticed how children tend to suffer 
</p>
<p>disproportionately both in the short and long term, from the loss of homes, shelter and 
possessions. When children lose their homes, they also lose their source of security; they lose 
their psychological shelter.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Indigenous peoples and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>45. As a result of historical and contemporary dispossession and discrimination, indigenous 
peoples worldwide experience socio-economic disadvantages that gravely impact their human 
right to adequate housing and the opportunity to use their resources for their development. In this 
context, the interlinkage between adequate housing and indigenous peoples&#8217; access to and 
control over land and other natural resources is clear.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>46. During various country missions, the Special Rapporteur witnessed discrimination against 
indigenous peoples and made a number of recommendations.<b>30</b> The elimination of obstacles 
faced by indigenous peoples, including discrimination and inequalities, poverty, and 
unemployment is essential for the implementation of their right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur believes that the recognition of the right to self-determination and 
of the right to land, as well as genuine participation in decision-making processes, is essential for 
the realization of the human rights of indigenous peoples, including their right to adequate 
housing. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples<b>31</b> and hopes that due consideration and implementation of it by 
States will contribute positively to the right to adequate housing of indigenous peoples and 
communities. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Groups requiring special attention 
</b></p>
<p>49. Throughout his work, the Special Rapporteur has identified a number of groups that need 
particular attention and protection in regard to the right to adequate housing. These groups 
include inter alia: persons with disabilities and/or health problems (including persons with 
complex needs such as those affected by HIV/AIDS or psychosocial disabilities and those 
critically ill); refugees and asylum-seekers; prisoners and persons released from detention; 
victims of domestic abuse and violence; and orphans. 
</p>
<p>50. As pointed out by CESCR, disadvantaged groups, including persons with disabilities, must 
be accorded full and sustainable access to adequate housing resources, and housing law and 
policy should take fully into account the special housing requirements of such groups.<b>32</b>

</p>
<p>51. As noted in a study that identifies the requirements of groups in need of special attention in 
South Africa, &#8220;special needs&#8221; housing can take the form of emergency shelters (short-term 
accommodation); shelters (medium-term accommodation); second stage housing (short-term 
rental accommodation); community care homes; home based care; and individual housing 
(ownership).<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ACTIVITIES OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Tools for the realization of the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>52. Since the beginning of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has stressed the importance, as 
have numerous treaty bodies, of reliable and clear statistics and indicators to assess the progress 
made by States towards the realization of the right to adequate housing. Unfortunately, as has 
been evident during his country missions, many States do not incorporate the human rights 
perspective in statistical data. In some cases, even basic indicators, such as the number of 
homeless people, are unavailable, let alone data at a disaggregated level. 
</p>
<p>53. In the context of its work for the international human rights treaty bodies, OHCHR 
organized subregional workshops and consultations at country level in 2007 for piloting the 
conceptual and methodological framework on statistical information and other appropriate 
indicators to promote and assess the implementation of human rights, including the right to 
adequate housing. Participants were experts from national statistical agencies, policymakers, 
national human rights institutions and civil society organizations. An expert consultation 
organized by OHCHR in December 2006 for its work for the treaty bodies, which involved the 
Special Rapporteur and experts from UN-Habitat, identified a preliminary set of statistics on the 
right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>54. As a follow-up, work was initiated on the compilation of metadata on each indicator, 
whether structural, process or outcome indicators. Such information, which is to be reflected in 
&#8220;metasheets&#8221;, aims at supporting the use of relevant statistics and providing detailed information 
on their definition, rationale, method of computation, primary and secondary data sources, level 
of disaggregation, periodicity and any other relevant comments and limitations. The elaboration 
of such metadata draws essentially on existing sources, including databases of United Nations 
agencies and examples of standardized information collected by civil society organizations. The 
development of metasheets benefited from workshops and consultations organized at country 
level. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his support to this piloting and sensitization 
process supporting the development of contextually relevant and viable statistical information on 
the implementation of the right to adequate housing at country level. The Special Rapporteur 
would also like to express his appreciation to the national human rights institutions of India and 
Uganda which took an active part in the organization of two subregional workshops. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on States to organize follow-up initiatives at country level and 
recommends further collaboration with OHCHR and UN-Habitat on indicators on adequate 
housing.

<p> A/HRC/7/16

</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur has submitted to the attention of States and civil society two 
questionnaires: one on the elements of the right to adequate housing, the other on women and 
adequate housing.<b>34</b> These questionnaires have been useful in obtaining information needed for 
the advancement of the conceptual understanding of the right to adequate housing and in 
implementing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. They have also been widely used as tools 
to ascertain gaps in national legislation and the state of implementation of the right to adequate 
housing. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Collaborative work 
</b></p>
<p>56. In the face of growing human rights challenges and the need to demonstrate the practical 
application of approach indivisibility of human rights, the Special Rapporteur has sought to 
collaborate closely with other mandate holders and treaty bodies on a wide range of economic, 
social and cultural as well as civil and political rights issues. These include food, health, 
education, internal displacement, racism and discrimination, indigenous peoples, minorities, 
toxic wastes, violence against women, human rights defenders, arbitrary detention, torture, 
summary executions and independence of lawyers and judges. In the course of this collaboration, 
the Special Rapporteur undertook joint missions and visits that were very useful in order to grasp 
the complexity of national and local situations and stress the need to address them in a holistic 
manner because of the close linkage between various human rights.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has emphasized the need for cooperative 
work between special procedures and treaty bodies and has collaborated actively with these 
mechanisms, in particular with CESCR, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This collaboration has comprised regular exchanges of 
information and ideas between the treaty bodies and the Special Rapporteur, work on general 
comments, participation at days of general discussion and the development of monitoring tools. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur believes that much more collaborative work is needed within the 
United Nations system to support the implementation of human rights and the right to adequate 
housing. There is room for a much closer and more coordinated collaboration between the 
special procedures mandate holders and the treaty bodies, United Nations agencies at the global 
and national levels and international financial institutions. This collaboration would result in 
better coordination and response to human rights issues, better follow-up on recommendations of 
these mechanisms and greater support for countries in their efforts to consider these 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. There is a need for greater integration of the work of special procedures across the 
United Nations system. There is limited knowledge about the human rights aspects of housing 
and this needs to be addressed. Moreover, further mainstreaming of human rights in the 
United Nations system is required, as there is often reluctance by some agencies to incorporate

</p>
<p>the human rights approach, erroneously perceived as &#8220;politicizing&#8221; their work. Unfortunately, 
without the adoption of a human rights approach, their efforts may not be effective or may even 
prove counterproductive. 
</p>
<p>60. In his efforts to mainstream the right to adequate housing in the work of international 
organizations, the Special Rapporteur has engaged actively with the International Olympic 
Committee in regard to the organization of mega-events, an initiative that should be continued by 
the next Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  DEVELOPMENT OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Need for further support and response from States 
</b></p>
<p>61. While certain States have seriously engaged with the Special Rapporteur in his work, 
others have shown less commitment. The reasons for this may be multiple. The lack of adequate 
staffing and resources within Government to engage with human rights mechanisms, as well as 
to cope with the new Human Rights Council system, could be one of the reasons. Ideological 
and/or political motivations and internal conflict within various Government departments about 
the relevance of the human rights approach (such as Ministries of Trade, Finance and Housing) 
may explain other situations. 
</p>
<p>62. In some cases, the Special Rapporteur may have faced non-responsiveness because the 
violations of the right to adequate housing touch upon issues such as the pre-eminence given to 
land and housing as speculative capital, corruption, real estate mobbing, land grabbing and 
illegal activities undertaken by land cartels and mafia. These issues negatively impact the efforts 
of individuals, civil society, and sometimes States themselves to implement the right to adequate 
housing. 
</p>
<p>63. Through his communication with States on information received, raising allegations that 
may reflect denial or violation of the right to adequate housing, the Special Rapporteur has tried 
to engage in a constructive dialogue. Many States have responded positively and provided 
information. Others have either not responded to his request for information or have only 
engaged on non-substantive issues.<b>36</b> The Special Rapporteur hopes that member States of the 
Human Rights Council will engage with the mandate on the substance of the allegation, invite 
the Special Rapporteur to visit their country and seek her/his assistance in moving toward the 
resolution of specific cases where the right to adequate housing has been, or is likely to be, 
violated. 
</p>
<p>64. As an example, the Special Rapporteur, in collaboration with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, has recently taken the 
initiative to offer assistance to the Government of Mexico, national institutions, affected civil 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>36
</b>  On average, Governments have responded to fewer than one-third of the communications of 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>society groups and regional politicians, to address the impact of a large development project on 
indigenous people.<b>37</b> The Rapporteur sees this form of assistance as a useful role for mandate 
holders. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Suggested areas of continued focus 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Access to land 
</b></p>
<p>65. In this section, the Special Rapporteur wishes to continue the discussion that he initiated in 
the last report he presented to the Council regarding the link between land and the right to 
adequate housing.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>66. In several reports,<b>39</b> the Special Rapporteur has stressed that land, as a housing resource, is 
a critical element of the human right to housing. Inadequate housing of the poor is often the 
consequence of being barred from access to land, credit, and materials with which to build. 
When access is granted, tenure generally is not. The lack of legal provisions to enable 
communities to inhabit or own land and to make productive use of natural or common resources 
should also be noted as creating an obstacle to the implementation of the right to adequate 
housing. 
</p>
<p>67. Land constitutes the main asset from which the rural poor are able to derive a livelihood. 
Of all the private land in the world, however, nearly three quarters is estimated to be controlled 
by just 2.5 per cent of all landowners. Millions of families, though they toil on the land, do not 
enjoy ownership rights over it and are considered landless. An average of 71.6 per cent of rural 
households in Africa, Latin America, and Western and East Asia (excluding China) are landless 
or near landless.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>68. Land also plays a crucial role in the structural linkages between rural and urban housing 
problems. While migration to urban areas is on the rise, the underlying causes for this movement 
are not being addressed. Such migration is generally not voluntary, but is the product of extreme 
rural poverty due to landlessness; land insecurity; land conversions; the loss of means of 
subsistence resulting from a failure to give priority to agrarian reform or promote rural 
infrastructure; project-induced displacement; distressed housing; or the industrial takeover of 
farmland. The lack of legal recognition of the right to land contributes to these situations. In 
cities, these migrants are often precluded from accessing adequate housing and forced to live in 
slums and other informal settlements characterized by insecure and inadequate living conditions.

</p>
<p>69. Inequitable land ownership patterns and landlessness give rise to a host of interrelated 
problems that range from inadequate housing and lack of livelihood options, to poor health, 
hunger and food insecurity, and acute poverty. The growing control of land by corporate 
enterprises and the accompanying industrialization of agriculture tend to displace the poor to 
marginal areas for farming, and threaten social and ecological sustainability.<b>41</b> Access to land is 
also critical for building socio-economic security. Many Governments and donor agencies fail to 
understand the important role that landlessness often plays in poverty and marginalization. This 
is evident in the low priority given to land and agrarian reform. This situation has given rise to 
well-organized movements of landless peasants and rural workers who are bringing agrarian 
reform to national and international policy debates, often at great personal risk, including to their 
lives. 
</p>
<p>70. The failure of States to provide legal security of tenure and to legally recognize the land 
and housing rights of communities makes them vulnerable to forced evictions. Globally, the 
trend to evict communities in the name of city beautification, urban renewal, industrialization 
and development-based activities, including mining or the building of dams and other 
infrastructures, has been accelerating. 
</p>
<p>71. In many countries, the control and ownership of land, especially in rural areas, by women 
is critical to their livelihoods, food security, economic independence and physical security, 
including of their children. Women, however, own only an estimated 1 to 2 per cent of all titled 
land worldwide, which is often cited as the result of low levels of inheritance of property by 
women.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>72. With the growing migration of men to urban areas in search of employment in many 
countries, it is mainly women who continue to farm in rural areas. This rising &#8220;feminization of 
agriculture&#8221; further heightens the importance of guaranteeing women&#8217;s land rights. 
</p>
<p>73. The studies and consultations on women and housing conducted by the 
Special Rapporteur, including testimonies from women, reveal<b> </b>widespread violation of women&#8217;s 
rights to adequate housing and land.<b>43 </b>On several occasions, the Special Rapporteur has 
expressed concern regarding the prevalence of cultural norms and traditions that deprive women 
of their rights to land, inheritance and property, which in turn prevents them from accessing their 
right to adequate housing. Of particular concern is the reflection of discriminatory cultural and 
social norms in family or personal law, including uncodified laws.

<p>74. The conceptual and practical linkage between land and other human rights is particularly 
evident with respect to indigenous peoples. Despite the often sacred relationship with their 
territories and deep-rooted and historical ties, the land and territories of indigenous populations 
have frequently been appropriated by others. The failure of States to recognize indigenous and 
other local communities as rightful stewards or owners of the natural resources they cultivate and 
manage is symptomatic of the neglect of rights of the rural poor. The systematic denial of 
ownership and collective land rights makes such communities more vulnerable to forced 
displacement, thereby threatening their livelihoods. The slow progress in demarcation of 
indigenous land is an obstacle to the legal recognition of community-based property rights for 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>75. Land is also of great importance to certain groups that have suffered historic 
discrimination, whether on grounds of descent, race or colour. For instance, descent and 
work-based communities, such as the Dalits in India, continue to face extreme human rights 
violations, including with regard to land and housing rights. In Brazil, the Afro-Brazilian 
communities of <i>quilombos</i> (former slave colonies) face discrimination that severely impacts their 
ability to enjoy the human right to land and adequate housing and force them to the fringes of 
mainstream society.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>76. Lack of access to housing, land and property also impact refugees who are forced to flee 
their home countries or those who have been internally displaced due to internal conflict or large 
development projects. 
77. Urban and peri-urban areas across the world today are scenes of violations of the right to 
adequate housing, due to the inability or unwillingness of the authorities to adequately control 
land and housing speculation and to reverse the concentration of land ownership and hoarding of 
property. This phenomenon is also spreading to rural areas. The privatization of land often leads 
to land becoming less affordable, which has particularly affected women-headed households. 
Unaffordability, as a result of inadequate regulation of housing and land markets by States was 
identified in numerous mission reports as an important issue. 
</p>
<p>78. Although there are few international human rights legal provisions on the right to land,<b>45</b> 
the outcomes of various international conferences, including the Istanbul Declaration on Human 
Settlements, recognize the relation between land and housing.<b>46</b> The UN-Habitat Agenda 
commits Governments to providing legal security of tenure and equal access to land to all

</p>
<p><b>2.  Rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>79. The increasing trend of migration from rural to urban areas, results in the creation of slums 
and millions of people forced to live in inadequate and insecure housing conditions. The causes 
of this often involuntary migration are multiple and need to be addressed. People are forced to 
move to urban areas to earn a living, as well as obtain access to medical services and education. 
This results from the loss of means of subsistence due to the failure to give priority to agrarian 
reform, growing landlessness and indebtedness, the failure to promote rural development, 
displacement induced by large projects, or State and corporate takeover of farmland. While 
urbanization worldwide is increasing at an alarming rate, over 3 billion people continue to live in 
rural areas. The absolute number of rural inhabitants in Africa and Asia is projected to increase 
over the next 30 years. 
</p>
<p>80. Given the level of poverty and unemployment in rural areas, many of these people live in 
distressed housing conditions. Extreme poverty is far more prevalent in rural areas, where about 
75 per cent of the world&#8217;s poorest people live and depend on agriculture for their survival.<b>49</b> 
Thus, a specific focus on rural areas remains essential to improve enjoyment of the right to 
adequate housing. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies 
</b></p>
<p>81. Natural disasters result in displacement, loss of housing and livelihood thereby impacting 
on peoples rights to adequate housing and its congruent rights. Recent natural disasters,<b>50</b> and 
their aftermath, have demonstrated the need to integrate human rights standards into prevention,

<p>relief and rehabilitation efforts. In many of these situations, concerns raised include 
discrimination, gender insensitivity, lack of participation, and corruption and delay in 
distribution of aid, compensation and reconstruction work. 
</p>
<p>82. These situations impact women and children disproportionately, as previously highlighted 
by the Special Rapporteur.<b>51</b> In some cases, compensation is reportedly distributed to heads of 
household and thus most often to men, while ignoring the equal rights of women over land and 
housing. 
</p>
<p>83. The absence of secure title to housing and land complicates access to compensation and 
rehabilitation, including permanent housing. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur has asked States and the international community to take necessary 
steps to relieve the plight of the victims of natural disasters.<b>52</b> He welcomes the operational 
guidelines on human rights and natural disasters developed by the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee (IASC) that aims to assist States in developing policies to support persons affected 
by natural disasters and to protect their human rights.<b>53</b> He hopes that these guidelines will be 
used by all actors who currently rely exclusively on the Sphere guidelines<b>54</b> which the Special 
Rapporteur finds lacking in a strong human rights, including women&#8217;s rights, perspective.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Climate change 
</b></p>
<p>85. Although the current and impending threats posed by climate change are being widely 
recognized, the human rights impacts need to be urgently addressed by the United Nations 
human rights system. Climate change has an impact on a range of human rights, including the 
rights to adequate housing, food and water. Climate change leads to increases in disasters, 
desertification, drought and loss of livelihood, which in turn increase displacement and force

<p>people and communities into distressed housing and living conditions. Climate change has 
already affected millions of the world&#8217;s poorest people and could result in hundreds of millions 
of people suffering loss of livelihood and permanent displacement.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>86. International human rights law imposes several obligations on States that are relevant to 
addressing human vulnerabilities to climate change, including the obligation to improve access 
to housing located away from hazardous zones and to safe drinking water.<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Global challenges 
</b></p>
<p>87. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has continued to elaborate on linkages 
between the process of economic globalization and the realization of the right to adequate 
housing and other relevant rights, and sought to elaborate a research agenda on this topic. With 
already deteriorating living conditions for the majority of poor communities in cities and rural 
areas, local authorities and civil society organizations around the world are seeking to provide 
alternative approaches to development and planning, to protect their most vulnerable citizens 
from the negative impacts of economic globalization, including privatization processes. 
Innovative approaches to improving the housing and living conditions of the poor are found in 
cities implementing participatory budgeting or decentralization of administration and 
decision-making through democratic processes.<b>58</b> While concerns have been raised in the 
international community that globalization has exacerbated the current deepening inequality 
between and within nations, its direct impact on the right to adequate housing - broadly defined 
to include access to land, as well as other essential services such as water, electricity and 
sanitation - have yet to be systematically studied or estimated.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p>88. In today&#8217;s context of globalization and predominance of the free market economy, there is 
a trend towards greater competition and market efficiency which often results in increased 
marginalization of the poor. The Special Rapporteur has examined in a previous report<b>60</b> 
examples of privatization of water services that negatively affected the poor, concluding that 
unfettered globalization cannot bring about the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights.

<p>Governments have an important role to play in reconciling macroeconomic policies with social 
objectives and meeting the needs of the most vulnerable first, keeping in mind the primacy of 
human rights obligations.<b>61</b> 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur believes that the severity of the crisis affecting housing and land 
requires much more global attention and needs to be given priority on the global agenda, 
including in the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>90. Civil society plays a very important role in the recognition of the right to adequate housing 
both at national and international level. In a growing number of examples brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur, civil society seeks to defend and protect the right to adequate 
housing and land with limited means to challenge corrupt officials and private national and 
global entities. 
</p>
<p>91. On many occasions, the Special Rapporteur has witnessed the difficult conditions under 
which civil society actors defend the right to adequate housing, including the removal of funding 
from service providers if they are critical of the policies in place, political interference in their 
work, limitations to their freedom of expression and association, violence and even murder. 
</p>
<p>92. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about increasing reports of 
violence against human rights defenders protecting the right to housing and land, and against 
representatives of communities affected by infrastructure projects, mining activities, 
mega-events and natural disasters. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The overall assessment of the Special Rapporteur, after seven years as mandate 
holder, is that there is a severe and growing global housing and land rights crisis that needs 
to be given priority on the global agenda and accorded greater attention. In this context, in 
view of the issues raised in this report and in addition to the recommendations made in all 
his previous reports,62 the Special Rapporteur wishes to present a number of general and 
specific recommendations addressed to the Human Rights Council, States and the 
international community. 
</b></p>
<p><b>General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>States should take immediate measures aimed at conferring legal security of tenure 
upon those persons, households and communities currently lacking such protection, 
including all those who do not have formal titles to home and land.

</p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to take concrete measures, including through 
legislation and other regulatory mechanisms, to counter forced evictions; urban 
&#8220;apartheid&#8221; and segregation; land-grabbing; growth of the &#8220;land mafia&#8221; and land cartels; 
unbridled property speculation; and indiscriminate escalation of housing prices. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends institutionalizing inter-ministerial coordination 
so as to ensure that the formulation and implementation of national and global economic 
policies, such as those in the areas of trade, investment, finance, structural adjustment and 
debt, do not cause the State to ignore human rights obligations and aggravate living 
conditions for those people and communities facing discrimination and segregation with 
regard to housing, land and access to related civic services. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Legislation at all levels should reflect and effectively implement the rights to 
information and participation, which are crucial to the realization of the right to adequate 
housing. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Council may wish to express its support for the joint UN-Habitat/OHCHR 
Housing Rights Programme, emphasizing the need for efforts to combat forced evictions 
and homelessness, including by inviting States to provide financial support. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Homelessness 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the recommendations on homelessness 
contained in his 2005 annual report,63 in particular the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) States must address holistically the structural causes of homelessness and 
integrate appropriate and accessible support services, including for health, psychological, 
social and work-related support, with particular attention to homeless women and 
children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Laws and policies should recognize that homeless people have a justiciable right 
to adequate housing, and should not criminalize the homeless. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>In his thematic report on forced evictions,64 the Special Rapporteur made a number 
of recommendations. In addition, the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urges States, donors, international and regional financial institutions and 
private investors not to engage, whether directly or indirectly, in projects that may result, 
through forced evictions, in the violation of the right to adequate housing of individuals or 
communities; 
</b></p>

</p>
<p><b> (b) Recommends States, in view of the growing incidence of forced evictions 
worldwide, to incorporate the Basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement65 into national laws and policies governing housing and land 
issues, including resettlement policies, and encourages States to invite the Special 
Rapporteur to observe their practical application at the country level; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Recommends the Council to ensure wide dissemination of the Basic principles 
and guidelines and inclusion of the issue of development and market-induced 
displacements and evictions in the elaboration of mandates of relevant special procedures 
of the Council, in particular on the rights of indigenous peoples, internally displaced 
persons, violence against women, and the right to food; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strongly recommends the further elaboration of assessments of the impact of 
evictions, on the basis of these principles and guidelines. Such assessments need to include 
both material and non-material losses. Reference can be made in this task to the &#8220;loss 
matrix&#8221; developed by the Special Rapporteur in collaboration with civil society.66 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendations contained in his 2002 
report,67 in particular to assist in the follow-up to recommendations and commitments 
made at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and 
Related Intolerance and urges that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Legislative measures that prohibit racial and other discrimination in all areas of 
housing be enacted or strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Policies, programmes, and budgetary and financial allocations promote equal 
access to civic services essential to the realization of the right to adequate housing, 
including potable water, electricity and sanitation, and that policies that result in 
discriminatory access are reversed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Policies and laws are formulated to address multiple discrimination facing 
minority, indigenous and low-income communities in their struggle to exercise their right 
to adequate housing and land. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The human right to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> In view of the importance of developing further analytical, investigative and 
monitoring work on water and sanitation, the Special Rapporteur:

<p><b> (a) Urges States to take into account the contents of the general comment of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to water68 and, in 
accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2002/21, to give full effect to 
housing rights including the right to water, giving particular attention to women, children, 
communities that have been historically discriminated against and marginalized, and those 
living in extreme poverty; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Also urges States to guarantee universal access to basic human rights to water, 
sanitation and other essential services including electricity, and to exercise the utmost 
caution when contemplating policies that would lead to the privatization of water, 
sanitation, and electricity services; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Invites the Council to consider appointing a Special Rapporteur on the right to 
water and sanitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Given that the issue of affordability of housing will most probably worsen in the 
coming years, resulting in increased denial of the right to adequate housing, the Special 
Rapporteur calls upon the Human Rights Council to propose a human rights approach to 
this problem including through: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urging States to devote particular attention to the question of ensuring, where 
possible, progressive increases in budgetary allocation to housing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Requesting States to increase the availability of social housing and reversing any 
policies that lead to the reduction of housing subsidies for low-income groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Urging States to adopt appropriate measures to regulate public and private 
rental markets and the mortgage market, so that no household has to pay more than 
30 per cent of its income for housing, as higher housing costs can compromise enjoyment of 
other basic human rights such as health, food, education and clothing. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Access to land 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>On many occasions, the Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the Council to 
the unfinished agenda of recognizing the linkage between access to land and human rights. 
Therefore, the Council should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Reaffirm the right to equal and non-discriminatory access to land and recognize 
that in many circumstances meeting human rights obligations will require improving 
access to land, particularly for the rural poor in developing countries;

<p><b> (b) Consider the relationship between the right to land and congruent human rights 
and their implementation, in particular in regard to adequate housing and the right to food 
and work as a means to combat poverty, discrimination, violence, evictions and 
displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Consider holding an expert seminar to develop strategies for the legal 
recognition of land as a human right, including the protection of individual and collective 
land rights of indigenous peoples, peasants, the landless and other groups that are 
dependent on and derive their identity and livelihood from land and land-based resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Request States to give priority to agrarian and land reform in rural areas and to 
improving equal access to land and wealth in both urban and rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out since the inception of the mandate, there is 
a growing neglect of the human rights of rural populations and the development of rural 
areas. It is therefore imperative that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) States collaborate with international and regional development agencies, donors 
and civil society to develop integrated rural development strategies, with policies and 
programmes that have the aim of sustaining rural livelihoods, with a focus on rural 
employment generation and local infrastructure development; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) States and international organizations take steps to ensure that rural 
development, including of remote areas and in cooperation with local communities, is 
integrated with national housing policy and strategy, and that improvement in housing and 
living conditions (including water and sanitation) is linked with employment and education 
opportunities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>In regard to natural disasters, humanitarian emergencies and post-disaster 
reconstruction, the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Recommends that the Council consider promoting disaster preparedness and 
relief and rehabilitation as essential to the enjoyment of human rights; 
 (b) Urges that international human rights standards and principles be incorporated 
into all relief and rehabilitation efforts, including those of the international community, 
international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations, in order to 
facilitate the speedy transition from temporary shelter to permanent housing for those 
affected; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Urges States to ensure implementation of the rights to information and 
participation and to seek the prior informed consent of victims or beneficiaries in all stages 
of relief and rehabilitation, including the provision of shelters and permanent housing; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16

<p><b> (d) Urges States to ensure that relief and rehabilitation efforts are gender-sensitive 
and culturally appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Human Rights Council must continue to focus on and promote women&#8217;s rights to 
adequate housing, land, property and inheritance. The Special Rapporteur has in his three 
reports on this issue made a number of recommendations. In addition, he: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urges States to guarantee women&#8217;s legal security of tenure over housing and 
land, including the recognition of women&#8217;s equal rights to housing, property and land; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Recommends that the Council reflect on the need for a Special Rapporteur on 
laws that discriminate against women and continue mainstreaming gender and women&#8217;s 
rights in its work;69 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Requests more collaborative work between special procedures mandate holders 
in this regard, including expanding the work on the link between women&#8217;s right to 
adequate housing and the violence they face in and around the home; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Urges the Council and the next Special Rapporteur on adequate housing to 
continue focusing on women and housing, including by: (a) further analysis and 
recommendations on the policy implications of an intersectional approach; (b) formulating 
strategies, in collaboration with States and civil society, to close the increasing gap between 
recognition and implementation of women&#8217;s rights to housing and land; and (c) continuing 
collaborative work with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women towards a general recommendation on women&#8217;s right to adequate housing and 
land.

<p><b>Children and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States and concerned parties to address the 
deteriorating global state of housing and homelessness of children around the world and 
make it a priority concern requiring urgent action. He recommends that the Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urge the next Special Rapporteur on adequate housing to continue close 
collaboration with the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in particular in view of the 
possible preparation of a general comment which may address issues such as the link 
between violence and the child&#8217;s right to adequate housing, the safety of children at home, 
and the impact of evictions on children; 
</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>a gender perspective in the work of the Council, (A/HRC/6/SR.12). </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/16

</p>
<p><b> (b) Request the next Special Rapporteur on adequate housing to analyse the impact 
of inadequate housing on children and their human rights, and establish specific 
recommendations in this regard, including policy measures to mitigate the psychological 
impact of evictions and other violations of the right to adequate housing on children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous peoples and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure the right to adequate housing for indigenous peoples, respecting their 
particular cultural housing and land needs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Recognize the historical rights that indigenous people have over their homes 
and territories; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Assure indigenous peoples a real participatory role in and control over, to the 
greatest extent possible, their affairs, including management, use and ownership of their 
natural resources; 
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> In addition, the Special Rapporteur believes that particular attention should be given 
by the United Nations to indigenous peoples living in rural areas, and the inadequate living 
and housing conditions forcing them into urban areas, as well as the housing, living 
conditions, evictions and discrimination that they face in urban areas. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Groups requiring special attention 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Human Rights Council must urge States to ensure that their national housing 
policies guarantee the provision of housing and proper support services to address the 
requirements of disadvantaged groups, including persons living with psychosocial and 
other disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>In addition, States should adopt specific legal provisions and programmes to 
eliminate barriers to physical accessibility in existing structures and make compulsory the 
elimination of these barriers in all new construction, as required by the new Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Given the critical role played by civil society in all aspects of advocacy, analysis, 
monitoring and implementation of the right to adequate housing, the Special Rapporteur 
calls upon the Human Rights Council to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Closely monitor the situation of human rights defenders and representatives of 
victims of housing and land rights violations, and take the necessary measures to ensure 
that claims for adequate housing and land are not criminalized; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Acknowledge the critical nature of the work being undertaken by campaigns 
and movements on housing and land rights and, given the increased stress under which 
civil society actors operate, ensure that sufficient spaces are made available for meaningful 
dialogue with civil society and those directly affected by violations of the right to adequate 
housing. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Monitoring implementation of the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>As the Special Rapporteur has emphasized on many occasions, it is of the utmost 
importance that implementation of the right to adequate housing is objectively evaluated. 
In this context, he: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urges States to adopt indicators and statistics on adequate housing70 and 
establish national benchmarks consistent with their human rights obligations, organize 
follow-up initiatives at country level and undertake further collaboration with OHCHR 
and UN-Habitat on indicators on the right to adequate housing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Urges States, in collaboration with the next mandate holder, OHCHR and 
UN-Habitat, to review the</b> <b>questionnaires developed by the Special Rapporteur (on the 
right to adequate housing, and on women and housing), with a view to including new issues 
in such monitoring tools; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Urges United Nations agencies and field presences to play a much more active 
role in monitoring implementation of the right to adequate housing and supporting States 
in their consideration of the recommendations of treaty bodies and Special Rapporteurs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Collaboration 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that collaborative work between mandate holders 
and between different parts of the United Nations human rights system is crucial and 
should be strengthened. The support of the Council is critical in this respect. The Council 
may wish to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Request the next mandate holder on adequate housing to work with all relevant 
mandate holders through joint missions, communications and other initiatives to reinforce, 
inter alia, the indivisibility of all human rights and their linkage with the right to adequate 
housing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Urge the next mandate holder to continue the dialogue with all relevant treaty 
bodies, including initiating work on relevant matters with the Human Rights Committee 
and the Committee against Torture.
