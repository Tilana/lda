</p>

<p><b>I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 25/28 on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to present a report to 
</p>
<p>the Council at its twenty-eighth session, detailing the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in the report of the independent international fact-finding 
</p>
<p>mission to investigate the implications of Israeli settlements on the civil, political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian People throughout the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem (A/HRC/22/63).  
</p>
<p>2. The present report, submitted pursuant to resolution 25/28, contains the information 
</p>
<p>requested and received from States to which the fact-finding mission addressed 
</p>
<p>recommendations, as well as information gathered by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights. The present report contains information up until 25 
</p>
<p>November 2014 and follows the report on the same subject matter which included 
</p>
<p>information up until November 2013 and was presented at the twenty-fifth session of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council (A/HRC/25/39). It should be read in conjunction with the report of 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General to the twenty-eighth session of the Human Rights Council on Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan (A/HRC/28/44) and recent reports of the Secretary-General and the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of the recommendations of the fact-finding mission 
</b></p>
<p>3. In its report, the fact-finding mission made six recommendations, of which four 
</p>
<p>were addressed to the State of Israel. Basing itself on article 49 of the Fourth Geneva 
</p>
<p>Convention, the mission called upon Israel to cease all settlement activities without 
</p>
<p>preconditions; to immediately initiate a process of withdrawal of all settlers from the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory; and to ensure adequate, effective and prompt remedy for all 
</p>
<p>Palestinian victims for the harm suffered as a consequence of human rights violations that 
</p>
<p>were a result of the settlements, in accordance with its international obligation to provide 
</p>
<p>effective remedy. The mission noted that, where necessary, steps should be taken to provide 
</p>
<p>such remedy in concurrence with the representatives of the Palestinian people and the 
</p>
<p>assistance of the international community (para. 112).  
</p>
<p>4. In addition, the fact-finding mission called upon Israel to put an end to the human 
</p>
<p>rights violations linked to the presence of settlements, and to ensure full accountability for 
</p>
<p>all violations, including for all acts of settler violence, in a non-discriminatory manner, and 
</p>
<p>to put an end to the policy of impunity. It furthermore urged Israel to put an end to arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrests and detention of Palestinians, especially children, and to observe the prohibition of 
</p>
<p>the transfer of prisoners from the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the territory of Israel, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (paras. 113&#8211;115). 
</p>
<p>5. In its report, the fact-finding mission called upon all Member States to comply with 
</p>
<p>their obligations under international law and to assume their responsibilities in their 
</p>
<p>relations with a State breaching peremptory norms of international law, and specifically not 
</p>
<p>to recognize an unlawful situation resulting from Israel&#8217;s violations (para. 116).  
</p>
<p>6. Lastly, the fact-finding mission stated that private companies must assess the human 
</p>
<p>rights impact of their activities and take all necessary steps &#8212; including by terminating 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Including A/HRC/28/45, A/HRC/28/80 and Add.1, A/69/348 and A/69/347. </p>


<p>their business interests in the settlements &#8212; to ensure that they do not have an adverse 
</p>
<p>impact on the human rights of the Palestinian people, in conformity with international law 
</p>
<p>and the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In this regard, the mission 
</p>
<p>called upon all Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure that business 
</p>
<p>enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or under their jurisdiction, including those 
</p>
<p>owned or controlled by them, that conduct activities in or related to the settlements, respect 
</p>
<p>human rights throughout their operations. The mission recommended that the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
</p>
<p>enterprises be seized of this matter (para. 117). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Status of implementation of the recommendations  
of the fact-finding mission 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Israeli settlement activity and recourse to remedy for Palestinians  
</b></p>
<p>7. As noted in the report of the Secretary-General on Israeli settlements in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan 
</p>
<p>submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session (A/69/348), Israel continues to 
</p>
<p>expand existing settlements in occupied territory and to advance new settlements in the 
</p>
<p>West Bank, including East Jerusalem.2 Settlements are directly linked to a broad range of 
</p>
<p>violations of the human rights of Palestinians, including their rights to non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p>liberty, security of person and fair trial, freedom of movement, adequate housing, health, 
</p>
<p>education, work and an adequate standard of living.3  
</p>
<p>8. Reportedly, between 1 November 2013 and 31 October 2014, 4,554 housing units 
</p>
<p>were tendered in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and 10,183 
</p>
<p>housing units advanced in the planning process towards realization, including 6,042 in the 
</p>
<p>West Bank and 4,141 in East Jerusalem.4  
</p>
<p>9. In late September 2014, the number of settlers in the Silwan area of East Jerusalem 
</p>
<p>increased after settlers moved into six houses, ostensibly after having purchased them, 
</p>
<p>although this is reportedly disputed by some of the Palestinian owners.5 New settlements in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank in 2014 included the long-disputed Al-Rajabi house in Hebron, capable of 
</p>
<p>housing 40 families, and the settlement of Leshem, near Salfit in the central West Bank.6 
</p>
<p>10. In a briefing to the Security Council on 17 November 2014, the Interim Assistant 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for Political Affairs noted that despite the &#8220;unanimous opposition to 
</p>
<p>increased settlement activity expressed in the recent Security Council session on Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>plans have since been advanced to build some 500 residential units in the settlement of 
</p>
<p>Ramat Shlomo. In addition, 28 new building permits and 200 new residential units were 
</p>

<p>approved in the settlement of Ramot, in East Jerusalem.&#8221;7 Illegal Israeli settlement activity 
</p>
<p>in East Jerusalem is one contributing factor to the volatile situation there.8  
</p>
<p>11. As reported to the twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/39), &#8220;the continued fragmentation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>through Israeli settlement expansion has gone hand-in-hand with the construction of the 
</p>
<p>wall, the destruction of Palestinian-owned property and the forcible displacement of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian civilians, including Bedouin communities&#8221;. At the time of writing, an Israeli 
</p>
<p>plan was being advanced to move Bedouin and herder communities from the East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem periphery and Jordan Valley to three allocated sites.9 On 21 October 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General expressed his concern over this plan, stating that &#8220;if implemented in a 
</p>
<p>forcible manner, &#61531;it&#61533; would be contrary to international human rights and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law&#8221;.10 The risk of forced eviction and forcible transfer of these communities appeared 
</p>
<p>imminent. Reportedly, demolitions of buildings belonging to these Bedouin communities 
</p>
<p>were ongoing.11 It is moreover of concern that the plan may enable additional expansion of 
</p>
<p>illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and may further undermine the 
</p>
<p>possibility for the Palestinian people to realize their right to self-determination.  
</p>
<p>12. The Secretary-General has previously noted that land which is declared by Israel as 
</p>
<p>State land is often allocated to settlements.12 Large land appropriations in 2014, in the 
</p>
<p>vicinity of Bethlehem, may facilitate future settlement expansion. On 25 August, the Israeli 
</p>
<p>Civil Administration declared 3,799 dunums (930 acres) around the settlement of Gva&#8217;ot, 
</p>
<p>near Bethlehem, as State land.13 This followed an earlier declaration of State land west of 
</p>
<p>Bethlehem in April.14  
</p>
<p>13. In the 10 years since the International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion of 
</p>
<p>July 2004,15 conclusively found that the construction of the wall in occupied territory and 
</p>
<p>settlements were illegal, the settler population in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>has increased substantially.16 The advisory opinion noted that the wall &#8220;has been traced in 
</p>
<p>such a way as to include within that area the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem)&#8221; (para. 119). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. In 2007, the United Nations Register of Damage caused by the Construction of the 
</p>
<p>Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the General Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution ES-10/17. It is mandated to record &#8220;damage caused to all natural and legal 
</p>
<p>persons concerned as a result of the construction of the wall by Israel &#8230; in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem&#8221;. According to the Register&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>website, as of October 2014, it had collected more than 43,850 claims and over 650,000 
</p>
<p>supporting documents in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. At the time of writing, 15,798

<p>of the collected claims had been reviewed by the Board of the Register and deemed valid 
</p>
<p>for inclusion in the Register.17<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Settler violence and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>15. As reported by the Secretary-General, &#8220;acts of violence by Israeli settlers against 
</p>
<p>Palestinians and their property continue to take place on a regular basis&#8221;.18 According to 
</p>
<p>figures published by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of 24 
</p>
<p>November 2014, the total number of settler violence incidents resulting in Palestinian 
</p>
<p>injuries or damage to their property in 2014 was 304. This compares to 389 recorded 
</p>
<p>incidents in the equivalent period of 2013.19 However, this relative decrease was 
</p>
<p>accompanied by a significant increase in Palestinian deaths and injuries caused by Israeli 
</p>
<p>Security Forces. The same period also saw a four-fold increase in violent incidents 
</p>
<p>involving Palestinians leading to settler casualties or damage to property.20  
</p>
<p>16. In October 2014, the Human Rights Committee issued its concluding observations 
</p>
<p>on the fourth periodic report of Israel (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4). Regarding settler violence, the 
</p>
<p>Committee noted the establishment of an interministerial team to deal with ideologically 
</p>
<p>motivated crimes, but was concerned at &#8220;the lack of effective accountability and protection&#8221; 
</p>
<p>from settler violence. It recommended that Israel &#8220;strengthen its efforts with a view to 
</p>
<p>ensuring that prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations are launched, in a 
</p>
<p>non-discriminatory manner, into all incidents of violence by private actors against 
</p>
<p>Palestinians and their property, that perpetrators are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished 
</p>
<p>with appropriate sanctions, and victims are provided with effective remedies&#8221; (para. 16). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Palestinian detainees, including children in Israeli custody 
</b></p>
<p>17. As concluded by the fact-finding mission, the existence of the settlements heavily 
</p>
<p>impact a wide range of Palestinians&#8217; human rights, including their rights to equality, due 
</p>
<p>process, fair trial, not to be arbitrarily detained, and liberty of person (A/HRC/22/63, 
</p>
<p>para. 105). According to the Palestinian non-governmental organization Addameer, as at 1 
</p>
<p>October 2014, 6,500 Palestinians were in Israeli detention, including 500 in administrative 
</p>
<p>detention on security grounds &#8212; held without charge or trial.21 The total number of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel was reportedly up by some 1,450 persons 
</p>
<p>compared to the previous year.22 The summer of 2014 witnessed a period of mass arrests of

</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Palestinians, especially following the kidnapping and murders of three Israeli youths in the 
</p>
<p>occupied West Bank in June 2014. An estimated 1,100 to 1,500 Palestinians, including 300 
</p>
<p>children, were detained in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, at some point between 
</p>
<p>12 June and mid-August 2014.23  
</p>
<p>18. The Secretary-General has consistently called for administrative detainees to be 
</p>
<p>formally charged or released without delay.24 In April, a large group of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>detainees went on hunger strike to protest the use by Israel of administrative detention. The 
</p>
<p>number fluctuated, reaching several hundred between April and late June 2014 when the 
</p>
<p>hunger strikers ended their protest.25  
</p>
<p>19. In February 2013, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) issued a report, 
</p>
<p>entitled &#8220;Children in Israeli Military Detention&#8221;, which found that the ill-treatment of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian children from the West Bank who come in contact with the Israeli military 
</p>
<p>detention system appeared to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the 
</p>
<p>process, from the moment of arrest until the child&#8217;s prosecution and eventual conviction 
</p>
<p>and sentencing.26 In an update report of October 2013, UNICEF referenced the commitment 
</p>
<p>made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel to study the recommendations and 
</p>
<p>cooperate with UNICEF for their implementation.27 However, treatment of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>children in Israeli detention continues to be gravely worrying and in need of action to 
</p>
<p>protect children&#8217;s rights.28 In its concluding observations, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>expressed concern &#8220;that Palestinian children are still exposed to arbitrary arrest and 
</p>
<p>detention&#8221; (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 19). It further expressed concern &#8220;at reports of the use 
</p>
<p>of torture and other ill-treatment in the State party&#8217;s detention facilities, including 
</p>
<p>widespread, systematic and institutionalized ill-treatment of Palestinian children&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>recommended that Israel &#8220;take robust measures to eradicate torture and ill-treatment against 
</p>
<p>adult and child detainees&#8221; (para. 15). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Business and human rights in relation to the settlements  
</b></p>
<p>20. In its resolution 25/28, the Human Rights Council reiterated its call (made 
</p>
<p>previously in  resolution 22/29) upon the relevant United Nations bodies to take all 
</p>
<p>necessary measures and actions within their mandates to ensure full respect for and 
</p>
<p>compliance with Human Rights Council resolution 17/4 on the Guiding Principles on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights and other relevant international laws and standards, and to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>the end of September 2014, there were 5,439 Palestinian so-called &#8220;security prisoners or detainees&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>Israeli prisons, including 368 from the Gaza Strip. In addition, there were 1,231 Palestinians held in

<p>Israel for being in Israel illegally (accessed in November 2014).

<p>remained seized of the matter of corporate engagement with settlements (A/HRC/22/63, 
</p>
<p>para. 117). On 6 June 2014, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/29, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
</p>
<p>business enterprises issued a statement on the implications of the Guiding Principles on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights in the context of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory.29 
</p>
<p>22. In the statement, the Working Group indicated that, in carrying out due diligence, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, corporations 
</p>
<p>should be cognizant of the illegal status of settlements under international law, and should 
</p>
<p>be informed by the publicly available information about the relation between settlements 
</p>
<p>and human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>further stated that the fact that the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including areas with 
</p>
<p>settlements, was a conflict-affected area resulted in a heightened risk of negative human 
</p>
<p>rights impacts which in turn required that companies act with heightened due diligence. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group noted that where a business could not prevent or mitigate human rights 
</p>
<p>risks, it might need to consider termination of operations (guiding principle 19).  
</p>
<p>23. In its report to the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, the Special 
</p>
<p>Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories reported on information received 
</p>
<p>regarding the continuing exploitation of natural resources in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory by Israeli and foreign companies, and on corporate involvement in a number of 
</p>
<p>Israeli measures with adverse human rights impacts, including involvement in Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements. It noted, as examples of corporate activities of concern from a business and 
</p>
<p>human rights perspective, three companies with activities in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory and one company in the occupied Syrian Golan.30 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Submissions by Member States pursuant to resolution 25/28  
</b></p>
<p>24. On 21 October 2014, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR) addressed notes verbales to all Permanent Missions to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva, in which it requested 
</p>
<p>information on any steps that their Government had taken, envisaged taking or were 
</p>
<p>otherwise aware of concerning the status of implementation of the recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>fact-finding mission report (A/HRC/22/63), and in particular with regard to those contained 
</p>
<p>in paragraphs 116 and 117 thereof (see paras. 5 and 6 above).  
</p>
<p>25. Also on 21 October, separate notes verbales were addressed to the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission of Israel and the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>requested the Government of Israel to provide information on any steps that it had taken or 
</p>
<p>envisaged taking concerning the status of implementation of the recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 29 Available from www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Business/OPTStatement6June2014.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 30 The companies mentioned were HeidelbergCement, G4S, Ahava and Genie Energy. A/69/355, 
</p>
<p>sections IV.D and V. </p>


<p>fact-finding mission report. OHCHR also requested the Government of the State of 
</p>
<p>Palestine to present relevant information concerning the status of the same 
</p>
<p>recommendations. At the time of the preparation of the present report, no information had 
</p>
<p>been received from either the Permanent Mission of Israel or the Permanent Observer 
</p>
<p>Mission of the State of Palestine.  
</p>
<p><b>  Cuba 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Permanent Mission of Cuba submitted a note verbale dated 10 November 2014. 
</p>
<p>Cuba noted with grave concern that, despite repeated appeals from the international 
</p>
<p>community for Israel to completely halt all illegal settlement activities and violence, and to 
</p>
<p>stop and reverse the construction of the wall, among other illegal policies and practices, 
</p>
<p>Israel continued to colonize the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>and the Syrian Golan. Cuba stated that, in doing so, Israel displaced Palestinian civilians, 
</p>
<p>imposed collective punishment on the people and violated international law. 
</p>
<p>27. Cuba reiterated the fundamental principle that acquisition of territory by force is 
</p>
<p>inadmissible under international law and the Charter of the United Nations. It noted that the 
</p>
<p>continued Israeli military occupation of the Syrian Golan since 1967 was unacceptable. 
</p>
<p>28. Cuba condemned settlement policies enacted by the Government of Israel in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan, with disregard for international law, international conventions, the 
</p>
<p>Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. Cuba specifically referenced General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 68/17, which highlighted the illegality of construction of settlements 
</p>
<p>and other Israeli activities in the occupied Syrian Golan, and General Assembly resolution 
</p>
<p>68/84, which calls upon Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
</p>
<p>composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and, in 
</p>
<p>particular, to desist from the establishment of settlements. 
</p>
<p>29. Regarding the construction of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including in and around East Jerusalem, Cuba stated that this was in flagrant violation of 
</p>
<p>international law and an obvious challenge to United Nations resolutions and the July 2004 
</p>
<p>advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p>30. Cuba demanded an immediate end to the construction and expansion of settlements 
</p>
<p>and the Wall; transfer of settlers; house demolitions; intensification of land confiscations; 
</p>
<p>evictions; excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem, including its religious sites and 
</p>
<p>surroundings; displacement of Palestinian civilians; imposition of arbitrary and racist 
</p>
<p>residency and movement restrictions on Palestinians; and all other measures to depopulate 
</p>
<p>the city of its Palestinian inhabitants and achieve the illegal annexation of East Jerusalem to 
</p>
<p>Israel. 
</p>
<p>31. Cuba stated that, since the negotiations resumed in 2013,31 Israel has announced 
</p>
<p>plans to build more than 13,000 [settler] homes, in addition to the ongoing construction of 
</p>
<p>thousands more throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in East Jerusalem 
</p>
<p>and its surrounding area. In this context, Cuba noted that, in 2013, at least 200 Palestinian 
</p>
<p>homes were demolished, forcibly displacing hundreds of people. Cuba also stressed that the 
</p>
<p>continued construction of the wall isolates entire communities and hinders the formation of 
</p>
<p>a Palestinian state. 
</p>
<p>32. Cuba stated that, in the nine months of negotiations, more than 60 Palestinians, 
</p>
<p>including children, were killed by the occupation forces, and that, in the same period, over 
</p>
<p>four thousand Palestinians, including children, joined thousands of Palestinian prisoners 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 The referenced round of negotiations ended in April 2014. </p>


<p>suffering constant violations of their human rights, torture and humiliation in Israeli 
</p>
<p>prisons. 
</p>
<p>33. Cuba reaffirmed its support for, and solidarity with, the Palestinian people, who, for 
</p>
<p>more than 45 years, have suffered under the brutal military occupation of their land, and 
</p>
<p>been denied their basic human rights, including the right to self-determination. Cuba stated 
</p>
<p>that the international community must assume its responsibilities, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international law and United Nations resolutions, to prevent Israel in persisting in its 
</p>
<p>ongoing violations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Denmark 
</b></p>
<p>34. In a note verbale dated 7 November 2014, the Permanent Mission of Denmark stated 
</p>
<p>that Denmark was pursuing a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict, including 
</p>
<p>between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and between Israel and Palestine. Denmark 
</p>
<p>expressed the view that the conflict contributes to a destabilization of the overall security 
</p>
<p>situation in the Middle East and must be resolved.  
</p>
<p>35. As a member of the European Union, Denmark noted that it fully associated itself 
</p>
<p>with the policy and initiatives undertaken by the European Union as a whole, as well as the 
</p>
<p>various efforts made by the European External Action Service and the Commission of the 
</p>
<p>European Union to further peace and justice in the context of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>36. At national level, Denmark pointed out that, in July 2014, it had introduced to the 
</p>
<p>Danish public the common messages from the European Union, aimed at raising awareness 
</p>
<p>among European citizens and businesses regarding involvement in financing, and economic 
</p>
<p>activities in, the settlements, including in the occupied Syrian Golan.32 Denmark noted that 
</p>
<p>in accordance with these messages, the European Union and its member States would not 
</p>
<p>recognize any changes to the pre-1967 borders which were not agreed by the parties, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to Jerusalem. Denmark affirmed that Gaza and West Bank, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem, and the &#61531;Syrian&#61533; Golan are territories occupied since 1967.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>37. In a note submitted by the Permanent Mission of Ireland on 3 November 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Government of Ireland noted that it did not recognize any transfer of sovereignty or 
</p>
<p>annexation of Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967, pending any agreement 
</p>
<p>between the parties to the conflict. Ireland had consistently affirmed that the establishment 
</p>
<p>of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was in breach of international 
</p>
<p>law. 
</p>
<p>38. Ireland noted that it was considering the formulation of a national plan of action for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It was not 
</p>
<p>aware of any Irish businesses engaged in activities in Israeli settlements. It stated that, in 
</p>
<p>July 2014, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland had issued new advice 
</p>
<p>for Irish citizens and businesses warning of the risks involved in financial and economic 
</p>
<p>activities in Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p><b>  The European Union 
</b></p>
<p>39. In a note verbale dated 24 November 2014, the Permanent Mission of the European 
</p>
<p>Union provided an update to its contribution of 21 November 2013, which was reflected in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 32 Information published on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, available from 
</p>
<p>http://um.dk/da/eksportraadet/markeder/markedsnyheder/newsdisplaypage/?newsid=5e152fbb-4d71-

<p>the report of the High Commissioner on the same subject matter, presented in March 2014 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/39). 
</p>
<p>40. The European Union reaffirmed its commitment to its long-standing position not to 
</p>
<p>recognize Israel&#8217;s sovereignty over territories occupied in 1967, namely, the West Bank, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the [Syrian] Golan Heights.  
</p>
<p>41. The European Union referred to its latest Council conclusions of 17 November 2014 
</p>
<p>in which it recalled that actions which called into question stated commitments to a 
</p>
<p>negotiated solution must be avoided. Further, the European Union deeply deplored and 
</p>
<p>strongly opposed the recent expropriation of land near Bethlehem, and recent 
</p>
<p>announcements of plans for new settlement construction, in particular in Givat Hamatos, 
</p>
<p>Ramat Shlomo, Har Homa and Ramot, as well as plans to displace Bedouins in the West 
</p>
<p>Bank, and the continued demolitions, including of projects funded by the European Union 
</p>
<p>and member States. The European Union noted that it had urged Israel to reverse these 
</p>
<p>decisions, which ran counter to international law and directly threatened the two state 
</p>
<p>solution. The European Union further stated that recent settlement activity in East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem seriously jeopardized the possibility of Jerusalem serving as the future capital of 
</p>
<p>both states. 
</p>
<p>42. The European Union recalled the illegality of settlements under international law, 
</p>
<p>and that the European Union and its member States remained committed to ensuring 
</p>
<p>continued, full and effective implementation of existing European Union legislation and 
</p>
<p>bilateral agreements applicable to settlement products. The European Union noted that it 
</p>
<p>closely monitored the situation and its broader implications and remained ready to take 
</p>
<p>further action in order to protect the viability of the two state solution.  
</p>
<p>43. The European Union pointed out that it had, since 1 January 2014, applied 
</p>
<p>guidelines on the eligibility of Israeli entities and their activities in the territories occupied 
</p>
<p>by Israel since June 1967 for grants, prizes and financial instruments funded by the 
</p>
<p>European Union. The European Union stated its belief that the United Nations Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights should be applied globally, and further noted that 
</p>
<p>it had called upon European companies to apply these principles in all circumstances, 
</p>
<p>including in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
