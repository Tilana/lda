 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus was 
established by Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/14 and extended by 
resolution 2005/13.  In its decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006 the Human Rights Council requested 
the special procedures to continue with the implementation of their mandates.  Among other 
things the Commission requested the Special Rapporteur to establish direct contacts with the 
Government and with the people of Belarus, with a view to examining the situation of human 
rights in Belarus. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Belarus, in 2006 as in 2004 and 
2005, has not responded favourably to his request to visit the country and has in general not 
cooperated with him in the fulfilment of his mandate.  Therefore, the report is based on the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to the Russian Federation in early 2006 as well as discussions and 
consultations held in Geneva, Strasbourg and Brussels with representatives of permanent 
missions and non-governmental organizations, the United Nations and specialized agencies, the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Council of Europe.  It is also 
based on media reports and various documentary sources.  It covers the period from September 
to December 2006 and makes reference to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s oral presentation to the 
Human Rights Council which covered the period from January to August 2006. 
</p>
<p> In section IV, the Special Rapporteur describes the situation of civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights in Belarus,<b> </b>which has steadily deteriorated in 2006.  In the last section, 
the Special Rapporteur addresses a number of issues which along the years have been the subject 
of allegations formulated not only by Belarus but also by several members of the Commission on 
Human Rights and later by members of the Human Rights Council, in particular the political 
motivation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate and of his assessments. 
</p>
<p> The conclusions and recommendations contained in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s last report 
(E/CN.4/2006/36) continue to be valid and should be considered an integral part of the present 
report.  The Special Rapporteur firmly believes that the first responsibility for improving the 
dramatic situation of human rights in Belarus lies with the country&#8217;s authorities.  Therefore, 
while bearing in mind that all the recommendations addressed to the Belarusian authorities in his 
2006 report were ignored, the Special Rapporteur stresses that they remain valid and must be 
reiterated even if there is no indication that this time they might be accepted and enhanced. 
</p>
<p> Among other things, the Special Rapporteur calls once again on the international 
community to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus; asks the Human Rights 
Council to request the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to immediately 
establish a group of legal experts to investigate the disappearance and murders of several 
politicians and journalists and to join the efforts of other international organizations to organize 
an international conference on the situation of human rights in Belarus; and calls for the 
establishment of an international fund for the promotion of human rights in Belarus. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur reiterates his recommendation to the Human Rights Council to 
extend the Belarus mandate not only in time, but also in scope and means, and calls for enhanced 
cooperation between regional organizations and the United Nations, and in particular between 
the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus was 
established by Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/14 and extended by 
resolution 2005/13.  In its decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006 the Human Rights Council requested 
the special procedures to continue with the implementation of their mandates.  At its second 
session, in October 2006, the Human Rights Council, in decision 2/102, recalled its 
decision 1/102.  The Commission requested the Special Rapporteur to establish direct contacts 
with the Government and with the people of Belarus, with a view to examining the situation of 
human rights in Belarus and following any progress made towards the elaboration of a 
programme on human rights education for all sectors of society, in particular law enforcement, 
the judiciary, prison officials and civil society, and to report to the Commission at its 
sixty-second session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Belarus, in 2006 as in 2004 
and 2005, has not responded favourably to his request to visit the country and has in general not 
cooperated with him in the fulfilment of his mandate.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s latest request 
was sent on 25 October 2006 and has not been answered.  Therefore, the present report is based 
on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to the Russian Federation in early 2006 as well as 
discussions and consultations held in Geneva, Strasbourg, France, and Brussels with 
representatives of Permanent missions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the 
United Nations and specialized agencies, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE), and the Council of Europe.  It is also based on media reports and various 
documentary sources.  It covers the period from September to December 2006 and makes 
reference to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s oral presentation to the Human Rights Council which 
covered the period from January to August 2006. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for the professionalism and dedication of the staff 
assigned to service his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>II.</b>  <b>ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>4. As he said in his oral presentation before the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur was invited to Moscow in January 2006.  He took the opportunity to present the main 
findings of his report, (E/CN.4/2006/36), conduct consultations with Russian officials and 
NGOs, and reiterate his readiness to take into consideration the views of the Belarus authorities 
should he be authorized to conduct a visit to Belarus. 
</p>
<p>5. In April 2006, the Special Rapporteur met with the High Commissioner and held 
consultations on the human rights situation in Belarus with a number of permanent missions and 
NGOs in Geneva.  He exchanged views on one of the recommendations in his last report:  to 
organize an international conference on the situation of human rights in Belarus, which would 
provide a forum to discuss possible ways to improve the human rights situation in the country 
and prepare the ground for an open-ended national round table on the situation of human rights 
in Belarus.  The OSCE and the Council of Europe have agreed in principle, the latter being 
willing to co-organize the conference. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. On 27 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur addressed the second session of the 
Human Rights Council where he gave an update on the situation of basic freedoms and human 
rights in Belarus, as well as its conclusions and recommendations.  His report was criticized by 
certain countries for a lack of impartiality and objectivity and for being politicized.  Others 
regretted the lack of cooperation of the Government of Belarus with the Special Rapporteur and 
commended his work. 
</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur gathered information from diverse sources such  
as NGOs (the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, Amnesty International, 
Human Rights Watch, the International League for Human Rights, the Human Rights Institute, 
the East European Democratic Centre and others), regional organizations (OSCE Council of 
Europe), United Nations bodies (United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the 
United Nations Country Team in Minsk), specialized agencies (International Labour 
Organization (ILO)) and the media. 
</p><p>8. In addition to the 11 communications sent by various special procedures to the 
Government of Belarus since January 2006 mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in his 
presentation before the Human Rights Council, three others have been issued: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 16 August 2006, concern was expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus that 
the sentences imposed on four human rights defenders might have been in connection 
with their activities in defence of human rights, in particular their participation in 
election-monitoring activities in Belarus; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 23 August 2006, concern was expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression at the 
sentencing of Alyaksandr Kazulin, leader of the Belarusian Socialist Democratic 
Party and former presidential candidate, to 5&#189; years&#8217; imprisonment for 
&#8220;hooliganism&#8221; and &#8220;organization of group activities that breach public order or active 
participation in similar activities&#8221;.  A reply from the Government was received on 
8 December; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 23 November 2006, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Belarus expressed concern at the detention of seven activists who 
worked to promote the human rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender 
(LGBT) persons in Belarus, and at the cancellation of the International LGBT 
Conference they had organized. 
</p>
<p><b>III.</b>  <b>THE APPLICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>9. Belarus is a Member of the United Nations and has ratified the Charter, which contains 
provisions relating to human rights, as well as six of the seven major human rights treaties 
(see E/CN.4/2006/36).  The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict entered into force for Belarus on 
28 February 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE SITUATION OF THE BASIC FREEDOMS AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b>  <b>Civil and political rights; mechanisms of protection 
</b></p>
<p>10. Systematic violations of civil and political rights and the deprivation of Belarusian 
citizens&#8217; right to effectively take part in the conduct of public affairs continue to be observed.  
Human rights protection mechanisms remain extremely weak, and there is no national human 
rights institution.  The judicial system is still subservient to the executive branch and there is no 
genuine independent legislative branch. 
</p>
<p>11. Presidential elections on 19 March 2006, in which incumbent President Lukashenka 
claimed victory with over 80 per cent of the vote, were said not to comply with standards for 
democratic elections.  OSCE and the European Parliament stated publicly that the election failed 
to meet international electoral standards because of arbitrary use of State power, widespread 
detentions, and disregard for the basic rights of freedom of assembly, association and expression.  
The European Parliament ad hoc delegation for the monitoring of presidential elections in 
Belarus stated that Alexander Lukashenka could not be recognized as the legitimate President of 
Belarus, as the elections were not free, fair or democratic, and called for a rerun of the elections, 
as well as for an extension of European Union sanctions against Belarus.  In April 2006, the 
EU Council extended a visa ban on 31 officials from Belarus, including President Lukashenka.  
On 18 May, the Council also applied an asset freeze to these individuals.  Nevertheless, on 
21 November, the European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood 
Policy issued a document setting out what the EU could bring to Belarus, were Belarus to engage 
in democratization and respect for human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur issued three press statements in March 2006 condemning the 
escalation of human rights violations in Belarus and requesting the release of imprisoned 
political opponents.  He strongly condemned the escalation of human rights violations committed 
by the Government against the independent press, opposition candidates and their supporters and 
human rights defenders ahead of the presidential election in Belarus, and urged the Government 
to promptly stop its campaign of aggression against human rights defenders, particularly the 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee and its members. 
</p>
<p><b>Administration of justice and law enforcement, the</b> <b>death penalty, disappearances and 
summary executions 
</b></p>
<p>13. Since his last report, the Special Rapporteur has remained concerned that Belarus is the 
last country in Europe to apply the death penalty.  The situation in the country is still 
characterized by harsh conditions of pretrial detention, the practice of torture and other inhuman 
treatment, and excessive use of force by the police. 
</p>
<p>14. Furthermore, it is alleged that judges virtually never refer to the Constitution or 
international treaties when they hand down rulings and that the decisions of the Constitutional 
Court are often ignored.  Trials are often held behind closed doors without adequate justification, 
and representatives of human rights organizations are denied access to courts to monitor 
hearings.  Punishments are often totally disproportionate.  The right to appeal is limited as the 
Supreme Court acts in many cases as the court of first instance, leaving no possibility for appeal.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Before and after the presidential elections, over 150 people were reportedly summarily put on 
trial without access to a defence lawyer.  Concerns were expressed regarding respect for their 
right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>15. The right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article 33 of the Constitution in 
practice faces numerous limitations.  Several articles of the Belarusian Criminal Code are used 
by the authorities to suppress the lawful exercise of the right to freedom of expression, including 
articles 367 (defamation of the President), 368 (insult to the President) and 369 (insult to a 
government official).  In August 2005, Presidential Decree No. 382 imposed a requirement for 
official registration of &#8220;public discussion&#8221; events (workshops, seminars) organized with foreign 
support.  In late 2005, the Belarusian parliament adopted amendments to the Belarusian Criminal 
Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure increasing penalties for &#8220;actions aimed against a 
person and public security&#8221;, which came into force on 1 January 2006.  The vague wording of 
the amendments paves the way for authorities to use their discretion for a broad, abusive 
interpretation.  A penalty was created for &#8220;discrediting Belarus&#8221;.  &#8220;Discrediting&#8221; in this context 
means &#8220;the fraudulent representation of the political, economic, social, military or international 
situation of the Republic of Belarus, the legal status of its citizens or its government agencies&#8221;.  
This would be likely to prevent Belarusian human rights defenders from communicating with 
United Nations special procedures. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur was informed of several cases in which freedom of opinion and 
expression were allegedly violated: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 10 May 2006, Artur Finkevich, a youth activist, was sentenced to 2 years of 
restricted liberty for writing political graffiti stating &#8220;We want a new President&#8221; and 
&#8220;Enough is enough!&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 16 June 2006, Nikolay Razumov was sentenced to 3 years in prison for releasing 
the information that President Lukashenka had been involved in the involuntary 
disappearances and deaths of Yury Zakharenko, Viktor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, 
Dmitry Zavadsky and Gennady Karpenko; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 23 October 2006, Katsiaryna Sadouskaya, a human rights defender, was 
sentenced to 2 years in a prison colony for alleged insults and threats (articles 391 and 
389 of the Criminal Code).  A letter that had never been sent was reportedly found in 
her home, calling for a psychiatric examination of President Lukashenka and a 
boycott of the March presidential elections and accusing the Russian secret services 
of supporting &#8220;the Belarusian dictator&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of the media 
</b></p>
<p>17. Freedom of the media is guaranteed by the Law on the Media, but several restrictions are 
imposed on this fundamental right.  In 2006, the index regarding freedom of the media 
established by Reporters without Borders ranked Belarus 151st out of 168 countries.  It is alleged 
that the Government of Belarus retains control of the broadcast media, printing plants and 
newspaper distribution networks using its monopoly to limit public access to information. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. In October 2006, the rector of the Brest State University, Miachyslau Chasnouski, 
refused to inform the correspondent of the independent newspaper <i>Brestskiy kurier </i>about the 
increase of the education fees.  The Baranavichy housing company refused to answer a written 
inquiry from non-State newspaper <i>Index-press</i> on the grounds that the company cooperated only 
with State publications. 
</p>
<p>19. Several months before the 2006 presidential election, 14 pro-opposition and independent 
newspapers including <i>Narodnaya</i> <i>Volya</i> and<i> Nasha Niva</i>, were denied distribution services by 
the national postal service (Belposhta<i>)</i> and by the State monopoly, Belsayuzdruk, which operates 
the only chain of news-stands and newspaper kiosks in Belarus.  As of November 2006, only 
three non-State newspapers reportedly had access to the nationwide distribution system.  Fearing 
problems with authorities, printing houses often refuse to print independent newspapers and 
magazines, or censor them.  On 16 November 2006, the Belarusian Ministry of Information 
issued an official warning to <i>Nasha Niva</i> as the newspaper had failed to comply with the 
provisions of the Belarusian Law on the Press and Other Mass Media to communicate the 
address of its editorial offices.  The only Belarusian-language independent newspaper has been 
facing enormous difficulties and had to change its legal addresses for the fourth time in 2006; as 
soon as the newspaper had moved to the new premises and communicated the new address to the 
Information Ministry and the Justice Department of the Minsk City Executive Committee, the 
landlords hasted to revoke the lease. 
</p>
<p>20. Accredited Moscow journalists of the newspapers <i>Moskovskiy Komsomolets</i> and 
<i>Kommersant</i> were not allowed by the authorities to cover the work of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States summit that took place on 28 November in Minsk.  It is believed that this was 
in retaliation for an article critical of relatives of President Lukashenka published in 
<i>Moskovskiy Komsomolets</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of assembly and association and the right to participate in the conduct of  
public affairs 
</b></p>
<p>21. These rights are protected under article 36 of the Constitution.  However, the law &#8220;On 
mass events&#8221; restricts the organization of demonstrations and allows the repression of 
unauthorized private meeting.  Several administrative requirements also hamper the exercise of 
freedom of association.  All NGOs and associations, including human rights organizations and 
trade unions must register, and receive official approval to operate.  Organizations can be closed 
down after receiving two successive &#8220;warnings&#8221; from the authorities for the breach of even 
minor administrative rules.  Law No. 213-3 of 26 June 2003 allows the courts to close down an 
organization for one single violation of the legislation on public meetings.  For instance, in 2003, 
courts issued 810 written warnings to NGOs and 51 NGOs were shut down at the initiative of the 
Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>22. In this regard, the Belarusian Helsinki Committee (BHC), the only remaining registered 
human rights NGO, has reportedly been the main target of the authorities.  Charges were brought 
against BHC for financial reasons and on the basis of foreign funding.  In 2004, the Minsk 
Economic Court confirmed that the activities carried out by BHC were lawful and complied with 
all the regulations and procedures:  the BHC projects, supported by the European Commission, 
were approved by the Government and registered with the Economics Ministry.  However, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>despite the fact that this matter is <i>res judicata </i>and a final decision has not been rendered, the first 
deputy chair of the Supreme Economic Court has filed a complaint against the court decision.  
In 2005, the Ministry of Justice issued a warning to BHC:  should BHC receive another similar 
reprimand, it could be ordered to close down by the Ministry of Justice which must first apply to 
the courts.  In response to the warning, and in order to avoid being liquidated, BHC dissolved its 
regional offices as legal entities but still has representatives who carry out activities in the 
region.  In late December 2005, the Supreme Economic Court reversed the decision of the Minsk 
Economic Court.  On 24 May 2006, the Belarusian Ministry of Justice asked the Supreme Court 
to order BHC to suspend its activities.  The Special Rapporteur was informed that on 
5 December 2006 court bailiffs confiscated the Belarusian Helsinki Committee&#8217;s property, 
including a computer, a fax machine and other office items.  The human rights group is accused 
of not having paid tax on financial aid received under the European Union TACIS programme, 
despite the fact that, according to a Belarusian government decision, such aid is tax-exempt. 
</p>
<p>23. Prior to and after the presidential election held on 19 March 2006, there were several 
reports that independent organizations and the political opposition had been persecuted by the 
authorities.  On 29 March, seven special procedures mandate holders - the Special Rapporteur  
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the  
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights  
defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in Belarus - issued a press release expressing concern at the large 
number of violations of the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association, a fair trial, 
physical and mental integrity and to liberty. 
</p>
<p>24. In a press release on 2 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur expressed grave concern  
over the detention of opposition leaders Aleksandr Milinkevich, Vintsuk Vyachorka, 
Aleksandr Buchvostau, and Sergei Kalyakin, who were arrested in Minsk on 27 April and 
sentenced to 15 days of imprisonment on charges of organizing and participating in an 
unauthorized protest rally, following their participation in a march to protest the Government&#8217;s 
management of the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986.  In this regard, he also joined an urgent 
appeal sent to the Government by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and<b> </b>the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression.  It is worth mentioning that in October the 
European Parliament awarded the 2006 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to 
Mr. Milinkievich in recognition of his personal efforts for greater democratic freedom and 
human rights in Belarus. 
</p>
<p>25. On 13 July 2006, Alyaksandr Kazulin, leader of the Belarusian Socialist Democratic 
party Narodnaya Hramada and former presidential candidate, was sentenced to 5&#189; years&#8217; 
imprisonment for &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; and &#8220;organization of group activities that breach public order or 
active participation in similar activities&#8221;.  The OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Belgian Foreign 
Minister Karel De Gucht, expressed his deep concern that Belarus had tried to make an example 
of Mr. Kozulin by imposing such a harsh sentence.  On 19 September, the Minsk City Court 
rejected the appeal and ruled that the July decision of the district court was justified.  On 
20 October, Mr. Kazulin started a hunger strike in order to protest against the lawlessness in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Belarus and to draw the attention of the United Nations Security Council to the situation in 
Belarus.  On 8 December, the Special Rapporteur urged the Belarus authorities to assure 
Mr. Kazulin&#8217;s access to proper health care and to grant family members, his legal representatives 
and independent monitors free access to Mr. Kazulin.  The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
on 12 December Mr. Kazulin interrupted his hunger strike on its fifty-fourth day and that, 
according to the prison authorities, his wife and lawyer would be granted access to him. 
</p>
<p>26. In August, four activists of the organization Partnerstva were sentenced to different terms 
of imprisonment under article 193.1 of the Criminal Code:  organization of or participation in the 
activities of an unregistered association, for their intention to observe the presidential elections in 
March 2006.  Two of them received 6 month sentences and were released very soon thereafter, 
as they had already spent that time in custody.  Mikalay Astreika was sentenced to 2 years, but 
on 17 November, his sentence was changed to a lighter one, &#8220;corrective labour&#8221;, allowing him to 
live at home and work at a specified workplace.  Part of his salary is remitted to the State.  
Timofey Dranchuk received a 1 year sentence and was released on parole on 26 December. 
</p>
<p>27. On 1 November 2006, Dzmitry Dashkevich, leader of the Young Front, was sentenced 
to 18 months&#8217; imprisonment on charges of &#8220;organizing the activity of an unregistered public 
movement&#8221;.  He had been detained since 15 September on suspicion of violation of article 193.1 
of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>28. On 3 November 2006, several Belarusian activists were obstructed or arrested by the 
authorities on their way to Kyiv where they were to take part in a regional conference of 
Belarusian opposition leaders in advance of local elections. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of religion</b> 
</p>
<p>29. The situation regarding freedom of religion has not improved since the last report of the 
Special Rapporteur.  The Belarusian Orthodox Church still benefits from privileges not enjoyed 
by other religious organizations.  Despite protests from religious communities, it has been 
alleged that State textbooks continue to make false allegations aimed at discrediting religious 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>30. The 2002 law &#8220;On religion&#8221; contains particular restrictions on religious freedom for 
foreign citizens.  For instance, only religious associations made up of at least 10 registered 
religious communities and including at least one active on the national territory for at least 
20 years have the right to invite foreign citizens to conduct religious activities.  The five 
registered Belarusian Krishna communities complained to the United Nations that they were 
unable to invite foreign citizens to conduct religious activities.  In January 2006, Belarus rejected 
the finding by the Human Rights Committee that there had been a violation of the Krishna 
devotees&#8217; freedom of religion (see CCPR/C/84/D/1207/2003 of 23 August 2005).  In August, the 
State Committee for Religious Affairs denied the Full Gospel Union permission to invite a 
Nigerian pastor to preach in three of its churches on the grounds that the visit was &#8220;not 
expedient&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. In 2006, the work permit of United States citizen Stewart Vinograd, pastor of the 
Minsk-based Messianic Jewish congregation, was not renewed.  Twelve Polish Catholic priests 
and nuns were also informed that their visas would not be renewed at the end of the year. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. In October, parishioners of the New Life church rallied to protest its possible closure by 
authorities who ordered the congregation to vacate the building it had bought and sell it to the 
Government at a nominal price.  The parishioners started a hunger strike. 
</p>
<p>33. The same month, the Baranovichi Municipal Court sentenced the Pentecostal Church to 
pay fines for conducting religious activities without State permission.  
</p>
<p>34. On 1 December 2006, Catholic parishioners of Our Lady of Vostraja Brama started a 
hunger strike demanding that the Executive Committee of Grodno overturn the decade-long 
refusal to allow them to build a new church.  On 6 December, their demand was agreed to by the 
City Council. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. Owing to the continuing refusal of the Government to allow the Special Rapporteur to 
visit Belarus, this part of the report is based on documentary sources.  The last (fourth) periodic 
report submitted to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CCPR/C/84/Add.4) 
dates back to 1996, the Government of Belarus having failed to submit its fifth periodic report, 
due in November 2001.  The UNDP Human Development Report 2006 ranks Belarus 67th out 
of 177 countries, with a Human Development Index of 0.794 (2004). 
</p>
<p><b>Right to work and workers&#8217; rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. Trade unions&#8217; freedoms are severely restricted in Belarus.  At its 297th session, in 
November 2006, the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization discussed the 
type of measures that could be taken to implement the recommendations of the 2004 
Commission of Inquiry regarding trade union rights in Belarus.  The Government of Belarus has 
recently engaged in discussions with the Governing Body of the ILO.  It was also requested to 
cooperate with the ILO to ensure that the planned legislative changes are in line with the ILO 
conventions on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. 
</p>
<p>37. In October 2006, the leader of the Belarusian Trade Union of the Radio-electronic Trade 
was detained by border guards for two hours on his way to a Lithuanian health centre.  He was 
not charged with any wrongdoing, but by the time he was released he had missed the bus. 
</p>
<p>38. On 21 November, the directorate of bus park No. 1 of Homel did not extend the contract 
of the head of the independent trade union.  The deputy director of the bus depot stated that this 
person could not work for the company because he was a member of an independent trade union. 
</p>
<p>39. Trade unions, like some NGOs and independent newspapers, face difficulties in  
finding premises and therefore cannot secure the legal address required for registration.  In 
October 2006, the administration of the Belnaftakhim company refused to provide an office to 
the main branch of the Free Trade Union of Belarus.  As a result, the trade union could not 
register. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>40. Since the last report of the Special Rapporteur, the total expenditure on health in  
Belarus has dropped.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total 2006 
expenditure on health represented 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), whereas  
it was 6.4 per cent in 2002. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>41. Likewise, expenditures on education have decreased.  In 2004, public expenditure on 
education was 5.8 per cent of GDP, whereas they were 6.0 per cent in 2003. 
</p>
<p>42. Following the issuance of a circular, &#8220;On measures of non-admittance of any pupils and 
students involved in unlawful political activities&#8221; by the Ministry of Education in May 2005, 
several students were expelled from educational institutions.  For example, on 30 October 2006, 
Siarhei Huminski, a Young Front activist, was expelled from Svetlahorsk State Industrial 
Technical College for violating regulations and missing classes; he had been threatened with 
expulsion for his political activity in September by the head of the college.  On 29 November, 
Alexander Stranchuk and Dzianis Sarokin, active participants in the election campaign, were 
expelled from the agro-ecology faculty of Hoerki academy. 
</p>
<p><b>Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the lack of equality between men and 
women in the labour sector, mainly with regard to political life and decision-making. 
</p>
<p>44. Domestic violence is also an issue of concern, as it reportedly affects 30 per cent of 
women in Belarus.  Reportedly, women usually escape domestic violence by divorcing, thus 
explaining the high divorce rate in Belarus.  It has been acknowledged by some NGOs that 
domestic violence is a push factor for trafficking, as women seek to escape their home situation 
and feel that they have nothing to lose by emigrating. 
</p>
<p><b>Resources and sustainability of the system 
</b></p>
<p>45. Belarus ranks 151 out of 163 countries in Transparency International&#8217;s 2006 Corruption 
Perceptions Index, with a corruption perception index of 2.1 out of 10 (0 indicating the highest 
level of perceived corruption). 
</p>
<p>46. On the basis of the available data, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the budgetary 
expenditures of Belarus (especially those related to the internal security forces and to the social 
safety net policies) cannot possibly be supported by the performance of the country&#8217;s highly 
centralized and relatively closed economy.  A thorough international investigation into the origin 
of the financial resources funding these expenditures is therefore necessary.  That origin may 
very well be of an illicit nature. 
</p>
<p>47. After the issuance of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s last report on the situation of human rights 
in Belarus in January 2006 and its presentation to the Human Rights Council in September 2006, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>various sources, such as the Report on Belarus, the Last Dictatorship in Europe, including Arms 
Sales and Leadership Assets, issued by the United States Government on 16 March 2006, and the 
international media (<i>International Herald Tribune</i>, Mark Douglas, &#8220;Choke off Belarus&#8217;s deadly 
arms trade&#8221;, 9 October 2006) made public data concerning the possible involvement of Belarus 
in international weapons trafficking, thus confirming the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s fears on that 
issue. 
</p>
<p>48. On the other hand, after the presentation of the previous report and very much in line 
with its recommendations, the Russian Federation announced that it would eliminate the price 
subsidies for energy exported to Belarus (including natural gas).  If market prices for energy are 
going to be applied in the trade relations between Belarus and Russia, it is very likely that the 
authorities in Minsk will no longer have the financial means to continue to commit human rights 
violations and limit civil liberties by means of a discriminatory social protection policy.  
However, a number of representatives of the Belarus political opposition and civil society have 
claimed that the new Russian trade policy towards their country has as its aim to reduce, or even 
put an end to the economic and, eventually, political independence of Belarus. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Cultural rights and national minorities 
</b></p>
<p>49. Since the last report of the Special Rapporteur, the Union of Poles in Belarus (UPB) still 
faces difficulties with the authorities.  In late October 2006, Belarusian customs officials claimed 
that they had found drugs in a car carrying Angelica Borys, the ousted leader of the UPB.  She 
and her supporters say that this accusation is politically motivated. 
</p>
<p>50. The Roma minority (about 70,000 people) also faces discrimination and exclusion.  In 
particular, Roma often are victims of police violence, lack the identity documents they need to 
access fundamental rights, live in isolated settlements and have limited access to education.  
Roma children face difficulties in enrolling in school.  Reportedly, 50 per cent of the Roma 
population is illiterate, 85 per cent do not complete secondary education and 98 per cent are 
unemployed. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Before drawing any conclusion on the substance of the matter, the Special 
Rapporteur is obliged to address a number of issues which along the years have been the 
subject of allegations formulated not only by Belarus but also by several members of the 
Commission on Human Rights and later by members of the Human Rights Council, 
namely:  (a) that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate and his assessments are politically 
motivated; (b) that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations have an unacceptably 
political character which aim at regime change; (c) that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s approach 
is subjective and biased; and (d) that the Special Rapporteur has exceeded the limits of the 
mandate entrusted to him by the Commission/Council.  On those issues the Special 
Rapporteur states the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Individual and collective human rights are about power-sharing between the 
State and the citizens as well as between the political leadership and the society.  That 
means that everything related to the protection and promotion of human rights is political.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>On the other hand, there is a clear and indestructible interrelationship between respect for 
human rights, the effectiveness of democratic mechanisms and the functioning of the rule 
of law.  The nature of recognized and protected human rights, as well as the instruments 
for their protection are different in different countries in accordance with the differences 
between those countries&#8217; political regimes.  While one should admit that respect for human 
rights might vary from one country or region to another as a result of variations in local 
cultural, social and historical backgrounds, one must admit that there is a minimal set of 
fundamental values having a universal character encompassing basic human rights which 
must be enhanced, respected and protected everywhere in the world.  The violation of these 
basic universal rights is a matter of legitimate concern for the whole international 
community and legitimates the intervention of the whole international community.  Such 
an intervention, which should take place in compliance with international law, has not only 
a moral basis but also a pragmatic and political explanation, since lack of respect for 
human rights generates social tensions and ultimately national and international 
insecurity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Whenever an incompatibility exists between the nature of a certain political 
regime and respect for universally recognized human rights, a change in the political 
behaviour of the respective regime must be recommended.  The alternative would be the 
acceptance of the human rights violations and of their consequences in the security field.  
What must be stressed is that such a change should be foreseen and promoted only in a 
transparent way, with non-violent means and preferably within a multilateral framework.  
This is precisely what the Commission on Human Rights was doing by putting in place the 
country mandates; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Since violations of human rights affect at the same time the real lives of 
human beings and international security, it is of paramount importance for everyone not 
only to assess the situation, but to act to change it for the better.  To this end the mandate 
of a special rapporteur has no limits, any rapporteur being obliged to look at every single 
issue which might directly or indirectly touch upon the capacity to violate or, on the 
contrary, to restore respect for human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) In the accomplishment of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has 
encountered, for the third consecutive year, an absolute refusal to cooperate on the part of 
the Government of Belarus.  All efforts made to engage in constructive dialogue were 
fruitless.  The Special Rapporteur has consistently informed the Government of Belarus of 
all of his findings based on information received from different sources, requested their 
official assessment, and made it clear that silence would be interpreted as a confirmation of 
accuracy.  The absence of any reaction implies that the Government of Belarus accepts the 
facts contained in this report. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The decision to establish a special procedure to monitor the situation of human 
rights in Belarus, taken in accordance with United Nations rules, must be accepted and 
enforced by all States Members of the United Nations.  The systematic obstruction of 
United Nations special procedures in the fulfilment of their mandates violates the 
obligations which the Republic of Belarus has accepted as a Member State.  The persistent </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>violation by Belarus of its obligations has been reiterated in resolution 61/175 of the 
General Assembly, in which the Assembly expressed deep concern about the failure of the 
Government of Belarus to cooperate fully with all the mechanisms of the Human Rights 
Council, and the failure to meet its commitments to hold free and fair elections.  The 
Assembly insisted that the Government of Belarus cooperate fully with all the mechanisms 
of the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The conclusions reached by the Special Rapporteur in his second report 
(E/CN.4/2006/36) were fully confirmed during the third term of his mandate.  The 
conclusions and recommendations contained in that report continue to be valid and should 
be considered an integral part of the present report.  The Special Rapporteur firmly 
believes that the first responsibility for improving the dramatic situation of human rights 
in Belarus lies with the country&#8217;s authorities.  Therefore, while bearing in mind that all the 
recommendations addressed to the Belarusian authorities in his 2006 report were ignored, 
the Special Rapporteur stresses that they remain valid and must be reiterated even if there 
is no indication that this time they might be accepted and enhanced. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>In parallel with the execution of the country mandate regarding Belarus, at least  
seven other special procedures mandate-holders - the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur  
on the torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, the  
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights  
defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - made 
assessments identical to those of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Belarus and, concerned by their findings, addressed several urgent appeals to the 
Government of Belarus.  Most of those appeals received no reply, and the few answers that 
were given were superficial.  Thus, all major information having been thoroughly checked, 
all the concerned special procedures have converged towards the same opinion on the 
situation of human rights in Belarus. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>At the same time, the opinions and assessments of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Belarus were confirmed and fully shared by the most 
important European or Euro-Atlantic organizations, namely the OSCE, the OSCE 
Parliamentary Assembly, the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe, the European Council, the European Parliament, the European 
Commission and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.  It is impossible to believe that all 
these people are wrong or biased.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>There are few States that support the current regime in Belarus.  Their support 
could be explained by ideological or geopolitical reasons.  Without such support the 
capacity of the Belarusian regime to continue its human rights violations would be 
drastically limited.  Consequently, one may conclude that, to a large extent, respect for 
human rights in Belarus is a hostage of geopolitical controversies and that in this context, 
without the support of the Russian Federation the efforts of the international community to 
promote respect for human rights in Belarus will enjoy very limited success.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. <b>During 2006, the situation of human rights in Belarus constantly deteriorated.  Over 
the last 1&#189; years, two negative developments worth mentioning were added to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment:  (a) an official State ideology essentially based on the former 
Soviet concepts was imposed to the citizens; (b) the ethnocultural diversity of the society, in 
fact unproblematic, was used as a means of dividing the people and thus diminished their 
capacity to resist State oppression.  Although resistance against the political regime is 
steadily increasing (the intensity of protest rallies is developing very fast for the generally 
very calm character of the Belarusian society), important parts of the population appear 
politically passive and limit themselves to silent opposition.  One could very well say that a 
large number of citizens patiently accept the current economic, social and political realities.  
An important explanation is the social safety net which is provided by the State to the 
obedient citizens.  Since the unreformed economy of the country could not possibly 
produce enough financial resources to fund such a protectionist-paternalist social policy, 
the appropriate international institutions should investigate to determine if the funds thus 
used are the result of illicit international activities. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Government of Belarus did not consider any of the recommendations made by 
the Special Rapporteur (E/CN.4/2006/36, para. 95).  It continued to ignore the 
recommendations made by other special procedures, such as the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention (see E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.3), or by treaty bodies such as the Human 
Rights Committee.  In fact, the political system of Belarus seems to be incompatible with 
the concept of human rights as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the 
international human rights instruments to which Belarus remains a party.  Consequently, 
the Human Rights Council should either call for the democratization of the political regime 
and a change in the political behaviour of the Government or admit that Belarus&#8217; human 
rights record cannot be improved because the human rights violations are consistent with 
the political nature of the regime.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The present report demonstrates that Belarus does not respect its obligations under 
the international human rights instruments to which it has adhered.  Therefore, based on 
Chapter II of the Charter, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his recommendation that the 
Security Council should adopt appropriate measures to ensure the respect by the Republic 
of Belarus of its legal obligations.  The Republic of Belarus has also not complied with 
reporting obligations under the treaties it has ratified.  Thus, outstanding reports were not 
forwarded respectively to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (due in 
1999 and 2004); to the Human Rights Committee (due in 2001); to the Committee against 
Torture (due in 2000 and 2004); to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women (due in September 2006); and to the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
under the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography (due in 2004). 
</b>60. <b>As mentioned in his previous report, the Belarusian political opposition and civil 
society cooperated actively with the Special Rapporteur.  The recommendations addressed 
to the Belarusian civil society and democratic forces were largely followed:  democratic 
forces managed to unite themselves, not only with the objective of participating in the 
elections, but also to develop human rights and a democratic culture in Belarus and  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>empower Belarusian society to defend these values.  They should be encouraged and 
supported.  However, recent developments show that this beneficial unity might be 
weakened by internal disputes and rivalries fuelled by, among other things, the frustrations 
induced by the general lack of progress in the democratization of the country.  The 
international community - and especially the Human Rights Council - should call for the 
unity of democratic forces in Belarus to be maintained for the sake of the effectiveness of 
the efforts dedicated to the promotion and defence of human rights.  While more political 
pluralism could be necessary within the democratic contest for political power, more unity 
is required as long as the actual priority is the defence of basic human rights, civil freedoms 
and democratic principles. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that many of his recommendations addressed to the 
international community were not implemented, even though some positive steps are to be 
acknowledged.  He would like once again to commend the European Union&#8217;s efforts to 
promote human rights in Belarus, especially through the measures set out in the non-paper 
issued by the European Commissioner for External Relations and European 
Neighbourhood Policy on 21 November 2006.  The Parliamentary Assemblies of the 
Council of Europe, OSCE, NATO and the European Parliament remained attentive to the 
situation of human rights in Belarus.  The Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight the 
support given to his mandate by Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia, and the important contribution of international NGOs to the promotion of human 
rights in Belarus.  He considers nonetheless that these efforts are insufficient, and calls 
upon the international community to take concrete action towards the fulfilment of all 
recommendations addressed to it.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Under the given circumstances, the mobilization and the action of the international 
community are of paramount importance for the destiny of Belarus and of its people.  
Therefore, at least the following recommendations addressed to the international 
community are to be reiterated: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Human Rights Council should request the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to immediately establish a group of legal experts to 
investigate whether senior officials of the Government of Belarus are responsible for the 
disappearance and murders of several politicians and journalists and make concrete 
proposals for their prosecution, in order to bring to an end the impunity enjoyed by those 
involved in such crimes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) An international fund for the promotion of human rights in Belarus should 
be established.  Such a fund could finance in a coherent way comprehensive programmes 
for the development of the civil society, for democratic public education and for assistance 
to the human rights defenders who have been politically harassed, oppressed or 
prosecuted; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Human Rights Council should request the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to join the efforts of other international 
organizations to organize an international conference on the situation of human rights in </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Belarus, involving the European Union, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as 
possibly the Government of Belarus and representatives of the civil society.  The 
conference would provide a forum to discuss possible ways to improve the human rights 
situation in Belarus and prepare the ground for an open-ended national round table on the 
situation of human rights in Belarus, with the objective of defining a road map for the 
implementation of human rights reforms, as requested by the United Nations human rights 
special procedures and treaty bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The United Nations Secretary-General should adopt appropriate measures to 
investigate the apparent involvement of senior government officials in international 
organized crime and illegal arms sales, monitor the international financial cash flows of 
Belarus and, if necessary, freeze foreign bank accounts of those involved in illicit 
trafficking, and prosecute criminals; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recommendation of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe that the European Convention on Human Rights be 
amended in such a way as to open it for signature by Belarus even before the country meets 
the standards for becoming a member of the Council.  That would allow Belarusian citizens 
to bring cases of human rights violations committed in their country before the European 
Court of Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that Member States should be aware 
and should not ignore that present trading relations with Belarus do not grant a better 
quality of life to Belarusian citizens, but allow President Lukashenka&#8217;s regime to remain in 
power by systematically violating human rights and threatening international security.  
Trade relations should be conditional upon the immediate adoption of democratic 
initiatives such as the organization of the proposed round table on the situation of human 
rights in Belarus.  While the European Union and the United States of America should 
maintain travel restrictions for Belarusian officials, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that all Member States, especially the Russian Federation and Ukraine, as neighbouring 
States, adopt similar measures.  On the other hand, international travel for ordinary 
Belarusian citizens should be facilitated and a reduction of or even an exemption from visa 
fees would be much welcomed. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus 
gave a sign of international solidarity to Belarusian victims of human rights violations and 
to human rights defenders, further raised international awareness of the situation of 
human rights in Belarus, mobilized international support, and indicated clearly to 
Belarusian stakeholders what measures they are expected to take in order to ensure the 
compliance of Belarus with its international human rights and international law obligations 
as a dignified Member of the United Nations.  Therefore, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
his recommendation to the Human Rights Council to extend the mandate not only in time, 
but also in scope and means.  This is the least the international democratic and civilized 
community can do to keep alive the hope that an improvement of the human rights record 
in Belarus is possible.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. <b>The United Nations bears a particular responsibility in supporting the 
implementation of the recommendations of special procedures.  Member States should 
ensure that the ongoing reform of the human rights system translates that responsibility 
into concrete powers and adequate resources for the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to enable her Office to act to provide stronger and more effective 
support for the special procedures.  Cooperation between regional organizations and  
the United Nations, in particular the Human Rights Council and the Office of the 
High Commissioner, should be enhanced.
