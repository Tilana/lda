<p><b> I. Organization of the workshop 
</b></p>
<p>1. The workshop on the impact of the application of unilateral coercive measures on 
the enjoyment of human rights by the affected populations in the States targeted was held 
on 5 April 2013, in Geneva. It was chaired and moderated by the former Permanent 
Representative of Algeria to the United Nations Office at Geneva, Idriss Jazairy. The 
workshop was composed of the opening session and three subsequent thematic sessions:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Session I: Unilateral coercive measures: concept, legal framework and challenges  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Session II: Impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Session III: The way forward  
</p>
<p>During the thematic sessions, nine panellists made presentations, which were followed by 
an interactive dialogue.  
</p>
<p>2. The objective of the workshop was to provide a platform for the exchange of views 
among States, academic and civil society experts, and human rights mechanisms, on the 
impact of the application of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, 
to allow all stakeholders to discuss new trends, and to brainstorm on the way forward. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening session 
</b></p>
<p>3. In opening the workshop, the Chairperson outlined four methodological issues, and 
invited all participants to be specific in formulating practical proposals for the Human 
Rights Council with regard to the nature and impact of unilateral coercive measures in 
terms of human rights. The first issue concerned the meaning of &#8220;unilateral coercive 
measures&#8221;. The Chairperson asked whether &#8220;unilateral&#8221; only encompassed coercive 
</p>
<p>measures applied by a single State to bring about a desired change in the policy of another 
State, or whether it should include coercive measures by regional groups without Security 
Council clearance or a mandate from the World Trade Organization. He then pointed out 
that the mandate of the workshop referred to &#8220;coercive measures&#8221; rather than &#8220;sanctions&#8221;, 
and asked whether the two terms should be considered synonymous. The Chairperson 
further asked if the participants would accept the connotation of coercive measures as being 
the &#8220;half-way house&#8221; between diplomacy and the use of force or whether they would favour 
a broader definition that included also &#8220;threats of the use of force&#8221;. Lastly, he asked 
whether the workshop should take coercive measures for granted and discuss how to 
minimize their adverse impact on the enjoyment of human rights, or whether it should 
question the legitimacy of such measures. 
</p>
<p>4. On behalf of OHCHR, the Director of the Research and Right to Development 
Division delivered welcoming remarks. She noted that the impact of unilateral coercive 
measures had been addressed on various occasions in relation to the three pillars of the 
work of the United Nations: peace and security, development, and human rights. She 
highlighted a number of United Nations reference documents that could be a helpful basis 
for discussion, including a thematic study on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
the enjoyment of human rights, including recommendations on actions aimed at ending 
such measures 1 conducted by OHCHR in 2012, general comment No. 8 of the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 and a working paper presented to the 
</p>
<p>  
 1  A/HRC/19/33. 
 2  E/C.12/1997/8. </p>


<p>Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on the adverse 
consequences of economic sanctions on the enjoyment of human rights.3 The year 2013 
marked the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
which called upon States:  
</p>
<p>to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and 
the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among 
States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights instruments, in 
particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and 
well-being, including food and medical care, housing and the necessary social 
services.  
</p>
<p>In conclusion, she stated that the drafters of the Vienna Declaration had put people and 
their rights at the centre, an approach OHCHR continued to advocate. When addressing the 
impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, we must focus on 
people, in particular vulnerable groups and individuals whose rights were most likely to be 
affected. 
</p>
<p>5. In his keynote speech, the President of the Constitutional Court of Belgium, Mr. 
Bossuyt, listed four features about sanctions that had been highlighted in the above-
mentioned working paper of the Subcommission that he had prepared: sanctions should 
always be limited in time; they affected most seriously innocent populations, especially the 
most vulnerable; they aggravated imbalances in income distribution; and they often gave 
rise to illegal and unethical business practices. He then provided a brief classification of 
sanctions, including trade, financial, travel, military, diplomatic and cultural sanctions, and 
proposed criteria to evaluate them: whether the sanctions concerned were imposed for valid 
reasons and within a reasonable time frame; whether they targeted the proper parties, goods 
or objects rather than innocent civilians; and if the sanctions were effective and free from 
&#8220;protest arising from violations of the principles of humanity and the dictates of the public 
conscience&#8221;.4 The most important criterion in evaluating sanctions was their legitimacy; it 
could hardly be disputed that sanctions imposed by the Security Council, unlike sanctions 
imposed unilaterally, were legitimate. He stressed that the effectiveness of sanctions should 
be periodically assessed, which would in turn affect their legitimacy.  
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Bossuyt stated that preference should be given to &#8220;smart sanctions&#8221; so that 
adverse consequences for the civilian population could be avoided. Such sanctions were 
conceived to affect directly political leaders by targeting their personal foreign assets and 
access to foreign financial markets, and subjecting them to travel restrictions. He then cited 
the three case studies examined in his working paper, which concerned Burundi, Cuba and 
Iraq. In conclusion, the effects of sanctions had to be evaluated at regular intervals (no more 
than one year at the maximum) and their impact on the enjoyment of human rights of the 
population should be taken prominently into account. If the desired results could not be 
attained within a reasonable time, the measures should be suspended; otherwise, the 
sanctions might lose legitimacy and become counterproductive. 
</p>
<p>7. Subsequently, the Chairperson opened the floor for general statements. 
Representatives of Belarus, Cuba, Iran (Islamic Republic of) (on behalf of the Non-Aligned 
Movement), Iraq, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Zimbabwe took the floor. 
Several delegations spoke of the impact of sanctions and unilateral coercive measures on 
their countries and how the human rights of the populations, such as the right to work, the 
</p>

 4 E/CN.4/Sub.2/2000/33, p. 12.  </p>


<p>right to health, the right to food, freedom of movement and the right to development, had 
been affected. A number of speakers stated that unilateral coercive measures constituted 
violations of the Charter of the United Nations and the multilateral trading system, and 
requested that these measures to be revoked immediately. Some delegations stated that 
unilateral coercive measures constituted human rights violations, including of civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, as well as of the right to development. 
Several speakers highlighted the humanitarian, economic and development impact of 
sanctions, adding that sanctions on the transfer of funds had prevented the importation of 
food and medicine, as well as construction and other materials needed for the development 
of the countries targeted.  
</p>
<p>8. Responding to questions, the Director of the Research and Right to Development 
Division cited the OHCHR thematic study on the subject, in which the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights had noted that even carefully targeted sanctions imposed to end gross 
human rights violations, as part of a wider diplomatic effort and preferably in a multilateral 
framework, had to be subject to stringent conditions. According to the High Commissioner, 
they had to be imposed no longer than necessary, be proportional and be subject to 
appropriate human rights safeguards, including human rights impact assessments and 
monitoring conducted by independent experts.5 The Director also referred to the visit made 
in 2012 by the High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, where she had spoken about the impact 
of sanctions on people. Mr. Bossuyt concurred and reiterated the importance for sanctions 
to be limited in duration and evaluated periodically. In closing the opening session, the 
Chairperson noted the converging views on the need to reform the current system of 
sanctions and unilateral coercive measures to make it more sensitive to human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Session I: Unilateral coercive measures: concept, legal 
framework and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>9. The panellists of session I included the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, Ariranga Pillay; Alena Douhan, Associate Professor of the 
Belarusian State University; and Kees Smit-Sibinga, Senior Policy Officer of the Security 
Policy and Sanctions Division of the European External Action Service.  
</p>
<p>10. The Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights listed a 
number of examples of unilateral coercive measures, such as trade sanctions, embargoes, 
boycotts and the interruption of financial flows, stating that some of these measures 
imposed by States had extraterritorial effects, as they were extended to third-party States. 
He stated that unilateral coercive measures were applied often without safeguards to protect 
human rights, causing deprivations that not only had an adverse impact on human rights 
and the right to development, but also disproportionately affected the poor and the most 
vulnerable. Citing general comment No. 8 of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, he added said that human rights had to be taken fully into account when 
designing an appropriate sanctions regime. When an external party took upon itself even 
partial responsibility for the situation within a country, it also unavoidably assumed a 
responsibility to do everything within its power to protect the economic, social and cultural 
rights of the affected population.  
</p>
<p>11. Ms. Douhan stated that there was no universal definition of &#8220;unilateral coercive 
measures&#8221; in international law; the term was not defined in any treaty and it did not appear 
</p>
<p>in the Charter. Citing the OHCHR thematic study, she noted four main characteristics of 
</p>
<p>  
 5 A/HRC/19/33, para. 38. </p>


<p>unilateral coercive measures: (a) those applied by States; (b) those that comprised primarily 
(but not exclusively) economic measures; (c) those applied to States or individuals who 
were able to decide on the policy of the State; and (d) those aimed to change a policy of a 
target State. These elements, however, might be used also to define normal and legal 
interactions between States. Various United Nations documents suggested that most States 
and United Nations bodies agreed on the illegality of unilateral coercive measures, even 
though &#8220;means of pressure or influence&#8221; were often still used. In order to minimize their 
negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights, both formal and legal criteria had to be 
used when defining unilateral coercive measures. Ms. Douhan proposed a definition of 
unilateral coercive measures as  
</p>
<p>measures applied by States, groups of States or regional organizations without or 
beyond authorization of the Security Council [applied] to States, individuals or 
entities in order to change a policy or behaviour of directly or indirectly targeted 
States, if these measures cannot undoubtedly be qualified as not violating any 
international obligation of the applying state or organization, or its wrongfulness is 
not excluded under general international law.  
</p>
<p>In this regard, international human rights law constituted an important qualifying criterion 
in deciding the legality of these measures. She proposed the establishment of an 
independent body to consider the issue in depth from the perspectives of human rights, 
security and the rule of law, and to decide whether certain measures would constitute 
unilateral coercive measures, their legality, and to review them periodically. 
</p>
<p>12. Mr. Smit-Sibinga stated that, for the European Union, sanctions were essentially a 
foreign policy instrument that concerned relations between States. While the European 
Union did therefore not consider the Human Rights Council the appropriate forum to 
address the issue, it agreed that sanctions should always be applied in accordance with 
international law and human rights. The European Union imposed &#8220;restrictive measures&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>implement United Nations sanctions or on an &#8220;autonomous&#8221; basis, which was referred to as 
&#8220;unilateral&#8221; in the workshop, with an objective to bring about a change in policy or activity 
</p>
<p>by the country in question, or the persons or entities targeted. Such restrictive measures had 
to be proportionate to their objectives, not have an economic motivation, and be drafted in 
accordance with article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union, and thus with respect for 
fundamental rights and freedoms, as guaranteed in, inter alia, the European Convention on 
Human Rights, including due process and the right to an effective remedy. He then 
provided some practical examples, such as travel bans, asset freezes and financial and trade 
restrictions, stressing the preventive nature of these measures and the inclusion of standard 
exemptions in order to guarantee human rights and basic needs. The sanctions should be 
targeted and minimize any unintended impact on the population. Autonomous sanctions 
had to be reviewed at least every year, and could be reviewed at any other time. In 
conclusion, it was reiterated that the sanctions applied by the European Union always 
included clearly defined safeguards in order to limit any unintended effects and to ensure 
that human rights obligations were respected. 
</p>
<p>13. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, representatives of Belarus, Cuba, Ecuador, 
Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and the 
International Association of Schools of Social Work made interventions. Several speakers 
stressed that unilateral coercive measures were illegal, unjustified and ineffective, and that 
they impeded the right to self-determination, jeopardized international peace and security, 
hindered development and undermined the human rights of ordinary people. Some speakers 
proposed that the Human Rights Council establish a special procedure to monitor the 
impact on human rights of unilateral coercive measures. Economic, social and cultural 
rights and the rights of indigenous peoples were raised. Some delegations stated that 
unilateral coercive measures with extraterritorial effects violated the sovereignty of States, </p>


<p>citing the over 50-year-long sanctions imposed by the United States of America on Cuba as 
an example.  
</p>
<p>14. Responding to questions, the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights stated that, while the rights of indigenous peoples were often addressed 
by the Committee, he failed to see the relevance of unilateral coercive measures in relation 
to the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples. Mr. Smit-Sibinga reiterated that the 
European Union considered sanctions a legitimate part of its foreign policy carried out in 
accordance with international law, as well as with its human rights and humanitarian 
obligations. Ms. Douhan reiterated the need to define the nature of sanctions.  
</p>
<p>15. Summing up session I, the Chairperson highlighted two prevailing views. Countries 
that had been affected by sanctions or unilateral coercive measures considered these 
measures illegal and ineffective and stressed the need to review the system at the 
international level in an independent manner. Countries that used these measures 
considered them justified as part of their foreign policy. It was important to build bridges 
and find a solution to make unilateral coercive measures less harsh on human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Session II: Impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. The panellists of session II included Benedict Chigara, Professor of Law at Brunel 
University; Anuradha Chenoy, Professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University; and Salvador 
Tanajero, Legal Adviser of the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations Office 
at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>17. Mr. Chigara addressed the question of whether States had the right to exercise 
extraterritorial jurisdiction to enforce human rights law and, if so, what the recognized 
criteria and procedures were for exercising this right in particular. He surveyed 
jurisprudence on cardinal principles governing inter-State relations, including the Lotus 
case, Permanent Court of International Justice (1927); the Island of Palmas case, Permanent 
Court of Arbitration (1928); the Corfu Channel case, International Court of Justice (1949); 
the Nicaragua case, International Court of Justice (1986); and Germany v Italy, 
International Court of Justice (2012). He concluded that unilateral coercive measures were 
illegal under current international law and that their use was a digression from the rule of 
law. Arguing that any State using unilateral coercive measures was in effect challenging the 
rule of law system under the Charter of the United Nations, he proposed the establishment 
of a world court of human rights to disarm the reason often cited by unilateralists for 
instituting coercive measures. Only after a positive finding of the proposed world court of 
human rights, and upon stringent conditions, would third States be allowed to impose 
coercive measures against the State found to be violating its human rights obligations under 
international law.  
</p>
<p>18. Ms. Chenoy observed that the current discourse on unilateral coercive measures was 
dominated by ideological and geopolitical considerations, and excluded the human rights of 
people on the ground, adding that both the users and the receivers of unilateral coercive 
measures were &#8220;cynical&#8221; about human rights. Citing examples in Iraq, Myanmar and Cuba, 
she noted that sanctions, whether smart or not, often created a regime of structural violence, 
and their impact was disproportionately borne by women and children. Sanctions often did 
not weaken the targeted regimes; rather, they strengthened the regimes, weakened the 
people and led to increased radicalization and violence against women. Unilateral coercive 
measures had deep and long-term negative social-psychological effects, and there was little 
morality for punishing a population and the most vulnerable such as women, children, 
human rights defenders and minorities. Ms. Chenoy stressed the importance of studies on </p>


<p>post-unilateral coercive measures to assess the situation on the ground and their continuing 
impact of the measures after they were lifted. She proposed that the Human Rights Council 
set up an expert committee with the support of the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and relevant bodies to study and 
report on the impact on gender and human rights of unilateral coercive measures. States that 
had used these measures should apologize for the indescribable misery caused, while the 
international women and human rights movements that had resulted in Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security should now be encouraged to 
push for a Council resolution against unilateral coercive measures. 
</p>
<p>19. Mr. Tanajero stated that he would discuss unilateral coercive measures from the 
perspective of the Americas and their impact on human rights. The Inter-American 
Democratic Charter prohibited States from interfering with each other. Mexico had tried to 
eliminate such measures and to promote fair trade. In 1996, Mexico requested an opinion 
on the extraterritorial application of the Helms-Burton Act of the United States of America, 
whether it was compatible with international law and what its impact was on Cuba and 
other countries in the Americas. He cited the conclusions of the Inter-American Judicial 
Committee, which stated that all States were subject to international law in their relations 
among themselves; all States were free to exercise their jurisdiction, but in exercising that 
right they had to respect the boundaries of international law; if this exercise was not in 
conformity with international law, they would be responsible. On the impact of unilateral 
coercive measures on human rights, he added that the indiscriminate nature of these 
measures was one of their greatest dangers, because the people they were supposed to 
protect were often those most affected. There was a need to monitor specific human rights 
violations resulting from unilateral coercive measures. The Human Rights Council had 
enough mechanisms at its disposal. Reports should be presented on such violations so that 
these human rights mechanisms could address them accordingly. 
</p>
<p>20. Speakers during the ensuing interactive dialogue included the representatives of 
Belarus, Cuba, Iran (Islamic Republic of) (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), Iraq, 
Malaysia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Swaziland and the Union of Arab Jurists. Some 
speakers raised issues relating to the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the transfer 
of technology, access to the Internet, freedom of expression, the right to life and the 
measures imposed on the Occupied Palestinian Territory by Israel. Several delegations 
supported the creation of a monitoring body to conduct an independent assessment of 
unilateral coercive measures and to ensure accountability, while some did not agree with 
the proposal to create a world court of human rights. According to some speakers, a set of 
principles or a legal framework that determined the human rights aspects of unilateral 
coercive measures could serve as a preventive instrument for the international community 
to consider when States were deciding to impose coercive measures unilaterally. Any 
further delay in finding a solution would only cause more suffering.  
</p>
<p>21. Responding to a question about the impact of unilateral measures on freedom of 
expression, Mr. Tanajero stated that the right to freedom of expression existed both online 
and offline, the only legal limitations being those established in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. Ms. Chenoy stated that, even as a receiver of unilateral 
coercive measures, Cuba had achieved three Millennium Development Goals through social 
spending, and that this methodology could be followed by other countries. Mr. Chigara 
stressed that unilateral coercive measures were illegal under current international law and 
warned that States were &#8220;sleepwalking&#8221; into the making of customary international law 
</p>
<p>perpetuated by &#8220;persistent objectors&#8221; who insisted on their right to use these measures to 
ensure human rights.  
</p>
<p>22. The Chairperson summed up the discussion and noted that agreement might never 
be reached on the desirability of unilateral coercive measures, although it was agreed that </p>


<p>an independent assessment was needed. In this regard, the workshop could contribute by 
identifying the elements that would enable the international community to understand the 
impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Session III: The way forward 
</b></p>
<p>23. The panellists of session III included the Permanent Representative of Uruguay to 
the United Nations Office at Geneva and former President of the Human Rights Council, 
Laura Dupuy Lasserre; former Special Rapporteur on the right to food and Professor at the 
University of Geneva, Jean Ziegler; and the Programme Director of Centre Europe-Tiers 
Monde, Melik &#214;zden. 
</p>
<p>24. Ms. Dupuy Lasserre noted that there were a number of situations involving unlawful 
unilateral coercive measures that had come before the Human Rights Council in different 
ways, such as the blockade of Gaza, the presence of the United States base in Guantanamo, 
the use of unlawful unilateral means against non-State actors in the fight against terrorism, 
the impasse in the Security Council and the supply of weapons by various States to various 
parties in the internal armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and the threat of use of 
force by nuclear weapons by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Economic 
measures taken as countermeasures or retaliation to an international unlawful act by a State 
should be assessed by an independent body to distinguish whether such measures were 
coercive or legitimate under international law, especially in view of the principle of non-
intervention. There were interesting examples in regional organizations where efforts were 
made to promote human rights, the rule of law and democracy, without breaching 
international law. The Organization of American States offered different ways of collective 
action in addressing problems in countries and sought to avoid the use of unilateral coercive 
measures. She highlighted the inter-American human rights system, and other regional 
peer-review mechanisms to combat corruption or the drugs problem, as well as various 
arbitration courts (subregional or international) in dealing with bilateral disputes. Ms. 
Dupuy Lasserre stressed the need to refrain from unlawful measures and to resort to 
dialogue and negotiation, as well as a cooperative approach at the bilateral, regional and 
multilateral levels.  
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Ziegler stated that the debate at hand had given rise to different opinions and 
that 12 States had voted against the resolution mandating the present workshop. Referring 
to a report on his visit to Cuba in 2007 as Special Rapporteur on the right to food, he added 
that the right to food in the country was guaranteed in spite of a complex regime of 
unilateral coercive measures, which had three dimensions: food and medical embargoes; 
regime change; and extraterritoriality. He then referred to the situation of the right to food 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and made several suggestions to address the impact 
of unilateral coercive measures on human rights. Compensation should be given to the 
families who had suffered because of unilateral embargoes and sanctions. Sanctions should 
be limited in duration (such as six months); regime change should never be an objective of 
unilateral coercive measures; when massively applied, smart sanctions were not 
substantively different from unilateral coercive measures. A special procedure should be 
created to report to the Human Rights Council at all sessions on the human rights 
consequences of unilateral coercive measures, and there should be a normative framework 
for these measures. 
</p>
<p>26. Mr. &#214;zden stated that unilateral coercive measures infringed international law, 
including international humanitarian law and international human rights law. The General 
Assembly could adopt a declaration condemning unilateral coercive measures and turn to 
the International Court of Justice for advisory opinions on specific cases. Individuals 
affected by these measures could seek redress before such relevant treaty bodies as the </p>


<p>Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In particular, those 
affected could bring cases under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, after it came into force in May 2013. Mr. &#214;zden 
agreed that the Human Rights Council should create a specific mechanism on the impact of 
unilateral coercive measures, because the existing mechanisms had not given the necessary 
attention to this important matter. 
</p>
<p>27. During the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representatives of Algeria, Belarus, 
Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia, the Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic took the floor. A number 
of proposals were made as a follow-up mechanism to address the issue of unilateral 
coercive measures and their impact on the enjoyment of human rights. The human rights 
mainstreaming panel of the Human Rights Council should deal with the impact of unilateral 
coercive measures. The Advisory Committee of the Council should be tasked to develop a 
code of conduct for respecting the human rights of people affected by sanctions. OHCHR 
should be given a stronger role in this area. Lastly, the qualitative and quantitative 
magnitude of the negative impact on human rights of these measures had to be registered in 
order to promote accountability. 
</p>
<p>28. Responding to questions and comments, Mr. Ziegler stated that there had to be an 
end to impunity, and that the right of the victims to reparation must be guaranteed. Mr. 
&#214;zden added that the goal was to end unilateral coercive measures, and that States could 
decide how to do so.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>In summing up the discussion held during the workshop, the Chairperson 
concluded that unilateral coercive measures were regarded by States or a group of 
</b></p>
<p><b>States that resorted to them as an instrument of their foreign policy. Those affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>such measures considered them to be infringements on their sovereign rights, and on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the principles of non-discrimination and non-interference in their internal affairs. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Whether in terms of legitimacy or effectiveness, many speakers recognized that 
</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures had been tools to achieve their proclaimed objective of 
</b></p>
<p><b>forcing the States targeted to change their policies. Where such policies were 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenged on the grounds of violations of human rights, unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>might even be self-defeating if they themselves denied the enjoyment of such human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights as the rights to food, to health and to education. Thus, some participants 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintained, instead of being assisted in upholding their rights, innocent civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b>might be doubly victimized. 
</b></p>
<p>30.<b> Furthermore, it was suggested that, if States resorted unilaterally to coercive 
measures, other States might follow suit and thus undermine the rule-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>international system. It was stressed that the Charter of the United Nations offered, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including under Chapter VII, the framework for applying such measures within a 
</b></p>
<p><b>rule-based system. Measures outside this framework and with an impact on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of human rights required, in the opinion of the speakers, an assessment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their legitimacy and effectiveness. Many speakers emphasized that States or a group 
</b></p>
<p><b>of States resorting to such measures were accountable for their impact on human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights as were those States whose internal policies were challenged on this basis. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on human rights of extraterritorial extension of domestic policies via third 
</b></p>
<p><b>States or multilateral institutions was also mentioned as a cause of concern to some. 
</b></p>
<p><b>There was broad-based recognition of the need for an independent assessment of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on human rights of unilateral coercive measures, and for jurisdictions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>uphold human rights and accountability in this context. </b></p>


<p>31.<b> The Chairperson summed up a menu of options discussed during the 
workshop, to be considered by the Human Rights Council in accordance with political 
</b></p>
<p><b>feasibility and financial possibility. The options proposed during the workshop 
</b></p>
<p><b>included devoting an annual human rights mainstreaming panel discussion of the 
</b></p>
<p>Human Rights Council to the issue of &#8220;unilateral coercive measures and human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221;; drawing up guidelines to prevent, minim<b>ize and redress the adverse impact of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unilateral coercive measures on human rights; tasking the Advisory Committee with 
</b></p>
<p><b>an overall review of independent mechanisms to assess unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to promote accountability; strengthening the capacity of OHCHR in this field; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and setting up a working group, a special procedure or mandating an existing special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure to deal with this thematic issue. </b></p>
