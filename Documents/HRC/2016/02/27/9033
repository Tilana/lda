<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent held its eighth session 
from 12 to 16 January 2009 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>2. The Coordinator for the Durban Review Conference, Mr. Ibrahim Salama, opened the 
session. The Working Group elected Joe Frans as its Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report reflects the general course of the debate.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the eighth session, the Working Group held eight public meetings and one private 
meeting. It was attended by the following members: Joe Frans, Monorama Biswas, 
Mirjana Najcevska, Ralston Nettleford, and Maya Sahli; 54 Member States and 1 non-Member 
State; 21 non-governmental organizations; 4 intergovernmental organizations; 1 national human 
rights institution, 1 observer; 1 academic and 3 invited panellists.<b>1 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF DELIBERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Coordinator for the Durban Review Conference, Mr. Salama, delivered the opening 
address. He welcomed the four new members of the Working Group: Monorama Biswas 
(Bangladesh), Mirjana Najcevska (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), 
Ralston Nettleford (Jamaica) and Maya Sahli (Algeria). The Coordinator paid tribute to the 
work of the former members of the Working Group and in particular the Chairman 
Ambassador Peter Lesa Kasanda. The contributions that panellists will make to this session 
of the Working Group in the consideration of various thematic issues were also noted.  
</p>
<p>6. The importance of the Working Group in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance was emphasized. The Coordinator encouraged Member 
States to accept invitations for country visits by the experts. It was noted that the active 
participation of victims is essential for the work of the experts.  
</p>
<p>7. The Coordinator congratulated the experts of the Working Group for their decision to 
address the situation of children of African descent during its eighth session as children are 
extremely vulnerable to racial discrimination. Quality education was underlined as an important 
instrument for combating prejudices and discrimination. It was also noted that special measures 
have to be adopted to ensure equal opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups, in 
particular people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>8. The President of the Human Rights Council, Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi addressed the 
Working Group. He also congratulated the new members of the Working Group and paid tribute 
to the work of the former members. The President pointed out that human rights are better 
                                                 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>understood, including the right to development, thanks to the work of human rights bodies. 
However, much more needs to be done in order to ensure that human rights are enjoyed by 
everybody. It was mentioned that nowadays challenges are posed, inter alia, by globalization, 
security threats and climate change. Poverty and disease undermine the full enjoyment of human 
rights in particular in developing countries. The need for improved synergy between 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, including special procedures mandate holders, was 
highlighted.  
</p>
<p>9. Following the statement of the President of the Human Rights Council, the Coordinator for 
the Durban Review Conference invited the members of the Working Group to present 
nominations for a Chairperson. Mr. Joe Frans was elected as Chairperson. 
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Frans thanked the other members for electing him. He noted that access to education, 
healthcare services, electricity and potable water and political participation are among the many 
areas where people of African descent experience unequal treatment. The Chairperson 
encouraged United Nations bodies to allocate more resources to developing countries.  
</p>
<p>11. The Chairperson recalled the valuable contribution of the Working Group to the 
Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference. It was mentioned that the present 
session of the Working Group is the right time to plan for future activities as there are four new 
members. He noted that the Working Group needs to adopt a workplan for the forthcoming three 
years as conditions have changed since the adoption of the last workplan, including the renewal 
and update of the mandate of the Working Group as stipulated in Human Rights Council 
resolution 9/14. The Chairperson pointed out that country visits are essential for the work of the 
experts as they are valuable occasions to interact with victims.  
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the programmed discussion on the situation of children of African descent, 
Mr. Frans highlighted that they are greatly affected by discriminatory practices. Concerted 
efforts by all stakeholders are required in order to reduce the vulnerability of these children.  
</p>
<p>13. Following the statement of the Chairperson, the agenda and programme of work were 
adopted.  
</p>
<p><b>Item 5: Review and discussion of the work of previous sessions of the 
Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent 
</b></p>
<p>14. Mr. Frans introduced agenda item 5 by inviting the members of the Working Group to 
make brief presentations on certain particularly important themes that have been addressed in 
previous sessions of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>15. Ms. Najcevska said that it was important that the Working Group adopt a practical 
approach. State institutions can have a direct impact on the situation of people of African descent 
and institutional changes can be perceived as positive changes. She proposed that the Working 
Group raise awareness on the issue of multiple forms of discrimination and multiple 
vulnerability. It was noted that enhanced cooperation with non governmental organizations 
(NGO) and special procedures is needed. The lack of disaggregated data was also identified as 
an important issue to be addressed in the future.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. Ms. Biswas mentioned that it is not easy to find practical solutions. However the Working 
Group can assist in the collection of updated information and data on various issues.  
</p>
<p>17. Ms. Sahli pointed out that the Working Group should also address new forms of racism, to 
identify new themes. Particular attention needs to be paid to the vulnerability of women and 
children of African descent. It was mentioned that a particular problem is the implementation of 
the previous recommendations of the Working Group. Measures by governments play a vital 
role, therefore the Working Group needs to sensitize them. It can be encouraging to highlight 
positive measures adopted by States.  
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Nettleford noted that it is important to come up with the right language and approach 
in the recommendations and this may also help the Durban Review process. With regard to 
children of African descent, he highlighted that the twenty-first century needs a new approach to 
protecting children.  
</p>
<p>19. There was a general agreement that there is a need for mechanisms for implementation and 
monitoring of implementation of the recommendations of Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>Cultural heritage of people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>20. Mr. Nettleford, member of the Working Group on People of African Descent, spoke about 
the cultural heritage of people of African descent. Mr. Nettleford began by expressing his 
preference to use the term people of African ancestry rather than people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>21. In his presentation Mr. Nettleford expressed the need to make the promotion and 
maintenance of the culture of People of African ancestry far more central to the issue of racial 
discrimination and racism, since it is of tremendous importance after the tragic experience of 
slavery and colonization. Cultural heritage is far more fundamental because it is a source of 
energy and of power. It is people&#8217;s capability to make definitions about themselves, on their own 
terms, and to proceed to positive action, which allows them to have a sense of place and purpose. 
Culture here becomes a means of liberation and emancipation. In this sense, artistic 
manifestations are of the greatest importance for human development along with other cultural 
indices such as language, religion and ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Nettleford recommended that any action taken should start at the micro level. He gave 
as examples changes urgently needed for the inclusion of cultural studies in the curricula of the 
educational system, one&#8217;s heritage being among them. 
</p>
<p>23. People of African Descent demand recognition, the kind of respect and understanding to be 
able to produce out of their imagination and intellect the tools which are fundamental for human 
development and intrinsic in the human condition. The expert mentioned that the products of the 
exercise of the creative imagination are points of power. The problem with the acceptance of 
such products is that they are too often taken as a product merely for entertainment, rather than 
seen as profound elements of human living. The expert considered that sportsmen for example, 
gain recognition because they are able to offer immediate short-term appeal for the appetite of 
millions of people. This type of production still reflects the conventional performance offered by 
the servant for the appetite of the master.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. The expert emphasized the importance of recognition, respect and understanding of the 
products of the creative imagination of people of African ancestry. Education here deserves 
special attention. We should however ask ourselves what kind of education is being offered. It 
should be an education which would seek not simply to allow us to enter into the mainstream but 
rather to have artistic creations that allow us to determine the mainstream. This also applies to 
indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups, who are historically victims of discrimination 
and who have been relegated to a zone of silence by the dominant controlling group. But the 
victims of racism have become very noisy in all sorts of ways in that zone of silence. In this 
regard, Bollywood, like the performance arts of people of African ancestry in the Americas, is in 
fact producing things of universal importance as products of their collective imagination.  
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Nettleford further stressed that States have a responsibility to facilitate the creative 
endeavours of their citizens and have the obligation to adopt and implement active policies that 
safeguard artistic creations. Of equal importance is the recognition of the tremendous cultural 
contribution made by indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas. He said 
that in any case we have all come to learn that all great achievements by any one people become 
the stock and capital of all peoples. Paradoxically, despite the achievements of people of African 
ancestry their creative manifestations are not usually regarded as achievements of quality. 
</p>
<p>26. Mr. Frans opened the floor to debate on the theme of cultural heritage. Several comments 
were made by participants highlighting the need to recognize the contribution of People of 
African descent had made to the progress of civilization, which should be considered as part of 
the common heritage of humanity. Other participants mentioned that people of African descent 
have the right to transmit to future generations their own histories written by themselves. 
</p>
<p>27. An issue was raised concerning the pervasive consequences of the colonization of the 
mind, which is a social construction based on a shared ignorance that perceives others as 
uncivilized. A sense of belonging and pride are important in combating social exclusion and 
racism and in the process of the emancipation of the mind. 
</p>
<p>28. A further comment was made regarding the important role the media plays in shaping 
public perception. In many cases the media represents certain cultures as inferior and 
misrepresents the images of people of African descent and other minorities. Another participant 
said that people of African descent have the right to establish their own media and to have access 
to all forms of media without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>29. Other commentators stressed that, people of African descent should have the right to 
establish and control their educational systems, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods 
of teaching and learning. 
</p>
<p><b>Administration of justice 
</b>30. Ms. Najcevska, expert of the Working Group, summarized former recommendations of the 
mechanism on the issue of administration of justice. She noted that people of African descent are 
detained more frequently, they are unevenly represented in law enforcement institutions, they are 
more often victims of violence by police officers, they are more vulnerable due to their poverty 
and young people of African descent are even more susceptible. Ms. Najcevska highlighted the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>need for disaggregated data as an important tool for combating racial discrimination in all 
pertinent areas. She noted that it is important to create the previously proposed racial equality 
index. An increased number of special measures is also needed in order to ensure equal 
representation of all groups in the field of law enforcement. Ms. Najcevska pointed out that it is 
essential to identify mechanisms for implementation of the recommendations of the Working 
Group and respective monitoring. In this regard, certain national bodies can perform these 
functions. 
</p>
<p>31. The Chairperson of the Working Group opened the floor to debate on the theme of 
administration of justice. 
</p><p>32. With regard to the issue of the creation of a racial equality index, an observer mentioned 
that there is an index that is developed in the area of health and that the World Health 
Organization (WHO) issues reports that might be useful in this context. It was noted that such an 
index should be developed at an international level in order to avoid technical or methodological 
variations from one country to another. A permanent international body should be in charge of 
monitoring the implementation of such an index and assisting Member States to collect 
information. The Chairman of the Working Group noted that the development of the racial 
equality index is linked to the issue of good practices.  
</p>
<p>33. The need for specific training of lawyers and judges of African descent was identified as 
important due to the fact that they are not equally represented in the law enforcement systems.  
</p>
<p><b>Racism and health 
</b></p>
<p>34. Ms. Biswas, expert of the Working Group, presented a summary of former 
recommendations of the Working Group on the issue of health of people of African Descent. She 
noted that in many developed countries people of African descent experience inferior health in 
comparison to other population groups. Their health is substantially affected by poverty, an 
inability to have proper medical insurance, a high rate of unemployment, lower levels of 
education and a lack of access to accurate information. Systematically collected and 
disaggregated data is needed in order to improve the health of people of African descent. 
Deteriorating socio-economic conditions need to be reversed, accurate information to be widely 
provided and special measures to be implemented in order to increase access to higher education 
and also to healthcare services.  
</p>
<p>35. The Chairperson of the Working Group opened the floor to debate on the theme of racism 
and health.  
</p>
<p>36. An observer noted that health reflects the extent of substantive equality. People of African 
descent can enjoy better health and can adopt healthier habits when socio-economic determinants 
of health are improved by governments.  
</p>
<p>37. A comment was made regarding the presence of institutionalized racism in some 
developed countries. It was noted that when certain epidemics and health problems affect people 
of African descent and/or Hispanic population groups, they do not enjoy the same access to 
healthcare services and information as other groups.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. A delegate pointed out that health should be looked at in its entirety and governments need 
to address the root causes of health problems such as education, marginalization and access to 
schools and healthcare services. 
</p>
<p>39. A comment was made regarding linkages between crops, traditional healing and the health 
of some population groups. Forced displacement, disruption of social networks, violence and the 
imposition of crops for cultivation deplete resources and deteriorate people&#8217;s health. Respect for 
culture and involvement of local communities in development projects need to be taken into 
consideration.  
</p>
<p><b>Racism and employment 
</b></p>
<p>40. Ms. Sahli, expert of the Working Group, made a presentation on the issue of employment 
of women of African descent. She noted that women are victims of multiple forms of 
discrimination on the grounds of their descent, gender and level of education. They are also more 
marginalized in comparison to men and subject to harmful religious and cultural practices. Girls 
are less often sent to school and are the first ones to be withdrawn. Literacy programmes for 
women and girls of African descent are vital for their advancement. Women have to be accepted 
on an equal footing with men in the labor market and receive equal remuneration. Positive 
measures have to be adopted in order to achieve gender equality. Literacy campaigns and equal 
working opportunities are needed.  
</p>
<p>41. The Chairperson of the Working Group opened the floor to debate on the theme of 
employment of people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>42. A comment was made regarding the vulnerability and abuse of female domestic workers 
and the urgency to address their situation. 
</p>
<p>43. An observer noted that a more nuanced approach can be more efficient in some countries 
as there are cases when men of African descent suffer from a higher unemployment rate in 
comparison to women. In this regard, a study is needed on how the issue of gender works 
differently for people of African descent in the developed countries.  
</p>
<p>44. Another observer mentioned that a constructive approach focusing on achievements of 
women might also have a positive impact, increasing motivation and commitment.  
</p>
<p>45. A comment was made regarding the need for political will to promote dialogue between 
different population groups and institutions. In multiethnic societies governments have to be 
aware of the needs of the entire population.  
</p>
<p>46. A comment was made regarding the linkages between administration of justice and 
employment of people of African descent. It was noted that the disproportionate level of 
incarceration of young men of African descent has a detrimental impact on their career 
perspectives.  
</p>
<p>47. There was also a comment that in addition to the gendered approach to employment, the 
residence of the targeted groups should be also taken into considerations as employment 
opportunities for men and women vary between urban and rural areas.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>48. Ms. Sahli, expert of the Working Group, pointed out that it can be useful to collect 
information on cases of employment exclusion regarding men and women, to encourage States 
to adopt special measures for women of African descent and to enhance partnerships among 
stakeholders. She noted that recommendations in this area have to be specific and to set 
priorities.  
</p>
<p>49. Ms. Najcevska, expert of the Working Group highlighted the need for education of law 
enforcement officials in order to reduce instances of racial profiling. The education of people of 
African descent also has to be enhanced, empowering them and reducing their vulnerability to 
become victims of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>50. Ms. Biswas, expert of the Working Group, concluded that women need to be more actively 
involved in the area of health. Educational opportunities can be increased for women through the 
provision of scholarships. Awareness-raising on women&#8217;s health issues is also essential.  
</p>
<p><b>Item 6:  Programme of work for future sessions 
</b></p>
<p>51. During the deliberations on the future work of the Working Group, several proposals were 
made. It was suggested to reschedule the sessions of the Working Group so that they can be held 
at a later time in the year. This would enable more stakeholders to attend the sessions and 
interact with the experts. It was also suggested that financial support is needed in order to 
increase participation of NGOs in the sessions of the Working Group, in particular those from 
the developing countries.  
</p>
<p>52. It was proposed that a conference on the transatlantic slave trade be organized under the 
auspices of the Working Group, addressing the impact of the phenomenon on contemporary 
practices of racial discrimination. Education on slavery and the slave trade is vital. More 
research and education efforts are needed and textbooks and other educational materials have to 
be revised accordingly.  
</p>
<p>53. It was suggested that the Working Group holds a session, where more days are dedicated to 
the theme of children and youth of African descent. Another proposal was made regarding a 
session of the Working Group on poverty due to its vital importance and cross-cutting nature. A 
suggestion was made to invite distinguished experts in the field of collecting and managing 
disaggregated data to participate in a session of the Working Group in order to assist the experts 
in addressing this issue. 
</p>
<p>54. It was proposed that the Working Group addresses more extensively the issue of criminal 
justice systems. Victims of hate crimes were also identified as a theme meriting attention by the 
Working Group. It was recommended that the Working Group focuses on identification of lesson 
learnt throughout its work.  
</p>
<p>55. It was also said that dialogue needs to be enhanced between the Working Group and 
stakeholders operating in the area of development. Information on their activities as they relate to 
racism against people of African descent is needed. It was agreed that the recommendations of 
the Working Group have to be practically oriented. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. The need for the Working Group to hold public meetings with victims, Member-States, 
NGOs and other stakeholders was highlighted by several delegates. Such meeting will enable the 
Working Group to receive updated information from victims and act accordingly.  
</p>
<p>57. It was proposed that the Working Group liaises with the United Nations Development 
Group (UNDG) in order to ensure that people of African descent are addressed in the 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). The incorporation of the 
recommendations of the Working Group in the respective UNDAF may ensure their 
implantation at the national level. Closer collaboration between the Working Group and financial 
institutions on specific projects would also be highly beneficial.  
</p><p>58. It was commented that the Working Group would benefit from working more closely with 
other human rights mechanisms, in particular treaty bodies and special procedures mandate 
holders of the Human Rights Council. It was also stated that the Working Group should ensure 
that it fulfills the entirety of its mandate as stipulated in Human Rights Council resolution 9/14, 
which includes the holding of public meetings and interacting with international financial 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>59. An observer suggested that the Working Group, in its future work, address the historic 
causes of racism, territorial autonomy and cultural autonomy, multiculturalism and interethnic 
identity, sustainable growth and intellectual property, equity and control of resources. 
</p>
<p>60. Other observers suggested that the Working Group address the issues of poverty, the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), cultural heritage, social exclusion and data collection, 
including disaggregated data. Furthermore, the issues of impunity and remedies were 
highlighted. It was proposed that the Working Group holds a session on the transatlantic slave 
trade and its direct and indirect impact. It was also mentioned that a distinction should be made 
between the situation of people of African descent in developing and developed countries as they 
may face different constraints upon the full enjoyment of their rights. 
</p><p>61. It was proposed that the Working Group also organize a thematic discussion on men of 
African descent as in some situations they are more vulnerable to discriminatory practices, for 
instance in the areas of criminal justice and employment.  
62. It was noted that technical assistance and cooperation projects need to address/incorporate 
the recommendations of the Working Group and that more technical assistance is needed for the 
improvement of the situation of people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>63. The issue of disaggregated data was extensively discussed. It was noted that research 
efforts are obstructed by the lack of availability of such data. In some cases where countries have 
such data, they do not release it. Other States are not keen on collecting disaggregated data as 
this is considered a violation of privacy and such data may trigger more discriminatory practices. 
It was commented that disaggregated data on gender, disabilities and indigenous peoples did not 
generate negative stereotypes or discriminatory practices; on the contrary they proved to be 
extremely useful.  
</p>
<p>64. The collaboration of State institutions and civil society are essential for the collection and 
distribution of such data. It was suggested that pilot projects on collection of disaggregated data </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>can be useful in paving a way towards wider support for this approach. Data collection of 
positive results can also encourage governments to adopt further measures and/or enhance 
existing ones.  
</p>
<p><b>Item 7:  Thematic discussion on the situations of children of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>65. Before beginning the discussion under this item, Mr. Frans made some opening remarks, 
stressing the problem of hate crimes, an issue previously identified by the Working Group as a 
subject that deserved discussion and accompanying recommendations. He said that hate crimes 
are a daily reality all over the world and that governments have a responsibility to put an end to 
these shameful and serious crimes. Several studies demonstrate the danger of allowing prejudices 
against others to take root and spread. Unfortunately, the step from hate speech to hate crime is 
easily made. In most of the countries, the law is clear and sees such racist motives as an 
aggravating factor but this is not always borne out in the trials. Though governments may have 
spoken out against racism and violence, the problem remains. The seriousness of such crimes 
and the duty of governments to take action to stop them have also been underlined by several 
international human rights bodies, highlighting the importance of effective investigation in cases 
of racially motivated violence.  
</p>
<p><b>Children of African descent and violence 
</b></p>
<p>66. Ms. Najcevska presented her paper on &#8220;Children of African descent and Violence&#8221;. 
Children are 30 per cent of the world&#8217;s population today and 100 per cent of the population of 
tomorrow. What happens to children today is a projection of tomorrow. Children are a 
vulnerable group and violence against them has grown significantly over the last twenty years. 
Children have not been accorded enough significance as either historical or social actors. 
</p>
<p>67. The expert considered that the conjunction of violence and discrimination endured by 
children is an explosive combination that should be very carefully scrutinized. According to 
UNICEF, poverty aggravates the social exclusion that Afro-descendent peoples have endured for 
centuries. Afro-descendent communities live in high-risk conditions and generally the violence 
against children in these communities is both wider and deeper. In recent decades some extreme 
forms of violence against children, including sexual exploitation and trafficking, female genital 
mutilation, the worst forms of child labour and the impact of armed conflict have provoked 
international outcry and achieved a consensus of condemnation, although no rapid remedy. 
</p>
<p>68. The expert stated that by default, violence against children is invisible, while that directed 
against children of African descent is even more so. The problem is aggravated by a lack of 
reporting of cases and institutional violence. The reporting of violence is closely connected with 
the support and security that a child feels, the trust that he or she has in the relevant institutions 
and also with the education of the child. Only a small proportion of acts of violence against 
children is reported and investigated, and few perpetrators are held to account.  
</p>
<p>69. The expert also identified the following major issues of concern faced by children of 
African Descent: the disproportionate rate of expulsion, suspension and relegation to special 
programs for emotionally disturbed children; corporal punishment administered with greater 
severity; the large number placed under institutional care or detention centers charged with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>minor or petty crimes; the death penalty and life imprisonment. Ms. Najcevska stressed that the 
conjunction between poverty, systematic and institutionalized discrimination and a lack of state 
interest result in a vicious circle in which children are trapped.  
</p>
<p>70. Finally, Ms Najcevska underlined the need for extended visibility of children of African 
descent by such means as birth registration, effective reporting systems on abuse and the 
development and implementation of systematic disaggregated national data. She also 
recommended the strengthening of international and national commitment and actions based on 
the clear recognition of the racial aspects of violence. Prevention, deinstitutionalisation of care 
(ensure institutionalisation is a last resort, and prioritise alternatives) should also de enhanced. 
Quality training of police, referral agencies, lawyers, judges, institution managers and staff 
should also be a priority so as to sensitize them to the issue of racism and violence as they affect 
children of African descent. Accessible and child-friendly reporting systems and services should 
be created and parents should have their capacity to care for their children supported. 
</p>
<p>71. Panellist Ms. Alma Jenkins, from the Regional Office of UNICEF Panama, made a 
presentation on &#8220;Children of African Descent, Violence and Discrimination in the Latin America 
and Caribbean Region&#8221;. She argued that the results of the World Conference against Racism, 
Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related intolerance of 2001 were weakened by the fight 
against terrorism and the fact that development cooperation resources were scarce in middle 
income countries. The current development models do not cater properly to the fight against 
poverty and social exclusion. She also highlighted as new forms of racial discrimination the 
increase in hate crimes and the political instrumentalization and intellectual legitimization of 
racism. 
</p>
<p>72. Ms. Jenkins stated that 150 million Afro-descendents live in the region out of 
which 106 million are young people and 80 million are these are children. She also pointed out 
that the lack of disaggregated data disadvantages people of African descent, as neither a clear 
understanding of the state of affairs nor a viable and comprehensive solution can be arrived at 
without accurate disaggregate data. 
</p>
<p>73. The expert panelist underlined the importance of the application of international human 
rights law at the national level. She highlighted article 29 (c) of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child according to which education of the child shall be directed to the development of 
respect for the child&#8217;s parents, his or her own cultural identity, language and values of the 
country in which the child is living, from the country from which he or she may originate, and 
for civilizations different from his or her own. 
</p>
<p>74. Ms. Jenkins also presented economic and social indicators, in particular those relating to 
income, resources, literacy, school attendance, education, employment, health and infant and 
maternal mortality that demonstrate that people of African descent are more severely affected in 
these areas than the average for the population in Latin America and Caribbean region. 
</p>
<p>75. Finally, Ms. Jenkins pointed out that not enough progress has been made towards the 
achievements of MDGs in the region. For instance, with regard to MDG 1 on halving extreme 
poverty, she said that there are still 194 million poor people in the region (36.5 per cent), and 
71 million people in extreme poverty (13.4 per cent). The panellist emphasized that the failure to 
meet MDGs as regards people of African descent stems from the persistence of discrimination.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>76. The Chairperson opened the floor for comments and questions. 
</p>
<p>77. One observer emphasised the importance of a rights based approach and that what children 
say must be taken into account. It was noted that children represent the present and not just the 
future. It was also stressed that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most 
comprehensive legal framework on child rights and must be the cornerstone for any action to 
further the protection of children. One observer stressed that States should take effective 
preventive measures with the aim of eliminating juvenile crimes.  
</p><p>78. Panellist Renato Roseno made a presentation on the situation of children of African 
descent in Brazil, with a focus on violence. It was noted that they face multiple forms of 
discrimination. The concept of intersectionality comprising the coexistence of different factors 
such as race, gender, social class, violence etc. helps us to understand the complexity of groups 
and situations. It was noted that discriminatory practices are acute, inter alia, in the realms of 
university education, employment and mortality rates. These children are more often victims of 
violent attacks. It was highlighted that isolated policies tend to be inefficient and that problems 
have to be addressed in an holistic manner. The need for differentiated education that respects 
and preserves cultural values, history and ethnic identity was noted.  
</p>
<p>79. It was suggested that the Working Group collaborate more closely with the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child and ensure participation of children in meetings that the Working Group 
carries out during country visits.  
</p>
<p>80. The Chairperson opened the floor for discussion. 
</p>
<p>81. An observer suggested that efforts should be made to reconstruct the image of people of 
African descent as this would have an impact on social attitudes towards them. It was also 
suggested that young people who are deprived of their history are apt to fill this gap with 
criminal figures as role models and points of reference.  
</p>
<p>82. The issue of children who are born and raised in a developed country and then deported, 
was mentioned as a concern. Furthermore, the so-called &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;safe&#8221; policies at 
schools result in the expulsion of boys of African descent who end up in criminal gangs. It was 
also noted that a disproportionate number of children of African descent remain in the childcare 
system in developed countries as there are no foster parents for them, which results in a loss of 
identity.  
</p>
<p><b>Children of African descent and human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>83. Panellist Veronica Birga made a presentation on the work of treaty monitoring bodies and 
special procedures mandate holders with regard to children of African descent. During the 
review of the respective recommendations, the issues of birth registration, nutrition, school 
attendance and drop out, mortality rates and access to healthcare services were highlighted, 
among others. It was noted that the Committee on the Rights of the Child also pointed out the 
need for disaggregated data. Race and ethnicity have been seen to affect vulnerability to sexual 
exploitation and trafficking. In schools, disciplinary measures are more often taken against 
children of African descent. The need for intersecting policies was emphasized.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>84. It was recommended that the Working Group use a human rights approach based on the 
provisions of the CRC when it addresses the issue of children of African descent. It was also 
proposed that the Working Group endorses the recommendations contained within the 
United Nations United Nations Study on Violence Against Children. The Working Group was 
also encouraged to continue examining the situation of children of African descent, to strengthen 
collaboration with human rights mechanisms, to invite civil society to submit information on the 
situation of children of African descent, to take into consideration the issue of children during 
the forthcoming country visits and to contribute to awareness-raising on the subject. 
<b>Access to education by children of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>85. Ms. Sahli, expert of the Working Group, made a presentation on access to education by 
children of African descent. She recalled that access to education is a fundamental human right. 
It was noted that apart from physical violence, a child&#8217;s not being allowed to have an education 
constitutes moral violence. The right to education constitutes a chance for equal opportunities. 
Again, an intersectoral analysis was noted as important. For instance, girls of African descent 
face three kinds of vulnerability: they are children, they are of African descent and they are girls. 
Furthermore, access to education is linked to access to healthcare services, housing, poverty etc.  
</p>
<p>86. The importance of the quality of an education was underlined. The contents of the school 
curriculum, for instance history, can make a child feel excluded. Education has the potential to 
erase the roots of discriminatory attitudes and marginalization and promote respect and 
tolerance. States need to increase the effectiveness of national measures in this regard and fully 
implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the provisions of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>87. The expert explained that a &#8220;zone by zone&#8221; approach takes into consideration the different 
conditions that determine access to education in rural and urban areas. A transversal approach 
focuses on the visibility of a child in the education system. Children who are excluded from 
educational systems are not visible. The bi-polar approach to education focuses on the situation 
of children of African descent in developed countries, where a certain dress code may become a 
reason for exclusion.  
</p>
<p>88. Ms. Sahli recalled the obligation of States to protect children without discrimination and to 
ensure equal access to education, taking into account the special vulnerability of children of 
African descent and the importance of education for their empowerment. 
</p>
<p>89. The expert made the difference between the right of access to education in developed and 
developing countries. Ms. Sahli mentioned that children of African descent in developing 
countries are subjected to discriminatory conditions with regard to access to education and that 
States should take measures to ensure that children enjoy the full protection and guarantees 
against all forms of discrimination and adopt national legislation in accordance with international 
human rights standards. On the other hand, although developed countries have recognized the 
right to education, the education system still involves segregation, whereby children of African 
descent are given access to education, but confined to separate or inferior schools. The expert 
said that the most challenging stage of implementing the right to access education requires that 
States adapt their education systems to enhance equal enjoyment by all.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>90. Ms. Sahli recommended strengthening cooperation and partnerships with civil society 
representatives, schools, the media, and specialized agencies, particularly UNESCO and 
UNICEF while addressing the issue of discrimination faced by children of African descent and 
in data collection regarding access to education, in order to monitor and evaluate legislation and 
elaborate educational policies. Ms Sahli mentioned that the inevitable effect of exclusion from 
education is exclusion from the labour market. 
</p>
<p>91. The Chairperson opened the floor for discussion. 
</p>
<p>92. A comment was made regarding the fact that with far fewer resources and facing enormous 
problems of poverty some developing countries still ensured a quality education for all. Another 
participant mentioned that without education, people are impeded from accessing employment. 
Redressing the existing imbalance, as regards the opportunities that life offers, without the full 
recognition of the right to education is thus impossible. There are a large number of human rights 
problems that cannot be solved unless the right to education is addressed as it is the key to 
unlocking other human rights. 
</p>
<p>93. Other commentators highlighted the fact that literacy is at the heart of all subsequent 
education, training and learning and that literacy is essential for sustainable development. The 
commentator stressed the urgent need for the elimination of illiteracy. In this regard, literacy is a 
precondition of effective social participation and a tool of empowerment at individual and 
community levels.  
</p>
<p>94. There was also mention of the importance of access for all to free primary education and 
strengthening access to higher education through national programmes, including affirmative 
action policies. In this regard, political will is essential in order to implement effective measures.  
</p>
<p>95. An observed noted that more teachers of African descent need to be integrated into 
educational systems as they are also role models and can help children to preserve their identity. 
It was pointed out that the concept of multi-vulnerability should be used with caution; for 
instance poor children of African descent do not face the same problem as other poor children - a 
fact that reveals that the colour of their skin is the determining factor.  
</p>
<p>96. It was pointed out that multicultural education should start as early as possible, including 
in kindergarten and pre-school curricula, and that education should preserve children&#8217;s identity 
and cultural values.  
</p>
<p><b>Access to health for children of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>97. Ms. Biswas, expert of the Working Group made a presentation on access to healthcare for 
children of African descent. She pointed out that unequal access to healthcare services has a 
detrimental impact on children. Lower birth weight and higher birth mortality are experienced by 
people of African descent in developed countries. They suffer disproportionally from mental 
diseases, chronic physical illness, stressful life events, poverty, single parenthood, abuse or 
neglect, family discord and depression. Factors such as inadequate resources, lack of a sufficient 
number of schools, violence in the community and poor housing in what amount to segregated </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods also influence the health status of this population group. Larger numbers of 
people of African descent do not have medical insurance. The lack of sufficient resources also 
hampers medical check-ups and timely prevention. Ms. Biswas also pointed out that there is a 
lower life expectancy and a higher mortality rate in this population group.  
</p>
<p>98. Governments have to eradicate racial discrimination in health care and health research as 
well as eliminate environmental hazards in these communities. Efforts should be made to 
increase knowledge about the health of people of African descent and translate it into effective 
clinical practice. It was suggested that the Working Group collect information on the health of 
children of African descent. This would help meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
with a view to reducing inequalities in health and thereby assist in improving the health of 
people of African descent, in particular children. 
</p>
<p>99. The Chairperson opened the floor for discussion.  
</p>
<p>100. An observer indicated that disparities need to be analyzed through a social determinant 
approach. Even when families have medical insurance, there is different care for children of 
African descent. Any disparities in healthcare should be determined as discrimination. It was 
commented that racism is the number one stressor for children of African descent in some 
developed countries, resulting in asthma, obesity and other stress related health problems.  
</p>
<p>101. It was highlighted that in the present economic crisis, governments should not reduce 
resources allocated to health and education due to their vital importance.  
</p>
<p><b>Item 8:  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>102. At the end of the discussion on the situation of children of African descent, the experts 
discussed country visits to be conducted in the coming three years. Observers suggested that the 
experts select countries with different profiles regarding the situation of people of African 
descent. Among the proposals for country visits were Brazil, Colombia and the United States of 
America. It was recommended that during the country visits, the experts should explore not only 
problems regarding the situation of people of African descent but also positive experiences that 
can be used as examples by other countries.  
</p>
<p><b>Item 9:  Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p>103. During the deliberations on item 9 of the agenda, a statement was read on behalf of several 
NGOs (African Canadian Legal Clinic, African Women&#8217;s Movement in Europe &#8220;Sophiedela&#8221;, 
Stichting National Monument the Netherlands, Tiye International, Pan-African Roots 
Organization, the University of Dayton, Afro Swedish National Association) noting with concern 
that some governments withdrew from the Durban Review Conference and called on all 
governments to participate. The issue of increased financial support for the participation of 
NGOs was also raised. Moreover, it was highlighted that during the Review Conference an 
assessment should be made of the extent to which governments have implemented the provisions 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The Chairperson indicated that the 
Working Group will participate in the Review Conference with a particular focus on discussions 
that relate to the situation of people of African descent. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>104. The Chairman announced that in the afternoon the experts will hold a private meeting to 
discuss and formulate their recommendations and conclusions, which will be presented and 
discussed the following morning.  
</p>
<p>105. The following morning, the Chairperson presented the draft conclusions and 
recommendations arrived at by the experts the day before, as well as the draft work plan of the 
Working Group for the period 2009-2011. He then adjourned the meeting for an hour so as to 
give participants the opportunity to review the documents and make consultations if necessary. 
When the meeting reconvened, a discussion of the draft documents took place and several small 
modifications were suggested. Several suggestions related to the need to reference the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child more explicitly in the conclusions and recommendations. 
Other comments related to education systems and the administration of justice, including 
detention, as regards children of African descent. At the end of the discussion, the experts met to 
consider the suggestions made. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 10: Adoption of the conclusions and recommendations of the  
eighth session as well as the work plan 2009-2011 
</b></p>
<p>106. The Chair opened the meeting with a brief presentation on the conclusions and 
recommendations and invited the other experts to make concluding remarks. Several 
Governments expressed their satisfaction with the session, the conclusions and recommendations 
and the work plan, as did other participants. A final amendment to one of the conclusions was 
suggested and agreed to by the experts and the conclusions and recommendations were adopted 
by the Working Group, along with its work plan for the period 2009-2011. The Chairperson then 
made his closing statement and the eighth session was concluded. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Working Group believes that it is important that it enhance its interaction with 
other human rights mechanisms insofar as they deal with the situation of people of African 
descent. Furthermore, the Working Group intends to engage with the United Nations 
Development Group to explore ways to enhance the effective implementation of its 
recommendations by States.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Working Group similarly intends to engage with United Nations Country Teams 
regarding the establishment of a thematic group on diversity, ethnicity and exclusion. In 
order to more fully implement its mandate, the Working Group also intends to interact 
with international financial institutions to explore ways in which it might collaborate with 
them so as to improve the situation of people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Working Group stresses the importance of educational curricula that are 
designed to highlight the history, heritage and contributions of people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>In light of the special concern of the Working Group with the situation of children of 
African descent, it endorses and reiterates the recommendations contained in the 
United Nations Study on Violence Against Children and calls upon States to implement </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>them fully. It furthermore highlights the importance of the principles of 
non-discrimination and participation contained in the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child (articles 2 and 12). 
</b>111. <b>Being an issue that particularly affects children of African descent, the Working 
Group recognizes the need for States to strengthen their legal regimes as regards the 
protection of children and to make all efforts to prevent the disproportionate 
representation of children of African descent in the juvenile justice system. 
</b>112. <b>The Working Group considers that any disparity in healthcare delivery systems that 
exists in a State that impact negatively on children of African descent constitutes 
discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Working Group identifies the issue of poverty as particularly important when 
analysing the situation of children of African descent and will include this subject in future 
sessions. The Working Group will also include the issues of social exclusion and 
marginalization, the right and access to housing, culture and development and the issue of 
hate crimes against people of African descent. With regard to the last issue, the Working 
Group intends to engage with the Inter-Parliamentary Union. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The Working Group emphasizes that the current global financial crisis must not be 
allowed to affect the enjoyment of social, economic and cultural rights by people of African 
descent, particularly children of African descent, and calls upon States to ensure that this 
does not occur.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Working Group reiterates its request for OHCHR to establish a voluntary fund 
to be used to assist NGOs to participate in the sessions of the Working Group. The 
Working Group also calls upon States to contribute to this voluntary fund. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The Working Group reiterates its call upon those States that have not as yet 
elaborated national plans of action to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, to do so, preferably before the Durban Review Conference is held. 
Those States that have elaborated national plans of action are called upon to fully 
implement them and to inform upon such implementation at the Durban Review 
Conference. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to enhance their support of Groups of Women 
of African Descent and to adopt special measures to favour young women of African 
descent in the areas of access to healthcare, employment and education. As a factor that 
greatly enhances their economic emancipation, autonomy and social and political 
participation, the Working Group particularly encourages States to adopt measures that 
facilitate access to education for young women of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Working Group calls upon OHCHR and States, in collaboration with civil 
society, to assist it in organizing an international conference on all aspects of the 
transatlantic slave trade. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>119. <b>The Working Group urges States to adopt special measures that address problems 
regarding access to education faced by children of African descent. The Working Group 
particularly underlines the obligation to provide free primary education as stipulated in 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Working Group furthermore urges States 
to give particular attention to victims of racism while designing policies to attain the 
Millennium Development Goals.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The Working Group urges States to adopt special measures to address the problem of 
violence faced by children of African descent, in line with the provisions contained within 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to ensure that children and youths are not held 
in detention centres where adults are held or given adult sentences, as this situation 
particularly affects children and youths of African descent. The Working Group also calls 
upon States to develop and implement a community-based restorative justice approach 
that ensures positive outcomes for youths and children of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Working Group urges States to address disparities in healthcare delivery systems 
that may exist between children of African descent and the rest of the population. States 
should adopt special measures to address disadvantages faced by children of African 
descent regarding access to health care, in line with the provisions contained within the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>Underlining its importance in understanding the situation of children of African 
descent, the Working Group reiterates its recommendation that States implement 
mechanisms whereby disaggregated information may be effectively collected on health, 
education, access to housing, employment, treatment in the criminal justice system and 
political participation and representation of people of African descent. The Working 
Group, furthermore, requests OHCHR to assist it in holding an expert seminar to establish 
guidelines on the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data and guidelines for the 
creation of a Racial Equality Index.  
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>Taking into account the often negative image of children and youths of African 
descent that is portrayed in the media, the Working Group reiterates its recommendation 
that, in association with the International Federation of Journalists, a code of conduct be 
drawn up that, while taking into account such fundamental issues as the right to freedom 
of expression, combats racial discrimination against people of African descent by 
elaborating standards that must be adhered to so as to eliminate the projection and 
perpetuation, through the traditional media and new technologies, of negative images and 
stereotypes of Africa and people of African descent. The Working Group, furthermore, 
calls upon States to develop and implement an information and education campaign to 
combat negative stereotyping of children and youths of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>As a measure to address discrimination faced by children of African descent, the 
Working Group reiterates its recommendation that States and international and regional 
organizations establish independent bodies, where they do not already exist, to receive 
complaints by people of African descent of discrimination in accessing housing, education, 
health, employment and other fundamental rights.</b> </p>

</p>
<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><b>WORK PLAN 2009-2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>Annual sessions 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group intends to look at ways to encourage higher attendance and more 
active participation in its sessions. The Working Group also intends to explore ways and means 
of making its work more visible.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group recognizes that the holding of its sessions in January each year has not 
favoured the ability of many delegates and observers to participate. The Working Group shall 
consult with the Human Rights Council regarding the possibility of holding its sessions at a later 
time in the calendar. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recognizes that it will need to revisit some of the themes already 
studied. It will however prioritize the following themes during the ensuing three years. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group identifies the dichotomy of rural versus urban as particularly 
impacting upon the situation of people of African descent and will include this analysis and a 
gender-specific analysis in future sessions. Other themes that it will discuss include poverty, 
social exclusion and marginalization, the right and access to housing, culture and development 
and hate crimes and inter and intracultural education, as related to people of African descent. 
</p>
<p><b>Country visits 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group will endeavour to undertake at least one country visit every year over 
the next three years. 
</p>
