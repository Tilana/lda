<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/31 
entitled &#8220;Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and 
discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or 
belief&#8221;, in which the Council requested, in paragraph 10, the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to prepare and submit to the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-fifth 
session, a report based upon information provided by States on the efforts and measures 
taken by them for the implementation of the action plan outlined in paragraphs 6 and 7, as 
well as their views on potential follow-up measures for further improvement of the 
implementation of that plan.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Information received from Member States 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Belarus 
</b></p>
<p>2. Belarus stated that its policy in the sphere of confessional relations was regulated by 
the Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations, which guaranteed 
equality and non-discrimination with respect to all religions before the law.  
</p>
<p>3. It added that the Law on Countering Extremism declared as punishable by law all 
the criminal acts listed in article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Law on Political Parties and the Law on Non-
Governmental Associations prohibited the creation and activity of political parties, non-
governmental associations and unions intending to propagate war or extremism. The Law 
on Mass Media guaranteed the rights and freedoms in mass media and prohibited the 
dissemination of information containing incitement to war, violence and extremism. Those 
anti-discrimination measures were extended to all people living in the territory of Belarus. 
</p>
<p>4. With a view to making the implementation of the legislation effective and to support 
inter-confessional dialogue, it had undertaken the second programme on Development of 
the Confessional Sphere, National Relations and Compatriots&#8217; Cooperation for the period 
2011 to 2015. The realization of the rights of freedom of conscience and freedom of 
religion and belief was under the competence of the Commissioner for Religions and 
Nationalities, with representatives in all regions of the country. The Inter-confessional 
Consultative Council coordinated the activity of religious organizations and promoted and 
consolidated peace for co-existence, tolerance and dialogue among representatives of the 
different confessions and religions.  
</p>
<p>5. More than 3,000 religious organizations, 26 confessions and religious groups, as 
well as over 3,000 religious communities and 164 religious organizations were registered in 
Belarus. Belarus reported about the absence of conflicts on the grounds of national, racial, 
cultural, linguistic and confessional affiliation.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The present report contains a summary of the information received from the following States: 
</p>
<p>Belarus, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, 
Indonesia, Iraq, Italy, Lithuania, Pakistan, Qatar, Romania, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, 
Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 
the United States of America. The original texts of the contributions can be consulted in the files of 
the Secretariat. </p>


<p><b>  Belgium 
</b></p>
<p>6. Belgium reported that the Centre for Equal Opportunities had been mandated to 
promote equal opportunities and the fight against all forms of discrimination, exclusion, 
restriction or preference based on several enumerated grounds, including religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>7. The Centre was tasked with ensuring respect for the fundamental rights of foreigners 
and prepared annual reports on discrimination in Belgium. Racism and xenophobia were 
also monitored by the police and the judicial system, and the police and the Crown recorded 
data on discrimination and hate crimes, as well as made available statistics on policing, 
prosecution and conviction with respect to those phenomena. In addition, the Centre had the 
capacity to initiate legal claims and to be a civil party in its own name or on behalf of 
victims of anti-Semitism or Islamophobia. The Centre also organized intercultural 
dialogues, training and awareness-raising sessions. 
</p>
<p>8. With respect to the fight against Islamophobia, Belgium noted that it was difficult to 
assess the extent of this phenomenon, due to the lack of available data. Since 2009, the 
Centre had been providing estimates of Islamophobic acts in its annual reports. It also 
reported that in recent years, 490 cases (164 in 2011, 139 in 2010 and 187 in 2009) inspired 
by Islamophobic sentiment had been opened. A significant part of those records related to 
comments posted on the Internet, while others related to the professional context or 
problems of cohabitation motivated by Islamophobia. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding the fight against anti-Semitism, in February 2012, the Ministers of Justice 
and of the Interior had established a unit to monitor anti-Semitism, which discussed 
building safe communities, teaching about the Holocaust, cyberhatred, anti-Semitic 
incidents and possible remedies.  
</p>
<p>10. Belgium highlighted several measures taken to implement education systems 
promoting tolerance of religious and cultural diversity.  
</p>
<p><b>  Canada 
</b></p>

<p>Act permited the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to 
regulate the content of radio and television programs.  
</p>
<p>14. In February 2013, the Government of Canada had established the Office of 
Religious Freedom which was mandated to promote freedom of religion or belief as a core 
human right, encourage protection of religious communities and promote Canadian values 
of pluralism and tolerance around the world. Canada&#8217;s Ambassador for Religious Freedom 
engaged in consultations with international stakeholders and delivered speeches at various 
events.  
</p>
<p><b>  Czech Republic 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Czech Republic indicated that the Government Council for Human Rights 
included experts on religious freedom and had set up a subsidiary Committee against 
Discrimination to address discrimination on all grounds, including religion, faith or belief. 
The issue of religious tolerance fell within the competence of the Churches Department of 
the Ministry of Culture. In 2012, financial subsidy had been granted to support a festival 
bringing together Christians, Jews and Muslims to deepen and promote their mutual 
understanding and dialogue, and to raise public awareness as a way to counteract the spread 
of extremism.  
</p>
<p>16. The applicable constitutional legislation, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and 
Freedoms, and the international human rights instruments binding on the Czech Republic 
prohibited discrimination on the grounds of religion, faith or belief. They also safeguarded 
freedom of thought and conscience, religion, practice of a faith and religion, as well as the 
freedom of churches and religious societies. The Anti-Discrimination Act prohibited 
discrimination on the grounds of religion, faith or belief in several sectors.  
</p>
<p>17. Propaganda and attacks motivated by religious intolerance were crimes under Czech 
law. The new Criminal Code (2009) included &#8220;the definitions of crimes of violence against 
a group of population or against an individual, dangerous threats, dangerous persecution, 
defamation of a nation, race, ethnic or other groups of persons, and incitement to hatred for 
a group of persons or to actions restricting their rights and freedoms.&#8221; In many other 
definitions of crimes, the presence of the element of religious intolerance automatically 
resulted in a heavier penalty in crimes. This element was also included in the list of general 
aggravating circumstances that attracted stricter penalties in any case.  
</p>
<p>18. To prevent the formation of groups promoting religious or other intolerance, the new 
Civil Code effective 1 January 2014 introduced a ban on the establishment of a legal person 
in cases where the purpose of such legal person was to deny or restrict individual, political 
or other rights of individuals because of their nationality, sex, race, origin, political or other 
opinion, religion and social status. 
</p>
<p><b>  France 
</b></p>
<p>19. France stated that freedom of religion or belief was a fundamental human rights 
principle, which was guaranteed by French national law, reflected in article 10 of the 
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (D&#233;claration des droits de l&#8217;homme et 
du citoyen) (1789) and fully guaranteed by the French Constitution. Implementation of this 
principle at the national level was guided by strict respect for freedom of religion and 
secularism.  
</p>
<p>20. The Minister of the Interior was responsible for relations with religious associations 
and faith-based organizations, and individuals enjoyed freedom of worship. Religious </p>


<p>association were not required to register; however, some did register in order to benefit 
from fiscal advantages. With respect to paragraph 9 of resolution 22/31, where necessary, 
State authorities ensured the protection and security of places of worship.  
</p>
<p>21. In March 2013, the annex to the annual report on racism, anti-Semitism and 
xenophobia by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH) 
had highlighted, through facts and figures, a decrease in tolerance in France over the past 
three years. The report made recommendations concerning education, awareness-raising 
and training to combat discrimination and foster tolerance.  
</p>
<p>22. A National Observatory of Secularism had been created in April 2013 and the 
Minister of Education had also introduced a Secular Charter at the start of the school year 
in September 2013. Regarding paragraph 7(a) of the resolution, France stated that strict 
neutrality was applied by functionaries and public school establishments, which were 
required not to privilege any religion over another. With reference to paragraphs 6 (e), (f) 
and (g) of the resolution, it stated that acts against persons on the basis of their religion 
were severely punished by law, and had been firmly condemned by the highest authorities 
in France. The penal response of the State in this regard was very high. Incitement to hatred 
was also heavily sanctioned.  
</p>
<p>23. France stated that it universally defended freedom of religion or belief and freedom 
of opinion and expression. It recalled that human rights were envisaged to protect 
individuals, not belief systems such as religions and their symbols, which were not subjects 
of rights. In order to combat intolerance, the High Commissioner for Human Rights should 
support the implementation of freedom of opinion and expression as well as freedom of 
religion and belief in an &#8220;equal and simultaneous&#8221; manner.  
</p>
<p><b>  Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>24. Under the auspices of the Public Defender of Georgia, the Council of Ethnic 
Minorities had been created in December 2005 with the main goals of responding in a 
timely manner in cases involving breaches of minority rights and/or the emergence of 
conflict situations and fostering consultation and dialogue between, inter alia, ethnic 
minorities and the Government. The Council of Religions had been created in June 2005 to, 
inter alia, facilitate constructive multilateral dialogue between various religious groups, 
engage religious minorities in the process of civil integration and protect religious freedom, 
etc.  
</p>
<p>25. The Action Plan of the Ministry of Justice, as a part of the National Concept for 
Tolerance and Civil Integration, included the elaboration of a comprehensive legal act on 
the issue of tolerance, undertaking measures aimed at the registration of the Roma 
population and the creation of an advisory body within the Ministry on questions of 
national minorities. 
</p>
<p>26. Prohibition of all forms of discrimination and intolerance was comprehensively 
regulated by the Constitution and other legal acts of Georgia. Under article 24.<footnote name="2">7. The Ministry of Justice had drafted a Law on Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination, with the purpose of eliminating all forms of discrimination and ensuring for </footnote> of the 
Criminal Code of Georgia (1999), in conjunction with all relevant crimes, a person could be 
brought to justice for instigating violence against representatives of any distinguishable 
group. Furthermore, in 2012, article 53 (General Principles of Sentencing) of the Code had 
been amended so that all relevant crimes committed on the grounds of racial, religious, 
national or ethnic intolerance or any other discriminating ground shall be considered to be 
committed in aggravated circumstances. 
</p>

<p>every person equal enjoyment of the rights prescribed by law, irrespective of a number of 
grounds, including religion or belief, and discrimination shall be prohibited in all spheres.  
</p>
<p>28. In July 2011, the Civil Code of Georgia had been amended and article 15091 had 
been added to allow the registration of religious groups as religious associations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Germany 
</b></p>
<p>29. Germany reported that the Federal Government actively supported networking, 
democratic consciousness and participation, education and publication of civic engagement 
through the Forum against Racism; the Government-funded programme, &#8220;Cohesion 
through Participation&#8221;; the Federal Agency for Civic Education (Bundeszentrale f&#252;r 
politische Bildung, BpB); and the Alliance for Democracy and Tolerance. 
30. The Federal Ministry of the Interior, for many years, had successfully promoted 
Christian-Jewish cooperation, as well as interreligious and intercultural dialogue between 
Christians and Jews, and had, in recent years, extended the dialogue to a trialogue at the 
international level with Muslims. In 2006, the German Islam Conference had been launched 
to establish a permanent communication process between the German State (Federal 
Government, Federal L&#228;nder, municipalities) and the representatives of Muslims living in 
Germany, aimed at improving their structural and social integration and strengthening 
social cohesion (www.deutsche-islam-konferenz.de).  
31. The police combated hate crime, including by systematically prosecuting hate 
crimes as offences against State security and recording them separately; cooperating with 
counselling bodies and supporting projects, associations and institutions providing 
assistance to victims, in an effort to encourage those seeking help to come forward; 
undertaking differentiated analysis of the number of cases nationally, in order to elaborate 
potential prevention measures; and cataloguing measures to combat politically motivated 
crime in order to perceive, record and combat relevant offences in a more targeted manner. 
The police took regular preventive measures, such as stepping up physical protection or 
police controls, with regard to especially vulnerable points, for example, Jewish cemeteries.  
</p>
<p>32. In 2011, the Federal Ministry of the Interior had launched the Security Partnership 
Initiative, a body comprised of representatives of the Federal Government, the Federal 
L&#228;nder, security authorities and Muslims, aimed at increasing public awareness of the 
problem of radicalization of young people, to initiate projects and to provide financial 
support to successful projects of the Muslim community and to security authorities, at the 
local level (www.initiative-sicherheitspartnerschaft.de). 
</p>
<p><b>  Greece 
</b></p>
<p>33. Greece outlined the legislative framework as well as the measures and actions 
implemented by the Greek Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports. 
It noted that while article 3 of the Constitution recognized the Eastern Orthodox Church as 
the predominant religion, the Greek State had declared its commitment to protecting the 
religious freedom of all other religious aggregations and expressions (art. 13). It added that 
the constitutional provision of &#8220;dominant&#8221; religion does not mean or imply any reduction or 
restriction of religious freedom of other religions.  
</p>
<p>34. The dialogue between the State and ecclesiastical jurisdictions and religious 
communities was constitutionally guaranteed and regulated within the constitutional 
guarantee of religious freedom. Free choice in the organization and administration of every 
church and religious community was protected by the Constitution.  </p>


<p>35. Principles of intercultural education had been included in the school curricula, and 
school books had been and continued to be revised. Further educational measures had been 
implemented, such as the prohibition of the distribution of leaflets, particularly those 
creating a negative image or defaming religion, belief or tradition; in compliance with 
international law, the functioning of schools for children of the Muslim minority in Thrace 
and the teaching of religious studies to Roman Catholic pupils in Cyclades; the recognition 
of religious holidays of Muslim and Roman Catholic students; and, the teaching of different 
religions around the world as part of the high school programme. 
</p>
<p>36. The Ministry of Education also provided for the appointment of teaching staff in the 
schools of the Jewish communities of Athens and Thessaloniki, in response to the 
communities&#8217; requests, as well as for the operation of the only public Jewish school in 
Larissa.  
</p>
<p><b>  Hungary 
</b></p>
<p>37. Constitutional regulations governed freedom of religion and belief in Hungary. 
According to the Fundamental Law of Hungary, everyone had the right to the free selection 
or change of religion or other conviction and the freedom whereby everyone may or may 
not manifest, may practice or teach his or her religion or other conviction by performing 
religious actions or rituals or by other manners, whether individually or in common with 
others, in public or in private. 
</p>
<p>38. Those who followed the same doctrine could set up a religious community to 
practice their religion, in the organizational form specified in the Cardinal Act. The State 
and the religious communities worked separately; religious communities were independent. 
Nevertheless, the State and religious communities could cooperate to achieve the 
community objectives. The rules relevant to religious communities were provided in the 
Cardinal Act on Churches, which protected fundamental rights; defined the religious 
community as an umbrella concept for the organizational framework and included therein; 
&#8220;accepted churches&#8221; had public law status under the amended act (Cardinal Act on 
Churches).  
39. If the stipulated conditions for recognition as an accepted church were met, the 
Minister forwarded the application to the National Assembly, which had, to date, 
recognized 32 religious communities as accepted churches. According to the fundamental 
law, other organizations which performed religious activities could use the name &#8220;church&#8221;, 
which thus warranted the identity protection of these communities. Hungary reported that a 
determinative part of the rules formerly only applicable to the legal status of churches 
applied to all the religious communities, including organizations performing religious 
activities, granting them much greater autonomy than before. 
</p>
<p>40. The Government and the National Assembly of Hungary regularly spoke out against 
religious intolerance. Hungarian government bodies held regular dialogues not only with 
the accepted churches, but also with other interested religious communities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Indonesia 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Government of Indonesia had conducted outreach activities among stakeholders 
within and outside the Government, including by disseminating Human Rights Council 
resolution 22/31 among members of the local committees of the Human Rights Action Plan 
at the provincial and district levels. It had also strengthened its national mechanisms, Forum 
Kerukunan Umat Beragama (FKUB) (Inter-religious Communication Forum), to identify 
potential conflict among different religious followers and provide conflict prevention and </p>


<p>mediation. Dialogue and consultation among national stakeholders had also been 
intensified. In cooperation with countries within a bilateral framework, Indonesia had held 
inter-faith dialogues to promote a culture of religious tolerance. Indonesia also reported that 
in November 2013, in cooperation with the Government of the United States of America, it 
had conducted a dialogue involving relevant stakeholders from both sides regarding the 
implementation of Council resolution 16/18.  
</p>
<p>42. Indonesia had enacted Law No. 11/2008 on Information and Electronic 
Transactions, which regulated the dissemination of information by a person with the 
intention to incite hatred and hostility of individuals and/or specific community groups 
based on ethnicity, religion, race and inter-group. The Penal Code was being revised to 
include criminalization of acts that disseminate statements of hostility that could lead to 
violence towards other persons or groups based on, inter alia, religion, race and ethnicity. A 
bill was being formulated to guarantee and enhance religious tolerance and also provide 
concrete and practical steps to resolve future conflicts between religious communities.  
</p>
<p>43. Indonesia was of the view that the issue of religious intolerance was transboundary 
and should be addressed collectively through cooperation among countries and relevant 
stakeholders. Indonesia believed that the existing Council resolutions should be further 
solidified and elaborated in order to serve as a robust foundation for advancing effective 
international cooperation to address issues of religious intolerance. It stated that a global 
joint effort was needed to formulate a solid common normative and operational framework 
for international cooperation to comprehensively address issues of religious intolerance, 
negative stereotyping and stigmatization, discrimination, incitement to violence and 
violence based on religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b>  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>44. Iraq reported that article 2 of its Constitution guaranteed the protection of the 
Islamic identity of the Iraqi people and the right and freedom of all peoples to practice their 
religions. It added that, there was a variety of religions and branches of religion in Iraq (art. 
3). The Constitution also forbade racial, terrorist or radical organizations, and under article 
14, all Iraqis were equal before the law, regardless of race, ethnicity, colour, religion, 
branch of religion, conscience, opinion or socioeconomic status. Under article 37(2) of the 
Constitution, the State guaranteed the protection of individuals against enforced religious, 
intellectual or political opinion or belief; article 43(1) guaranteed to all, freedom of worship 
and belief, and the State protected freedom of worship as well as places of worship.  
</p>
<p>45. It added that national legislation reflected the international human rights conventions 
ratified by Iraq, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Arab Charter on Human Rights and the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Iraq reported on its 
efforts to train government personnel, security officials, civilians and others to treat the 
public without discrimination. The Government also ensured freedom of worship and the 
celebration of feast days and holidays.  
</p>
<p>46. It reported that religious and racial minorities in Iraq were represented in politics and 
in the Parliament and Councils of the Government through a quota. The Government also 
allocated land and funds for the places of worship of all religions. Educational curricula at 
all levels reflected the ethnic and racial minorities of Iraq and the Government conducted 
promotional campaigns to foster and encourage tolerance among all people in Iraq. The 
Government was also undertaking conflict resolution and mediation in different 
communities and areas in Iraq.  </p>


<p><b>  Italy 
</b></p>
<p>47. On 20 June 2013, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had organized a conference 
entitled, Genocide Prevention and Responsibility to Protect: the United Nations Early 
Warning Mechanism, in which the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the 
Prevention of Genocide participated as keynote speaker. Italy was supporting the Office on 
Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect in updating its framework of 
analysis for genocide prevention, which had strengthened the relevance of sectarian 
violence as an indicator of danger of genocide and mass atrocities.  
</p>
<p>48. Italy reported that the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) was 
undertaking a database project on country legislation on freedom of religion or belief, 
designed to build high-quality, up-to-date empirical research and statistical analysis of 
national restrictions on the practice of religion and an online legal database of existing 
national legal frameworks on freedom of religion or belief worldwide. IDLO planned to 
work in close cooperation with the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to 
Protect, selected research institutes, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) and other actors.  
49. Italy stated that, in its view, there was a worldwide increase in acts of intolerance 
and violent attacks against persons belonging to religious groups and minorities, while at 
the same time, there was a rise in legal and de facto restrictions on religious freedom in 
many countries. It added that, in many countries, intolerance and violence directed against 
members of religious communities and minorities were increasingly inspired and executed 
by terrorist groups. Those activities should be contained and defeated through international 
cooperation, namely with the countries in which such events had occurred, as well as within 
international organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lithuania 
</b></p>
<p>50. Lithuania reported that it did not have a State religion and that Lithuanian legislation 
guaranteed unrestricted freedom of thought, conscience and religion to all persons. Persons 
belonging to national minorities had the right to profess any or no religion and perform 
religious or national observances in their mother tongue. 
</p>
<p>51. In Lithuania, the religious communities of the Orthodox, Old Believers, Sunni 
Muslims (Tartars), Jews, Greek Catholics and Karaites were considered traditional religious 
communities that formed part of the social, cultural and historical heritage of Lithuania, as 
set out in article 5 of the Law on Religious Communities and Associations. Article 6 of that 
Law stated that other religious associations may be granted State recognition as being a part 
of Lithuania&#8217;s historical, spiritual and social heritage, provided that they enjoy support of 
the general public and that their teaching and rites were not contrary to the law and 
morality. To date, no ethnoconfessional community had approached the Seimas of the 
Republic of Lithuania for the status of State-recognized religious association. 
</p>
<p>52. Once registered, a religious association acquired legal personality; nevertheless, 
religious associations did not necessarily need to register to operate in Lithuania. Religious 
associations, both registered and non-registered, were not subject to any restrictions on their 
right to practice their religion or faith.  
</p>
<p>53. Lithuania highlighted a number of relevant training sessions and seminars held for 
judges, lawyers and other law enforcement officials between 2009 and 2012.  </p>


<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>54. Pakistan outlined several articles of the Constitution, which, it stated, were in line 
with paragraph 6 of Human Rights Council resolution 22/31, including articles 15 to 20 
guaranteeing freedom of movement, assembly, association, speech, to profess religion and 
manage institutions to every citizen; article 25 guaranteeing equal protection of the law to 
all citizens, irrespective of their religion, caste, gender or creed; article 33 whereby the 
State shall discourage parochial, racial, tribal, sectarian and provincial prejudices among 
the citizens; and article 36 guaranteeing the protection of minorities. It stated that the State 
shall safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of minorities, including their due 
representation in the Federal and Provincial services.  
</p>
<p>55. Pakistan also explained that its domestic &#8220;blasphemy laws&#8221; originated from the 
colonial era with the purpose of ensuring law and order and preventing interreligious 
discord. It indicated that its purpose was not to discriminate against any religious 
community and that it applied equally to Muslims and non-Muslims. 
</p>
<p>56. The National Conference on Interfaith Harmony, held in February 2013, 
recommended, inter alia, the establishment of an Interfaith Dialogue Council; the 
replacement of the word minorities with &#8220;non-Muslims&#8221; for Pakistani Christians, Hindus 
and members of different religions; integration of interreligious dialogue and the teaching 
of peace in the educational curriculum; appropriate governmental measures to prevent 
misuse of blasphemy; tackling the root causes of terrorism, violence and intolerance; and 
increased media coverage of interfaith dialogue and peace programmes in the country. 
Pakistan added that, confronted by extremism and terrorism, particular focus was being 
placed on the education, deradicalization and skills development programmes. 
</p>
<p>57. Pakistan underlined the influential role of religious leaders in Pakistan, particularly 
in condemning acts of discrimination and incitement to hatred.  
</p>
<p>58. Regarding the implementation of the action plan, Pakistan stated that Council 
resolution 16/18 was a first step in the process and not an end in itself, as the heart of the 
issue was to determine a threshold between incitement to hatred and violence on the basis 
of religion on the one hand, and freedom of expression on the other. While the Istanbul 
Process and the series of workshops organized by OHCHR, which had culminated in the 
Rabat Plan of Action, had contributed to identifying some elements that might strengthen 
the implementation of the action plan, the issue of incitement to hatred remained largely 
unaddressed as clearly underlined by paragraph 6 (f) of the action plan, &#8220;adopting measures 
to criminalize incitement to violence based on religion or belief.&#8221; Pakistan stated that 
OHCHR should work in collaboration with Member States towards a more institutional 
response to the issue of criminalization of hate speech.

citizens were equal in rights and obligations before the law and there was a &#8220;right to 
equality and non-discrimination based on sex, origin, language and religion (articles 34 and </p>


<p>35). Freedom of worship was guaranteed to all in line with the law and within the limits of 
the general public order and morality, under article 50, and under article 52, every person 
legally resident was protected in their person and assets.  
</p>
<p>61. The national legislation of Qatar also contained articles and provisions rejecting all 
intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to 
violence and violence against persons based on religion or belief. Article 256 of the 
Criminal Code (2004) punished all acts and actions relating to incitement to: &#8220;denigrating 
or insulting the deity by any means; making insulting, disparaging or blasphemous remarks 
about the Koran; making insulting remarks about Islam or an Islamic ritual; defaming any 
of the revealed religions; insulting the prophet of a religion; or desecrating a place of

the Doha International Centre for Interfaith Dialogue and the Coalition of Cultures 
Committee in this regard, and outlined a number of conferences, activities and interfaith 
dialogues.

</p>
<p>64. In 2012, the annual activity report of the National Council for Combating 
Discrimination indicated that five petitions had been made on the basis of religion, of which 
one concerned a declaration made about Muslim persons. In that case, the decision issued 
by the National Council established that the affirmations made in the media, were &#8220;aimed at 
reaching the Romanian public, brought about prejudice to a person&#8217;s dignity and created a 
hostile, degrading atmosphere against the Arab community and Muslims.&#8221;

of such illegal acts. 
</p>
<p>69. The Interdepartmental Commission for Combating Extremism in the Russian 
Federation was created in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 988 of 26 July 2011,

functionaries was determined as follows: &#8220;a State servant must be tolerant and shall respect </footnote>0 seminars and 30 training 
sessions directed at 2,515 imams and religious leaders had taken place. Similar initiatives 
were also being carried out by the Ministry of Education in schools across the country, and 
teachers had been sanctioned for discriminatory behaviour. Saudi Arabia had signed an 
accord with the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture in order to hold dialogues and 
train 40,000 imams to be increasingly tolerant in their religious addresses and activities.  
</p>
<p>74. Saudi Arabia reported that article 61 of the Labour Law prohibited slavery and the

conscience, religion and belief. It also guaranteed churches and religious societies an 
autonomous position independent of the Slovakian State authorities. Slovakia stated that 
incitement to violence on the basis of religion was criminalized under the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>77. Slovakia had adopted legislative measures to prevent expressions of hatred, 
intolerance and discrimination in such debates in the media. On-demand audiovisual media 
services and programme services must not in the manner of their presentation and content 
infringe the human dignity and the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, nor promote 
violence and overtly or covertly incite hatred, denigrate or defame on the basis of gender,

</p>
<p><b>  Spain  
</b></p>
<p>79. Spain recalled the provisions of its Constitution and other relevant legislation that 
protected the right to freedom of ideology and religion, including article16, paragraph 1, of 
the Constitution and article 14 on the right to equality and non-discrimination. The 
fundamental right to religious liberty was developed in Law 7/1980 on Religious Freedom. 
Relevant provisions in the Criminal Code relating to crimes committed on discriminatory 
grounds included the offence of incitement to hatred, violence or discrimination (art. 510); 
conspiracy to promote or incite hatred, violence or discrimination (art. 515.5); offences 
against freedom of conscience and religious feelings, or impeding or forcing specifically 
the practice of religious acts (art. 522); prevention or disruption of the acts of religious 
faiths (art. 523); acts of desecration in places of worship (art. 524); or violation or 
desecration of graves or corpses (art. 526). Article 22.4 provided for a generic aggravating

</p>
<p>80. Other relevant legal provisions guaranteeing freedom of religion included Organic 
Law 4/2000 on the Rights and Freedoms of Aliens in Spain and their Social Integration

Education emphasized that special attention should be paid to respecting diversity as a 
fundamental principle (art. 4). The Law on Political Parties established that a party would 
be declared illegal if its activity infringed democratic principles, including by promoting 
persecution against people on the basis of ideology, religion, belief, nationality or race (art. 
9). 
81. Spain also outlined further institutional arrangements, policies and measures to 
combat intolerance on the basis of religion or belief, including the Advisory Commission 
on Religious Freedom, which was founded in 1981. A sub-branch had been established 
within the Directorate General for International Legal Cooperation and Relations of the 
Ministry of Justice to deal with relations with confessions.  </p>


<p><b>  Switzerland 
</b></p>
<p>82. Switzerland reported that the Federal Constitution guaranteed to all persons residing 
in Switzerland freedom of conscience and belief, and that the practice of religion, its 
transmission to others and freedom to join at any time any religious community or 
withdraw from it, were guaranteed as fundamental rights. Everyone was free, in compliance 
with the Civil Code, to create a religious community, provided that it was a private 
association with legal personality (art. 23).  
83. There were also measures to promote a domestic climate of religious tolerance, 
peace and respect. Switzerland stated that the cantons had, especially in the field of 
education, carried out projects with two umbrella Jewish organizations &#8212; the Swiss 
Federation of Jewish Communities (SIG) and the Platform of Liberal Jews in Switzerland 
(PJLS). Between 2001 and 2012, the Department for the Fight against Racism (SLR) had 
supported 58 projects to raise awareness about anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.  
84. In November 2009, the initiative Against the construction of minarets was approved  
by voters (57.5 per cent in favour and 42.5 per cent against). It reported that the vote was at 
the forefront of the question of relations between the majority society and religious 
minorities. A new paragraph under article 72 of the Federal Constitution (BV) had 
reintroduced a provision at the federal level for the first time since the repeal of the article 
in 2001. In that context, federal authorities had launched, in 2009, a dialogue with the 
Muslim population in order to fight against fear and stigma surrounding Islam and to 
discuss issues of integration.  
</p>
<p>85. Since 2006, various federal councillors had held regular exchanges with the Swiss 
Council of Religions (le Conseil suisse des religions (SCR)), a platform which brought 
together representatives of the three Abrahamic religious communities. Similarly, 
interreligious dialogue was taking place between Jewish and Christian communities and 
Muslim associations.  
</p>
<p>86. Switzerland stated that it was convinced that existing international provisions were 
sufficient to effectively fight against incitement to racial hatred. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p>87. Ukraine reported that active cooperation between State authorities and religious 
organizations, as well as interconfessional associations was well developed. Collaborative 
networks to build mutual understanding, promote dialogue and inspire constructive joint 
action towards shared values had been established.  
</p>
<p>88. As of October 2012, the Commission for the Realization of Rights of Religious 
Organizations (under the Cabinet of Ministers) had been revived. The Commission was a 
temporary advisory and consultative body that focused on the coordination of State 
authorities in the sphere of religious organizations, their rights and formulation of proposals 
on State policy towards religious tolerance, peace and mutual respect.  
</p>
<p>89. On 26 March 2013, the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious 
Organizations had declared its official statement to the Government and Parliament with 
respect to the draft law on Introduction of Amendments to Some Legislative Acts for

religious preferences&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>91. Ukraine reported that the commission of the acts enumerated in article 161 of the 
Criminal Code (&#8220;violation of citizens equality on the grounds of their race, nationality or 
religion&#8221;) was considered as an aggravating circumstance and gave rise to more severe 
penalties. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>92. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland indicated that 1,621 
religious hate crimes had been reported to the police in 2011-12, which comprised 4 per 
cent of the total reported hate crimes. It explained that the general underreporting of hate 
crime was partly due to reluctance to go to the police directly. It also reported that 566 
religiously aggravated offences were prosecuted in 2010-11, of which 472 (83 per cent) 
resulted in successful outcomes. That constituted a 94.2 per cent increase in convictions 
compared to the previous year. 
</p>
<p>93. Religiously aggravated offences were defined in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. 
Section 145 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 placed a general duty on courts to treat more 
seriously any offence that could be shown to be racially or religiously aggravated or 
motivated. Under the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, an offence was committed 
where a person used threatening words or behaviour in order to stir up religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>94. In 2012, the Government had published its hate crime strategy, Challenge it, Report 
it, Stop it, aimed at reducing the harm caused by hate crime, including religiously motivated 
hate crime, and at improving published data. The Government was currently reviewing the 
progress on the recommendations and expected to publish the results in 2014. 
Implementation of the strategy had included: the development and publication of guidance 
for police and prosecutors on handling hate crime cases; the inclusion of hate crime data, 
including religion, within the National Crime Statistics; and offering financial and other 
support to a range of civil society organizations to act as links between victims and the 
police. The police had developed a web facility called True Vision (www.report-it.org.uk), 
which provided information to victims of crime and professionals, and allowed victims and 
advocates to report hate crimes directly to the police through an online reporting facility.  
</p>
<p>95. The United Kingdom indicated wider Government actions aimed at tackling 
religious hatred, including guidance to help newspaper editors tackle online hatred; 
supporting the Anne Frank Trust; funding the Holocaust Memorial Day; and establishing 
cross-Government working groups on anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred to further 
explore what could be done.  
</p>
<p>96. The United Kingdom stated that it welcomed self-reporting by all States on all forms 
of religious intolerance, as an important way of building trust, and that it was important that 
State reporting be credible and comprehensive. It also stated that, given that States had the 
ultimate responsibility to protect and promote human rights, it believed that it was 
important that reporting on religious intolerance be a State-led process. The action plan set 
out in Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 highlighted a number of important areas for 
all States to work on.  
</p>
<p><b>  United States of America  
</b></p>
<p>97. The United States of America reported that the First Amendment to the United 
States Constitution, applicable to state and local governments under the Fourteenth </p>


<p>Amendment of the Constitution, provided that Congress shall make no law respecting an 
establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom 
of speech. Freedom of thought and conscience was protected by the guarantee of freedom 
of speech and opinion. Federal Government action that substantially burdened religious 
exercise could be invalidated by the judiciary, unless the action was the least restrictive 
means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. 
</p>
<p>98. It added that federal law prohibited discrimination on the basis of religion in 
education, employment, housing, public accommodations and access to public facilities 
(Civil Rights Act 1964), and that the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice 
enforced those statutes, including through a Special Counsel for Religious Discrimination. 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated allegations of religious 
discrimination in employment.  
</p>
<p>99. The Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice was available to 
state, local and tribal jurisdictions to help prevent and resolve racial and ethnic conflict and 
employ strategies to prevent and respond to alleged violent hate crimes committed on the 
basis of actual or perceived race, colour, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual 
orientation, religion or disability. The Service had developed a set of &#8220;best practices&#8221; to 
assist localities in preventing hate crimes and restoring harmony in communities.  
</p>
<p>100. The President of the United States and other officials had embraced their role in 
speaking out against intolerance. Civil society leaders, including religious leaders, regularly 
spoke out against intolerance. Various efforts had been made to promote interfaith dialogue 
and unity in the United States. 
</p>
<p>101. A new Office of Faith-based Community Initiatives had been created in the State 
Department. The State Department and the White House co-chaired a Working Group on 
Religion and Foreign Policy, which included a Subgroup on International Religious 
Freedom, Stability and Democracy, through which it engaged national and foreign civil 
society representatives to advance religious freedom and foster mutual respect for diversity. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b>102. <b>Based on the information provided by States on the efforts and measures taken 
by them for the implementation of the action plan outlined in paragraphs 6 and 7 of 
Human Rights Council resolution 22/31, the steps taken by States are largely policy-
oriented or legal in nature, with many of them enshrining protection against 
discrimination on the basis of religion or belief in national constitutions, criminal 
codes and other civil laws. Advocacy of incitement to hatred is for the most part 
criminalized and often prohibited on several grounds, including religion or belief.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Some States noted the importance of speaking out against intolerance, 
including advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence, and indicated that their political and religious leadership, often at 
the very highest level, had done and continued to do so. It was also noted that freedom 
of expression and opinion was important to countering religious intolerance, including 
hate speech.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Several States noted the importance of tackling extremism and certain 
practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Extremism and radicalization, 
often leading to hate crimes and violence, were being addressed through social 
cohesion and integration programmes, police and security responses, often coupled </b></p>


<p><b>with regular engagement and interaction with grassroots communities and young 
people, as well as data gathering and monitoring.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Almost all of the States that responded provide for a channel or some form of 
communication and consultation between religious groups and communities and 
government authorities. Numerous practical examples were forwarded about 
communication bodies and/or forums between State institutions and religious groups 
or communities, with regard to policing and security matters, or as general forums of 
exchange. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Intolerance, stigmatization, negative stereotyping and discrimination, in 
particular, are addressed through public information and media campaigns and 
awareness-raising and educational measures. States are also funding local and 
national projects aimed at capacity-building, social cohesion, interfaith dialogue and 
the activities of religious groups and communities.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Most States reported that generally there was religious freedom and pluralism 
domestically and that members of religious groups and communities were able to 
manifest their religion and contribute openly and on an equal footing in society. Such 
religious freedom is often guaranteed by constitutional regimes and laws, so long as it 
is in accordance with domestic law. Several responses referred to the domestic legal 
frameworks providing for the practice of religion and the status, functioning and 
management of religious communities and associations. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>A few of the responses expressed views on potential follow-up measures for 
further improvement of the implementation of the action plan outlined in paragraphs 
6 and 7 of the resolution.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>It was noted that Human Rights Council resolution 22/31 was a step in the 
process. Views were expressed that, while some work had been undertaken by the 
international community, through the Istanbul Process and OHCHR, to strengthen 
the plan, the issue of freedom of religion and belief and incitement to hatred required 
further collaboration by and attention from the international community, particularly 
through the adoption of measures to establish a normative standard, including 
possibly by criminalizing incitement to violence based on religion or belief. Views 
were also expressed that, as the issues concerning freedom of religion and belief are 
transboundary, collective and cooperative action by countries and with relevant 
stakeholders, including OHCHR, is required.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Concern was expressed about religiously motivated violence and intolerance 
and restrictions on religious freedom around the world. The solution lies in action at 
the national level, particularly to protect the rights of religious groups and minorities, 
as well as through international cooperation. Credible and comprehensive reporting 
by all States on all forms of religious intolerance, especially in view of Council 
resolution 16/18, was noted as very important, and reporting on religious intolerance 
was considered a State-led process. It was recalled that people, not belief systems, 
were the subjects of human rights and that in combating intolerance, the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights should support the implementation of freedom of 
opinion and expression, as well as freedom of religion and belief.
