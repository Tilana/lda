In certain cases, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as "plans", "expects" or 
"does not expect", "is expected", "budget", "scheduled", "estimates", "forecasts", "intends", "anticipates" or "does 
not  anticipate",  or  "believes",  or  variations  of  such  words  and  phrases  or  state  that  certain  actions,  events  or 
results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will be taken", "occur" or "be achieved" suggesting future outcomes, or 
other  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions,  intentions  or  statements  about  future  events  or 
performance. Forward-looking information contained in this MD&A is based on certain factors and assumptions 
regarding,  among  other  things,  the  estimation  of  mineral  reserves  and  resources,  the  realization  of  resource 
estimates,  iron  ore  and  other  metal  prices,  the  timing  and  amount  of  future  exploration  and  development 
expenditures, the estimation of initial and sustaining capital requirements, the estimation of labour and operating 
costs, the availability of necessary financing and materials to continue to explore and develop the Kami Property 
(as defined below) in the short- and long-term, the progress of exploration and development activities, the receipt 
of  necessary  regulatory  approvals,  the  estimation  of  insurance  coverage,  and  assumptions  with  respect  to 
currency fluctuations, environmental risks, title disputes or claims, and other similar matters. While the Company 
considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, these assumptions 
may prove to be incorrect.

Description of business and overview 
 
Alderon is a development-stage company conducting iron ore evaluation activities related entirely to its Canadian 
properties  located  in  western  Labrador  in  the  province  of  Newfoundland  &  Labrador.  Those  properties  are 
collectively referred to as the Kamistiatusset, or “Kami”, Property. All activities associated with the Kami Property 
are referred to as the Kami Project. 
 
The  Company’s  common  shares  are  listed  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  (“TSX”),  under  the  symbol  “ADV”.  
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company voluntarily withdrew its common shares from listing on 
the NYSE MKT to simplify its administrative requirements and to reduce listing fees and legal and administrative 
costs associated with the listing of the common shares on two separate stock exchanges.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
The Kami Project 
 
Alderon is focused on developing its core asset, the Kami Property, which is located next to the mining towns of 
Wabush and Labrador City in western Labrador, Canada. The Kami Property is surrounded by two producing 
mines and is within close proximity to a common carrier railway that is connected to deep sea ports with year-
round access to the global market. The Company’s goal is to develop the Kami Property into a profitable mining 
operation and to become a producer of low-cost iron concentrate by taking advantage of the Kami Property’s 
strategic location and of the readily available regional infrastructure. 
 
For  technical  information  related  to  the  Kami  Project,  reference  should  be  made  to  the  Company’s  Technical 
Report, entitled Feasibility Study of the Rose Deposit and Resource Estimate for the Mills Lake Deposit of the 
Kamistiatusset  (Kami)  Iron  Ore  Property,  Labrador  for  Alderon  Iron  Ore  Corp.,  (the  “Feasibility  Study”),  dated 
effective December 17, 2012 and filed on January 16, 2013, on SEDAR (accessible at www.sedar.com) and the 
Company’s Annual Report. The Feasibility Study has not been updated from its effective date. Since the effective 
date  of  the  Feasibility  Study,  certain  technical  and  financial  parameters  and  inputs  have  changed  and  the 
Company has revised the expected timing of certain key project milestones. In addition, during this period Alderon 
has completed detailed engineering. 
 
Recent developments 
 
From January 1, 2010, through to June 30, 2016, the Company has incurred a cumulative total of $160.5 million 
related to the Kami Project. These costs include $65.5 million of exploration and evaluation expenditures and $6.6 
million  in  project  maintenance  expenditures  which  have  been  accounted  for  as  expenses  in  the  consolidated 
statements of comprehensive loss and  $88.4 million in development costs which have been accounted for as 
additions to mineral properties in the consolidated statement of financial position. A description of the nature of the 
project maintenance expenses is detailed in the discussion under the heading “Results of operations – Project 
maintenance expenses” below. 
 
On August 11, 2015, the Company announced that it would work with Hebei to re-scope the capital and operating 
costs of the Kami Project in order to identify savings that have arisen from the current depressed state of the 
market and changes in ownership and management of assets in the Labrador Trough, and evaluating strategic 
alternatives for the Company.  The re-scoping exercise is ongoing and consists of a technical analysis, the re-
negotiation of existing commercial agreements and the negotiation of new commercial agreements. 
 
Corporate activities 
 
Strategic investment from Hebei (the “Strategic Investment”) 
 
On March 15, 2013, Hebei and Alderon completed the Strategic Investment in which Hebei contributed $119.9 
million (the “Initial Investment”) into The Kami Mine Limited Partnership (“The Kami LP”) for 25% interest in the 
Kami Project and Alderon contributed the Kami Property and its related assets into The Kami LP for 75% interest 
in the Kami Project. Alderon and Hebei are required to contribute to capital expenditures for the development of 
the Kami Project not covered by initial capital contributions and project debt financing, in accordance with their 
respective  interests.  However,  Hebei’s  further  contributions  to  The  Kami  LP  will  depend  upon  the  amount  of 
aggregate proceeds received as project debt financing and will not exceed $220.0 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Engineering Procurement and Construction Management (“EPCM”) services agreement  
 
A  formal,  comprehensive  EPCM  services  agreement  (the  “EPCM  Agreement”)  with  WorleyParsons  Canada 
Services  Ltd.  (“WorleyParsons”)  was  executed  effective  April  30,  2013.  On  June  30,  2014,  the  Company 
announced that it had completed the required pre-construction engineering on the Kami Project and as such has 
temporarily  suspended  any  further  work  by  WorleyParsons.  Alderon’s  internal  project  team  took  over  the 
management  of  all  works  in  progress  to  continue  advancing  the  Kami  Project  in  preparation  for  the  start  of 
construction, once the Company’s financing plan (as discussed below) is concluded. As a result of the temporary 
suspension of WorleyParsons, certain demobilization costs were incurred in accordance with the terms of the 
EPCM Agreement. As at June 30, 2016, the Company has accrued $3.3 million in demobilization costs.  
 
Debt financing 
 
Alderon is pursuing a financing strategy for the Kami Project based on a combination of a senior debt facility (the 
“Senior  Debt  Facility”),  other  debt  options,  equipment  financing,  and  equity.  In  order  to  provide  flexibility  and 
maximize its financing options, Alderon intends to pursue the Senior Debt Facility and its other debt and equity 
options  in  parallel.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company  will  successfully  conclude  the  Senior  Debt 
Facility or any of its financing plan. 
 
Convertible debt 
 
On February 24, 2014, Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC (“Liberty”) provided a loan (the “Liberty Note”) to 
The Kami LP in the amount of $22.0 million. $21.0 million of the gross proceeds of the Liberty Note was used to 
fund the first security deposit that is required by NLH in connection with the construction of the New Transmission 
Line. Commencing 12 months after the issuance of the Liberty Note, the principal amount of the Liberty Note and 
any accrued but unpaid interest, become convertible at Liberty’s option into the Company’s common shares at a 
conversion price equal to $2.376 per common share. The Liberty Note is secured with a mortgage over the Kami 
Project and bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum, payable on June 30th and December 31st of each year. The 
Company has the option to prepay the entire balance of the Liberty Note, at a premium of a 20% internal rate of 
return to Liberty. The maturity date of the Liberty Note is December 31, 2018. 
 
On December 8, 2014, Alderon and Liberty amended the Liberty Note (the “Amended Note”). Liberty agreed to 
defer the payments of the interest due on December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. The deferred interest was 
added to the principal amount of the Liberty Note and is subject to interest in accordance with the terms of the 
Amended Note. In consideration of such deferral, Liberty was issued on each deferred interest payment date a 
number of warrants determined by dividing the interest payable by a dollar amount equal to a 10% premium to the 
volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s common shares on the TSX for the five trading days 
prior to the applicable interest payment date. The Company issued to Liberty 1,987,083 warrants with an exercise 
price of $0.4465 on December 31, 2014 and 3,254,353 warrants with an exercise price of $0.279 on June 30, 
2015.  
 
During  the  six  month  period  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  accrued  and  paid  interest  in  the  amount  of 
$946,129 (2015 - $nil).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold land and building and paid the net proceeds 
in the amount of $92,804 to Liberty to reduce the principal outstanding on the Amended Note in consideration for 
Liberty releasing its security interest in the land and building. 
 
Cash conservation program  
 
On December 9, 2014, the Company announced a cash conservation program (the “Program”) designed to allow 
it to maintain sufficient liquidity during the advancement of its financing plan. The Program includes an interest 
deferral agreement with Liberty, voluntary partial payment deferrals with equipment vendors for work completed to 
date, workforce reductions and the implementation of the DSU Plan (as defined below) with respect to director 
fees  as  discussed  below  under  the  “Consolidated  statements  of  financial  position  information  -  DSU  liability” 
heading.

During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses in 
the  amount  of  $1.3  million  (2015  -  $3.2  million)  resulting  in  a  decrease  of  $1.9  million  which  reflects  the 
implementation of the Program.  Staff reductions resulted in a decrease of $0.7 million in salaries, wages and 
benefits.  The decrease in rent and facilities of $0.1 million is due to various office closures which occurred in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.  Legal, professional and consulting costs and other costs decreased by $0.2 million 
and $0.7 million respectively which is explained by reduced overall corporate activity as the Company continued 
to  attempt  to  conserve  cash.    During  the  six  month  period  ended  June  30,  2016,  share-based  compensation 
decreased by $0.04 million compared to the previous period as a result of the lower degree of vesting associated 
with stock options granted in prior periods.     
 
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses 
in  the  amount  of  $0.4  million  (2015  -  $1.5  million)  resulting  in  a  decrease  of  $1.1  million  which  reflects  the 
implementation of the Program.  Staff reductions resulted in a decrease of $0.5 million in salaries, wages and 
benefits.  During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized a recovery of salary, wages 
and benefits due to further employee departures and fair value adjustments to outstanding DSUs.  The decrease 
in rent and facilities of $0.06 million is due to various office closures which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2015.  Legal, professional and consulting costs remained consistent for the three month periods ended June 30, 
2016 and 2015.  Other costs decreased by $0.5 million which is explained by reduced overall corporate activity as 
the Company continued to attempt to conserve cash.   
 
It is the Company’s expectation that, consistent with the Program, total general and administrative expenses will 
be at lower levels for the year ending December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, 
excluding  the  impact  of  share-based  compensation  costs  which  in  turn  depends  on  a  number  of  unknown  or 
currently inestimable factors such as the number of options that will be granted in future periods and any changes 
to  parameters  or  judgments  applied  to  the  option  pricing  model  used  to  calculate  the  underlying  fair  value  of 
awards.

The Company started to capitalize costs directly attributable to the Kami Project as of February 1, 2013, which 
coincided with the release of the Feasibility Study. Generally, as of November 15, 2014, the Company ceased to 
incur development costs eligible for capitalization as Alderon was focused on the advancement of its financing 
plan  rather  than  the  development  of  the  Kami  Property.  Therefore,  most  of  Kami  Project  costs  incurred 
subsequent to November 15, 2014 have been recorded as project maintenance expenses in Alderon’s operating 
expenses as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization. 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred project maintenance expenses in the 
amount of $0.6 million (2015 - $1.4 million), resulting in a decrease of $0.8 million which reflects the temporary 
suspension of the Kami Project and the implementation of the Program.  During the six month period ended June 
30,  2016,  professional  services  and  consulting  costs  increased  slightly  by  $0.02  million  due  to  the  Company 
focusing on re-scoping the Kami Project during the period, as discussed under the heading “The Kami Project – 
Recent developments”.  The decreases in building rental and services and other costs each in the amount of $0.2 
million are explained by the closure of various site offices during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.  Staff reductions 
resulted in a decrease of $0.5 million in salaries, wages and benefits.  During the six month period ended June 30, 
2016, the Company realized a recovery of salaries, wages and benefits as a result of revised accrued liabilities.    
 
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred project maintenance expenses in the 
amount of $0.2 million (2015 - $0.4 million), resulting in a decrease of $0.2 million which reflects the temporary 
suspension of the Kami Project and the implementation of the Program.  During the three month period ended 
June 30, 2016, professional services and consulting costs increased slightly by $0.05 million due to the Company 
engaging consultants on various matters, including ensuring security of remote properties and translating project 
related communications.  The decreases in building rental and services and other costs in the amounts of $0.07 
million and $0.06 million respectively are explained by the closure of various site offices during the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2015.  Staff reductions resulted in a decrease of $0.08 million in salaries, wages and benefits.  During the 
three month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized a recovery of salaries, wages and benefits as a 
result of revised accrued liabilities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Foreign exchange loss (gain) 
 
The foreign exchange gains and losses recorded during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 
and 2015 reflect changes in the currency exchange rate between the US dollar compared to the Canadian dollar 
as  of  each  period  end  and  the  related  impact  on  US  dollar  denominated  liabilities  with  respect  to  equipment 
commitments.   
 
Net finance costs 
 
During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred net finance costs of $0.6 
million  and  $1.2  million  respectively  (2015  -  $0.5  million  and  $1.0  million  respectively).    The  increases  in  net 
finance costs in the amounts of $0.07 million and $0.2 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 
2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior year are due to both decreased finance income 
and increased finance costs. The decreased finance income and increased finance costs realized are a result of 
decreased cash and cash equivalents balances and an increased principal balance outstanding on the Amended 
Note, respectively.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Net loss per share is based on each reporting period’s weighted average number of shares outstanding, which 
may differ on a quarter-to-quarter basis. As such, the sum of the quarterly net loss per share amounts may not 
equal year-to-date net loss per share.  
 
Historical  quarterly  results  of  operations  and  net  loss  per  share  data  do  not  necessarily  reflect  any  recurring 
expenditure patterns or predictable trends. As such, quarterly results cannot be interpreted as being indicative of 
future expectations, results of operations or net loss per share.   
 
Quarterly loss from operations and net loss and comprehensive loss have generally decreased over the past eight 
quarters,  consistent  with  the  temporary  suspension  of  the  Kami  Project  and  the  implementation  of  the  cash 
conservation program, as discussed under the “Corporate activities” heading.  The increased loss from operations 
for  the  three  month  period  ended  September  30,  2015  is  due  to  previously  deferred  transaction  costs  in  the 
amount of $2.2 million which were expensed in the period on the basis that the timing of a future financing is 
uncertain.  The loss from operations for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 was the lowest of the past 
eight quarters; this is a result of continuing cost reductions in accordance with the Program.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
 
As noted below under the heading “Liquidity and capital resources”, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.6 
million during the six month period ended June 30, 2016, due largely to the cash used in operating activities and 
cash payments to Liberty with respect to the Amended Note. 
 
Restricted investments and short-term investments 
 
Restricted investments represent investments deposited with the Company’s bank to guarantee letters of credit 
issued in the course of the Company’s development activities. Such investments must remain on deposit as long 
as the letters of credit are outstanding.   As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, restricted investments 
relate  to  the  first  security  deposit  in  connection  with  the  Power  Purchase  Agreement  (the  “PPA”)  with 
Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro (“NLH”), a subsidiary of Nalcor Energy, to supply power to the Kami Project 
via a new transmission line. 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, short-term investments increased by $0.3 million as a result of 
investments maturing and the reinvestment of earned interest. 
 
Asset held for sale 
 
As of December 31, 2015, the balance of asset held for sale in the amount of $0.1 million related to land and 
building for which the Company received an offer to purchase the asset. During the six month period ended June 
30, 2016, the land and building were sold. 
 
Receivables and other current assets 
 
Receivables and other current assets include sales tax credits receivable, interest receivable, other receivables 
and  prepaid  expenses.    The  total  balance  of  receivables  and  other  current  assets  decreased  by  $0.2  million 
during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 as a result of a decrease in receivables of $0.4 million which 
was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.1 million.  Total receivables decreased due to the 
receipt of sales tax and accrued interest income during the six month period ended June 30, 2016.  The increase 
in prepaid expenses during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 related to the prepayment of administrative 
fees associated with the bank guaranteed letters of credit discussed above.  
 
Mineral properties 
 
As discussed above, under the “Results of operations – Project maintenance expenses” heading, Alderon started 
to capitalize development costs incurred in relation to the Kami Project as of February 1, 2013. Generally, as of 
November 15, 2014, the Company ceased to incur development costs eligible for capitalization as Alderon was 
focused  on  the  advancement  of  its  financing  plan  rather  than  the  development  of  the  Kami  Property.  
Development costs capitalized to mineral properties will only increase significantly once the Company’s financing 
plan is in place and the Company commences construction of the Kami Project. 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, mineral properties increased by $0.2 million as a result of the 
renewal of mining and surface rights leases.
11
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
 
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, property, plant and equipment consisted of construction in progress 
in the amount of $28.9 million and related to advances paid or accrued on equipment. 
 
Long-term advance 
 
The long-term advance in the amount of $20.5 million relates to the initial commitment paid by the Company to the 
Sept-Îles Port Authority (the “Port Authority”) with respect to an agreement with the Port Authority to secure usage 
of a new multi-user deep water dock facility that the Port Authority is constructing.  The advance constitutes an 
advance on Alderon’s future shipping fees. The Buy-in Payment will be reimbursed to the Company via a discount 
that  will  be  applied  to  shipping  fees  to  be  billed  by  the  Port  once  Alderon’s  usage  of  the  multi-user  facility 
commences. Once the new multi-user dock facility is operational, the Company has a take or pay obligation based 
on a discounted rate applied on 50% of the 8,000,000 tons minimum annual shipping capacity and is payable 
even if Alderon does not use the facilities.  
 
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, the Port Authority provided notice to the Company that the 
new multi-user dock facility is operational. The Port Authority is engaged in negotiations will all the users of the 
multi-user dock facility (including the Company) in order to develop a satisfactory arrangement with respect to 
take or pay obligations. The Company is involved in these negotiations but at this time cannot provide certainty 
regarding  what  any  arrangement  will  encompass.  The  Company  intends  to  work  collaboratively  with  the  Port 
Authority but it has also provided notice that there are certain factors that indicate that the multi-user dock facility 
is not yet operational. 
   
Payables and accrued liabilities 
 
Payables and accrued liabilities decreased by $0.4 million during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 which 
primarily  relates  to  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  on  accrued  equipment  purchases  ($0.3  million)  and  the 
reduction in trade accounts payable ($0.1 million) due to the timing of payments. 
 
Due to related parties 
 
As of June 30, 2016, amounts due to related parties increased by $0.04 million compared to the balance as of 
December 31, 2015.  The increase in amounts due to related parties is due to amounts accrued for services 
provided by HBIS International Holding (Canada) Co., Ltd.  Refer to “Related party transactions” below. 
 
Convertible debt 
 
As discussed above under the “Corporate activities - Convertible debt” heading, the Company entered into the 
Liberty Note which amounted to $22.0 million. The Liberty Note is a compound instrument composed of both a 
debt component and an equity component. The equity component is due to the embedded derivatives identified in 
the  agreement  with  respect  to  Liberty’s  conversion  option  and  the  Company’s  early  repayment  option. 
Management has determined that the fair value of the debt component at inception was $18.3 million with the 
residual value of $3.4 million allocated to the equity component, net of transaction costs of $0.3 million.
12
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
On December 8, 2014, Alderon and Liberty amended the Liberty Note to defer cash interest payments that were 
due on December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. The Company  issued to Liberty 1,987,083 warrants, with an 
exercise price of $0.4465, on December 31, 2014 and 3,254,353 warrants, with an exercise price of $0.279, on 
June 30, 2015. The fair value of these warrants ($0.8 million) was accounted for as additional financing costs of 
the Liberty Note.  
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the balance of convertible debt increased by $0.4 million as a 
result of non-cash accretion expense of $0.5 million, net of a partial principal repayment of $0.1 million.  During 
the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold land and building and subsequently paid the net 
proceeds of the sale to Liberty in consideration for Liberty releasing its security interest in the land and building. 
 
Deferred share unit (“DSU”) liability 
 
The  Company  has  in  place  a  program  (the  “DSU  Plan”)  whereby  Directors  are  issued  DSUs,  which  vest 
immediately, are equivalent in value to a common share upon issuance of the Company, and are settled in cash. 
Directors have the option to convert 25, 50, 75 or 100 percent of their annual director fees into DSUs. To support 
the Program, the Directors agreed to convert 100 percent of their annual director fees into DSUs as of September 
30, 2014 through to March 31, 2016. Effective April 1, 2016, the Directors agree to convert 50 percent of their 
annual director fees into DSUs. 
 
As  of  June  30,  2016,  Alderon  has  issued  4,201,751  DSUs  to  directors  of  the  Company.  DSUs  can  only  be 
redeemed following departure from the Company in accordance with the terms of the DSU Plan. 
 
The carrying value of the DSU liability is based on the number of DSUs outstanding and the closing share price of 
the Company’s common shares as of each period end. 
 
As of June 30, 2016, the balance of the current deferred share unit liability consists of amounts accrued to retired 
directors of the Company in the amount of $180,347 (December 31, 2015 - $nil) as these amounts are expected 
to  be  paid  within  twelve  months  of  the  statement  of  financial  position  date.  The  balance  of  the  non-current 
deferred share unit liability consists of amounts accrued to current directors of the Company in the amount of 
$323,863 (December 31, 2015 - $286,509) as these amounts are not expected to be paid within the next twelve 
months. 
 
Equity attributable to owners of the parent 
 
Equity attributable to owners of the parent decreased by $1.3 million during the six month period ended June 30, 
2016 as a result of the net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to the parent for the period. 
 
No distributions or cash dividends were made or declared during the six month period ended June 30, 2016. 
 
Non-controlling interest 
 
Non-controlling interest represents Hebei’s 25% interest in the equity of the Company’s less than wholly-owned 
affiliate, The Kami LP, and is classified as a separate component of equity. On initial recognition, non-controlling 
interest, which represents Hebei’s $119.9 million contribution into The Kami LP, was measured at fair value.
13
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in The Kami LP that do not result in a loss of control are recorded 
as equity transactions. The carrying amount of non-controlling interest decreased by $1.4 million during the six 
month period ended June 30, 2016 as a result of the net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to The Kami 
LP. 
 
Liquidity and capital resources 
 
Consolidated statements of cash flows information 
 
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $11.2 million, as compared to $13.9 million 
as of December 31, 2015, and a working capital surplus (total current assets less total current liabilities) of $2.5 
million, as compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2015. 
 
The decrease in working capital surplus of $2.6 million during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 is due to 
decreases in cash and cash equivalents ($2.6 million), asset held for sale ($0.1 million) and receivables ($0.4 
million) and an increase the current portion of the deferred share unit liability ($0.2 million), which were partially 
offset by increases in short-term investments ($0.3 million) and prepaid expenses ($0.1 million) and a decrease in 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($0.4 million).  Refer to the “Consolidated statements of financial position 
information” section of this MD&A for further discussion of account balance changes during the six month period 
ended June 30, 2016.   
 
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to 
operating and financing activities.  Cash used in operating activities during the six month period ended June 30, 
2016 amounted to $1.2 million, as discussed above under the heading “Results of operations”.  Net cash used in 
investing  activities  amounted  to  $0.4  million  and  related  to  additions  to  mineral  properties  ($0.2  million)  and 
reinvestment of interest income received ($0.3 million), net of proceeds received on the sale of land and building 
($0.1 million).  Cash used in financing activities of $1.0 million related to an interest payment ($0.9 million) and a 
principal repayment ($0.1 million) on the Amended Note, as discussed under the “Consolidated statements of 
financial position information – Convertible debt” heading. 
 
During the six month period ended June 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $4.9 million which is 
primarily explained by cash used in operating activities of $4.1 million, as discussed above under the heading 
“Results of operations”.  Net cash used in investing activities of $0.8 million included development expenditures of 
$1.0 million, net of restricted investment changes of $0.2 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
A summary of cash flows by activity is summarized below.
Net cash used in operating activities 
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
Net cash used in financing activities 
 
Net change in cash and cash equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 
 
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period
Cash used in operating activities represents net loss and excludes the impact of any non-cash transactions, such 
as the recording of accretion of the Amended Note, share-based and DSU compensation costs, and depreciation 
expense  and  impairment  losses  in  relation  to  property,  plant  and  equipment.  Additionally,  net  cash  used  in 
operating activities reflects any changes in components of working capital, such as receivables and payables, 
which fluctuate in a manner that does not necessarily reflect predictable patterns for the overall use of cash, the 
generation  of  which  depends  almost  entirely  on  sources  of  external  financing  to  fund  our  evaluation  and 
development initiatives and other expenses. 
 
Cash used in investing activities primarily represents cash development costs that have been capitalized, changes 
in restricted and unrestricted investments and advances made to suppliers of equipment, as discussed above in 
“Consolidated statements of financial position information”.  
 
Cash  used  in  financing  activities  reflects  activities  with  respect  to  the  Amended  Note,  as  discussed  above  in 
“Consolidated statements of financial position information” and “Corporate activities – Convertible debt”. 
 
As at June 30, 2016, $9.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.0 million in short-term investments are held 
by The Kami LP which is the remaining amount of the Initial Investment. Under the terms of the agreements with 
Hebei, Alderon has agreed that the proceeds from the Initial Investment would be used solely for Kami Project 
related expenditures. As a result, Alderon is restricted from transferring this cash from The Kami LP to the parent 
company (Alderon Iron Ore Corp.). Currently this restriction does not have an effect on Alderon’s ability to meet its 
short- to medium-term obligations as Alderon held $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as at June 30, 2016; 
however, Alderon will need to obtain additional financing at the parent company level in the future. See below 
under the headings, “Financial instruments and risk management – Liquidity risk” and “Risk factors”. 
 
To date, the Company has not recorded any revenues from operations, has no source of operating cash flow and 
no  assurance  that  additional  funding  will  be  available  to  it  for  further  development  of  the  Kami  Project.  The 
Company has $12.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and unrestricted short-term investments. The Company 
currently does not have sufficient financial resources to cover all of its planned commitments and as a result, it 
has  split  its  purchase  orders  for  equipment  into  two  phases,  engineering  and  manufacturing.  Advances  for 
engineering have been paid in full while commitments for manufacturing and fabrication, estimated at $7.9 million 
for the next twelve months and $22.5 million for the following 12 months, remain contingent upon the Company 
issuing to its suppliers a notice to proceed following successful completion of its financing plan.
15
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
In addition, the Company is committed to paying its amounts payable ($10.0 million) as at June 30, 2016, of which 
certain amounts therein become due once financing is obtained.  Necessary general and administrative costs are 
projected at approximately $3.3 million over the next twelve months, including key management personnel ($1.6 
million), audit, tax, legal and other professional services ($0.4 million), building rental and storage ($0.6 million), 
property  claims  maintenance  ($0.2  million)  and  other  corporate  and  regulatory  costs  ($0.5  million).    Interest 
payments on the Amended Note total $1.9 million over the next twelve months. 
 
The Company could be required to advance up to $44.0 million to NLH as of a date to be determined to support 
continued construction of a new transmission line to supply power to the Kami Project.  However, NLH has halted 
construction;  and  construction  of  the  remaining  portion  of  the  new  transmission  line  will  proceed  once  the 
Company secures its project financing for the Kami Project.  
 
Despite the actions taken by the Company, these conditions and events indicate material uncertainties that cast 
doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has plans in place and is seeking 
to arrange the necessary funds in order to cover these obligations. While the Company has been successful in the 
past in obtaining necessary funds on terms acceptable to the Company, there is no assurance that such funds will 
be  available  in  the  future.  If  management  is  unable  to  obtain  new  funding,  the  Company  may  be  unable  to 
continue its operations, and amounts realized for assets might be less than amounts reflected in the consolidated 
financial statements.  
 
As discussed in the “Outlook for 2016” section below, the Company does not currently have sufficient resources to 
fund the construction of the Kami Project. In order to obtain the necessary funds the Company plans to conclude 
the Senior Debt Facility and issue equity instruments as discussed further in the section below. The Company will 
not be able to commence the construction of the Kami Project until the funds are obtained. 
 
Outlook for 2016 
 
As  noted  above  under  the  “Corporate  activities”  heading,  the  Company  has  completed  the  required  pre-
construction engineering on the Kami Project and is ready for construction. The delay in the completion of the 
financing has led to the Company implementing the Program which will allow it to maintain sufficient liquidity while 
it  continues  to  advance  its  financing  plan.  During  2016,  Alderon  will  focus  on  the  re-scope  of  the  capital  and 
operating costs of the Kami Project in order to identify savings resulting from the current market conditions and 
changes of ownership and management of assets in the Labrador Trough. The re-scoping process should result 
in  revised  project  economics  for  the  Kami  Project  that  will  make  it  more  attractive  for  potential  lenders  and 
investors.  Alderon will use the results of the re-scoping process to further its goal of completing its financing plan. 
As discussed above, the overall project financing strategy likely will take the form of a combination of debt and 
equity instruments. 
 
As previously disclosed, Alderon intends to commence construction of the Kami Project when the Company’s 
financing plan is successfully completed, including the closing of the Senior Debt Facility. The completion of the 
financing plan has taken longer than anticipated. Once the financing plan is completed and following tree clearing, 
full-scale construction will commence and is expected to take 32 months for completion, including pre-operational 
verifications, hot commissioning and handover to mine operations team.

Related party transactions  
 
A  related  party  is  any  person,  including  close  members  of  that  person’s  family,  or  entity  that  has  significant 
influence over the Company. Related parties also include members of our key management personnel—namely, 
those  persons  having  authority  and  responsibility  for  planning,  directing  and  controlling  the  activities  of  the 
Company,  directly  or  indirectly,  including  any  director  (whether  executive  or  otherwise)  of  the  Company. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity, but is 
not control over those policies. Significant influence may be gained by share ownership, statute or agreement. A 
transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations 
between related parties. 
 
Key management personnel 
 
Key management personnel include those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and 
controlling  the  activities  of  the  Company  as  a  whole.  The  Company  has  determined  that  key  management 
personnel  consists  of  executive  and  non-executive  members  of  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  corporate 
officers,  including  the  Company’s  Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”),  Chief  Operating  Officer  (“COO”)  and  Chief 
Financial  Officer  (“CFO”),  as  well  as  any  Vice  Presidents  reporting  directly  to  a  Corporate  Executive  Board 
member or officer, acting in that capacity.

& Bay personnel and for overhead and third party costs incurred by King & Bay on behalf of the Company. 
 
Liberty: Liberty is a significant shareholder of the Company and is entitled to a representative on Alderon’s Board 
of Directors. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Liberty provided the Company with the Liberty Note that 
was used to fund the first security deposit that is required by Nalcor in connection with the construction of the New 
Transmission Line. The Liberty Note has an interest rate of 8% per annum.  Transactions with Liberty in 
connection with the Liberty Note and the subsequent amendments are discussed under the “Corporate activities - 
Convertible debt” heading. The Company entered into this related party transaction because alternate sources of 
financing were unavailable at the time due to the short time period that the Company had to fund the first security 
deposit required by NLH.  During the six month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company accrued and paid 
interest and made a principal repayment to Liberty, as discussed in “Consolidated statements of financial position 
information – Convertible debt”.

Commitments and contingencies 
 
In  connection  with  the  2010  purchase  from  Altius  Resources  Inc.  (“Altius”)  of  the  Kami  Property,  Alderon 
committed to paying Altius a 3% gross royalty on iron ore concentrate that is generated from the Kami Project. 
 
In connection with the Strategic Investment, Hebei agreed to purchase, upon the commencement of commercial 
production, 60% of the actual annual production from the Kami Project up to a maximum of 4.8 million tonnes of 
the first 8.0 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate produced annually at the Kami Project. The price paid by Hebei 
will be based on the Platts Iron Ore Index (“Platts Price”), including additional quoted premium for iron content 
greater than 62%, less a discount equal to 5% of such quoted price. Hebei also will have the option to purchase 
additional tonnages at a price equal to the Platts Price, without any such discount. 
 
On July 29, 2014, The Kami LP entered into an off-take agreement (the “Glencore Agreement”) with a subsidiary 
of Glencore plc (“Glencore”), with respect to an off-take transaction pursuant to which Glencore will acquire all of 
actual annual production from the Kami Project that has not been allocated to Hebei. Under the terms of the 
Glencore Agreement, Glencore will be obligated to purchase upon the commencement of commercial production, 
40% of the actual annual production from the Kami Project up to a maximum of 3.2 million tonnes of the first 8.0 
million tonnes of iron ore concentrate produced annually at the Kami Project. The term of the Glencore Agreement 
will continue until The Kami LP has delivered 48.0 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate to Glencore, which is 
expected to be 15 years after the commencement of commercial production. The market price paid by Glencore 
will be based on the Platts Price, including additional quoted premium for iron content greater than 62%, less a 
discount equal to 2% of such quoted price. 
 
As discussed above, as part of Alderon’s strategy to source the long-lead mining and processing equipment in 
sufficient time to adhere to the Kami Project’s schedule, the Company has negotiated contracts with suppliers in 
relation to the purchase of equipment. As at June 30, 2016, payments of $30.4 million remain to be paid on the 
equipment for contracts entered into and approximately $30.2 million of this amount is contingent on confirmation 
by the Company of notice to proceed with fabrication of this equipment.

As noted above, under the terms of the agreement with NLH, the Company has provided $21.0 million in security 
deposits to NLH and has agreed to provide an additional $44.0 million in security deposits in the future. At this 
point, the Company does not know the timing of these security deposits.  
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 
As of June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
Significant accounting policies and critical estimates and judgments 
 
Significant accounting policies 
 
A  complete  summary  of  our  significant  accounting  policies  is  provided  in  note  2  to  the  consolidated  financial 
statements of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.  
 
Critical accounting estimates and judgments 
 
The preparation of the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
requires management to make estimates about and apply assumptions to future events and other matters that 
affect the reported amounts of the Company’s assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures. Assumptions 
and estimates are based on historical experience, expectations, current trends and other factors that management 
believes to be relevant at the time at which the Company’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements 
are prepared. Management reviews, on  a regular basis, the Company’s accounting policies, assumptions and 
estimates in order to ensure that the condensed interim consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and 
in accordance with IFRS. 
 
Critical accounting estimates are those that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment and are often 
applied  to  matters  or  outcomes  that  are  inherently  uncertain  and  subject  to  change.  As  such,  management 
cautions  that  future  events  often  vary  from  forecasts  and  expectations  and  that  estimates  routinely  require 
adjustment. The significant judgments made by the Company in applying accounting policies and the key sources 
of  estimation  uncertainty  were  the  same  as  those  that  applied  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the 
Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 
Capital disclosures 
 
The Company’s objective in managing capital, consisting of equity, with cash being its primary component, is to 
ensure  sufficient  liquidity  to  fund:  development  and  other  Kami  Project  activities;  general  and  administrative 
expenses; working capital; and capital expenditures. 
 
Management regularly monitors the Company’s capital structure and makes adjustments thereto based on funds 
available to the Company for the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. The Board of 
Directors has not established quantitative return on capital criteria for capital management, but rather relies upon 
the expertise of the management team to sustain the future development of the business.

(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
The properties in which the Company currently has an interest are in the development stage, and the Company 
does not generate any revenue. Accordingly, the Company is dependent upon sources of external financing to 
fund  both  the  Kami  Project  and  its  other  costs.  While  the  Company  endeavours  to  minimize  dilution  to  its 
shareholders, management has in the past engaged in dilutive financial transactions, such as private placements, 
and may engage in dilutive arrangements in the future. 
 
The Company’s policy on dividends is to retain cash to keep funds available to finance the activities required to 
advance the Company’s Kami Project. Although the Company is not subject to any capital requirements imposed 
by any regulators or by any other external source, Alderon has provided confirmation to Hebei with respect to the 
use of the Initial Investment proceeds. 
 
Financial instruments and risk management  
 
As of June 30, 2016, financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, 
short-term  investments,  receivables,  payables  and  accrued  liabilities,  amounts  due  to  related  parties  and 
convertible debt. 
 
The carrying values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, short-term investments, 
receivables, payables and accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due 
to their short-term maturities or to the prevailing interest rates of the related instruments, which are comparable to 
those of the market. The determination of fair value of the convertible debt as of June 30, 2016 is based on a 
discounted cash flow model using the current market interest rate that the Company could have obtained for a 
similar secured loan without a conversion option. 
 
The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying values included in the 
balance sheet, as of June 30, 2016 are presented below.  Amounts presented for receivables and payables and 
accrued liabilities exclude sales tax credits receivable and payable, respectively.

(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  an  entity  will  encounter  difficulty  in  meeting  obligations  associated  with  financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. 
 
As discussed above, our capital management objectives include working to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity 
to fund Company activities that are directly and indirectly related to the advancement of the Kami Project. 
 
The Company endeavours to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity in order to meet short to medium-term 
business  requirements  and  all  financial  obligations  as  those  obligations  become  due.  Historically,  sufficient 
liquidity has been provided predominantly through external financing initiatives, including strategic, traditional and 
flow-through private placements to investors and institutions. Alderon is actively engaged in discussions to raise 
the necessary capital to meet its funding requirements for the Kami Project, including debt and equity financing. 
The  Company  will  continue  to  rely  upon  sources  of  external  financing  in  future  periods  until  such  time  as 
commercial  production  commences,  notwithstanding  the  Company’s  successful  capital-raising  activities,  as 
discussed above under “Corporate activities”.  There is no assurance that financing of sufficient amounts or on 
terms acceptable to the Company will be available. 
 
Credit risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing 
to discharge an obligation. 
 
The  Company’s  receivables  consist  primarily  of  sales  tax  credits,  which  are  due  from  Canadian  federal  and 
provincial tax agencies. Additionally, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments and short-
term investments are held in deposit at high-credit quality Canadian financial institutions. As a result, management 
considers  the  risk  of  non-performance  related  to  accounts  receivable,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted 
investments and short-term investments to be minimal. 
 
Interest rate risk 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates.  
 
Fluctuations of market interest rates have little impact on the Company’s financial results since the Company does 
not have variable rate debt as of June 30, 2016. Changes in market interest rates do not have an impact on 
interest expense related to the Amended Note because the rate of the Amended Note is fixed. 
 
Risk factors 
 
The  exploration  of  mineral  deposits  involves  significant  risks  and  uncertainties,  which  even  a  combination  of 
careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. A comprehensive list of risk factors relating to 
our business is provided under the heading, “Risk factors”, in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended 
December 31, 2015, which is available on SEDAR, at www.sedar.com. Certain of the more prominent risk factors 
that may materially affect the Company’s future performance, in addition to those referred to above, are listed 
hereunder.
22
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Alderon depends on a single mineral project. 
 
The  Kami  Property  accounts  for  all  of  Alderon's  mineral  resources  and  mineral  reserves  and  exclusively 
represents  the  current  potential  for  the  future  generation  of  revenue.  Mineral  exploration  and  development 
involves a high degree of risk that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge cannot 
eliminate  and  few  properties  that  are  explored  are  ultimately  developed  into  producing  mines.  Any  adverse 
development affecting the Kami Property will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
The successful start of mining operations at, and the development of, the Kami Project into a commercially viable 
mine cannot be assured. 
 
Development  of  mineral  properties  involves  a  high  degree  of  risk  and  few  properties  that  are  explored  are 
ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit is dependent upon a 
number of factors which are beyond Alderon’s control, including the attributes of the deposit, commodity prices, 
government policies and regulation and environmental protection. Fluctuations in the market prices of minerals 
may render resources and deposits containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic. 
 
There are numerous activities that need to be completed in order to successfully commence development and 
production at the Kami Project, including, without limitation: re-scoping of the Kami Project; optimizing the mine 
plan; recruiting and training personnel; having available funds to finance construction and development activities; 
avoiding  potential  increases  in  costs;  negotiating  contracts  for  railway  transportation  and  port  loading  and 
handling;  updating,  renewing  and  obtaining,  as  required,  all  necessary  permits,  including,  without  limitation, 
environmental permits; and handling any other infrastructure issues. There is no certainty that we will be able to 
successfully complete these activities, since most of these activities require significant lead times, and we will be 
required to manage and advance these activities concurrently in order to begin production. A failure or delay in the 
completion  of  any  one  of  these  activities  may  delay  production,  possibly  indefinitely,  at  the  Kami  Project  and 
would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations and cash 
flows. 
 
As such, there can be no assurance that Alderon will be able to complete development of the Kami Project at all, 
on time or in accordance with any budgets due to, among other things, the delivery and installation of plant and 
equipment and cost overruns, or that the current personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to 
support operations. Failure to successfully complete these events as expected would have a material adverse 
effect on our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
There is no assurance that Alderon will ever achieve production or that the Company will ever be profitable if 
production is achieved.
23
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Alderon currently relies on only two customers for 100% of its expected iron ore concentrate production. 
 
Alderon currently relies on two significant customers for 100% of the Alderon expected output of 8 Mt of iron ore 
concentrate annually once the commencement of commercial production occurs. Alderon has entered into the Off-
Take  Agreement  with  Hebei,  a  related  party  who  owns  25%  of  The  Kami  LP  and  19.9%  of  the  Company’s 
common  shares.  As  part  of  this  agreement,  upon  the  commencement  of  commercial  production,  Hebei  is 
obligated to purchase 60% of the actual annual production from the Kami Property, up to a maximum of 4.8 Mt of 
the first 8.0 Mt of iron ore concentrate produced annually at the Kami Property. In addition, the Company entered 
into the Glencore Agreement with respect to an off-take transaction pursuant to which Glencore will acquire all of 
actual annual production from the Kami Project that has not been allocated to Hebei. As noted above, Glencore 
will  be  obligated  to  purchase  upon  the  commencement  of  commercial  production,  40%  of  the  actual  annual 
production from the Kami Project up to a maximum of 3.2 million tonnes of the first 8.0 million tonnes of iron ore 
concentrate produced annually at the Kami Project.  
 
As a result of reliance on these two customers for the entirety of Alderon’s iron ore production, Alderon could be 
subject to adverse consequences if Hebei or Glencore breach their purchase commitments. 
 
Titles  and  other  rights  to  the  Kami  Property  cannot  be  guaranteed  and  may  be  subject  to  prior  unregistered 
agreements, transfers or claims and other defects. 
 
Alderon cannot guarantee that title to the Kami Property will not be challenged. Alderon may not have, or may not 
be  able  to  obtain,  all  necessary  surface  rights  to  develop  the  Kami  Property.  Title  insurance  generally  is  not 
available for mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure claim to individual mineral 
properties or mining concessions comprising the Kami Property may be severely constrained. The Kami Property 
may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other 
things, undetected defects. We have not conducted surveys of all of the claims in which we hold direct or indirect 
interests. A successful challenge to the precise area and location of these claims could result in our being unable 
to operate on all or part of the Kami Property as permitted or being unable to enforce our rights with respect to all 
or part of the Kami Property. This could result in Alderon not being compensated for its prior expenditures relating 
to the property. In addition, Alderon's ability to continue to explore and develop the property may be subject to 
agreements  with  other  third  parties  including  agreements  with  aboriginal  groups.  For  instance,  Alderon  has 
concluded agreements with the Innu Nation of Labrador and the NunatuKavut pursuant to which these groups will 
provide their support for the Kami Project in return for certain benefits. 
 
Alderon needs to enter into contracts with external service providers. 
 
Mining,  processing,  development  and  exploration  activities  depend,  to  one  degree  or  another,  on  adequate 
infrastructure. In order to develop a mine at the Kami Project, we will need to negotiate and conclude various 
agreements with external service providers for rail transportation and port loading and handling, and these are 
important determinants that affect capital and operating costs. The inability to conclude any such agreements 
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and 
render the development of a mine on the Kami Project unviable.
24
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Alderon's activities are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase Alderon's costs of doing 
business and restrict the Company’s operations. 
 
All  of  our  exploration,  potential  development  and  production  activities  in  Canada  are  subject  to  regulation  by 
governmental agencies under various environmental laws, including with respect to air emissions, discharges into 
water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances, protection of natural resources, antiquities 
and endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining operations. Compliance with environmental 
laws and regulations may require significant capital outlays on behalf of Alderon and may cause material changes 
or delays in our intended activities. There can be no assurance that future changes in environmental regulations 
will not adversely affect our business, and it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could 
have a significant adverse impact on some portion of our business, causing us to re-evaluate those activities at 
that  time.  Failure  to  comply  with  applicable  environmental  laws,  regulations  and  permitting  requirements  may 
result  in  enforcement  actions  thereunder,  including  orders  issued  by  regulator  or  judicial  authorities,  causing 
operations  to  cease  or  to  be  curtailed,  and  may  include  corrective  measures  requiring  capital  expenditures, 
installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. 
 
Alderon may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel to meet 
the needs of its anticipated growth. 
 
We are dependent on the services of key executives, including our Non-Executive Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and other highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel 
focused  on  managing  Alderon's  interests  and  the  advancement  of  the  Kami  Property  and  on  identifying  new 
opportunities for growth and funding. Due to our relatively small size, the loss of these persons or our inability to 
attract and retain additional highly skilled employees, on a timely basis or at all, required for the development of 
our activities may have a material adverse effect on our business or future operations. 
 
We also anticipate that, as we bring the Kami Project into production and, where appropriate, acquire additional 
mineral  rights,  we  will  experience  significant  growth  in  our  operations.  We  expect  this  growth  to  create  new 
positions and responsibilities for management and technical personnel and to increase demands on our operating 
and financial systems. There can be no assurance that we will successfully meet these demands and effectively 
attract  and  retain  additional  qualified  personnel  to  manage  our  anticipated  growth.  The  failure  to  attract  such 
qualified personnel to manage growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows. 
 
The Company does not have financial resources sufficient to cover all of its commitments for the coming year, 
therefore,  material  uncertainties  exist  that  cast  substantial  doubt  upon  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a 
going concern.  
 
Alderon currently has limited financial resources, no cash inflows from production and negative operating cash 
flows.  Although  Alderon  has  completed  the  engineering  work  required  to  commence  construction  at  the  Kami 
Project, the commencement of construction of the Kami Project is subject to the completion of the Company’s 
financing plan.
25
(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
The Company does not have financial resources sufficient to cover all of its commitments for the coming year and 
must secure sufficient funding to meet its existing commitments. In addition, further development and exploration 
of the Kami Property depends upon Alderon's ability to obtain financing through strategic partnerships, equity or 
debt financings, production-sharing arrangements or other dilutive or non-dilutive means. There is no assurance 
that Alderon will be successful in obtaining required financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If Alderon is unable to 
obtain additional financing it may consider other options, such as (i) selling assets, (ii) selling equity, or (iii) selling 
interests in the Kami Property. If Alderon raises additional funding by issuing additional equity securities or other 
securities that are convertible into equity securities, such financings may substantially dilute the interest of existing 
or future shareholders. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of securities, or the perception that such sales 
could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price of Alderon's common shares. With any additional 
sale or issuance of equity securities, investors will suffer dilution of their voting power and may experience dilution 
in earnings per share. Failure to obtain additional financing could result in an indefinite postponement of further 
exploration and development of the Kami Property and will have a material adverse effect on Alderon's business, 
prospects, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
Alderon is pursuing a financing strategy for the Kami Project that includes obtaining the Senior Debt Facility to 
complete the construction and start-up of the Kami Project. The completion of the financing plan has taken longer 
than anticipated. There can be no assurance that Alderon will receive commitments from lenders for the Senior 
Debt Facility or that Alderon will be able to negotiate binding agreements with respect to the Senior Debt Facility. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully conclude the Senior Debt Facility or any of its 
financing strategy. These conditions and events indicate material uncertainties that cast substantial doubt upon 
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The failure of Alderon to enter into the Senior Debt Facility 
on reasonable terms, or at all, could delay construction and start-up of the Kami Project. The Company may be 
unable to continue its operations, which would have a material adverse effect on Alderon's business, financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
If the going concern assumption were not appropriate, adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities, 
reported  expenses  and  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  classifications  would  be  necessary.  Such 
adjustments could be material. 
 
Alderon has a history of losses and expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
Alderon has incurred losses since its inception and expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect 
to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as the Kami Project enters into commercial production and 
generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. The development of the Kami Project will require the 
commitment of substantial financial resources. The amount and timing of expenditures will depend on a number of 
factors,  including  the  progress  of  ongoing  exploration,  evaluation  and  development,  the  results  of  consultant 
analysis and recommendations, the rate at which operating losses are incurred, the execution of any agreements 
with strategic partners and our acquisition of additional properties. Some of these factors are beyond our control. 
There can be no assurance that Alderon will ever achieve profitability.

(A Development-Stage Company) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 
 
Our securities are subject to price volatility. 
 
In recent years, the securities markets in the United States and Canada have experienced a high level of price 
and volume volatility, and the market prices of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations 
that have not been necessarily related to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such 
companies. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in our share price will not occur. It may be anticipated 
that any quoted market for our common shares will be subject to market trends generally, notwithstanding any 
potential success in creating revenues, cash flows or earnings. The value of our common shares will be affected 
by such volatility.

The following reportable event occurred subsequent to the six month period ended June 30, 2016:
