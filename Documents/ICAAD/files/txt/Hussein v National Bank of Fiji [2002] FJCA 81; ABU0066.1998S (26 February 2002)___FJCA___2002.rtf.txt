ORAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

Reddy, P., Presiding Judge

There are two applications before the Court. First, the Appellant seeks leave of this Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. If leave is granted, he seeks a stay of all proceedings in the matter until the final determination of his appeal by the Supreme Court.

The Appellants petition sets out four proposed grounds of appeal. None of the grounds raise any questions of public importance calling for further argument and decision of the Supreme Court. Nor do they raise any questions of general principle requiring consideration and decision by the Supreme Court. All the points raised involve decisions on the particular facts of this case.

Since none of the grounds raise questions of significant public importance leave is refused. The application for stay must also be refused.

Barker JA

I agree that both applications should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Presiding Judge.

Davies JA

I also agree.

Reddy P

In accordance with the unanimous opinion of the Judges both applications are dismissed. No order as to costs.

Hon J.R. Reddy

Hon Sir Ian Barker
