<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011. The review of Sao Tome and Principe was 
held at the 11th meeting on 31 January 2011. The delegation of Sao Tome and Principe was 
headed by Elisio Osvaldo do Espirito Santo d&#8217;Alva Teixeira, Minister of Justice and 
Reform of the State. At its 15th meeting held on 2 February 2011, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Sao Tome and Principe. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Sao Tome and Principe: Norway, Nigeria, 
and China. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Sao Tome and Principe:

(A/HRC/WG.6/10/STP/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Latvia, Sweden, the 
Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and France was 
transmitted to Sao Tome and Principe through the troika. These questions are available on 
the extranet of the UPR site. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that Sao Tome and Principe was committed to human rights, 
as provided for in the African Charter of Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and enshrined in the Constitution of the country.  
</p>
<p>6. In 1990, political, legislative and institutional reforms took place, paving the way to 
a multiparty democracy, which demonstrated the engagement of Sao Tome and Principe to 
promote democracy, the rule of law, and construct a society based on justice and solidarity. 
</p>
<p>7. Sao Tome and Principe has taken actions to promote legislative and institutional 
reforms in line with its international commitments. It has gradually moved forward in the 
consolidation of democratic ideals, by harmonizing its domestic legislation in accordance 
with international human rights. The delegation highlighted, in this regard, the adoption of 
the following laws: the law on constitutional review, the law on electoral rights and 
electoral registration, the law on nationality, the law on political parties, the law on 
electoral commissions, the statute governing holders of political office, the press law, and 
the law on the High Council of the Press, among others.  
</p>
<p>8.  Although Sao Tome and Principe has not ratified several international human rights 
instruments, it has taken several measures in order to comply with its international </p>


<p>commitments. Many steps remain to be taken to improve the human rights situation, which 
also requires time and better economic, social and political conditions.  
</p>
<p>9.  The delegation indicated that the Constitution of Sao Tome and Principe recognized 
civil and political rights &#8211; such as the right to life and the right to liberty &#8211;, economic, social 
and cultural rights, and collective rights, such as the right of peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>10.  The delegation stated that the policies and laws approved in recent years had been 
prompted by social demands which had evolved in accordance with cultural and social 
developments.  
</p>
<p>11.   Responding to advance questions raised by Germany and Latvia, the delegation 
referred to several measures which have been adopted to improve the access of rural 
children to education, such as improvement of access to primary and secondary school for 
all children, enhancement of educational opportunities for juveniles and adults, 
sensitization of families about the importance of education, creation of new infrastructure, 
enlargement of education to early childhood, adoption of measures to ensure mandatory 
education for at least 9 years, creation of non-formal education spaces in partnership with 
NGOs, improvement of the quality of training provided to teachers, and creation of 
scholarships.  
</p>
<p>12.  With regard to the question raised by Latvia on the issue of extending a standing 
invitation to special procedures, the delegation indicated that the matter would be brought 
to the attention of the relevant authorities in Sao Tome and Principe, and that an invitation 
would be extended in the upcoming months.  
</p>
<p>13.   Regarding prison conditions, the delegation stated that penitentiary policies were in 
line with international standards. Since the 1990 reforms, efforts have been made to comply 
with the United Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners. In 2003, the law on 
sentencing and incarcerating measures was adopted to fill existing legal gaps. The law 
provides for prisoners to be treated with dignity and not be subjected to any form of ill-
treatment. The internal regulations of the prisons, in force since June 2008, reinforce the 
principles already provided for in the law. The delegation added that the basic principles for 
ensuring the life of prisoners were respected in Sao Tome and Principe, and that the main 
challenge which remained was the lack of adequate infrastructure, which sometimes 
prevented the separation of persons awaiting trial from those already convicted. The 
delegation stated that the Government was developing a project to built new prison 
facilities.  
</p>
<p>14.  The delegation indicated that freedom of expression was guaranteed by articles 29 
and 30 of the Constitution of Sao Tome and Principe, and by several provisions of the Press 
Law and its amendments. Previous censorship was outlawed, and both the Constitution and 
relevant laws expressly state under which circumstances restrictions may be imposed.  
Article 23 of the Press Law also guarantees the exercise of freedom of the press by private 
media. Besides public radios, there were three private radios, and two community radios 
have recently been established. Foreign television and private journals were also accessible.  
</p>
<p>15.  With regard to advance questions raised by Sweden and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the ratification of several international 
instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the delegation explained 
that the Constitution of Sao Tome and Principe and legislation adopted to date had already 
incorporated the principles of the above-mentioned instruments. Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s 
legislative reform policy envisaged the following goals: harmonization of domestic 
legislation with international instruments, review of the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure 
Law, and accession to all international instruments which provide for the fight against </p>


<p>transnational crime. A bill amending the Penal Code was under consideration by the 
National Assembly.  
</p>
<p>16.  The delegation also highlighted that Sao Tome and Principe had adopted a policy to 
enhance transparency and accountability at all levels of Government.  
</p>
<p>17.  A bill for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities has been tabled for 
adoption by the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p>18.  The Fifth Commission of the National Assembly of Sao Tome and Principe was 
established in accordance with the internal regulations of the Parliament, and it has been 
mandated to follow up on human rights matters, especially with regards to reports of human 
rights violations by citizens, gender issues, HIV/AIDS issues, children in vulnerability, and 
other related matters.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>19.  During the interactive dialogue, 31 delegations made statements. Many delegations 
commended Sao Tome and Principe for its level of participation in the process and for its 
consultative approach in the preparation of its national report. Recommendations made 
during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>20.  Nigeria acknowledged Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s achievements with regard to the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in the area of infant and child 
mortality. Nigeria noted that poverty was one of the major social problems and challenges 
faced by Sao Tome and Principe. It noted that, although Sao Tome and Principe was not a 
party to all international and regional human rights instruments, it had incorporated some of 
the principles into its Constitution. Nigeria called on the international community to 
provide the country with technical and capacity-building assistance, and made 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>21.  Portugal highlighted Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s commitment to the promotion of 
human rights. Portugal inquired about the policies developed for ensuring wider access to 
justice for all citizens, the specific measures intended to prevent excessive use of force by 
the police, procedural guarantees provided to detainees, and the specific actions and 
measures undertaken to combat violence against women. Portugal made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>22.  Cuba noted the challenges facing Sao Tome and Principe and its considerable 
dependency on development aid. Although they have been decreasing since 2000, these 
constraints reduced Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s capacity to deal with health and education 
problems. Cuba noted, however, the progress made in the health sector, with a constant 
reduction of child and adolescent mortality, the achievements in education, and the actions 
taken to improve the socio-economic situation of its population. Cuba made 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>23.  Algeria praised Sao Tom&#233; and Principe&#8217;s genuine will to promote human rights and 
cooperate with the Human Rights Council. It highlighted its efforts to improve its judicial 
system, the enjoyment of rights by women, the right to education, health, food, and access 
to drinking water.  Algeria noted the lack of resources suffered by Sao Tome and Principe 
as a small-island developing state and called on the international community to continue its 
assistance to the country. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24.  Morocco welcomed the efforts made to reform its judiciary and the police force 
despite a lack of infrastructure and technical and scientific material. It noted with 
satisfaction the setting up of the Centre to combat domestic violence and the National 
Institute for the Promotion of Gender Equality. It enquired as to whether Sao Tome and </p>


<p>Principe envisaged taking measures to mitigate the low involvement of women in public 
and political life.  Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25.  Chile highlighted the efforts and progress made by Sao Tome and Principe to 
combat child and adolescent mortality, and to ensure greater life expectancy. Chile also 
noted Sao Tome&#8217;s commitment to reduce poverty. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26.  Norway welcomed Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s support for the General Assembly 
Statement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (2008). Norway was 
concerned about the absence of mechanisms to protect children against all forms of 
violence, and the fact that child prostitutes were considered criminals under the law. 
Norway noted the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation in Sao Tom&#233; and 
Principe, and made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27.  Mauritania praised the efforts made by Sao Tome and Principe to promote human 
rights in various areas, despite its limited resources and infrastructure. It encouraged the 
authorities to pursue its commitment to human rights, despite the various constraints. 
Mauritania made recommendations  
</p>
<p>28.  Brazil noted the steps taken by Sao Tome and Principe to protect human rights. It 
welcomed its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, the Bolsa Familia initiative, the National 
Committee on the Rights of Children and the Reproductive Health Program. Brazil 
enquired about the concrete steps taken to combat all forms of violence against children, 
and the main initiatives for promoting gender equality. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29.  Sweden appreciated the response provided by Sao Tome and Principe to its advance 
questions. It was pleased to note that the Constitution and legislation provided for freedom 
of speech and media freedom, and that the Government generally respects these rights. 
However, it noted that most of the media outlets were owned by the Government, which 
may prompt journalists to practice self-censorship. Sweden finally enquired about the 
intention of Sao Tome and Principe to ratify ICCPR and its two Optional Protocols 
(ICCPR-OP 1 and OP 2), and the timeline for such ratification. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30.  Angola welcomed the impressive human rights progress made by Sao Tome and 
Principe. It noted the multiparty democracy, institutional consolidation, and freedom of 
expression and information. Angola inquired about the impact of the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper on improving the socio-economic situation. Angola encouraged Sao Tome 
and Principe to improve the living and housing conditions of its citizens. Angola called on 
the international community to provide assistance to the country, and made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Burkina Faso encouraged Sao Tome and Principe to pursue the ratification of 
international conventions as well as their incorporation into domestic law. It also 
encouraged further cooperation with special procedures mandate holders. Finally it 
requested a large dissemination of the recommendations of the Working Group on the UPR 
after the review. Burkina Faso made a recommendation 
</p>
<p>32.  Mozambique noted Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s political will and commitment to

education and health rights. Mozambique commended Sao Tome for its new Criminal 
Code. Mozambique encouraged the authorities to continue with its judicial reform and the 
implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  
</p>
<p>33.  France noted with appreciation the ratification of the Convention for the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC). It stressed however that the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child had raised concerns regarding the increase in prostitution and acts of sexual violence </p>


<p>against children. France also noted that child prostitutes were considered as delinquents and 
criminals, rather than victims. Finally, France welcomed Sao Tom&#233; and Principe&#8217;s support 
for the General Assembly Statement on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender 
Identity (2008). France made recommendations<b>.  
</b></p>
<p>34.  Poland welcomed the ratification of CEDAW and CRC. It commended the 
establishment of the National Child Rights Committee mandated to coordinate the 
implementation of CRC. It noted the concerns of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
about the lack of independence of the National Child Rights Committee, and the fact that its 
mandate was not in accordance with the Paris Principles. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35.  Canada commended Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s commitment to protect human rights, 
despite its limited resources. It noted that the discovery of oil resources was a unique 
opportunity to improve the living conditions of Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s population, and 
highlighted the need for the revenues of this industry to be managed with transparency. It 
regretted the removal of Sao Tome and Principe from the Extracting Industries 
Transparency Initiative, and advised it to strengthen efforts to combat corruption. Canada 
also raised concerns about the increase in family violence, prostitution and sexual abuse. 
Canada made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36.  Germany enquired about the implementation of legislation concerning persons under 
the age of 18 who are in conflict with the law, the establishment of juvenile courts with 
trained personnel and judges, and the separation of detainees under the age of 18 from 
adults. Germany was concerned about the increase in pregnant women and young people 
affected by HIV/AIDS, and the fact that corporal punishment still occurred. Germany made 
recommendations.

Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (2008), but noted that sexual 
activity between same-sex consenting adults remained criminalized. The United Kingdom 
noted that the Constitution protects several human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40.  The United Sates of America commended Sao Tom&#233; and Principe for adopting a 
Plan of Action for Human Rights Education focusing on the national school system. It was 
concerned, however, about the lack of a juvenile court system and adequate procedures to 
deal with persons under the age of 18 who were suspected or accused of crimes. It also 
expressed concern with regard to the prevalence of discrimination and violence against 
children, and enquired about Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s plans to develop a mechanism to 
protect children against all forms of violence and sexual abuse. The United States made

the law on domestic violence which made punishable all forms of abuses and domestic 
violence against children and persons living in the same physical space. Following the 
passage of the new 2010 law governing the judiciary system, a family and children court 
was set up to deal with family matters. The court would be fully operational by the end of 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>44.  Regarding same-sex relationships, the delegation explained that although the Penal 
Code, in force since 1878, made such acts punishable, the provisions were no longer 
applied. The new Penal Code would abolish this criminal offence and would also 
comprehensively protect children against abuse and violence. 
</p>
<p>45.  The Minister of Justice, in conjunction with the Fifth Commission of the National 
Assembly and some NGOs were making efforts to harmonize national legislation with 
international standards, and investigate allegations of human rights abuses.

human rights treaties.

adolescent mortality and a longer life expectancy, as well as the adoption of the Plan of 
Action for the World Programme for Human Rights Education. However, it expressed

establishment of the National Child Rights Committee to coordinate and supervise the

recent draft label act. It also noted the progress made by Sao Tome and Principe in 
protecting the civil and political rights of its citizens. China was concerned about the

standing invitation to special procedures. Latvia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>53.  Mauritius noted Sao Tome and Principe efforts to combat poverty, and commended 
the special attention given to vulnerable groups and to education. Mauritius appealed to the 
international community to strengthen its development cooperation. Mauritius enquired 
about the measures taken to prevent corporal punishment, and the steps to ensure 
accountability for the exploitation of oil reserves. Mauritius made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>54.  Hungary hoped that the recently discovered oil deposits will help to improve the 
economic and social situation in the country. It commended the establishment of the 
National Child Rights Committee and highlighted that the protection of children rights 
could be improved through the prohibition of corporal punishment, and the adoption of 
laws to combat ill-treatment or violence within the family. It commended the decrease in 
child and adolescent mortality, but noted the high rate of maternal mortality, and the 
prevalence of infectious diseases. It enquired about Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s intentions to 
provide access to drinking water and sanitation, especially in rural areas. Hungary made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.  Ghana commended the 2009 national forum on justice that was aimed at reforming 
the judicial system. Ghana enquired about the impact of the 2005-2009 Plan of Action on 
the education system and society in general. Ghana was concerned about the lack of a 
mechanism to protect children against all forms of violence. Ghana made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56.  Cape Verde noted the challenges faced by Sao Tome and Principe in areas such as 
health, education, water and sanitation, and access to justice. It highlighted the financial 
constraints that prevented Sao Tome and Principe from improving the human rights in these 
areas. Cape Verde noted that the establishment of a national human rights institution 
accredited by the International Coordinating Committee (ICC) would be desirable. It 
encouraged the international community to increase its assistance to the country. Cape 
Verde made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57.  The delegation of Sao Tome and Principe referred to two recently adopted laws 
which allow citizens to have access to information regarding petroleum exploration 
activities. With regard to the efforts undertaken to reduce poverty, the delegation mentioned 
the measures taken to improve access to health-care services and compulsory education. 
The 2010 national budget allocated better coverage to the special needs of the extremely 
poor and people at a disadvantage.  
</p>
<p>58.  Regarding the promotion of gender equality and women&#8217;s participation in decision-
making processes, the delegation pointed out that a resolution adopted by the National 
Assembly three years ago, establishing quotas to advance the access of women to posts in 
the administration, has been implemented. Awareness-raising campaigns have also been 
carried out among women to involve them in decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>59.  In order to improve access to justice by the poor, an amendment to the Law on 
Judicial Fees has been proposed. The Government, in partnership with the Bar Association, 
was working on a draft law which would provide free legal aid and assistance to the poor.  
</p>
<p>60.  Regarding violence against women, the delegation indicated that the National 
Institute for the Promotion of Gender Equality was preparing a strategy on gender equality. 
Regarding domestic violence, apart from the Centre for Combating Domestic Violence, a 
shelter for victims of violence has been established, and a shelter for street children has also 
been envisaged.  </p>


<p>61.  A coordination scheme has been envisaged to enhance cooperation between 
ministers dealing with foreign technical cooperation, namely the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Minister of Finance.  
</p>
<p>62.  Regarding the MDGs, since 2002, Sao Tome and Principe has been carrying out 
several projects to enhance access to drinking water. The delegation indicated that the goal 
of the Government was to reduce within four years, and by almost 60 per cent, the lack of 
access to drinking water by the population. 
</p>
<p>63.  Sao Tome and Principe thanked all the delegations for their comments and 
recommendations, the majority of which were in line with Sao Tome and Principe&#8217;s 
priorities and concerns. The delegation also called on the international community to 
provide technical assistance to Sao Tome and Principe so that it could properly address its 
human rights challenges.
