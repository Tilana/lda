against Women in 1985, with reservations to key provisions: articles 9 (2) (on transfer of

name to children and inheritance). Article 16 (c) (d) (f) (concerning marriage, divorce, and 
custody of children) would not be respected. A general declaration which, under 
international law, has no legal value was also made upon ratification: the provisions of 
Chapter 1 of the now suspended Constitution, which stated that the religion of Tunisia is 
Islam (art. 1), take precedence over the provisions of the Convention. While some laws in 
relation to articles 9, 15 and 16 have been modified in a positive way as noted earlier, the 
persistence of reservations, and in particular of the general declaration, impedes further 
progress towards the elimination of discrimination in law and in practice.

Realization of the Goals of the Revolution, which was tasked to lead the process of legal 
and institutional reform, adopted Decree N&#176;35 of 10 May 2011 concerning elections to the 
NCA establishing parity on electoral lists. This law showed the Government&#8217;s commitment 
to enhancing women&#8217;s involvement in political life and their role in the transition to 
democracy. Although parties were obliged to follow the rules requiring parity of male and 
female candidates on electoral lists, as provided for in article 16, few placed women at the 
top of lists, thereby limiting the effects of this legislation.  According to official statistics, 
women only composed 7 per cent of those at the top of candidate lists.45  On paper, this was 
a strong affirmative measure, but in practice, most of the more than 80 parties competing in 
the elections (with more than 1,<footnote name="5">4. Many young rural women also depend on casual employment, particularly as

risk exploitation and slavery-like conditions. Many complained about how these young 
girls send their pay regularly to their fathers only to be denied inheritance later by law.

constituency, which went to the male candidate invariably heading the list, showing the gap 
in this field between the law and the practice. As a result, fewer women were elected in 
2011 than in the previous election in 2009, with 57 women (26.3 per cent) elected among 
the 217 members of the NCA.46  However Tunisia still remains the country in the region 
with the highest proportion of women in parliament.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
practice visited Tunisia from 7 to 11 January 2013 at the invitation of the Government. Two 
of its five members, the Chairperson-Rapporteur, Kamala Chandrakirana, and Eleonora 
Zieli&#324;ska, participated in the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with its mandate as contained in Human Rights Council resolutions 
15/23 and 20/6, the objectives of the Working Group were to engage in dialogue with the 
Government and other stakeholders on the issue of eliminating discrimination against 
women in law and in practice; to identify good practices relating to the elimination of laws 
that discriminate against women or are discriminatory in terms of implementation or 
impact; and to make recommendations on the improvement of legislation and the 
implementation of the law. With a focus on the participation of women in political and 
public life, including in times of political transition, for its 2013 thematic report, the 
Working Group paid particular attention during its visit to the political transition process 
and its impact on women&#8217;s rights; the drafting of a new constitution and other legislative 
</p>
<p>reforms; State institutions and national mechanisms; and the issue of women&#8217;s political 
participation at all levels of decision-making. Prior to the visit, the Working Group had 
already engaged in a constructive dialogue on those issues with the Government through its 
communication procedure. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group held extensive consultations in Tunis and Jendouba with 
Government officials and local authorities, members of the National Constituent Assembly, 
the national human rights institution, national and local civil society organizations, religious 
institutions, constitutional experts, academics and representatives of United Nations 
agencies. It regrets that it had only five working days in Tunisia, owing to the last-minute 
rescheduling of the visit, which was originally scheduled to take place from 2 to 9 
November.  It welcomes, however, Tunisia&#8217;s openness vis-&#224;-vis the special procedures of 
the Human Rights Council as illustrated by the visits by seven mandate holders since May 
2011.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group expresses gratitude to the Government for its cooperation in 
ensuring the success of the visit. It is grateful to the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), 
including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) country 
office, for its assistance prior to and during the visit, and to all interlocutors for their 
support for the mission. It looks forward to continuing to engage with the Government and 
other stakeholders on the issue of gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations made in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.<footnote name="2">5. The time of political transition has been a reopening of the debate on the 60-year 
commitment by Tunisia to the principle of equality between men and women in a highly 
polarized environment. The Working Group is concerned that international standards on 
gender equality and human rights are still little understood by the public and are too often 
dismissed as foreign. Without the State&#8217;s full and effective guarantee of, among other 
</footnote> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>Ali&#8217;s resignation, and for freedom and dignity.1 This is consistent with a long history of 
activism by women. At the start of the 21st century, working class women who were made 
redundant from their positions in the textile industry took part in protests as part of larger 
struggles by social and trade unions.2 
</p>
<p>6. The Jasmine Revolution has brought greater freedom of opinion and expression, 
assembly and association, as well as the consolidation of the rule of law. At the same time, 
it has also increased the polarization of Tunisian society, generating a new sense of 
uncertainty and insecurity among many, including women who are fearful of losing the 
gains they have enjoyed since the country&#8217;s independence in 1956.  
</p>
<p>7. Tunisia has in fact had a long and distinctive history in eliminating discrimination 
against women in law and practice for almost six decades. This started in 1956, a few 
months after independence and before the Constitution was in place, when President 
Bourguiba promulgated the Personal Status Code (CPS) in which many gender-based 
discriminatory practices were abolished.   
</p>
<p>8. The progressive CPS was formulated on the basis of the work of the Tunisian 
Islamic scholar Tahar Haddad as articulated in his book entitled Our Women in Shari&#8217;a and 
<i>in Society</i> published in 1930.  Although this book was banned upon its publication and the 
author marginalized for the rest of his life, its promotion of equality for women provided 
independent the first President of an independent Tunisia, a quarter of a century later, with 
the theological foundation to launch a campaign for women&#8217;s liberation as an integral part 
</p>
<p>of his concept of the modern nation.3 This was soon followed by State policies giving 
women the right to vote and stand for elections and providing measures to enhance 
women&#8217;s economic rights, including to open bank accounts and to start businesses without 
</p>
<p>spousal permission. The conditions for equality between men and women were further 
developed with the introduction of family planning in the 1960s and the legalization of 
abortion in 1973.4  
</p>
<p>9. In 1985, Tunisia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, although with reservations on several key provisions, 
including on inheritance and the transfer of nationality to children, reflecting the increasing 
compromises Bourguiba was making as his political power waned. From 1987 on, 
President Ben Ali continued most of Bourguiba&#8217;s reformist policies &#8211; termed by some 
experts as &#8220;State feminism&#8221; &#8211; and further institutionalized them by establishing a ministry 
for women and family affairs in 1993. However, the regime&#8217;s growing authoritarianism 
meant that these government policies were implemented under politically repressive 
conditions, severely limiting the scope of change, including women&#8217;s opportunity and 
capacity for full and equal participation in political and public life. Backsliding in the 
implementation of the CPS was not adequately addressed, in the interest of reducing 
political opposition to the Government. A study on the jurisprudence of ordinary courts 
found how some judges with a traditional view of the family were able to subvert legal 
guarantees of equality in the CPS by using religious references.5

<p>10. Women participated in the protests to oust President Ben Ali despite the innovations 
brought by the CPS, which was rather seen as a top-down attempt at changing Tunisian 
views of men and women&#8217;s roles. While it has afforded greater autonomy to women, the 
</p>
<p>Code continues to sustain many of the traditional roles of women as mothers in marriage 
and after divorce. For example, although women can now end their marriages, they 
continue to live with the same legal and traditional dynamics that restricted them before 
divorce.6 Such an approach did not take into consideration the social, cultural and religious 
context of the newly independent State and the CPS created disparities between the law and 
a society that had yet to fully challenge deeply embedded issues of gender inequality.7  
</p>
<p>11. The family law reforms of the 1950 and 1960s were not prompted by any form of 
contestation or feminist movement within society. It is argued that although women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>organizations existed prior to independence, Tunisian women played no role in the 
promulgation of the CPS. While women had the right to participate in public life, 
Bourguiba&#8217;s promotion of gender equality fell short of the freedom to assemble.8 Tunisian 
State feminism has been described by women&#8217;s rights advocates as &#8220;masculine feminism&#8221; 
in the sense that it does not aim at transforming women&#8217;s traditional roles but at making 
them more efficient within a patriarchal family structure.9 Ultimately, half a century of laws 
and policies on women&#8217;s liberation has had only limited impact in terms of comprehensive 
</p>
<p>substantive equality outcomes. 
</p>
<p>12. With the Jasmine Revolution, the issue of women&#8217;s status has once again become a 
central issue in the process of State building. Upon its establishment, the Transitional 
Government announced the withdrawal of reservations to the Convention. At the time of 
the Working Group&#8217;s visit, however, the withdrawal process had not yet been finalized.   
</p>
<p><b> III. </b>Women&#8217;s rights at a time of political transition<b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. Political transition in Tunisia is occurring in a highly polarized nation. Different 
parts of society have varying, not to say opposing, views on the nation&#8217;s identity and future. 
At this very challenging point in the country&#8217;s history, women&#8217;s rights are at the core of a 
collision of views. The former Head of the High Authority for the Achievement of the 
Revolution Objectives affirmed this when he said that &#8220;the immense debate &#8230; revolves 
</p>
<p>around a few focal points: the first is the relationship between <i>sharia </i>and positive law; the 
second is the question of women&#8217;s rights and of gender equality; and the third is the issue of 
freedom of conscience, of thought, and of expression.&#8221;10 
</p>
<p>14. Despite significant shortcomings in the gender policies of the past regimes, there 
was and continues to be a strong constituency within society that believes in those policies&#8217; 
basic premise of equality and non-discrimination. This constituency comprises both women 
and men, of diverse backgrounds, who abide by the international standards of equality and 
human rights. The Working Group heard from many of them and notes with concern the

</p>
<p>sense of fear that they have at losing the gender equality guarantees and gains that Tunisia 
has enjoyed to date. With an increasing incidence of attacks on freedom of expression, 
including the stigmatization of women who speak out, there is a heightened sense of 
insecurity as crucial negotiations and decision-making are ongoing on the new 
constitutional foundation of the nation. 
</p>
<p>15. Similar concerns at a prevailing climate of insecurity have been raised by the Special 
Rapporteur on human rights defenders, who referred to &#8220;statements in the media by various 
actors, including &#8230; critical of women&#8217;s participation in public life and activities in defence 
of human rights. 11  The Working Group is concerned that these statements, including by 
conservative Islamists, impede the emergence of an environment conducive to women 
human rights defenders&#8217; work, as they contribute to the insecurity felt by such defenders. 
</p>
<p>Many of the women met reported feeling unsafe in public spaces, particularly at night, and 
having to avoid walking in the street unaccompanied by a male after 5 p.m. In this respect, 
the Group wishes to recall the case of &#8220;Meriem&#8221;,12 which is considered by many women as 
illustrative of a prevailing context of violence and insecurity. 
</p>
<p>16. In spite of the challenges, women continue to take an active part in the political 
transition, at street level and through official processes. They participated as voters, 
candidates and observers during the country&#8217;s first free and democratic elections in October 
</p>
<p>2011, in which the Ennahda Party won the most seats in the National Constituent Assembly 
(NCA). This institution is now leading the drafting of the country&#8217;s new constitution. 
Although parties were obliged to respect the rules requiring parity of male and female 
candidates on electoral lists, few placed women at the top of lists, thereby limiting the 
effects of this legislation.  
</p>
<p>17. The trend is not consistent across institutions of the State, however. In the Ennahda-
led coalition government, women are severely underrepresented in top decision-making 
positions. As of March 2012, in the 41-member Government, there were 3 women.13 While 
the Government has stressed its commitment to maintaining women&#8217;s rights, several of its 
representatives have made statements calling these into question. For example, in February 
2012, the Minister for Women and Family Affairs said that customary marriage or <i>orfi</i> was 
a &#8220;personal freedom&#8221;.14 Also, in November 2011, a member of parliament affiliated with 
Ennahda declared that single mothers were a disgrace in an Arab Muslim society. Such 
statements have contributed to the sense of a genuine risk of regression in existing 
guarantees of equality between men and women felt among the country&#8217;s advocates of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The initial draft of the constitution generated heated debates and public protests 
when it ascribed women&#8217;s role as &#8220;complementary to that of men in the family&#8221;. The NCA 
then repealed this clause in the following draft and further introduced an article on the 
elimination of violence against women. In reviewing the latest draft constitution during the 
time of its visit, the Working Group found persisting loopholes and ambiguities in the draft 
which, if not removed, would undermine the protection of women&#8217;s rights and the 
guarantee of gender equality. For the Working Group, this reaffirms the nature and depth of 
the political divisions within Tunisian society at this critical moment in its history. 
</p>
<p>19. The heightened polarization of society in this time of political transition, which has 
at times expressed itself in violent clashes, has permeated beyond the formal political 
institutions and processes, including into educational institutions. The Group was informed

<p>that, since the revolution, there has been a rise in religious extremism in universities. An 
increasing number of female students in Tunisia have started to wear the <i>niqab</i>, which, 
unlike the <i>hijab,</i> the prohibition on which was lifted after the revolution, is a barrier to 
communication between teachers and students and can prevent teachers from being able to 
identify their students. In March 2011, the Minister of Education announced that the 
prohibition on wearing the <i>niqab</i> in educational institutions would be maintained. 
Following this decision, a number of violent conflicts involving young <i>salafists</i> took place 
in universities and demands were further made for gender segregation in classes.15 The 
Working Group heard the case of a university dean who was attacked for not allowing the 
<i>niqab</i> in the examination room, in accordance with a decision of the scientific council of 
Manouba University, and prosecuted for alleged physical violence against a female student.  
According to stakeholders in academia, the frequent on-campus protests and sit-ins, in 
which violence has been used in some cases, have had a negative impact on the functioning 
of a number of universities. 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group heard concerns from women&#8217;s rights advocates and education 
specialists about the increasing number of non-formal kindergartens operating outside the 
supervision of the Ministries for Women&#8217;s Affairs. Responding to the shortage of public 
kindergartens, religious associations have been establishing kindergartens within their 
respective communities. The Working Group was given access to reports on the &#8220;radical 
indoctrination&#8221; of children under the supervision of women who wear the <i>niqab,</i> whereby 
mixed classes of boys and girls are prohibited and the veil imposed on girl children.16 It 
wishes to emphasize that children should be protected from extremist political or religious 
ideology.17 According to information received by the Ministry for Women and Family 
Affairs, an interministerial meeting has been convened on this matter, involving the Prime 
Minister&#8217;s Office, which is responsible for the delivery of authorizations to open 
associations, and an interdepartmental commission was created to establish an inventory of 
childrens&#8217; institutions established by Koranic associations and to ensure the effective 
oversight thereof. 
</p>
<p>21. A time of political transition is also a time for States to account for past abuses. In 
the immediate aftermath of the revolution, a multiplicity of ad hoc initiatives were 
undertaken to provide compensation to those who had been victims since the December 
2010 riots. Among the victims were women who were subjected to specific forms of police 
violence, including sexual harassment and rape.18 The <i>Association Tunisienne des Femmes 
D&#233;mocrates</i> (ATFD) documented cases of rape by members of President Ben Ali&#8217;s special 
forces in Kasserine and Thala during the repression of protests. There were also reports of 
women protesters being raped while in detention in the Ministry of Interior from 14-15 
January 2011 in Tunis. The Working Group was made aware of gender-based 
discrimination in the delivery of compensation to women victims as this followed religious 
practices on inheritance whereby women receive only half the amount received by men.19 It 
was not able to verify, during its visit, to what extent all women victims entitled to 
compensation received their right without discrimination.

<p>22. The Working Group supports the call made by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence20 for Tunisia to 
take a comprehensive approach to transitional justice linking reparations with advances in 
truth-seeking, criminal prosecutions, institutional reforms, and other measures to guarantee 
non-repetition, and further emphasizes the need to ensure the responsiveness of all 
transitional justice measures to the gender dimensions of past human rights violations and 
to the specific needs and interests of women victims, including for transformative 
reparations.21 The Group notes that the account of what women have endured at the hands 
of the authoritarian regime has so far tended to focus on the abuses committed during the 
revolution and not before. During the dictatorship, women suffered from &#8220;brutal beatings 
</p>
<p>they received under interrogation; and sexual abuse at the hands of police and prison 
guards. They explained the oppression they faced even after their release &#8211; employment and 
educational blacklisting, and administrative requirements to check in to the local police 
station multiple times each day, thus preventing them from pursuing what few work and 
educational opportunities may be available. After decades of silence, these women are 
finally able to speak openly about these violations.&#8221;22 The Group also heard the testimony 
of women who were arrested and imprisoned under the former authoritarian regime on the 
basis of either their political beliefs or religious observance. 
</p>
<p>23. On 14 April 2012, a national dialogue on transitional justice was launched, which 
included consultations in the regions, in order to produce a consensus-driven draft law on a 
holistic transitional justice process. The technical committee created to oversee this process 
includes two women out of 12 members, both representing civil society organizations.  The 
Working Group notes with concern the assessment of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence of the 24 dialogues 
which took place between 16 September and 7 October 2012 across the country, namely 
that &#8220;the design of these consultations appears to have fallen short of including all sectors 
of society in an efficient manner. The voices of women, so crucial in the deliberations of a 
country on how to move ahead, were not sufficiently represented in this undertaking&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>24. The technical committee has now completed the draft law covering the four 
elements of transitional justice, i.e. truth, justice, reparations, and guarantees of non-
recurrence, and providing for the creation of a Truth and Dignity Commission which would 
be responsible for examining violations committed from 20 March 1956 until the date of its 
establishment. The draft law was submitted to the Ministry of Transitional Justice, 
approved by the Government and transmitted to the NCA in January 2013. The Working 
Group appreciates the special measure to ensure women&#8217;s representation in the 
Commission, guaranteed in article 20 of the draft law, stating that among the 15 members 
of the Commission, each gender is represented by at least one third of the members. It is, 
however, concerned that while it refers several times to the need to take into account the 
specificity of women&#8217;s, children&#8217;s and vulnerable groups&#8217; experiences, there is no specific 
reference to women&#8217;s experiences, other than in the context of other vulnerable groups and 
</p>
<p>in relation to the organization of hearings and design of the reparations programmes.

<p>human rights elements, freedom of expression and opinion, as well as freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion for all, the goal of a lasting peace and democracy would be 
undermined and differences of opinion could lead to further violence and other forms of 
violation. For such guarantees to be effective, they must include gender-responsive 
measures and a focus on women human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional design 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Group&#8217;s visit coincided with the consideration of a second draft constitution, 
released on 14 December 2012. As stated before, one of the most contentious debates since 
the first draft concerns the principle of full equality between men and women in all fields of 
life. This principle has been discussed in connection with other key provisions, namely 
those which refer to Islam as the religion of the State and to human rights. The Working 
Group heard widely divergent views on these provisions, including disturbing arguments 
promoting cultural relativism, including religion-based, in place of universal human rights &#8211; 
a clear regression from the 1959 Constitution&#8217;s long-standing guarantee of &#8220;the 
fundamental freedoms and human rights in their universality, comprehensiveness, 
complementarity and interdependence&#8221; (art. 5).  
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group had the opportunity to meet with the General Rapporteur and 
five female members of the NCA. Their description of the debates among the Assembly 
members indicates certain areas of strong consensus, such as on the elimination of violence 
against women, as well as areas of deep and continuing contention, such as on the 
universality of human rights. The Group regrets not receiving any assurance of confidence 
over the resolution of the existence of potentially contradictory provisions in the final draft, 
such as that which protects the family structure and gender equality. It is concerned that 
there may not be enough political will to resolve divergent views through democratic 
debate. 
</p>
<p>28. While noting that the second draft of the constitution contains improved language on 
several issues, there are still loopholes and omissions that could result in both regressive 
judicial interpretation of existing legislations and regressive legislative actions. The absence 
of a clear reference to international human rights law fails to firmly situate the rights and 
freedoms set out in the draft constitution in its universally understood meaning.  
</p>
<p>29. In view of the forthcoming draft under preparation, the Working Group identifies 
some key elements of a gender-responsive constitutional design which would ensure that a 
country abides by its international obligations on non-discrimination on the grounds of sex, 
gender equality and the protection and promotion of women&#8217;s human rights. A constitution 
</p>
<p>should uphold equality between men and women in its entirety and without ambiguity. 
Such a constitutional design would include specific provisions on gender equality, 
including: 
</p>
<p>(a) A clear and explicit principle of equality between women and men before and 
in the law with the aim of framing equality priorities throughout the constitution; 
</p>
<p>(b) A clear and explicit prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on the 
grounds of sex and gender in all fields and in relation to other prohibited grounds, such as 
race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status; 
</p>
<p>(c) The specific enumeration of women&#8217;s civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights in all spheres of life, including family life; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>(d) A provision on the possibility of taking positive action to promote gender 
equality in all fields of women&#8217;s life, including gender parity in political and public life; 
</p>
<p>(e) Provisions on the protection of women&#8217;s physical, sexual and moral integrity, 
criminalization of violence against women, and consideration of violence as a serious 
violation of human rights and gender-based discrimination; 
</p>
<p>(f) The principle of gender parity in all constitutionally mandated institutions. 
</p>
<p>30. In light of the universality of the principle of equality and non-discrimination, the 
constitutional design should also have clear framework provisions of a general nature on 
human rights, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) An explicit provision respecting human rights in their universality; 
</p>
<p>(b) A clear reference to the international human rights instruments and the 
recognition that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated; 
</p>
<p>(c) A provision on the primacy of international treaties, including the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, over 
domestic laws including clarity that international obligations take precedence over 
contradictory provisions in the Constitution and the legislation; 
</p>
<p>(d) A provision articulating the principle of non-retrogression in the protection 
and promotion of all human rights as an established principle of international human rights 
law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Personal Status Code 
</b></p>
<p>31. The promulgation of the Personal Status Code on 13 August 1956, as mentioned 
above, was a breakthrough for the rights of women in family law, with positive 
repercussions for women in the social, economic, political and cultural domains. The 
promulgation of the code inter alia abolished polygamy and repudiation and instituted civil 
marriage with the explicit consent of both spouses, and gave men and women equal access 
to divorce before a court. These advances in favour of women were unprecedented in the 
Arab-Muslim context. Over the past decades, a number of legislative reforms have further 
strengthened the protection of women&#8217;s rights in the family. Among them, in 1993, the 
wife&#8217;s duty to obey her husband was replaced with the principle of reciprocal rights and 
</p>
<p>duties of the two spouses. In 2007, the Personal Status Code was amended to harmonize the 
minimum legal age for marriage, now 18 years for both men and women. In 2010, the 
Tunisian nationality law was reformed, allowing women to transmit citizenship to their 
children in the same way as men.24<b> 
</b></p>
<p>32. Despite these successive reforms, a significant number of discriminatory provisions 
remain in force that deny women equal rights with men. For example, there are limits to a 
woman&#8217;s right to freely choose her husband, since marriage between a Tunisian Muslim 
</p>
<p>woman and a non-Muslim man is prohibited according to an administrative regulation of 
1973. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed its 
concern at this regulation, which created an impediment not foreseen by the CPS.25 During 
marriage, women continue to suffer discrimination in their personal relations with their 
husbands, who, according to article 23, remain the heads of the household. Maintaining

<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>such a notion, even confined to the maintenance obligation of his spouse and children, 
constitutes discrimination which violates the principle of equality. This unequal status is 
reinforced by the reference in the same article to customs and traditional practices with 
respect to the couple&#8217;s conjugal duties. Although since 1993 this article has stipulated that 
the two spouses shall cooperate in managing the family&#8217;s affairs, the proper education of 
their children and the conduct of their children&#8217;s affairs, including education, travel and 
</p>
<p>financial transactions, the status that is granted to the husband and father and the notion of 
customs and traditional practices give rise to certain abuses, in particular as regards the 
choice of domicile.  
</p>
<p>33. Discriminatory provisions still persist in relation to divorce and custody. 
Notwithstanding the adoption of specific legislative measures, in particular with regard to 
the custody of children and the family house (law of 4 March 2008), there are still some 
shortcomings: while the mother is entitled to the house as long as she has custody of her 
minor children, she might lose the house in case the family home was not listed as joint 
property.26 Although the common property regime has been introduced, it is not well 
known by women and as a result is seldom applied.  Women lose custody of their children 
if they remarry after divorce, while men can retain custody on the condition that &#8220;they have 
at their disposal a woman who will take responsibility for looking after the children&#8221; 
(art. 58).  
</p>
<p>34. Inheritance law, which is based on patriarchal and patrilineal family, remains 
discriminatory against women. While the law is characterized by a policy of emancipation 
of the individual from the group and equality between men and women, inheritance law 
remains profoundly unequal, still pervaded with an outdated notion of family.  In the 
current system, even when women are related to the same degree as their male counterparts 
to the deceased, they are not entitled to equal shares. This inequality is explicitly part of the 
CPS, with several articles recalling the principle that the male heir receives a share that is 
double that of a female heir.27 The Working Group is cognizant of the fact that inequalities 
between men and women in inheritance matters are traditionally explained by the 
specificity of inheritance relations in Muslim law aimed at compensating men who have to 
bear the costs linked to the maintenance of the family. However, this rationale is no longer 
appropriate to the situation which has evolved since women have been increasingly 
working outside the home and hence significantly contributing to the maintenance of the 
household, and since unpaid female homeworkers have gained more recognition. To avoid 
the application of Islamic inheritance law, some families execute civil contracts between 
parents and children; however even codified civil law is often subordinated to Islamic law 
at the discretion of judges when the former contradicts their interpretation of Islamic law.28<b> 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Group wishes to highlight the absence of any restrictions bound to religion to 
prevent marriage or inheritance, which clearly demonstrates the will of the legislature to 
remove these barriers, as also demonstrated by some case law in that regard.29 While it is 
difficult to measure the real impact of the CPS on women&#8217;s lives and to analyse the way 
</p>
<p>judges have applied its provisions over the past 50 years, the Working Group nevertheless 
received information about some progressive, but also many regressive, judgements 
whereby, as mentioned earlier, judges use the Sharia as a source of customary law in 
matters concerning family law and inheritance. It also received repeated allegations, which,

</p>
<p>while being difficult to corroborate, point towards some worrisome trends. In Yadh Ben 
Achour&#8217;s own words, &#8220;beginning with the elections of October 23, 2011, a number of 
</p>
<p>controversies developed regarding adoption, polygamy, single mothers, and, generally 
speaking, women&#8217;s rights&#8221;.30  In particular, the Working Group heard repeated concerns 
over the phenomenon of &#8220;<i>orfi</i>&#8221; or customary marriages. While the CPS prohibits customary 
</p>
<p>marriages, imposes an official marriage procedure and sanctions non-compliance with these 
requirements as offences liable to prosecution, &#8220;<i>orfi</i>&#8221; marriages are allegedly increasingly 
tolerated, threatening the &#8220;prohibition of multiple marriages which is regarded as one of the 
</p>
<p>key modernizing provisions of the Personal Status Code.&#8221;31 Declarations by public officials 
have also raised outrage among women&#8217;s rights defenders, such that proclaiming that single 
mothers, and, by association, their children, did not deserve the protection of the law.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Criminal Code 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Criminal Code went through successive reforms, which notably criminalized 
sexual harassment in 2004.  With a view to guaranteeing women&#8217;s right to physical 
</p>
<p>integrity, section 207 of the Criminal Code was deleted because it recognized marriage ties 
as a mitigating circumstance when a husband murdered his wife or her partner upon 
catching them in an act of infidelity. However, the Working Group is concerned at the fact 
that article 218 provides for the termination of proceedings or the vacation of a conviction 
with the withdrawal of the complaint by the victim of an assault32. In 2010, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noteda very high number of 
complaints withdrawals.  Also, although rape is criminalized (art. 227bis), the perpetrator 
can escape criminal prosecution if he marries the victim (art. 239) and marital rape is not 
criminalized.  Furthermore, in sexual harassment cases, article 226quarter, paragraph 3, 
provides that &#8220;if no suit or acquittal is obtained, the person against whom the complaint is 
filed may, if necessary, request reparation for damage incurred without prejudice to 
criminal prosecution for false accusation.&#8221; These articles, which are included in section III 
on offences against public decency, reveal the rationale based on morality underpinning 
these offences and overlook the protection of individual rights.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>38. In response to a call by women&#8217;s rights defenders for the withdrawal of all 
reservations to the Convention and of its general declaration, the interim government issued 
Decree No. 103-2011 on 24 October 2011, authorizing this. However, the internal 
withdrawal process was not followed at the time by the necessary notification to the United 
Nations Secretary General.  Having been assured by the Government of its commitment to 
&#8220;finalizing, in an effective way, and as soon as possible, the process of withdrawing all 
reservations to the CEDAW and especially the general declaration&#8221;,33 the Working Group 
learned subsequently that this issue had been brought to the NCA for further discussion. It 
expressed concern about a recent statement made by the Minister for Religious Affairs, 
who declared that the lifting of reservations to the Convention was a flagrant violation of 
national sovereignty, cultural specificity and the values of Islam. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Institutional architecture 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ministry for Women and the Family  
</b></p>
<p>39. The institutional framework to support women in accessing their human rights, 
including for legal complaint, is situated within the State&#8217;s executive bodies, primarily 
under the coordination of the Ministry for Women, Children and the Elderly (MAFFEPA), 
and in the Tunisian national human rights institution, the Higher Committee for Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (HCHRFF). These institutions play a critical role at this 
time of political transition, when the issue of gender equality is at the core of a national 
debate, characterized by abuse and violence, about the identity and future of the nation.  
</p>
<p>40. The MAFFEPA holds the responsibility of carrying out government policies 
regarding the advancement of the status of women, the spread of a culture of women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, the conduct of research and studies, and coordination with sectors, organizations and 
structures working in the field of women&#8217;s rights, including civil society organizations. Its 
</p>
<p>capacity to carry out its work is, uniquely, supported by three semi-independent sub-
structures: the National Council on Women and Family, an advisory body focusing on most 
policy trends; the Centre for Research, Education, Documentation, and Information on 
Women (CREDIF); and the National Commission on Women and Development, an 
advisory body with the aim of mainstreaming gender approaches in development policies. 
CREDIF is in particular responsible for promoting studies and carrying out research and 
surveys on women and their status in Tunisian society; disseminating information on 
women's rights; and preparing reports on the condition of women. 
</p>
<p>41.  While MAFFEPA is a legacy of the Ben Ali regime, since the revolution it has 
played a proactive role in promoting women&#8217;s rights in the process of political transition. 
The Group recognizes and appreciates the role MAFFEPA has played in broadening the 
space for public discussion on women&#8217;s political participation, including by engaging 
representatives from successive transitional governments and NCA, and in bringing 
together and facilitating communication among women who do not share the same ideology 
with regard to gender issues.  
</p>
<p>42. The Working Group shares the concern expressed by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women34 that while MAFFEPA has the authority to

</p>
<p>deal with complaints based on sex discrimination, no such complaints have been filed in the 
past years.   
</p>
<p><b> B. National human rights institution  
</b></p>
<p>43. Potentially, women in Tunisia also have the opportunity to file human rights 
complaints to HCHRFF. However, this body, with its post-revolution membership, is 
attempting to reform itself in order to better comply with the Paris Principles. A draft law 
was drawn up in September 2011 which states that the Committee shall be composed of 65 
members in addition to representatives of 14 government ministries. It also provides for the 
independence of the Committee, which is entrusted, inter alia, with monitoring human 
rights violations; conducting inquiries and investigation into such violations; receiving 
petitions and complaints from alleged victims; advising relevant authorities on the 
reinforcement of human rights and freedoms; giving its opinion regarding draft laws on 
human rights and fundamental freedoms and carrying out research and studies, and 
organizing events on human rights. The Group notes with satisfaction that the draft includes 
provisions providing for the principle of gender balance in the composition of the 
Committee. It also notes that the Committee&#8217;s own request to be elevated to constitutional 
rank has found a positive resonance in the December 2012 draft text of the constitution.  
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group notes the establishment of the Ministry of Human Rights and 
Transitional Justice, and met with its Minister to better understand its role and potential 
contribution to women&#8217;s human rights, including in transitional justice processes. This 
ministry also holds the authority to receive human rights complaints, alongside HCHRFF, 
which raises the need to articulate the distinct jurisdiction of each institution, together with 
the areas of collaboration and synergy, and to communicate this clearly to the public, 
including women facing multiple forms of discrimination. The Working Group points to the 
importance of consistency and coherence across both institutions in the interests of 
enhancing effective human rights protection and in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. </b>Women&#8217;s participation in economic and social life<b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Tunisian revolution was the culmination of social upheavals which started in 
different regions, particularly those which were economically and socially disadvantaged, 
well before December 2010.  One of the key issues that sparked the social unrest was the 
structural inequalities in economic and social life, economic growth having been limited to 
some sectors and its fruits unevenly distributed among inland and coastal regions of the 
country.  
</p>
<p>46. The Tunisian economy is based on agriculture, mining, energy, tourism, textiles, 
food, and the mechanical, electrical and electronic industries. Tunisia was one of the fastest 
growing economies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and managed to 
invest resources in key social sectors before the recent global financing crisis and political 
revolution unfolded.35 Since 2011 industrial productivity, particularly in the mining sector, 
and economic performance have deteriorated. Profits from tourism have fallen by more 
than one third. Unemployment has consequently increased to 19 per cent, i.e. a figure of 
800,000, for an active population of 3.5 million, compared to the 500,000 unemployed at

</b></p>
<p>the time of the fall of the previous regime.36 The Working Group is concerned that the 
Government&#8217;s inevitable priority of focusing on the search for democratic legitimacy does 
not sideline the urgent need to address crucial social concerns of the population. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>47. According to the last national survey on population and employment (2010), the 
unemployment rate for women was 32.9 per cent as compared with 15.8 per cent for men.37 
Although illiteracy is generally decreasing, the illiteracy rate among women was 26.5 per 
cent while the rate for men was 11.5.38 
</p>
<p>48. Unemployment is not uniformly distributed between regions and between age and 
gender categories. It is significantly higher for some regions and for some groups; youth 
and women have far more trouble finding jobs than male adults. Youth unemployment is 
above 30 per cent; the number of unemployed with higher education and university 
graduates was about 100,000 in 2008, of whom more than half were young women. Overall 
demand for skilled labour is low, and there is also a sizeable skill mismatch. Those who are 
employed have often had to accept jobs below their expectations. The duration of 
unemployment is also increasing. The lack of opportunities acts as an incentive for the 
youth to migrate, initially from the rural and small-town western areas to larger urban areas, 
especially greater Tunis. This has become a push factor for young people to join the rising 
numbers of those involved in international labour migration.39 
</p>
<p>49. Tunisian legislation outlaws discrimination based on sex in the employment sector. 
Article 5(a) of the Labour Code prohibits discrimination between men and women in the 
implementation of the Code and the texts enforcing it. However, the Working Group was 
informed of the persistence of the traditional gender labour divide and a discriminatory job 
market in practice. Despite higher levels of education and qualifications among women, the 
gender divide applies, whereby paid work is reserved for men while women continue to 
perform unpaid household tasks. This division perpetuates arguments legitimizing male 
dominance in economic and family life. Women&#8217;s economic dependence on men puts them 
at risk of violence, exploitation and disempowerment. The greater the family 
responsibilities, the more difficult it is for a woman to enter the job market in the absence 
of supportive policies. The proportion of married women in work in 2008 was 16 per cent 
lower than the national average for women as a whole.40  
</p>
<p>50. Equal pay for work of equal value is guaranteed only in the formal sector, mainly in 
public administration, whereas in the private and informal sectors women earn less than 
men. Many women who work in the informal sector, such as domestic work and 
agriculture, are not covered by social security programmes. In some industrial sectors, such 
as the textile, clothing, and leather and footwear industries, which have the largest female 
workforce, job insecurity is most widespread. Women employed in these sectors are 
therefore the first to suffer illegal or collective redundancy, such as those which occurred 
following the lowering of trade barriers further to an arrangement between the European

<p>Union and Tunisia in 2005, or during financial and economic crises. In addition, in some of 
these sectors trade unions encounter difficulties operating. Women are subject to sexual 
harassment and other forms of violence, as they are mostly young, poorly informed of their 
rights and isolated.41  
</p>
<p>51. Trade unions have historically played an important role in the development of the 
country and participated in advocating for social change. Women have been able to 
participate in trade unions, although the Working Group did not gather sufficient 
information to understand clearly the role women played within them in the struggle for 
equality between men and women. It heard that a multi-sectorial women&#8217;s chamber had 
been created within the Syndicat Patronal, which comprises all industries, with the aim of 
promoting women&#8217;s participation within the sectors/unions, which in the 1980s was still 
insignificant. Since its creation the chamber has had an important role in mobilizing women 
in their sectors of employment.  It now has 24 regional chambers, which represent an 
important network, in touch with women&#8217;s economic realities.  
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group visited the city of Jendouba in the north-west.  At the time of 
the visit, the Governorate had a population of 425,000 inhabitants and a 17.9 per cent 
unemployment rate, including 12,000 university graduates. Almost half of the unemployed 
are women. Historically, Jendouba has been marginalized in terms of development and 
investment policies. This has had a negative impact on the equal enjoyment of economic 
and social rights, including through the depletion of public educational institutions and 
health services, and on progress in the modification of patriarchal family structures and in 
grounding the principle of equality between women and men in society. Exclusion and 
marginalization of certain regions were policies of the old regime as a means of political 
control.  
</p>
<p>53. In Jendouba agriculture is the main source of income and depends primarily on 
female labour, particularly older women, who are ready to accept the sector&#8217;s low wages. 
These older rural women are predominantly casual agricultural labourers, who are collected 
every morning from the streets, transported standing in the back of trucks to the farms, and 
compelled to work long hours for meagre pay. The Working Group heard the testimony of 
one of these women, who explained that her plight was similar to that of others in her 
situation: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wake up at 5 am, my husband is sick and cannot work, I go to the field, pull up 
onions and potatoes, till 6 pm, I get paid USD 3 per day, sometimes the farmers do 
not want to pay me or promise to pay me later and they never do; if I work the 
family eats and if I do not we do not eat; during the school holidays my children 
come with me to work; I studied only until the end of primary school then my father 
took me out of school to work in the fields; I got married at 20; I do not receive any 
form of public assistance, I pay for my husband&#8217;s medical care; I have two children, 
I did not want to have more, what for? To live miserably&#8230;, my parents-in-law live 
with us so I have to provide for them too.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Working Group considers the case of older women in casual agricultural 
employment and young women in casual employment as domestic workers to be forms of 
systemic discrimination in which multiple grounds of discrimination intersect to produce a 
serious violation of economic and social rights.  
</p>
<p>56. It also became evident to the Group that women in rural areas hardly participate in 
public and political life because of lack of education, the necessity to work often under 
inhuman conditions, economic dependency on their families and consequently the 
impossibility of challenging traditional roles and eventually pursuing ambitions of political 
and public careers. In addition restrictions imposed by the previous regime on the 
possibility for civil society organizations to operate freely represented an obstacle to 
women&#8217;s associations being able to reach out to and support women in rural areas to 
</p>
<p>mobilize and claim their rights. The revolution has provided an important opportunity to fill 
this gap, which some women&#8217;s organizations have seized, although the impact of their work 
will take time to translate into concrete changes in the lives of rural women.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Education 
</b></p>
<p>57. Education is a fundamental right and has constituted a considerable investment for 
the country. Outline Act N. 80 of 2002 stipulates that &#8220;education is a national priority; 
school attendance is compulsory from ages 6 to 16; education is a fundamental right 
guaranteed to all Tunisians without discrimination on the grounds of sex, social origin, 
colour or religion&#8221;. Enrolment of children has been almost universal since 1997/98;42 in 
2011/12, for example, the enrolment rate for girls between 6 and 11 years of age was 
99.1 per cent.43  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group regrets that such investment in education has not borne fruit, 
particularly for women, as they continue to be discriminated against in the labour market.  
Despite the fact that more girls than boys are enrolled in secondary school and that gross 
enrolment data for tertiary education also showed a higher enrolment ratio for women, 
women&#8217;s economic participation remains low. The labour force participation rate among 
women aged 15 and above was only 26 per cent, compared to 71 per cent for men. Among 
young women aged 15-24 the labour force participation rate was 22 per cent, while for 
young men it was 43 per cent.44 The Group heard that many young women graduates have 
no other option but to return to their parents&#8217; home and sometimes do not have the 
resources to access the Internet for job hunting. 
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group received testimonies reflecting the reality that educational 
institutions have become one of the arenas in which the ideological battle is being waged 
for the future of Tunisia. The case of the university dean referred to in paragraph 19 is a 
case in point. While the dean believes he was upholding the standards of his profession and 
giving all youth the equal opportunity to education by prohibiting clothes that would 
prevent anyone from acquiring knowledge, he has been accused of discriminating against 
women. This case is still pending in court but in the meantime has triggered mass 
mobilization on both sides in the debate.  
</p>
<p>60. It was also brought to the attention of the Group that the impact of deteriorating 
schools went beyond shaping the future opportunities of individual students. It also

<p>influenced the availability of spaces for youth engagement in extra-curricular activities, 
such as in sports and culture. School-based youth centres and clubs which used to be open 
to the public had been closed down, further isolating schools from the public life of their 
community. The Working Group would like to emphasize the importance of schools, 
including in their extracurricular activities, in enhancing the capacity of young boys and 
girls to exercise their right to participate in cultural life, as defined by the Special 
Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>61. Further to its dialogue with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Mufthi of the 
Republic, the Group notes the importance of an active role by these institutions in 
promoting the principle of equality and non-discrimination between men and women in all 
fields of life. The changing realities of women and men in Tunisian society have called for 
the renewal of religious institutions, including mosques and the diverse forms of religious 
education. The Working Group is of the view that the right to education includes access to 
human rights education in diverse religious contexts. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>62. Throughout this report, the Working Group has identified a number of good 
practices relating to the elimination of laws that discriminate against women or are 
discriminatory in terms of implementation or impact. Here, it would like to highlight those 
in relation to women&#8217;s equal opportunity for political participation and to the capacity to 
systematically address one of the main obstacles to women&#8217;s full and active participation in 
</p>
<p>political and public life, women&#8217;s health.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Parity in the electoral law of 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/50/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. National Office for Family and Population 
</b></p>
<p>64. Since the 1960s, Tunisia has introduced a progressive family planning programme 
as a means to reinforce women&#8217;s ability to manage the family in a way permitting her to be 
active outside of the home. This programme is run by the National Office for Family and 
Population (ONFP), which is associated with but independent from the Ministry of Health. 
ONFP, established in 1973 under the name of &#8220;National Family Planning&#8221;, has centres in 
each of the country&#8217;s 24 governorates. It develops, implements, monitors and assesses 
several programmes aimed at improving and ensuring universal access to sexual and 
reproductive health, contributing thereby to the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals. These programmes target women of reproductive age, adolescents and 
youth, men, couples and women victims of gender-based violence. Those offices provide a 
wide range of services free of charge, including family planning and contraception, 
antenatal and postnatal consultations, the fight against women&#8217;s cancers, prevention of 
sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents 
and young people and psychological support for women victims of violence. ONFP staff 
perform administrative, medical, paramedical, and educational and social work. ONFP has 
been recognized internationally for its qualitative and quantitative results by the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 2004 and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 
2009.   
</p>
<p>65. ONFP has been instrumental in improving the health status and access to 
reproductive health services of Tunisian women, and in particular those living in rural 
areas. In Jendouba, 70 per cent of the population lives in rural and often remote areas and a 
high percentage of women give birth at home.  To reach out to those women and help them 
overcome geographical and economic obstacles, ONFP has mobile teams. Despite the 
challenges, ONFP was able to continue providing its services during and after the 
Revolution. 
</p>
<p>66. In 1965, Tunisia was the first Muslim country to legalize abortion during the first 
three months of pregnancy for women who already have more than five children.  In 1973, 
article 214 of the Criminal Code authorized the performance of abortions on request during 
the first three months of pregnancy independently of the number of children already born.  
</p>
<p>67. The Group learned however that the resources of ONFP offices have been curtailed 
throughout the years. The office in Jendouba, for example, was not provided with the 
services of a gynaecologist to perform surgical abortions for seven years, despite the 
existence of the necessary equipment on its premises. The Office&#8217;s mandate may also risk 
being integrated with the national health services, which lack the specialization and 
experience in family planning programmes and services. A growing trend of difficulties in 
accessing abortion services was reported, which had also been recognized by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2010,47 in particular 
with regard to single women but also for married women. ONFP stopped providing services 
for abortion in 10 districts in 2007 due to budgetary constraints.

<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> </b>Tunisia has long been hailed as a bastion of women&#8217;s rights in the Arab <b>world, 
since the promulgation of the Personal Status Code (CPS) and its subsequent reforms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>As a result, women pursued their education and entered the workforce, birth rates 
</b></p>
<p><b>declined and a growing middle class emerged.  However, in the context of a highly

</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Working Group also recommends that the Higher Committee for Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and other independent national institutions
