<p><b>2006/&#8230;  The right to development 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, recalling resolution 2005/4 of 12 April 2005 and recalling 
also all General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights resolutions on the right to 
development, decides: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reaffirm its previous requests, contained in resolution 1/4 of 30 June 2006, to 
the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development and to the Working 
Group on the Right to Development to meet prior to the fourth session of the Council in 
March/April 2007; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To act to ensure that its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development 
and the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and in this regard, to agree on a 
programme that will lead to raising the right to development to the same level so that it is on a 
par with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the core human rights 
instruments; 
</p>
<p>GE.06-14301  (E)    031006 </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To request the high-level task force and the Working Group in the discharge of 
their mandates to take into account the needs: 
</p>
<p>(i) To promote the democratization of the system of international governance in 
order to increase the effective participation of developing countries in 
international decision-making; 
</p>
<p>(ii) To promote also effective partnerships such as the New Partnership for 
Africa&#8217;s Development and other similar initiatives with the developing 
countries, particularly the least developed countries, for the purpose of the 
realization of their right to development, including the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals; 
</p>
<p>(iii) To strive for greater acceptance and operationalization and realization of the 
right to development at the international level, urging all States to undertake 
at the national level necessary policy formulation and institute measures 
required for the implementation of the right to development as a fundamental 
human right, and further urging all States to expand and deepen mutually 
beneficial cooperation in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development in the context of promoting effective international cooperation 
for the realization of the right to development, bearing in mind that lasting 
progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires 
effective development policies at the national level as well as equitable 
economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the 
international level; 
</p>
<p>(iv) To consider ways and means to ensure the operationalization of the right to 
development as a priority, including through the elaboration of a convention 
on the right to development; 
</p>
<p>(v) To mainstream the right to development in the policies and operational 
activities of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, programmes 
and funds as well as in policies and strategies of the international financial 
and multilateral trading system, taking into account in this regard that the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>core principles of the international economic, commercial and financial 
spheres, such as equity, non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, 
participation and international cooperation, including effective partnerships 
for development, are indispensable in achieving the right to development and 
preventing discriminatory treatment in the issues of concern to the 
developing countries arising out of political or other non-economic 
considerations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to continue to take all the necessary measures and allocate the necessary resources for the 
effective implementation of the present decision; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To reaffirm its previous decision to consider the report of the Working Group on 
the Right to Development on its next session at the fourth session of the Council.
