Attention:
Paul Huet, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Dear Sir:
Re: Private Placement of Subscription Receipts
GMP Securities L.P. (“GMP”), BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. (“BMO” and, together with GMP, the 
“Co-Lead  Underwriters”),  Canaccord  Genuity  Corp.,  Clarus  Securities  Inc.,  RBC  Dominion 
Securities Inc., M Partners Inc., Mackie Research Capital Corporation, Dundee Securities Ltd., 
HSBC  Securities  (Canada)  Inc.,  National  Bank  Financial  Inc.,  Paradigm  Capital  Inc., 
PI Financial Corp., Rodman & Renshaw a unit of H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC and Haywood 
Securities  Inc.,  (collectively,  with  the  Co-Lead  Underwriters,  the  “Underwriters”  and  each 
individually,  an  “Underwriter”),  understand  that  Klondex  Mines  Ltd.  (the  “Corporation”) 
proposes  to  issue  and  sell  to  the  Underwriters,  or  to  the  Substituted  Purchasers  (as  defined 
below),  22,900,000  subscription  receipts  (the  “Initial  Subscription  Receipts”)  at  a  price  of 
$5.00 per Subscription Receipt (the “Issue Price”) for aggregate gross proceeds of $114,500,000 
(the “Offering”).
In  addition, the Corporation hereby  grants to the Underwriters an option (the “Underwriters’ 
Option”)  to  purchase,  severally  and  not  jointly,  in  the  respective  percentages  set  forth  in 
to  an  additional  3,000,000  Subscription  Receipts  (the  “Additional 
Section 14(a),  up 
Subscription Receipts” and together with the Initial Subscription Receipts, the “Subscription 
Receipts”)  at  the  Issue  Price  per  Additional  Subscription  Receipt.  The  Underwriters’  Option 
may be exercised in whole or in part at any time up to 48 hours prior to the Closing Date (as 
defined below) by written notice from GMP, on behalf of the Underwriters, to the Corporation 
setting forth the aggregate number of Additional Subscription Receipts to be purchased.
Although  the  offer  to  purchase  the  Initial  Subscription  Receipts  is  being  made  by  the 
Underwriters as Purchaser (as defined below), the Underwriters will endeavour to arrange for 
substituted purchasers (collectively, the “Substituted Purchasers”) for the Initial Subscription 
Receipts (and any Additional Subscription Receipts) in the Qualifying Jurisdictions (as defined 
below)  with  the  effect  that  such  Substituted  Purchasers  will  be  the  initial  Purchasers  of  the 
Subscription Receipts. To the extent that Substituted Purchasers purchase Subscription Receipts 
at  the  Closing  (as  defined  below),  the  Underwriters  shall  not  be  obligated  to  purchase  the 
Subscription Receipts so purchased by such Substituted Purchasers.
The  Subscription  Receipts  will  be  created  pursuant  to  a  subscription  receipt  agreement  (the 
“Subscription  Receipt  Agreement”)  among  the  Corporation,  the  Co-Lead  Underwriters,  on 
their own behalf and on behalf of the other Underwriters, and Computershare Trust Company of 
Canada, as subscription receipt agent (the “Subscription Receipt Agent”), to be dated as of the
- 2 -
Closing Date. Each Subscription Receipt will entitle the holder to receive, upon satisfaction of 
the  Escrow  Release  Conditions  (as  defined  below)  and  without  payment  of  additional 
consideration or further action on the part of the holders of the Subscription Receipts, one special 
warrant (a “Special Warrant”).
The Special Warrants shall be issued pursuant to, and governed by, a special warrant indenture 
(the “Special Warrant Indenture”) to be entered into effective on the Closing Date between the 
Corporation  and  Computershare  Trust  Company  of  Canada,  as  special  warrant  agent  for  the 
Corporation  (the  “Special  Warrant  Agent”).  Subject  to  the  conditions  described  in  this 
Agreement  (as  defined  below),  each  Special  Warrant  will  entitle  the  holder  to  receive  upon 
exercise  or  deemed  exercise,  without  payment  of  any  additional  consideration,  one  Common 
Share  (as  defined  below)  (each,  an  “Underlying  Share”).  The  Special  Warrants  not  already 
exercised will be deemed exercised at the earlier of: (i) the date that is the third Business Day (as 
defined below) after the date of a receipt for a final short-form prospectus of the Corporation 
qualifying the distribution of the Underlying Shares in the Qualifying Jurisdictions (as defined 
below)  (the  “Qualification  Date”);  and  (ii) 4:59  p.m.  (Toronto  time)  on  the  date  that  is  four 
months and one day following the Closing Date.
The gross proceeds from the Offering, less an amount representing the Underwriters’ expenses 
and out-of-pocket costs and legal expenses and 50 percent of the Commission (as defined below) 
(the “Escrowed Proceeds”), will be deposited at the Closing Time (as defined below) in escrow 
with the Subscription Receipt Agent and invested in interest-bearing trust accounts maintained 
by the Subscription Receipt Agent or otherwise invested in such manner as is acceptable to the 
Corporation  and  the  Underwriters,  pending  satisfaction  of  the  Escrow  Release  Conditions. 
Provided that the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on 
the date which is 90 days following the Closing Date (as defined below) (the “Escrow Release 
Deadline”), the Subscription Receipt Agent will: (i) release an amount representing 50% of the 
Commission plus any interest accrued and actually earned thereon to or at the direction of the 
Co-Lead  Underwriters,  and  (ii)  release  all  of  the  remaining  Escrow  Funds  (as  such  term  is 
defined in the Subscription Receipt Agreement) to or at the direction of the Corporation. Each 
Subscription Receipt will be automatically exchanged for one Special Warrant without payment 
of  additional  consideration  and  without  any  further  action  by  the  holder.  If  (i) the  Escrow 
Release  Conditions  are  not  satisfied  prior  to  the  Escrow  Release  Deadline;  or  (ii) prior  to  the 
Escrow Release Deadline the Corporation advises the Underwriters or announces to the public 
that  it  does  not  intend  to  satisfy  any  of  the  Escrow  Release  Conditions  (each  such  event,  a 
“Termination  Event”),  the  Subscription  Receipt  Agent  will  return  to  each  holder  of 
Subscription Receipts, within three Business Days following the Termination Event, an amount 
equal to the aggregate Offering Price of the Subscription Receipts held by such holder and their 
pro rata portion of interest and other income earned (if any) on the Escrowed Proceeds and their 
pro  rata  portion  of  interest  and  other  income  that  would  otherwise  have  been  earned  on  50 
percent of the Commission and the expenses and out-of-pocket costs and legal expenses of the 
Underwriters, as if such amounts had been held in escrow as part of the Escrowed Proceeds and 
not paid to the Underwriters on the Closing Date (less applicable withholding tax, if any) and the 
Subscription Receipts shall be canceled.
- 3 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Underwriters may offer and sell the 
Subscription  Receipts  on  a  private  placement  basis  in  the  Selling  Jurisdictions  (as  defined 
below), to purchasers in Canada, through their U.S. Affiliates (as defined below) to purchasers in 
the United States (as defined below) that are U.S. Accredited Investors (as defined below), in 
transactions  that  are  exempt  from  or  not  subject  to  the  registration  requirements  of  the  U.S. 
Securities Act (as defined below) and applicable state securities law, and to purchasers in certain 
jurisdictions agreed to by the Corporation and the Underwriters, all in the manner contemplated 
by this Agreement, including Schedule A hereto, which forms a part of this Agreement.
The Corporation agrees that the Underwriters shall be permitted to appoint, at their sole expense, 
other registered dealers or other dealers duly qualified in their respective jurisdictions, as their 
Underwriters, to assist in the Offering in the Selling Jurisdictions and that the Underwriters may 
determine, and shall be  solely responsible for, the remuneration payable to such other dealers 
appointed by them.
In consideration of the Underwriters’ services to be rendered in connection with the Offering, 
including  assisting  in  preparing  documentation  relating  to  the  Subscription  Receipts  and 
distributing the Subscription Receipts, directly and through other investment dealers and brokers, 
the Corporation shall pay to the Underwriters a cash fee (the “Commission”) equal to the sum 
of: (i) 5.0% of the aggregate purchase price of Subscription Receipts sold under the Offering to 
Subscribers  that  are  not  on  the  President’s  List  (as  described  below);  and  (ii)  2.5%  of  the 
aggregate purchase price of Subscription Receipts sold under the Offering to Subscribers on the 
President’s  List  that  are  designated  by  the  Corporation  and  Co-Lead  Underwriters  as  being 
associated  with  a  fee  payable  to  the  Underwriters  (the  “Designated  Purchasers”).  For  the 
avoidance  of  doubt,  the  Commission  will  not  include  any  amount  in  respect  of  Subscription 
Receipts sold under the Offering to Subscribers on the President’s List who are not Designated 
Purchasers.

Nature of Transaction
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
The Corporation understands that, although the offer to purchase the Subscription 
Receipts is being made by the Underwriters as Purchaser, the Underwriters will 
endeavour to arrange for Substituted Purchasers for the Subscription Receipts in 
the  Qualifying  Jurisdictions,  subject  to  acceptance  by  the  Corporation,  acting 
reasonably, of the Subscription Agreements, with the effect that such Substituted 
Purchasers shall be the initial Purchasers of the applicable Subscription Receipts.  
The  Underwriters  acknowledge  that,  subject  to  the  conditions  contained  in 
Section 11 being satisfied and subject to the rights of the Underwriters contained 
in Section 16, the Underwriters are obligated to purchase or cause to be purchased 
all of the Initial Subscription Receipts. To the extent that Substituted Purchasers 
purchase Initial Subscription Receipts at the Closing, the Underwriter shall not be 
obligated  to  purchase  the  Initial  Subscription  Receipts  so  purchased  by  such 
Substituted Purchasers.
Each Purchaser resident in Canada shall purchase the Subscription Receipts under 
a  Private  Placement  Exemption.  The  Underwriters  will  notify  the  Corporation 
with  respect  to  the  identity  of  any  Purchaser  as  soon  as  practicable  and  with  a 
view to leaving sufficient time to allow the Corporation to secure compliance with 
all  relevant  regulatory  requirements  of  the  applicable  Qualifying  Jurisdictions 
relating to the sale of the Subscription Receipts.  The Corporation undertakes to 
file  or  cause  to  be  filed  all  forms  or  undertakings  required  to  be  filed  by  the 
Corporation and to pay all filing fees in connection with the purchase and sale of 
the Subscription Receipts so that the distribution of such securities may lawfully 
occur without the necessity of filing a prospectus or an offering memorandum in 
Canada or  comparable document elsewhere. The Underwriters undertake to use 
commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  cause  Purchasers  to  complete  any  forms 
required by Applicable Securities Laws.
The  Corporation  understands  and  agrees  that  the  Underwriters  may  arrange  for 
Purchasers of the Subscription Receipts in jurisdictions other than Canada or the 
United States, on a private placement basis, provided that the purchase and sale of 
such Subscription Receipts do not contravene the Applicable Securities Laws of 
the jurisdiction where the Purchaser is resident and provided that such sale does 
not  trigger:  (i)  any  obligation  to  prepare  and  file  a  prospectus,  registration 
statement  or  similar  disclosure  document;  or  (ii)  any  registration  or  other 
obligation  on  the  part  of  the  Corporation  including,  but  not  limited,  to  any 
continuing obligation in that jurisdiction.

Receipts,  and  each  certificate  or  ownership  statement  issued  in  transfer  of  the 
Subscription Receipts prior to the date which is four months and one day after the 
Closing Date, will bear or be deemed to bear, as applicable, the following legends

or any trade of any of its securities, (ii) obligate the Corporation to establish or 
maintain any office or director or officer in such jurisdiction, or (iii) subject the 
Corporation  to  any  reporting  or  other  requirement  in  such  jurisdiction,  if  any,

Accordingly,  the  Corporation  and  each  of  the  Underwriters,  severally  and  not  jointly,  hereby

- 17 -
(i)
(ii)
any  material  fact  which  has  arisen  or  been  discovered  and  would  have

Prospectus; and
any change in any material fact (which for the purposes of this Agreement 
shall be deemed to include the disclosure of any  previously undisclosed 
material fact) which fact or change is, or may be, of such a nature as to 
render any statement in the Qualification Prospectus misleading or untrue 
or which would result in a misrepresentation or which would result in the 
Qualification Prospectus not complying with Applicable Securities Laws.
The Corporation shall in good faith discuss with the Underwriters any fact or change in 
circumstances (actual or anticipated) which is of such a nature that there is reasonable

prepare and file such Prospectus Amendment with the appropriate securities regulatory 
authority in each of the Qualifying Jurisdictions where such filing is required.

form and content of such Prospectus Amendment or other document, which approval will 
not be unreasonably withheld. The Corporation shall cooperate in all respects with the 
Underwriters to allow and assist the Underwriters to participate fully in the preparation of 
any Prospectus Amendment and shall allow the Underwriters to conduct any and all “due 
diligence”  investigations  which  in  the  opinion  of  the  Underwriters  are  reasonably 
required  in  order  to  enable  the  Underwriters  to  responsibly  execute  any  certificates 
required to be executed by the Underwriters in any Prospectus Amendment and to fulfil 
their obligations under Applicable Securities Laws, including applicable U.S. Securities 
Laws.

Subject to Section 14(b), if any Underwriter fails to purchase its applicable percentage of 
Subscription  Receipts  at  the  Closing  Time  as  set  forth  above  (the  “Defaulted 
Securities”), and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default by such Underwriter 
in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Underwriters which are 
not  so  in  default  shall  be  relieved  of  all  obligations  to  the  Corporation  and  shall  be 
entitled to either (i) take up and pay for the Defaulted Securities, in which case the non-
defaulting  Underwriters  shall  have  the  right  to  postpone  the  Closing  Time  for  such 
period,  not  exceeding  three  Business  Days,  as  it  shall  determine  and  notify  the 
Corporation  in  order  that  the  required  changes,  if  any,  to  the  documents  or  other 
arrangements  as  may  be  effected,  or  (ii) terminate  their  obligations  to  purchase  their 
applicable  percentage  of  Subscription  Receipts  agreed  to  be  purchased  by  them  as  set 
forth  above.  Nothing  in  this  Agreement  shall  obligate  the  Corporation  to  sell  any 
Subscription Receipts unless all and not less than all the Subscription Receipts agreed to 
be  purchased  are  purchased  by  the  Underwriters  and  nothing  in  this  Agreement  will 
relieve any Underwriter which is in default from liability for its default to the Corporation 
or  the  other  Underwriter.  In  the  event  of  a  termination  by  the  Corporation  of  its 
obligations  under  this  Agreement,  there  shall  be  no  further  liability  on  the  part  of  the 
Corporation to the Underwriters except in respect of any liability which may have arisen 
or may arise under Sections 13, 17 and 18. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate a 
U.S.  Affiliate  of  any  of  the  Underwriters  to  purchase  Subscription  Receipts.  Any  U.S. 
broker-dealer that makes offers and sales of the Subscription Receipts will do so only as 
an agent for an Underwriter.
(b)
Rights to Purchase of the Other Underwriter
If  any  of  the  Underwriters  shall  exercise  its  right  of  termination  under  Section 16,  the 
other remaining Underwriter shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to offer or 
purchase all of the Subscription Receipts which would otherwise have been purchased by 
such Underwriter which has so exercised its right of termination.
(c)
Change to Offering Price
After  the  Underwriters  have  made  reasonable  efforts  to  sell  all  of  the  Subscription 
Receipts at the Issue Price, such price may be decreased and further changed from time to 
time to an amount not greater than the Issue Price; provided, however, that in no event 
shall the Corporation receive net proceeds of less than $4.75 per Subscription Receipt.

any  securities  convertible  into  or  exchangeable  for  or  exercisable  to  acquire  Common  Shares 
without  the  prior  consent  of  the  Co-Lead  Underwriters  (such  consent  not  to  be  unreasonably 
withheld), except in conjunction with: (i) the grant or exercise of stock option and other similar 
issuances pursuant to the stock option plan and restricted share plan of the Corporation, the share 
incentive plan of the Corporation and other share compensation arrangements including, for the 
avoidance  of  doubt,  the  sale  of  any  shares  issued  thereunder;  (ii)  outstanding  warrants;

Underwriters  (or  any  of  them),  has  or  would  be  expected  to  have  a  significant 
adverse effect on the market price or value of the Subscription Receipts, or any 
other securities of the Corporation, any of the Underwriters shall be entitled, at its 
option  and  in  accordance  with  Section 16(e),  to  terminate  its  obligations  under 
this  Agreement  by  written  notice  to  that  effect  given  to  the  Corporation  at  any

announced  or  threatened  or  any  order  made  by  any  federal,  provincial,  state, 
municipal or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency 
or instrumentality including, without limitation, the TSX, the NYSE MKT or any 
securities  regulatory  authority  or  any  law  or  regulation  is  enacted  or  changed 
which  in  the  opinion  of  the  Underwriters  (or  any  of  them),  acting  reasonably, 
operates  to  prevent  or  restrict  the  trading  of  the  common  shares  or  any  other 
securities of the Corporation or materially and adversely affects or will materially 
and adversely affect the market price or value of the Subscription Receipts or any 
other securities of the Corporation, any of the Underwriters shall be entitled, at its

prior to the Closing Time.

terrorism)  or  any  law  or  regulation  which  in  the  reasonable  opinion  of  the 
Underwriters (or any of them) seriously adversely affects, or involves, or will, or 
could  reasonably  be  expected  to,  seriously  adversely  affect,  or  involve,  the 
financial markets or the business, operations or affairs of the Corporation and its 
subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Material Properties or the Hollister Acquisition, 
any  of  the  Underwriters  shall  be  entitled,  at  its  option  and  in  accordance  with 
Section 16(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice 
to that effect given to the Corporation at any time at or prior to the Closing Time.
(d)
Non-Compliance with Conditions
The  Corporation  agrees  that  all  terms  and  conditions  in  Section 11  shall  be 
construed  as  conditions  and  complied  with  so  far  as  they  relate  to  acts  to  be 
performed or caused to be performed by it, that it will use its best efforts to cause 
such  conditions  to  be  complied  with,  and  that  any  breach  or  failure  by  the 
Corporation  to  comply  with  any  such  conditions  shall  entitle  any  of  the 
Underwriters  to  terminate  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement  to  purchase  the 
Subscription Receipts by notice to that effect given to the Corporation at any time 
at  or  prior  to  the  Closing  Time,  unless  otherwise  expressly  provided  in  this 
Agreement. Each Underwriter may waive, in whole or in part, or extend the time 
for compliance with, any terms and conditions without prejudice to its rights in 
respect of any other terms and conditions or any  other or subsequent breach or 
non-compliance,  provided  that  any  such  waiver  or  extension  shall  be  binding 
upon an Underwriter only if such waiver or extension is in writing and signed by 
the Underwriter.
(e)

The  rights  of  termination  contained  in  Sections 16(a),  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  may  be 
exercised by any of the  Underwriters and  are in addition to any  other  rights or 
remedies  any  of  the  Underwriters  may  have  in  respect  of  any  default,  act  or 
failure  to  act  or  non-compliance  by  the  Corporation  in  respect  of  any  of  the 
matters contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. In the event of any such 
termination, there shall be no further liability on the part of the Underwriters to 
the Corporation or on the part of the Corporation to the Underwriters except in 
respect  of  any  liability  which  may  have  arisen  prior  to  or  arise  after  such 
termination  under  Sections 13,  17  and  18.  A  notice  of  termination  given  by  an 
Underwriter under Sections 16(a), (b), (c) and (d) shall not be binding upon any 
other Underwriter who has not also executed such notice.

Indemnity
(a)
Rights of Indemnity
The Corporation agrees to indemnify and save harmless each of the Underwriters 
and  each  of  their  affiliates,  directors,  officers,  employees  and  agents  from  and 
against  all  liabilities,  claims,  losses,  costs,  damages  and  expenses  (including 
without limitation any legal fees or other expenses reasonably incurred by such 
persons  in  connection  with  defending  or  investigating  any  of  the  above,  which 
legal  fees  and  other  expenses  the  Corporation  shall  reimburse  such  persons  for 
forthwith upon demand), but excluding any loss of profits and other consequential 
damages,  in  any  way  caused  by,  or  arising  directly  or  indirectly  from,  or  in 
consequence of:
any  information  or  statement  contained  in  the  Subscription  Agreements, 
the  Documents  or  the  Public  Record  (other  than  any  information  or 
statement  relating  solely  to  the  Underwriters  and  furnished  to  the 
Corporation by the Underwriters in writing expressly for inclusion in the 
Subscription  Agreements),  which  is  or  is  alleged  to  be  untrue  or  any 
omission or alleged omission to provide any information or state any fact 
the omission of which makes or is alleged to make any such information 
or statement untrue or misleading in light of the circumstances in which it 
was made;
alleged  misrepresentation
any  misrepresentation  or 
a 
misrepresentation  which  is  based  upon  information  relating  to  the 
Underwriters  and  furnished  to  the  Corporation  by  the  Underwriters  in 
writing expressly for inclusion in the Subscription Agreements) contained 
in the Material Agreements, the Documents or the Public Record;
(except
any prohibition or restriction of trading in the securities of the Corporation 
or  any  prohibition  or  restriction  affecting  the  distribution  of  the 
Subscription  Receipts,  the  Special  Warrants  or  the  Underlying  Shares 
imposed  by  any  competent  authority  if  such  prohibition  or  restriction  is 
based  on  any  misrepresentation  or  alleged  misrepresentation  of  a  kind 
referred to in Section 17(a)(ii);
any order made or any inquiry, investigation (whether formal or informal) 
or  other  proceeding  commenced  or  threatened  by  any  one  or  more 
competent  authorities  (not  based  upon  the  activities  or  the  alleged 
activities of the Underwriters or its banking or selling group members, if 
any)  relating  to  or  materially  affecting  the  trading  or  distribution  of  the 
Subscription Receipts, the Special Warrants or the Underlying Shares; or
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
- 38 -
(v)
any breach of, default under or non-compliance by the Corporation with 
any  representation,  warranty, 
the  Material 
Agreements or any requirement of Applicable Securities Laws,
term  or  condition  of
provided that the indemnity provided in this Section 17 shall not apply in respect 
of an Indemnified Party in the event and to the extent that a court of competent 
jurisdiction or a regulatory  authority in a final judgment  from  which no appeal 
can be made shall determine that an Indemnified Party was negligent or guilty of 
wilful misconduct and that such negligence or wilful misconduct was the cause of 
such Claims.
(b)
Notification of Claims
If  any  matter  or  thing  contemplated  by  Section 17(a)  (any  such  matter  or  thing 
being  referred  to  as  a  “Claim”)  is  asserted  against  any  person  or  company  in 
respect  of  which  indemnification  is  or  might  reasonably  be  considered  to  be 
provided,  such  person  or  company  (the  “Indemnified  Party”)  will  notify  the 
Corporation as soon as possible of the nature of such Claim (but the omission to 
so notify the Corporation of any potential Claim shall not relieve the Corporation 
from any liability which it may have to any Indemnified Party and any omission 
so  to  notify  the  Corporation  of  any  actual  Claim  shall  affect  the  Corporation’s 
liability  only  to  the  extent  that  the  Corporation  is  materially  prejudiced  by  that 
failure). The Corporation shall assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce 
such Claim, provided, however, that:
(i)
(ii)
the  defence  shall  be  conducted  through  legal  counsel  acceptable  to  the 
Indemnified Party, acting reasonably; and
no settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be made by 
the Corporation without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, 
acting  reasonably,  unless  such  settlement  includes  an  unconditional 
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action 
or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, 
culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
(c)
Right of Indemnity in Favour of Others
With  respect  to  any  Indemnified  Party  who  is  not  a  party  to  the  Material 
Agreements, the Underwriters shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this 
Section 17 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party.
(d)
Retaining Counsel
In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain one counsel 
of the Indemnified Party’s choice to act on his, her or its behalf, provided that the 
fees  and  disbursements  of  such  counsel  shall  be  paid  by  the  Indemnified  Party 
unless:
- 39 -
(i)
(ii)
the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to 
the retention of the other counsel;
the  named  parties  to  any  such  Claim  (including  any  added  third  or 
impleaded party) include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation 
and  the  representation  of  both  parties  by  the  same  counsel  would  be 
inappropriate  due  to  the  actual  or  potential  differing  interests  between 
them; or
(iii)
the  Corporation  shall  not  have  retained  counsel  within  seven  Business 
Days  following  receipt  by  the  Corporation  of  notice  of  any  such  Claim 
from the Indemnified Party.
18.
Contribution
(a)
Rights of Contribution
In order to provide for a just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which 
the indemnity provided in Section 17 would otherwise be available in accordance 
with its terms but is, for any reason, held to be unavailable to or unenforceable by 
the Underwriters or enforceable otherwise than in accordance with its terms, the 
Corporation and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate of all claims, 
expenses, costs and liabilities and all losses (other than loss of profits) of a nature 
contemplated by Section 17 in such proportions so that the Underwriters shall be 
responsible  for  the  portion  represented  by  the  percentage  that  the  aggregate 
Commission  under  this  Agreement  bears  to  the  aggregate  offering  price  of  the 
Subscription Receipts being sold by the Corporation and the Corporation shall be 
responsible for the balance, whether or not they have been sued together or sued 
separately, provided, however, that:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
the  Underwriters  shall  not  in  any  event  be  liable  to  contribute,  in  the 
aggregate,  any  amounts  in  excess  of  the  aggregate  Commission  actually 
received by the Underwriters from the Corporation under this Agreement;
each  Underwriter  shall  not  in  any  event  be  liable  to  contribute, 
individually,  any  amount  in  excess  of  such  Underwriter’s  portion  of  the 
aggregate Commission actually received from the Corporation under this 
Agreement; and
no  party  who  has  engaged  in  any  fraud,  fraudulent  misrepresentation  or 
gross negligence shall be entitled to claim contribution from any person 
who has not engaged in such fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or gross 
negligence.
- 40 -
(b)
Rights of Contribution in Addition to Other Rights
The rights to contribution provided in this Section 18 shall be in addition to and 
not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the Underwriters may 
have by statute or otherwise at law.
(c)
Calculation of Contribution
In the event that the Corporation may be held to be entitled to contribution from 
the  Underwriters  under  the  provisions  of  any  statute  or  at  law,  the  Corporation 
shall be limited to contribution in an amount not exceeding the lesser of:
(i)
(ii)
the portion of the full amount of the loss or liability  giving rise to such 
contribution for which the Underwriters are responsible, as determined in 
Section 18(a); and
the amount of the Commission actually received by the Underwriters from 
the  Corporation  under  this  Agreement,  and  an  Underwriter  shall  in  no 
event be liable to contribute, individually, any amount in excess of such 
Underwriter’s portion of the aggregate Commission actually received from 
the Corporation under this Agreement.
(d)
Notice
If the Underwriters have reason to believe that a claim for contribution may arise, 
they  shall  give  the  Corporation  notice  of  such  claim  in  writing,  as  soon  as 
reasonably  possible,  but  failure  to  notify  the  Corporation  shall  not  relieve  the 
Corporation of any obligation which it may have to the Underwriters under this 
Section 18.
(e)
Right of Contribution in Favour of Others
With respect to this Section 18, the Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the 
Underwriters are contracting on their own behalf and as agents for their affiliates, 
directors, officers, employees and agents.
For purposes of this Section 18, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter 
within the meaning of Section 16 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 21 of the 
United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange 
Act”)  and  each  Underwriter’s  affiliates  and  selling  agents  shall  have  the  same 
rights to contribution as such Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls 
the Corporation within the meaning of Section 16 of the U.S. Securities Act or 
Section 21 of the U.S. Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as 
the Corporation.
- 41 -
(f)
Remedy Not Exclusive
The remedies provided for in this Section 18 are not exclusive and shall not limit 
any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any party at law or in 
equity.
19.
Survival of Representations and Warranties
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the 
Corporation  and  the  Underwriters,  as  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  or  made  by  or  on  behalf  of 
them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of 
any investigation (or any statement as to the results of any investigation) made by or on behalf of 
the  Underwriters  or  the  Corporation  and  shall  survive  delivery  of  and  payment  for  the 
Subscription  Receipts  and  the  subsequent  disposition  of  the  Subscription  Receipts  by  the 
Underwriters or the termination of the Underwriters’ obligations under this Agreement.
20.
Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, 
it shall be deemed not to affect or impair the validity of any other provision of this Agreement 
and such void or unenforceable provision shall be severable from this Agreement.
21.
Time
Time  is  of  the  essence  in  the  performance  of  the  parties’  respective  obligations  under  this 
Agreement.
22.  Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province 
of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable in the Province of Ontario.

group formed by them, as to whom the Corporation makes no representation, warranty, 
acknowledgement, covenant or agreement) has engaged or will engage in any Directed 
Selling  Efforts  or  has  taken  or  will  take  any  action  that  would  cause  the  applicable

cause the exemption from registration set forth in Rule 506(b) of Regulation D to become 
unavailable with respect to the offer and sale of the Subscription Receipts in the United 
States.
Neither the Corporation nor any of its predecessors or affiliates has been subject to any 
order,  judgment  or  decree  of  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  temporarily,

requirements  of  applicable  exemptions  from  registration  or  qualification  of  the 
Subscription Receipts under such laws.

securities under the U.S. Exchange Act revoked by the SEC pursuant to Section 12(j) of 
the U.S. Exchange Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.

EXHIBIT I TO SCHEDULE A
UNDERWRITER’S CERTIFICATE
In connection with the offer and sale in the United States of Subscription Receipts (collectively, 
the “Subscription Receipts”) of Klondex Mines Ltd. (the “Corporation”) to U.S. Accredited 
Investors pursuant to a  U.S. Subscription Agreement dated as of  , 2016, and pursuant to an 
underwriting  agreement  (the  “Underwriting  Agreement”)  effective  as  of  August  18,  2016 
between  the  Corporation  and  the  Underwriters  named  in  the  Underwriting  Agreement,  ●  (the 
“Underwriter”) and ● (the “U.S. Affiliate”), the U.S. broker-dealer affiliate of the Underwriter, 
hereby certify as follows:
on the date of this certificate and on the date of each offer, solicitation of an offer or sale 
of Subscription Receipts in the United States, the U.S. Affiliate is and was: (A) a duly 
registered broker-dealer pursuant to section 15(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act and under the 
laws  of  each  state  where  offers  and  sales  of  Subscription  Receipts  were  made  (unless 
exempted from the respective state’s broker-dealer registration requirements), and (B) a 
member of and in good standing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc.;
all offers and sales of Subscription Receipts in the United States have been and will be 
effected and arranged by the U.S. Affiliate in accordance with all applicable U.S. federal 
and state broker-dealer requirements;
immediately prior to Offering or soliciting offers for the Subscription Receipts to or from 
offerees in the United States, we had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe that 
each offeree was an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D (a 
“U.S. Accredited Investor”) under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
(the “U.S. Securities Act”), and, on the date of this certificate, we continue to believe 
that each such person purchasing Subscription Receipts from the Corporation is a U.S. 
Accredited Investor;
no  form  of  “general  solicitation”  or  “general  advertising”  (as  those  terms  are  used  in 
Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act) was used by us, including, but not limited to, 
advertisements,  articles,  notices  or  other  communications  published  in  any  newspaper, 
magazine  or  similar  media  or  the  internet  or  broadcast  over  radio,  television  or  the 
internet,  or  any  seminar  or  meeting  whose  attendees  had  been  invited  by  general 
solicitation or general advertising, in connection with the offer or sale of the Subscription 
Receipts in the United States;
the  offers  and  solicitations  of  offers  of  the  Subscription  Receipts  in  the  United  States 
have been conducted by us in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, 
including Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement; and
in connection with each sale by the Corporation of Subscription Receipts in the United 
States, we caused each such U.S. purchaser to execute and deliver to the Corporation a 
U.S.  Subscription  Agreement  in  the  form  agreed  by  the  Corporation  and  the 
Underwriters.
