<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report examines the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
realization of the right to food. Development cooperation and food aid increasingly form a 
continuum ranging from interventions aimed at providing long-term support for food security to 
short-term answers to emergency situations. Both these policies have been under increased 
scrutiny in recent years, and both are in need of reform. This report makes a number of 
suggestions on how to reorient them by better integrating a perspective grounded in the human 
right to adequate food at three levels: in the definition of the obligations of donor States; in the 
identification of the tools on which these policies rely; and in the evaluation of such policies, 
with a view to their continuous improvement. At its core, a human rights approach turns what 
has been a bilateral relationship between donor and partner, into a triangular relationship, in 
which the ultimate beneficiaries of these policies play an active role. Seeing the provision of 
foreign aid as a means to fulfil the human right to adequate food has concrete implications, 
which assume that donor and partner Governments are duty-bearers, and beneficiaries are 
rights-holders.

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, presents his first annual 
report to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolution 7/14. Since he took office on 
1 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur has focused on integrating a right to food perspective in 
responses to the global food crisis in various forums.<b>1</b> He also presented a preliminary report to 
the General Assembly, outlining his approach to the mandate (see A/63/278), and conducted a 
mission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) (see A/HRC/10/5/Add.2). This report<b>2</b> 
examines the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right 
to food. 
</p>
<p>2. Development cooperation is one aspect of a broader obligation of international assistance 
and cooperation which may include, but is not limited to, the transfer of resources.<b>3</b> In recent 
years, development cooperation has been criticized from a number of different angles. Some 
have dismissed it as excessively donor-driven and top-down, and therefore as insufficiently 
informed by the views of the ultimate beneficiaries.<b>4</b> The tendency of donors - whether 
Governments, intergovernmental agencies or private non-governmental organizations - to 
impose various demands on recipients without coordination has also been seen as imposing a 
heavy burden on the partner Government&#8217;s administrative capacities, leading to suboptimal 
results. Others have denounced the mismanagement of aid by recipient Governments, noting that 
poor governance often resulted in aid not being used effectively. On 2 March 2005, the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness was adopted as an attempt to improve the quality of aid. It has 
been endorsed by 122 Governments and the European Commission, 27 international 
organizations including 6 regional development banks, the World Bank and the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and a number of non-governmental 
organizations. The commitments contained in the Paris Declaration focus on the five principles 
of ownership, alignment, harmonization, managing for results and mutual accountability. These 
principles mark a shift from donor-driven to needs-driven aid strategies, and emphasize the need 
for evaluating the performance of both donors, particularly as regards harmonization and 
predictability of aid, and their partners. In this report the Special Rapporteur argues that the Paris 
Declaration could be further concretized if placed under a human rights framework, and 
particularly by taking into account the human right to adequate food and explores the 
implications of that approach.<b>5</b>

<p>3. Food aid has also been subject to heavy scrutiny. Critics have denounced food aid as 
creating new forms of dependency; as being potentially disruptive of local markets; and as 
disrupting commercial trade patterns. Changes introduced over the last two decades have made 
food aid less susceptible to these criticisms.<b>6</b> At the same time, food aid has a crucial role to 
fulfil in times of emergency. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considers 
that States comply with their obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights by providing disaster relief and humanitarian assistance in times of 
emergency.<b>7</b> When it is based on proper needs assessments and well targeted, food aid can play 
an important role also in non-emergency contexts. Although declining in volume terms over the 
last few years,<b>8</b> international food aid currently provides about 10 million tons of commodities a 
year to some 200 million people in need, at an estimated total cost of US$ 2 billion. Questions 
regularly emerge about how to combine emergency responses<b>9</b> with the need to promote 
developing local food markets and food security in food-aid recipient countries. There is a 
growing consensus on the desirability of providing greater flexibility including through the use 
of locally and regionally procured food transfers and cash or voucher transfers,<b>10</b> and on the 
importance of food aid being provided with a clear exit strategy in order to avoid dependency. 
But these commitments remain unfulfilled in practice. 
</p>
<p>4. Within the broader area of international cooperation, both development assistance and food 
aid are currently being reviewed. The global food crisis of 2007/08 further highlighted the urgent 
need to reform both. On 2-4 September 2008, the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, 
held at Accra, reviewed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and adopted an Agenda for 
Action which aims to accelerate and deepen its implementation. For food aid, 2009 may provide 
a unique opportunity to revisit the mechanisms established by the Food Aid Convention (FAC), 
adopted in 1967 as a component of the International Grains Agreement (IGC). It contains

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See, e.g. WFP, <i>Food Aid Flows 2007</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  E/C.12/1999/5, para. 38. 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Since 1999, the overall amount of food aid has decreased from 15M to 6.9MT in 2006 
</p>
<p>and 5.9MT in 2007. This is a continuation of a broader trend: in the 1960s, food aid represented 
20 per cent of total bilateral official development assistance; it represented approximately 
5 per cent in 2005 (Christopher B. Barrett and Daniel G. Maxwell, <i>Food Aid after Fifty Years: 
Recasting its Role</i>, London and New York, Routledge, 2005). 
<b>9
</b>  Over 60 per cent of food aid is used for emergencies. This proportion has increased 
</p>
<p>from 18 per cent in 1990. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  Three distinct modalities of food aid need to be distinguished: (a) the shipment of donor 
country sourced commodities (food transfers); (b) cash-based food aid (food transfers paid for by 
donor funding); and (c) vouchers or cash transfers (payment instruments enabling recipients to 
obtain food from the local market). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>commitments by its States parties to provide certain quantities of food as food aid.<b>11</b> The 
proportion of official development assistance (ODA) going to agriculture and the rural sector fell 
sharply between 1980 and 2007: there is now a consensus that this trend must be reversed, and 
the next few years will witness, one hopes, an important increase. The crisis also illustrated the 
continued importance of food aid in a context in which the dependency of countries on imports 
to feed their populations has grown significantly over the last two decades, at the same time as 
the prices of food commodities in international markets have become increasingly volatile. 
</p>
<p>5. The premise of this report is simple. By cooperating internationally, whether through their 
development cooperation policies or through the provision of food aid, donor States are not only 
meeting basic human needs. They are also contributing to realize the human right to adequate 
food. This has potentially three implications. First, there is the question of whether States are 
under an obligation to provide international assistance, including food aid, in certain 
circumstances, or at certain levels. Second, the way international assistance is delivered must 
take into account that it should contribute to implement the right to food: the principles of 
participation, transparency, accountability and non-discrimination, as well as access to remedies, 
must therefore be taken into account in the implementation of development cooperation policies 
and in the delivery of food aid. Third, the effectiveness of the aid provided should be regularly 
evaluated by measuring the contribution of the existing policies to the realization of the right to 
adequate food. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE AID 
</b></p>
<p>6. Whether in the field of development cooperation or in the field of food aid, their 
contributions are argued by donor countries to be made on a purely voluntary basis. However, 
donors cannot ignore their obligations under human rights law in the implementation of their 
policies in these fields. There are also situations where they may be under a duty to help, 
particularly when they have made commitments to this effect, and where reneging on those 
commitments would violate the principle of predictability for the recipient State. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Defining obligations to provide aid 
</b></p>
<p>7. Millennium Development Goal 8 is to develop a global partnership for development, a goal 
to which increased levels of donor country commitments to official development assistance can 
contribute. The levels of aid provided remain clearly insufficient to meet the targets set by the 
2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the 
2005 World Summit, which would require raising ODA by US$ 50 billion by 2010 compared 
with 2004 (at 2004 prices and exchange rates). Despite repeated commitments, again reaffirmed 
in the Millennium Declaration, in the Monterrey Consensus,<b>12</b> in the Food and Agriculture

<p><b>11
</b>  The parties to the Food Aid Convention are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, and the United States, as well as the European Community and its member States. 
The present version of the FAC entered into force on 1 July 1999.

<p> 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive 
realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security (&#8220;FAO 
Guidelines&#8221;),<b>13</b> and in the 2008 Doha Declaration on Financing for Development,<b>14</b> developed 
countries have mostly failed<b>15</b> to meet the targets for ODA of 0.7 per cent of GDP to developing 
countries and 0.15 per cent to 0.2 per cent of GDP to least developed countries. 
</p>
<p>8. The Charter of the United Nations imposes in general terms an obligation on all its 
Members to &#8220;take joint and separate action in cooperation with the Organization&#8221;, inter alia, for 
the achievement of human rights (see Arts. 55 and 56). Neither the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, nor other human rights instruments, define precise levels 
at which States should provide aid.<b>16</b> That, however, is not equivalent to saying that there is no 
such obligation; it is to say, rather, that this obligation is still &#8220;imperfect&#8221;, in need of being 
further clarified.<b>17</b> According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, &#8220;States 
parties [to the Covenant] should take steps to respect the enjoyment of the right to food in other 
countries, to protect that right, to facilitate access to food <i>and to provide the necessary aid when 
required</i>&#8221;.<b>18</b> In the general comment it devoted in 2000 to the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health, the Committee similarly noted that &#8220;Depending on the availability of 
resources, States [in particular States in a position to assist developing countries in fulfilling their 
core and other obligations under the Covenant] should facilitate access to essential health 
facilities, goods and services in other countries, wherever possible <i>and provide the necessary aid 
when required</i>.&#8221;<b>19</b>A consensus seems to emerge, at a minimum, on three requirements. 
</p>
<p>9. First, the Covenant imposes an obligation on all States parties to &#8220;move as expeditiously 
and effectively as possible&#8221; towards the full realization of all human rights, including the right to 
adequate food. Moreover, &#8220;any deliberately retrogressive measures in that regard would require 
the most careful consideration and would need to be fully justified by reference to the totality of 
the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  Chap. III, para. 12; the Voluntary Guidelines were adopted on 23 November 2004 by 
</p>
<p>the 187 countries represented in the General Council of the FAO.

<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  Five countries exceeded the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP: Denmark, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. 
<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  However, some authors note that the repeated commitments of developed States to provide 
certain levels of assistance, particularly to reach the Millennium Development Goals, might in 
time crystallize into customary international law.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>available resources&#8221;.<b>20</b> Therefore, at a minimum, developed countries should make measurable 
progress towards contributing to the full realization of human rights by supporting the efforts of 
governments in developing countries, and they should not diminish pre-existing levels of aid 
calculated as ODA in percentage of the GDP. Any regression in the level of aid provided that is 
not fully justified should be treated, presumptively, as a violation of States&#8217; obligations under 
international law. 
</p>
<p>10. Second, the assistance provided should be non-discriminatory. Even if it remains based on 
the voluntary decisions of each donor Government, the aid provided should not be determined by 
the political, strategic, commercial or historically rooted interests of the donors, but by an 
objective assessment of the identified needs in developing countries. This is required if aid is to 
be effective, as noted already in 1969 by the Pearson Commission and in 1980 by the Brandt 
Commission.<b>21</b> It also follows from the recognition of the fact that development cooperation is a 
means of fulfilling human rights, particularly the right to food. The implication is that aid should 
be informed by an adequate mapping of needs - including, in particular, the existence in certain 
countries of food insecurity and vulnerability (see chap. III below). 
</p>
<p>11. Third, the amount of aid provided to recipient countries remains volatile and unpredictable, 
changing from one year to the next and from one country to another.<b>22</b> This does not allow 
recipient countries to plan their development over a number of years and creates the risk of aid 
being suspended or interrupted for politically motivated reasons, without such measures being 
based on objective and transparently applied considerations. Where such decisions result in 
negative impacts on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly on the right to food, they require 
careful consideration of the donor State&#8217;s obligations.<b>23</b> Donor States must therefore follow up 
on the commitments they make to provide certain levels of aid at a specific time and in a given 
year. Such commitments give rise to legitimate expectations for the recipient State, which cannot 
be disappointed without an adequate justification being provided by the donor State.

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Improving the definition of food aid commitments under 
the Food Aid Convention 
</b></p>
<p>12. The FAC is unique in that it imposes on its parties (or &#8220;Members&#8221;) binding obligations in 
relation to volumes of food aid they commit to provide, thus improving the predictability of this 
form of aid. Indeed, the objectives of the FAC are to &#8220;contribute to world food security and to 
improve the ability of the international community to respond to emergency food situations and 
other food needs of developing countries&#8221;, inter alia, by &#8220;making appropriate levels of food aid 
available on a predictable basis, as determined by the provisions of this Convention&#8221; (art. I). The 
Convention, in its article VIII, (e), provides that &#8220;to the maximum extent possible, 
non-emergency food aid shall be provided by members on a forward-planning basis, so that 
recipient countries may be able to take account, in their development programmes, of the likely 
flow of food aid they will receive during each year of this Convention&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. At the same time, the monitoring of compliance with these commitments remains weak. 
Members must provide yearly reports to the Food Aid Committee on their contributions.<b>24</b> This 
information is processed and made available to the public in ways which are not sufficiently 
transparent to allow for an adequate scrutiny. The monitoring system is based on a peer review 
performed by the Food Aid Committee on the basis of the information provided by the members. 
The current system could be improved in two important respects. First, the information provided 
by the members about their contributions could be processed in a way which would facilitate the 
evaluation by any external observer of a State party&#8217;s compliance with its commitments, thus 
allowing in particular national parliaments and civil society organizations to contribute more 
effectively to a public debate about whether States deliver food aid in ways which are 
sufficiently predictable for the recipient States. Second, the evaluation of States&#8217; compliance 
with their obligations under the FAC should include, as a matter of priority, their compliance 
with article XIII thereof, which makes explicit their obligation under international law to ensure 
that the aid they provide does not lead to violations of the right to food in the recipient country 
(see also below, chap. III). Both of these improvements could result from an amendment to the 
rules of procedure adopted by the Food Aid Committee. 
</p>
<p>14. A more fundamental issue related to the FAC relates to the mismatch between 
commitments and needs, and even more clearly, between the deliveries of food aid and need. 
Under the FAC, members express their commitments in terms of tons of wheat equivalent, in the 
value of wheat equivalent, or as a combination of tonnage and value. These commitments are 
made without being aligned with identified needs in recipient countries. In addition, in practice, 
food aid has often been counter-cyclical. States may carry over their commitments to the 
following year when they appear unable to meet their commitments for any single year, and they 
may carry forward their commitments to the following year for up to 5 per cent of their total 
commitment if their contribution exceeds their commitment for any single year (art. VI). This 
flexibility, combined with the fact that States budget their aid in monetary terms rather than in 
volume terms, may contribute to States delaying provision of aid when the prices are high on 
international markets, and to exceed their commitments when the prices are low - precisely the 
reverse of what would be needed if food aid were to truly contribute to food security. In sum, 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  Art. XIV, FAC, and rule 9 of the rules of procedure (FA (00/01) Misc.2 Restricted). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>there is &#8220;a financial incentive to mistime the delivery of food aid&#8221;, which the FAC does not 
discourage effectively.<b>25</b> For example, although the prices of food commodities reached 
historical peaks in 2007-2008, food-aid volumes in those years reached their lowest level since 
the early 1970s, further illustrating the inverse relationship between food-aid volumes and world 
prices that typifies food-aid shipments.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>15. This is contrary to the spirit of article VIII (b) of the FAC, which recognizes the need to 
base food aid on an evaluation of needs by the recipient and the members, and states that food 
aid &#8220;should be aimed at enhancing food security in recipient countries&#8221;. The FAO Guidelines 
also provide that &#8220;donor States should ensure that their food aid policies support national efforts 
by recipient States to achieve food security, and base their food aid provisions on sound needs 
assessment, targeting especially food insecure and vulnerable groups&#8221; (Guideline 15.1). Indeed, 
that corresponds to a requirement under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights: the treaty Committee noted pointedly in its general comment No. 12 on the right 
to food that, to avoid discrimination, &#8220;priority in food aid should be given to the most vulnerable 
populations&#8221;.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Two changes could be made to the system of the FAC in order to ensure that it is 
effectively needs-based, beyond its still very insufficient emergency clause.<b>28</b> First, the aid 
provided to each State should be based on an adequate mapping of food vulnerability and 
insecurity in that State.<b>29</b> There are methodologies available for mapping food vulnerability 
which may be used in the context of FAC. Whatever the methodology used, it is crucial that the 
situation in each country where food security problems may arise is objectively evaluated. This 
may also alleviate concerns that the food aid provided distorts commercial trade in favour of the 
donor country&#8217;s producers when the aid is provided in kind. Consistent with Guideline 15.5 of 
the FAO Guidelines, the assessment of food vulnerability should, as far as possible, be made &#8220;in 
a participatory manner and, whenever possible, in close collaboration with recipient governments 
at the national and local level&#8221;.

members should respond to the situation by increasing the amount of food aid provided&#8221;).

<p>17. Second, members&#8217; commitments under the FAC should be expressed in ways other than in 
wheat equivalents. One possibility is to define these commitments as a percentage of assessed 
needs whereby each State commits itself, in accordance with its ability,<b>30</b> to cover a predefined 
percentage of the needs identified over a certain period, preferably on a multiannual basis. This 
change would introduce an element of uncertainty in the commitments of donor countries. This 
uncertainty is already present in the current system, since commitments expressed in tonnage 
will vary, as to their budgetary implications, following the variation of the prices of commodities 
in international markets. Expressing commitments as a percentage of assessed needs would share 
the risk equally across all parties to the FAC, and would avoid the dangers associated with food 
aid being driven by the commercial or geopolitical interests of donor States. In addition, States 
may insure themselves against this risk, by resorting to reinsurance mechanisms. Finally, this 
way of expressing commitments under the FAC would avoid the problem of counter-cyclical aid, 
which plagues the current system. 
</p>
<p>18. Another possible mode of expressing commitments could be for FAC members to commit 
to meeting the costs of insurance schemes, with a view to enhancing the predictability of aid and 
putting an end to the counter-cyclical nature of food aid. For instance, since 2006 the World 
Food Programme (WFP) has developed a drought-insurance programme in Ethiopia in 
partnership with the French firm Axa Re. This pilot programme aims to provide cash payouts to 
farmers in the event of a severe drought.<b>31</b> In 2007, WFP, the World Bank and the Government 
of Ethiopia began work on developing a broader risk-management framework for droughts and 
floods in the context of the Productive Safety Net Programme. The second phase (2008-10) will 
introduce a drought risk financing component to the programme and also include clearer 
contingency planning, capacity-building and more robust early-warning systems. Donors could 
commit to pay the insurance premiums, thus ensuring not only predictability at the recipient&#8217;s 
end, but also easier budgetary programming on the donors&#8217; side. One of the attractive features of 
such mechanisms is that they encourage potentially food-insecure countries to put in place 
relatively ambitious social safety nets, including food safety nets, since these countries will not 
have to fear the fiscal costs linked to shocks like drought which, in the absence of an insurance 
mechanism, may make the safety nets unsustainable. Another advantage, particularly as regards 
weather-related insurance mechanisms, is that, if donors contribute to meet the costs of the 
premiums, this constitutes an incentive for them to transfer technologies to developing countries 
which could ease adaptation to climate change and limit its negative impacts. 
</p>
<p>19. The shift towards a more systematic needs-based approach to food aid would be consistent 
with the responses which are currently being shaped in order to address concerns that food aid 
may constitute a form of disguised export subsidy, and displace commercial imports. For 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>30
</b>  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights takes the view that States parties to 
</p>
<p>the Covenant should provide aid in accordance with their ability to do so; see its general 
comment No. 12 (E/C.12/1999/5, para. 38). 
<b>31
</b></p>
<p>  Under the programme, Axa Re would have had to pay US$ 7.1 million to WFP in case of a 
serious drought in 2006 triggering the response - an event some estimate to occur every 20 years 
on average. The WFP would then have transferred the funds to the Government of Ethiopia to be 
disbursed as cash assistance to households. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>emergency situations, the development of objective needs-based assessments will be required as 
part of the disciplines imposed under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), since the 
current proposals under discussion within the Doha development round of trade negotiations aim 
to place emergency food aid in a &#8220;safe box&#8221; with more lenient disciplines, once the emergency is 
declared or appealed by relevant international organizations. The non-emergency forms of food 
aid are also disciplined under the AoA to prevent the aid from displacing commercial trade, 
which again implies that it be based on needs assessment. New mechanisms may be needed for 
the definition of commitments under the FAC rules of procedure to be coordinated with the 
WTO disciplines, as would be the case if needs assessments both triggered certain responses 
under the FAC (such as an obligation for each State party to provide a certain percentage of food 
aid) and shielded the food aid provided through such responses from the WTO disciplines. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Assisting net food-importing developing countries facing the 
negative impacts of the reform programme in agriculture 
</b></p>
<p>20. In the Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform 
Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries (&#8220;Marrakesh 
Decision&#8221;), which is part of the WTO agreements adopted following the Uruguay round of trade 
negotiations, the WTO members committed themselves to establishing a number of mechanisms 
in order to ensure that the least-developed countries (LDCs) and net food-importing developing 
countries (NFIDCs) would be able to continue to afford normal levels of commercial imports of 
basic foodstuffs, despite the impact on prices which could result from the reform programme in 
agriculture. The four response mechanisms provided for under the Marrakesh Decision are: 
(a) the provision of food aid at a level sufficient to continue to provide assistance in meeting the 
food needs of developing countries; (b) the provision of technical and financial assistance to 
least-developed and net food-importing developing countries to improve their agricultural 
productivity and infrastructure; (c) favourable terms for agricultural export credits; and 
(d) short-term financing facilities benefiting developing countries in order to allow them to 
maintain normal levels of commercial imports. Regrettably, WTO members have not adequately 
implemented these mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>21. The Marrakesh Decision refers to the need to review the level of food aid established 
periodically by the Committee on Food Aid under the FAC and to &#8220;initiate negotiations in the 
appropriate forum to establish a level of food aid commitments sufficient to meet the legitimate 
needs of developing countries during the reform programme&#8221;. It also included a commitment to 
&#8220;adopt guidelines to ensure that an increasing proportion of basic foodstuffs is provided to 
[LDCs and NFIDCs] in fully grant form and/or on appropriate concessional terms in line with 
article IV of the Food Aid Convention 1986&#8221;. However, as regards the NFIDCs which are 
neither LDCs nor low-income countries, more restrictive conditions are stipulated under 
article VII of the 1999 FAC than would be required in order to ensure an adequate 
implementation of the Marrakesh Decision,<b>32</b> a discrepancy that should be eliminated. In 
addition, the guidelines referred to in the Marrakesh Decision could be adopted, in order to 
impose an obligation on the States parties to the FAC to provide food aid at levels which ensure 
that NFIDCs will at all times be able to ensure an adequate protection of the right to food under 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>32
</b>  The countries concerned are Barbados, Mauritius, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>their jurisdiction. Given the likelihood of increased volatility of food prices, particularly due to 
climate change, States parties to the FAC could most effectively comply with this obligation by 
financing insurance schemes - related, ideally, both to weather-related events and to other 
shocks, internal or external. 
</p>
<p>22. The provision of assistance to LDCs and NFIDCs in order to allow them to improve their 
agricultural productivity and infrastructure has been insufficient over the last two decades. As a 
result of falling commodity prices making agriculture less profitable in developing countries and 
of increasing competition from social sectors such as health or education, both the proportion of 
official development assistance dedicated to agriculture and the proportion of national budgets 
going to agriculture have declined significantly since the early 1980s.<b>33</b> In sub-Saharan Africa, 
bilateral agricultural aid fell by 60 per cent from US$ 1.3 billion to only US$ 524 million 
between 1990 and 2001.<b>34</b> While commitments have been made in various forums to reverse this 
trend, it remains to be seen whether there will be sufficient political will to implement these 
resolutions. It would be unacceptable for increased and more predictable provisions of food aid 
to divert attention from the need to rebuild agriculture and enhance food security through the 
improvement of local capacities to produce. 
</p>
<p>23. The Marrakesh Decision provides that appropriate provision should be made for 
differential treatment of LDCs and NFIDCs in any agreement on agricultural export credits. The 
most recent WTO draft texts underscore the ongoing nature of this commitment, which is 
particularly important in light of the recent extreme international food price volatility. Those 
texts also provide for substantially extended credit periods for commercial transactions involving 
LDCs and NFIDCs.<b>35</b> However, as explained in the following paragraph, the IMF has only 
recently made any credit available to cope with high prices without a high level of policy 
conditionality. 
</p>
<p>24. The Marrakesh Decision provides in paragraph 5 for the possibility for NFIDCs 
experiencing balance-of-payment difficulties to draw on existing facilities, or such facilities as 
may be established to address such difficulties. The main facility which has been considered to 
satisfy this requirement is the IMF Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF), initially established 
in 1963. The CFF was expanded in 1981 to cover excess cereal import costs, following requests 
from the World Food Council and FAO, and in view of the high volatility of food prices in the 
1970s. However, this facility has been of little use to NFIDCs. Access to CFF is restricted to 
countries experiencing temporary balance-of-payments difficulties linked to factors largely 
beyond the control of the authorities, such as a rise in cereal import costs. This is a condition

<p>which very few countries are considered to have met. In addition, access to loans is subject to 
conditionality, which the Marrakesh Decision recognizes explicitly by referring to facilities 
extended &#8220;in the context of adjustment programmes&#8221;. Finally, there is a discrepancy between 
CFF and the Marrakesh Decision: CFF is limited to cereals, whereas the Decision covers all 
basic foods.  
</p>
<p>25. On 25 April 2001, a group of 16 developing countries, members of WTO, submitted a 
proposal which called for, inter alia, the establishment of an Inter-Agency Revolving Fund 
(RF)<b>36</b> under which, in addition to technical and financial assistance to LDCs and NFIDCs for 
specific projects linked to improving agricultural productivity and related infrastructure, 
financing would be provided at concessional terms without requiring any justification other than 
evidence that import bills were excessive. This system was conceived as self-financing: 
borrowing countries would assume the obligation to repay their loans, for instance within a 
period of two years. UNCTAD later elaborated on this proposal, which was included by the 
WTO Doha Ministerial Conference among the implementation issues<b>37</b> and led to an 
Inter-Agency Panel being established to examine the issue.<b>38</b> To date, there has been no 
follow-up to the proposal. It is therefore to be welcomed that the Exogenous Shocks Facility 
(ESF) has been revised in September 2008 in order to allow the IMF to help its members cope 
with events such as commodity price changes, by including a rapid-access component in the 
facility and providing concessional terms of financing, focused on the adjustment to the 
underlying shock but with less emphasis than previously on broader structural adjustments. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  IMPLEMENTATION 
</b></p>
<p>26. Until a few years ago, international aid was seen as a unilateral undertaking, by a donor 
country, to provide assistance to a recipient country, whether through bilateral or through 
multilateral channels. Now, strategies which were donor-driven are increasingly needs-driven, 
and expected to be aligned with strategies developed at the level of the partner country. A human 
rights framework requires that we deepen the principles of ownership, alignment and mutual 
accountability, by shifting our attention to the role of national parliaments, civil society 
organizations, and the ultimate beneficiaries of aid - the rights-holders - in the implementation 
and evaluation of foreign aid. It is this triangulation, away from a purely bilateral relationship 
between Governments, which the adoption of a human rights framework requires.

</p>
<p><b>A.  Improving the contribution of international aid to the realization  
of the right to food: the role of national strategies 
</b></p>
<p>27. The current reform process of international aid is based on the principles of ownership, 
alignment, harmonization, managing for results, and mutual evaluation, which are made explicit 
in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. An explicit endorsement of a human rights 
framework for the implementation of these principles could make them more concrete and 
operational. At a general level, human rights-based approaches to development cooperation 
recognize people &#8220;as key actors in their own development, rather than passive recipients of 
commodities and services&#8221;: they emphasize participation as both a means and a goal; they seek 
to empower, and thus should combine top-down and bottom-up approaches; both outcomes and 
processes should be monitored and evaluated, following the adoption of measurable goals and 
targets in programming; all stakeholders should be involved in analysis; and the programmes 
should focus on marginalized, disadvantaged, and excluded groups, and aim at reducing 
disparity.<b>39</b> The human right to adequate food in particular should be guiding countries&#8217; choices 
of development strategies, and provide an objective benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of 
development efforts, thus improving the accountability of both donors and partners.  
</p>
<p>28. Specifically, the implementation of the principles of national ownership and alignment 
would be greatly facilitated if the recipient State were to define its national priorities according 
to a national strategy for the realization of the right to food, whether it is formally integrated into 
broader poverty-reduction strategy documents or not. The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has insisted on the need for States to work towards the adoption of a national 
strategy to ensure food and nutrition security for all, based on human rights principles that 
define the objectives, and the formulation of policies and corresponding benchmarks 
(E/C.12/1999/5, para. 21). Guideline 3 of the FAO Guidelines provides useful indications about 
how States could adopt a national human rights-based strategy for the realization of the right to 
adequate food, emphasizing in particular the need to allow for monitoring of progress and 
accountability, and to develop such strategies through participatory processes. 
</p>
<p>29. One of the commitments of the States adhering to the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness is to enhance partner countries&#8217; accountability to their citizens and parliaments for 
their development policies, strategies and performance (paras. 3 (iii), and 14). This objective has 
been further reaffirmed by the Accra Summit on Aid Effectiveness of 2-4 September 2008<b>40</b> and 
in the 2008 Doha Declaration on Financing for Development.<b>41</b> The elaboration, through 
participatory processes, of a national strategy for the realization of the right to food provides a 
concrete means to improve the accountability of national governments and their responsiveness 
to the needs of their populations. The Accra Agenda for Action provides that developing

<p>countries and donors will &#8220;ensure that their respective development policies and programmes are 
designed and implemented in ways consistent with their agreed international commitments on 
gender equality, human rights, disability and environmental sustainability&#8221; (para. 13 (d)). 
Grounding development assistance on the human right to food would contribute to this agenda. 
Since development cooperation programmes would fit into a national strategy for the realization 
of the right to food defined at national level, the recipient Government would improve its 
bargaining position in aid negotiations. Since this national strategy would involve national 
parliaments and civil society organizations, development policies would be democratized. And 
since it would set benchmarks and allocate responsibilities, it would increase accountability in 
their implementation.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Improving the contribution of food aid to the realization of the right  
to food: the need for disciplined and context-specific food aid 
</b></p>
<p>30. Food aid, if not strictly tailored to the needs which have been assessed and to the local 
conditions, may create unintended - and negative - consequences. When food insecurity is not 
the result of the absence of well-functioning markets or of insufficient supply, but of insufficient 
purchasing power for certain segments of the population, the arrival of food aid in kind can 
undermine local agricultural production, since it leads to a lowering of the prices on domestic 
markets. In the worst-case scenario, the provision of food aid could lead to reduced investment in 
the local agricultural sector, increasing the likelihood of future emergencies, leading to what 
major commentators have referred to as a &#8220;relief trap&#8221; in international assistance: donors are 
caught in a vicious circle in which &#8220;they can increasingly finance only relief operations 
accompanied only occasionally by under-funded structural investments&#8221;.<b>42</b> This is why the FAO 
Guidelines emphasize the need to ensure that international food aid does not disrupt local food 
production (Guideline 15.1). The FAC also includes a provision according to which, in 
delivering food aid, the Members should &#8220;avoid &#8230; harmful effects on local harvests, production 
and marketing structures, by appropriately timing the distribution of food aid&#8221; (art. XIII (a) (i)). 
</p>
<p>31. Since food aid is generally directed towards regions which experience food insecurity 
problems, often as a result of failures of domestic production, the arrival of food aid and patterns 
of food insecurity are statistically correlated. This is not to say that the latter are necessarily 
caused or aggravated by the former.<b>43</b> The potential impacts on local agricultural production 
should not lead to dismissing the usefulness of food aid to meet the needs of the food-insecure, 
under certain conditions and provided the right instruments are used. In principle, in-kind food 
aid - through the physical delivery of commodities - will be adequate as an answer to

<p>humanitarian crises resulting from a food-availability deficit and a market failure. Cash transfers 
allowing recipients to procure from local or regional markets may be an option where markets 
function adequately and where there exists an adequate local agricultural production, but where 
certain households are food insecure as a result of insufficient purchasing power. When in-kind 
food aid is the preferred option, it should comply with certain conditions. First, adequate 
targeting and appropriate timing should ensure that the provision of in-kind food aid does not 
have highly disruptive effects on local agricultural production. If food aid is effectively targeted 
towards the poor and the most vulnerable, which in any case may not have been able to afford 
buying locally produced commodities, and if it is delivered in a timely way, immediately after 
the needs have been identified - rather than, for instance, many weeks later, particularly after 
new harvests are brought on the markets - negative impact on local production may be entirely 
avoided. Second, local purchasing of commodities through food aid programmes which are 
cash-based rather than donor-country sourced and commodity-based may both assist those in 
need and support local producers and may be closer to local diets. This will be the case 
particularly if those responsible for these purchases make deliberate efforts to buy from 
smallholders, helping them to overcome the barriers they face, particularly as regards their 
ability to keep stocks, which may otherwise place them at a disadvantage in comparison to larger 
producers or commodity traders. At the same time, the local purchasing of food aid to be 
distributed to the poorest or most food insecure segments of the population may lead to price 
increases which will be detrimental to households which are not covered by the programme. It is 
for this reason that the FAC requires that Members &#8220;pay particular attention to avoiding harmful 
effects on low-income consumers due to price changes resulting from local purchases&#8221; 
(art. XII (d)).  
</p>
<p>32. In sum, while donor-country sourced commodities risk disrupting local production, 
cash-based food aid or vouchers or cash transfers both have price effects which risk making food 
less affordable for the poor. To avoid these negative effects, a number of conditions should be 
strictly adhered to. The monetization of food aid - i.e., the selling of donated products to raise 
funds for aid - has a particularly negative effect on local market prices and thus disruptive 
impacts on local production and should be avoided to the largest extent possible.<b>44</b> As much as 
the commitments, the delivery of food aid needs to be based on careful assessments of the 
existing needs. Delivery needs to be timely and well targeted; and preferably in cash and untied 
from domestic production or shipping requirements, in order to allow it to be used in the most 
efficient way, for instance for local or regional purchases, depending on the conditions existing 
on the local markets. Tying constitutes a major impediment to the effectiveness of food aid: it is 
estimated that the cost of direct food-aid transfers from the donor country is on average 
50 per cent higher than local food purchases, and 33 per cent higher than regional purchases.<b>45</b> 
Yet, tying remains widespread, resulting in roughly a third of the global food aid budget, or some 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>44
</b>  The monetization of food aid is particularly disruptive since it is not targeted to specific 
</p>
<p>food-insecure populations. In this respect, it is similar to programme aid which consists in 
transfers from Government to Government, with the recipient Government reselling the food aid 
received on the local markets.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>US$ 600 million, being spent in donor countries and never reaching beneficiaries.<b>46</b> This is 
highly unfortunate, since it puts the interests of the donor State or its agricultural sector above 
the needs of the population in the recipient State.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Both bringing discipline to food aid and its adaptability to the different contexts in which it 
operates could be significantly improved by defining food aid as a tool aimed at the realization 
of the right to adequate food, and by drawing the consequences from this redefinition at the 
operational level. Specifically, this shift has three implications. First, as noted above, the 
provision of food aid should fit into national strategies for the realization of the right to food, 
defined by the Government through participatory processes in which the ultimate beneficiaries, 
but also farmers&#8217; organizations, should be involved. This would ensure that local conditions are 
taken into account in the assessment of which forms of food aid are desirable - depending, in 
particular, on whether the local agricultural sector is or is not able to increase its supply 
following cash transfers, whether such transfers take the form of disaster relief, of public 
employment schemes, or other forms. It would also ensure that greater attention will be paid to 
the nutritional dimensions of food aid. The need for food aid to ensure an adequate provision of 
micronutrients - referred to in the FAC<b>48</b> - is increasingly recognized in international discussions. 
This may constitute a particularly important benefit of aligning food aid with national strategies 
developed with the beneficiaries both because food aid may result in a transformation of dietary 
habits of the target population, which may be difficult to change back later and lead to a 
long-term dependency on certain imported goods, and because the nutritional adequacy of diets 
is particularly tested in times of crisis.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>34. Second, the reconceptualization of food aid as a means to implement the right to adequate 
food implies that targeting would be based on the needs identified through such participatory 
processes. This should limit the risk of applying criteria which may be discriminatory in nature 
or may have discriminatory effects to identify those who qualify for food aid, and it should allow 
the possibility for the targeted communities to identify by themselves the optimal means of 
distribution - for instance, through women rather than men.  
</p>

<p><b>46
</b>  FAO, <i>The State of Food Aid and Agriculture 2006</i>, Rome, January 2007, p. 16. 
</p>
<p><b>47
</b>  Another advantage of untied aid is that it ensures the compatibility of aid with the 
</p>
<p>requirements of the Agreement on Agriculture under the WTO framework (see art. 10 (4), AoA), 
as well as with the FAO Principles of Surplus Disposal and Consultative Obligations. 
<b>48
</b></p>
<p>  See FAC, art. XIII (a) (ii) (requiring from Members that they &#8220;respect local food habits and 
nutritional needs of the beneficiaries&#8221; and that they minimize &#8220;any possible negative effects on 
their eating habits&#8221;). 
<b>49
</b></p>
<p>  A switch to diets which are poorer in micronutrients, a common adaptation strategy of 
households faced with food insecurity, has particularly severe consequences on children 
under 24 months of age and on lactating or pregnant women. See C. Koltz et al., &#8220;Nutrition in 
the perfect storm: why micronutrient malnutrition will be a widespread health consequence of 
high food prices&#8221;, World Food Programme 2008, <i>Sight &amp; Life</i> No. 2/2008, p. 6. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>35. Third, and even more importantly, once food aid is defined as a means to implement the 
right to food, it implies that it should be delivered through criteria which are transparent and, in 
principle, set out in legislation. This should allow those who are unjustifiably denied food aid to 
have access to recourse mechanisms in order to seek a remedy from such exclusion - a 
potentially powerful guarantee against the risk of exclusion or against the discriminatory 
application of criteria for the allocation of aid.<b>50</b> By restoring predictability for the recipients, 
food safety nets could function adequately as insurance mechanisms. Without such insurance, 
those who temporarily fall into poverty are obliged to sell their assets to meet their immediate 
needs and thereby fall into extreme poverty, and those who are chronically poor are stuck in 
poverty as a result of their inability to rebuild their asset stocks and thus escape their condition.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EVALUATION 
</b></p>
<p>36. The evaluation of development cooperation and food aid policies can serve to 
progressively improve their effectiveness. It also enhances the accountability of donor and 
partner States alike. By providing an objective and agreed upon analytical framework for such 
assessments,<b>51</b> the reference to the human right to adequate food contributes to both objectives.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Evaluating the effectiveness of development cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>37. Under the principle of mutual accountability agreed to in the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness, partner countries and donors should &#8220;enhance mutual accountability and 
transparency in the use of development resources&#8221;, a process which should help &#8220;strengthen 
public support for national policies and development assistance&#8221; (para. 47). The commitment of 
the partner countries is to involve more closely national parliaments and civil society in the 
design and implementation of national development strategies and/or budgets (para. 48). In turn, 
donors commit to &#8220;provide timely, transparent and comprehensive information on aid flows so as 
to enable partner authorities to present comprehensive budget reports to their legislatures and 
citizens&#8221; (para. 49). And both partner countries and donors commit to joint assessments of the 
effectiveness of aid (para. 50).  
</p>
<p>38. How success is to be measured remains unspecified under the Declaration. A reference to 
the normative components of the right to adequate food would be particularly useful to guide 
such assessments. Ideally, monitoring the effectiveness of aid should take the form of human 
rights impact assessments based on the normative components of human rights as recognized in 
international law; and it should be performed jointly by donors and partner countries, as well as 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>50
</b>  Such transparency requirements and recourse mechanisms should also be available to the 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries of food aid channelled through non-governmental organizations. Certain such 
organizations have established help desks to provide information to those targeted by their 
programmes, as well as complaints handling mechanisms.

Understanding Among UN Agencies (2003). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>by independent bodies.<b>52</b> Apart from providing donor countries and partner countries with a focal 
point for the performance of joint assessments, this could significantly enhance accountability of 
both donors and recipient Governments to the national parliaments and civil society 
organizations in the recipient countries, ensuring the involvement of these actors in the 
assessment itself, and encouraging the launching of a public debate about the results of the 
evaluation. Thus, such assessments would allow citizens of developing countries to hold their 
Governments and donor States to account for the impact of development cooperation, and for the 
use of aid.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Evaluating the effectiveness of food aid 
</b></p>
<p>39. Article XIII (h) of the FAC provides that &#8220;Members shall endeavour to carry out joint 
evaluations of their food aid programmes and operations &#8230; based on agreed international 
principles.&#8221; This suggests the need for the Food Aid Committee to transform itself into a 
learning forum, in which States parties, together with the recipient States and non-governmental 
organizations, could on a regular basis assess the effectiveness of food aid both in responding to 
emergency situations and in enhancing the long-term food security of the country concerned. It 
also points to the usefulness of basing such evaluations on objective and internationally agreed 
criteria. Although the FAC refers to the use of indicators &#8220;such as the nutritional status of the 
beneficiaries and other indicators related to world food security&#8221;, at least for those Members&#8217; 
monitoring the impact of the food aid they provide (art. XIII (j)), a reference to the normative 
components of the human right to adequate food would be most appropriate. Those components 
are well recognized and provide an objective benchmark, including a well-established set of 
indicators, on the basis of which the effectiveness of food aid could be assessed.  
</p>
<p>40. Although the FAC defines the composition of the Food Aid Committee as including all 
the Parties to the FAC, it does not exclude the organization of regular meetings between the 
members of the FAC on the one hand, and the recipient countries or their representatives as 
well as non-governmental organizations active in the field of food aid,<b>53</b> on the other hand. 
Such meetings could encourage mutual learning, on the basis of an exchange of experiences 
about the successes or failures of food aid in different contexts. They could enhance mutual 
accountability - of donors towards recipients, who must receive aid in more predictable ways in 
the future, of recipients towards donors, who must ensure that the food aid they receive is used in 
accordance with appropriate national strategies, and of both donors and recipients towards the 
beneficiaries of aid, whose concerns non-governmental organizations may be in a position to 
convey. They could also contribute to more transparency, allowing in turn both national and 
international monitoring mechanisms to better supervise whether the States concerned comply 
with the requirements of the right to food in the provision, delivery, and management of food 
aid.

<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>While the contributions of donor States to the realization of the right to food in the 
partner countries are generally made on a purely voluntary basis, this does not exempt 
donors from complying with the principles of non-retrogression, non-discrimination, and 
of predictability in the provision of aid. Where States have made commitments to provide 
certain levels of assistance, as is the case under the FAC and under the Marrakesh 
Decision, those commitments should be complied with. To the fullest extent possible, such 
commitments should be to meet objectively assessed needs, so that assistance will be 
detached from commercial or strategic interests of the donors. Defining international aid as 
an instrument to fulfil the human right to adequate food could contribute to this shift.</b> 
</p>
<p>42. <b>Human rights can help complement the principles of aid effectiveness stipulated in 
the Paris Declaration, and help make them more operational because they provide a 
framework which is grounded in the international obligations of both donors and recipient 
States, and because they emphasize the values of participation and accountability. As 
donors and their partners seek to clarify how to implement these principles, a reference to 
human rights may provide a focal point on which those discussions can be based. Realizing 
the first Millennium Development Goal to halve the proportion of people suffering from 
hunger by 2015, without grounding the policies we develop to fulfil this objective on the 
human right to adequate food, would lead to policies which were less well informed, less 
sustainable in the long term, and whose legitimacy would be more easily contested. The 
recommendations presented in this report are based, not only on the idea that 
Governments must respect their obligations under international law, but also on the idea 
that relying on the right to adequate food is useful and operational, and truly adds value to 
development policies. We ignore the potential of the right to food at our own peril.</b> 
</p>
<p>43. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Donor States should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Make measurable progress towards contributing to the full realization of human 
rights by supporting the efforts of Governments in developing countries, by 
maintaining and - to the maximum of available resources - increasing levels of aid 
calculated as ODA as a percentage of GDP 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Provide aid on the basis of an objective assessment of the identified needs in 
developing countries 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Respect their commitments to provide certain levels of aid at a specific time and in 
a given period, ensuring adequate justification when commitments are not 
complied with 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Support the implementation of the FAO Guidelines in partner countries and their 
use as a binding reference framework for development cooperation, especially in 
the field of rural development and concerning advisory services for development 
strategies such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Fully respect the principle of ownership in their development cooperation policies 
by aligning these policies with national strategies for the realization of the right to 
food defined in the partner country with the participation of national parliaments 
and civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promote the right to food as a priority for cooperation with partner countries 
where hunger or malnutrition are significant problems, focusing on the most 
vulnerable groups of the society 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Conduct <i>ex ante</i> impact assessments (based on human rights standards and 
principles) in order to ensure that development policies and investments in all 
relevant sectors will not lead to violations of the right to adequate food 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implement basic human rights principles in development cooperation: 
transparency, accountability, participation, non-discrimination and empowerment 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Propose to their partners that they prepare joint assessments, on a regular basis, of 
the impact of development cooperation on the realization of the right to adequate 
food, based on the normative components of this right as recognized in 
international law 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) States parties to the FAC should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Process the information provided by the Members of the Food Aid Committee 
about their contributions so as to allow the evaluation by any external observer of 
a State party&#8217;s compliance with its commitments 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Assess States&#8217; compliance with article XIII of the FAC within the Food Aid 
Committee 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Allow the Food Aid Committee to transform itself into a learning forum for both 
its Members and the recipient Governments, as well as non-governmental 
organizations active in the field of food aid, by organizing transparent and joint 
assessments of the impacts of food aid on long-term food security 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that the commitments under the FAC are needs-based, by grounding them 
on an adequate mapping of food vulnerability and insecurity in the recipient 
country, and by expressing commitments as a percentage of assessed needs or as a 
contribution to the cost of meeting the costs of insurance schemes 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Avoid the monetization of food aid and prioritize cash transfers untied from 
domestic production or shipping requirements above the provision of food aid 
in-kind 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Set up mechanisms, including by reforming internal decision-making processes for 
the allocation of food aid, in order to ensure that their food aid will be timely and 
well targeted and will fit into the national strategy for the realization of the right to 
food adopted at domestic level by the recipient State </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Seek information about the situation of local markets before deciding on the form 
in which food aid should be provided, in order to avoid disrupting prices or local 
agricultural production or, if local purchasing is preferred, contributing to 
increases in prices which households not covered by the food aid programme may 
not be able to afford 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) States receiving food aid should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure an objective mapping of food vulnerability and insecurity, in order to allow 
adequate targeting of food aid 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Examine the potential impacts on local agricultural production and on the 
affordability of food for the poorest segments of the population, before deciding 
under which form food aid may be accepted and how it should be distributed 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure the delivery of food aid through criteria which are transparent and, in 
principle, set out in legislation, granting a right to effective remedies to potential 
beneficiaries which are unjustifiably excluded 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Members of the World Trade Organization should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Fully implement the Marrakesh Decision, in particular by adopting guidelines 
ensuring that an increasing proportion of basic foodstuffs will be provided to 
least-developed and net food-importing developing countries (LDCs and NFIDCs) 
negatively affected by the reform programme under the WTO Agreement on 
Agriculture, in fully grant form and/or on appropriate concessional terms, by 
providing that the States parties to the FAC shall provide food aid at levels which 
ensure that NFIDCs will at all times be able to ensure an adequate protection of 
the right to food under their jurisdiction 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should systematically 
request that the reports of States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights provide information as to:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Donor States and (a) the proportion of food aid they have committed to deliver in 
an untied form; (b) the measures they have taken, in their bilateral programmes

not undermine, but instead enhances, long-term food security in the recipient 
State, and the development of its agricultural sector 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Whether in food-aid recipient States (a) they have ensured that the food aid they 
receive fits into a national strategy for the realization of the right to food; (b) the
