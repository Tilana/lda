<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of the Congo was held at the 15th 
meeting on 30 October 2013. The delegation of Congo was headed by Mr. Bienvenu 
Okiemy, Minister of Communication and Relations with Parliament. At its 19th meeting 
held on 1 November 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on the Congo. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Congo: Austria, Ethiopia and Indonesia. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Congo: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/COG/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/COG/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/COG/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Congo through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister of Communication and Relations with Parliament began his speech by 
expressing his commitment to universally shared human rights values. He said that the 
delegation had come to present to the Working Group the national report of the Congo on 
the implementation of the recommendations resulting from the first universal periodic 
review held in 2009, prepared on the basis of an inclusive process involving the 
Government, through an interministerial commission, as well as civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. He said that the Congo had accepted 51 recommendations during its first universal 
periodic review. Much attention had been accorded to their implementation but some goals 
had yet to be achieved. 
</p>
<p>7. He said that the second universal periodic review was taking place in a political 
context of greater peace and security and institutional stability that helped to strengthen 
participatory democracy and the rule of law. He continued by noting that, in economic 
terms, the country had recorded significant results which helped to improve people&#8217;s living 
conditions and poverty reduction. From the political and social standpoint, the Government 
was committed to making the Congo a place where people lived in harmony and were 
building a future together, without discrimination based on origin, social status or ethnicity, 
in compliance with the fundamental freedoms and rights of every person. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-10049 
</p>
<p>8. Concerning international human rights instruments, the Minister said that the Congo 
had become party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the 
Additional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially 
Women and Children. Furthermore, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 
169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989) were being 
ratified. 
</p>
<p>9. He said that women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities and indigenous 
peoples benefited from specific protection measures. He indicated that the Congo had been 
the first country to adopt national legislation to ensure the promotion and protection of 
indigenous peoples (Act No. 5 of 2011). 
</p><p>10. The Congo believed and adhered to multilateralism. Its relations with the United 
Nations were conducted in a framework of ongoing and constructive dialogue. The Minister 
said that since its first universal periodic review, the Congo had received visits from two 
mechanisms of the Human Rights Council: the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>11. The Minister acknowledged that the Government was aware of the delay in the 
submission of reports to the various mechanisms. Arrangements had been made to deal 
with the delay, specifically through the establishment of an interministerial committee. 
</p>
<p>12. He recalled that the independence of the judiciary was guaranteed by article 136 of 
the Constitution under which the judiciary was independent of the executive and legislative 
powers. He added that the Government was deploying all its efforts to combat corruption in 
the judiciary. For example, in 2009, 11 judges had been dismissed for corruption by the 
Supreme Council of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>13. He said that torture was prohibited by the Constitution and that its perpetrators were 
subject to criminal penalties and disciplinary sanctions. In the Congo, a country which was 
still in a post-conflict situation, the police forces had been re-established by incorporating 
ex-combatants under disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures and because 
of the country&#8217;s will to establish peace. The National Police Academy had been 
restructured and its training programmes included instruction on international humanitarian 
law and human rights. 
</p>
<p>14. The head of the Congolese delegation stated that the creation of a Ministry for the 
Advancement of Women and the integration of women in development was in line with 
women&#8217;s aspirations and expectations in the field of human rights. Gender equality was 
guaranteed by the Constitution and the law ensured women and men equal access to 
employment. Women and men with the same qualifications had equal pay. Women were 
involved in all decision-making bodies. 
</p>
<p>15. He said that sexual violence and female genital mutilation were prohibited by law. 
Although, female genital mutilation was not a cultural tradition among the Congolese, some 
Congolese communities made no secret of their support for the highly controversial 
practice. He noted that significant progress had been made in the health of mothers and 
girls through obstetric consultations and the fight against the mother-to-child transmission 
of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>16. The protection of the rights of the child was guaranteed by the 2010 Act. It ensured 
children full protection against violence, exploitation and sexual abuse, child labour, child </p>


<p>GE.14-10049 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>trafficking, neglect and abuse. One of the Government&#8217;s main priorities was children&#8217;s 
access to education. Compulsory education up to the age of 16 was free of charge. 
</p>
<p>17. In recent years the authorities had paid particular attention to the fight against 
trafficking in persons in general and in children in particular. The Congo had also 
undertaken to take action at the regional level, in cooperation with certain bilateral partners. 
</p>
<p>18. The Minister said that the exercise of civil and political rights was guaranteed by the 
Constitution and laws. During elections those rights took on particular importance. After its 
first universal periodic review, the Congo had held presidential elections in 2009 and 
parliamentary elections in 2012. During those elections, freedom of the press and freedom 
of expression had been guaranteed as well as equal treatment of candidates in terms of 
media coverage. 
</p>
<p>19. He said that the favourable economic conditions that the Congo was experiencing 
had allowed for the realization of certain economic, social and cultural rights, including the 
payment of 21 months of wage arrears to State officials, the lifting of measures adopted in 
1994 as part of structural adjustment programmes negotiated with the Bretton Woods 
institutions and a review of the salaries of State employees. 
</p>
<p>20. Significant progress had been made in the field of education where substantial 
resources had been committed to strengthening admission capacities and academic facilities 
in schools and universities. He said that the Congo had reached an enrolment rate of over 
82 per cent and allocated 3 per cent of its GDP to education, in other words, 12 per cent of 
the national budget. 
</p>
<p>21. In the field of health, specific measures had been taken, inter alia, to provide free 
malaria and tuberculosis treatment for children from 0 to 15 years, caesarean sections in 
ectopic pregnancies, as well as support for people living with HIV/AIDS. Vaccination 
coverage was close to 90 per cent for children aged 0 to 5 years. 
</p>
<p>22. The State had invested more than 1 billion euros in electricity production, bringing 
the installed capacity from 89 to 607.5 megawatts. 
</p>
<p>23. He added that in view of the poor access to drinking water (45 per cent in urban 
areas and 14 per cent in rural areas) since 2002, the State had made considerable efforts to 
improve the water supply in the main cities of the country and also to build new water 
supply systems in smaller towns and rural areas. From 2005 to 2012, investments of more 
than 1 billion euros had been made. 
</p>
<p>24. The head of the delegation said that, in 2010, the national human rights commission 
had acquired B status from the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. Since 2010, the 
Government had started work on the construction of the headquarters of the commission so 
that it had appropriate working conditions. He concluded by saying that the Government 
intended to introduce certain reforms so that the commission would be awarded A status. 
</p>

<p>64. Thanking the speakers, the head of the Congolese delegation noted the pertinence of 
Member States&#8217; comments reflecting the international community&#8217;s desire to be governed 
by the rule of law. He said that, having emerged from civil wars, the Congo had recognized 
the rule of law as the basis of Congolese society. 
</p>
<p>65. The Government ensured that the domestic legal order was in keeping with 
international standards, with a view to the consolidation of democracy in the Congo. It was 
against that background that the delegation would respond to questions during the 
interactive dialogue 
</p>
<p>66. He said that the prohibition of torture in the Congo was enshrined in the 
Constitution. He added that the Constitution did not yet contain an explicit classification of 
torture. Acts of torture were punished under conventional criminal offences against 
individuals. 
</p>
<p>67. Concerning detention conditions, the delegation noted that prisons built during the 
colonial era were designed to accommodate a small number of inmates. However, the 
Government had embarked on an extensive programme of rehabilitation and construction of 
prison facilities. 
</p>
<p>68. He said that prisons were visited by non-governmental organizations for human 
rights, the investigation and analysis services of the Directorate General of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms, the national human rights commission and international 
institutions that so requested. 
</p>
<p>69. Concerning the ratification of international legal instruments, he said that the 
process of ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance had commenced. Ratification had been approved on first reading 
in the Senate. The adoption process was under way in the National Assembly. Both Houses 
of Parliament had adopted the draft law on ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. The law would be enacted before 2014. 
Similarly, the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was being considered. 
</p>
<p>70. The Minister said that the Congo had not applied the death penalty since 1982. As 
such, the country was considered to be de facto abolitionist. The question of the legal 
abolition of the death penalty was under consideration, taking into account change in 
attitude towards the matter. 
</p>
<p>71. On corruption, the Minister referred to a number of measures carried out between 
2012 and 2013 by the national commission to combat corruption, fraud and bribery, 
including the hearing of 311 companies awarded public works contracts, and to the 
establishment of a platform with civil society to create an early warning system. 
</p>
<p>72. With regard to women&#8217;s rights, since 2009 the Congo had a national gender policy 
which placed particular emphasis on the representation of women in decision-making. The 
electoral law imposed quotas on the representation of women in the electoral lists of </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-10049 
</p>
<p>political parties, failing which they were rejected. Those quotas were 15 per cent for the 
parliamentary elections and 20 per cent in local elections. A centre to promote women in 
politics had also been created. 
</p>
<p>73. Combating sexual violence was a government concern. To that end, two draft laws 
had been drafted: one on gender violence, accompanied by an action plan for 2013&#8211;2017; 
another one on the definition and punishment of sexual harassment. The head of the 
Congolese delegation indicated that the two draft laws complemented existing provisions in 
the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>74. Armenia noted steps taken to protect children, including the adoption of legislation 
prohibiting child labour, the recruitment of child soldiers or the trafficking or sale of 
children. It encouraged efforts to ensure women&#8217;s equal rights to property ownership, 
employment and political life. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Australia acknowledged efforts to improve the national human rights framework. It 
acknowledged a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and commended efforts to 
provide safe drinking water and ensure access to education for all children. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Bangladesh noted that challenges such as high infant, child and maternal mortality 
rates, low women&#8217;s participation and the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, still needed to be 
addressed. It called on the international community to provide the necessary support to the 
Congo. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Belgium noted that women continued to suffer from all forms of discrimination and 
violence. It also noted that, despite a de facto moratorium on the death penalty, its 2009 
commitments had yet to be implemented. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Benin expressed appreciation for the adoption of legislation to promote and protect 
the rights of indigenous peoples, children and persons living with HIV/AIDS, as well to 
prohibit the trafficking and sexual exploitation of indigenous women and children. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Botswana welcomed legislative reforms in the area of human rights, especially 
concerning the rights of children, persons living with HIV/AIDS and indigenous women 
and children. It encouraged further steps towards reviewing legislation on its national 
human rights commission. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Brazil noted the adoption of legislation and action plans on gender, children&#8217;s rights 
and health. However, it remained concerned about women&#8217;s rights, the disproportionately 
high number of women with HIV/AIDS and women&#8217;s lack of awareness of their rights. 
Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Burkina Faso welcomed the strengthening of the national human rights commission 
and commended progress made in education and reducing maternal and infant mortality. It 
encouraged further efforts in that regard. It welcomed the prohibition on FGM. Burkina 
Faso made recommendations. 
</p>

and give priority to education. It commended adoption of legislation to combat HIV/AIDS 
and protect persons living with HIV. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>83. Cambodia noted endeavours to enhance development, increase growth and 
employment and reduce poverty. It commended ratification of key international human 
rights instruments, particularly those addressing trafficking in persons and protecting 
children&#8217;s rights, including OP-CRC-AC. It made recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.14-10049 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>84. Canada asked what measures had been adopted to combat the spread of HIV, in line

</p>
<p>85. Cabo Verde stressed the importance of the Congo ratifying international human 
rights instruments that it had already signed and of their incorporation into domestic
