<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in Cambodia, Surya P. Subedi 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> Having produced four substantive and substantial reports with a thorough analysis of 
the situation of human rights and the challenges that Cambodia faces in terms of the 
promotion and protection of human rights since his appointment by the Human Rights 
Council in March 2009, the Special Rapporteur focused his last two missions to the country &#8211; 
one conducted in December 2012 and the other  in May 2013 &#8211; on the follow-up to the 
recommendations made in his reports and on monitoring the situation of human rights in 
Cambodia. His previous annual reports to the Council focused on judicial, parliamentary and 
electoral reform and on the human rights impact of economic and other land concessions. His 
reports included a series of recommendations designed to assist the Government with their 
reform agenda and the process of democratization in the country. Rather than taking up a 
new human rights theme, he considered it timely to take stock of the progress made on the 
follow-up to the recommendations made in his previous reports. 
</p>
<p> The reception that the Special Rapporteur received from the Government during his 
mission to the country in December 2012 was a frosty one during which no senior member of 
the Government was available to meet with him. In the wake of the publication of two major 
reports by the Special Rapporteur &#8211; one on electoral reform and the other one on economic 
and other land concessions &#8211; he was subjected to some raw remarks descending to the 
personal level. This was highly regrettable, as the focus of the dialogue between the Special 
Rapporteur and the Government should remain strictly on the substance of the work he is 
mandated to carry out by the United Nations, and not on him as a person. However, the 
Government cooperated with him during his mission to the country in May 2013, when he 
met with a broad range of stakeholders. They included senior members of the Government 
who were forthcoming with information, prepared to acknowledge deficiencies where they 
existed, and willing to work with the Special Rapporteur in a constructive manner to address 
the remaining challenges concerning greater protection of human rights, stronger democracy 
and genuine rule of law in Cambodia. He was satisfied with the level of engagement and 
dialogue with various government interlocutors; the dialogue was candid, cordial and 
constructive.  
</p>
<p> While the private meetings with senior members of the Government were 
</p>

<p>constructive, the Special Rapporteur regrets that he was subjected to some unpleasant 
incidents during the mission. If the media reports are to be believed, these were staged 
protests designed to intimidate and harass the Special Rapporteur in order to distract him 
from his focus on substantive issues. He was also subjected to baseless allegations of bias 
against the Government. These were all familiar lines of criticism of the work of the Special 
Rapporteur and were not much different from the treatment meted out to his predecessors. 
While the experience was unpleasant, this did not distract the Special Rapporteur from the 
objectives of his mission and he continued to advocate the reform agenda of the national 
institutions responsible for promoting and protecting human rights to move forward. In fact, 
as a reaction to these incidents, he received tremendous messages of support for his work in 
Cambodia from people from various walks of life, by which he was greatly encouraged. In 
addition to the government interlocutors, the Special Rapporteur also interacted with various 
other stakeholders in Cambodian society, including the various political parties, civil society, 
local communities, private citizens and development partners of Cambodia. 
</p>
<p> Overall, Cambodia seems to be moving along on the road to democracy. It has come a 
long way since the conclusion of the Paris Peace Agreements in 1991 and adoption of the 
new Constitution founded on liberal democratic values in 1993. Some of the major steps 
taken in a positive direction within the review period were the release of Mr. Mam Sonando, 
a prominent human rights defender, and the granting of pardon to the leader of the 
opposition, Mr. Sam Rainsy, paving his return to the country from exile in France to 
participate in the political process in the country. However, Cambodia still has some way to 
go in promoting and protecting human rights, strengthening good governance, enhancing the 
independence and capacity of State institutions responsible for upholding people&#8217;s rights, as 
was acknowledged by government interlocutors throughout the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission 
to the country in May 2013. He sees as a sign of progress that the Government has readily 
admitted these shortcomings in his meetings, showing its willingness to work with him in its 
endeavour to improve the human rights situation for the people of Cambodia. While the 
Constitution of Cambodia speaks of a liberal democracy, in reality the situation is akin to a 
limited democracy in many respects. The country has some way to go in conforming to 
international human rights standards that flow from the human rights treaties voluntarily 
ratified by Cambodia and is striving towards that end. 
</p>
<p> The international community has invested heavily in Cambodia since the conclusion 
of the Paris Peace Agreements and the first democratic elections held under the auspices of 
the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in 1993. The wish of the 
State parties to the Paris Peace Agreements and the national stakeholders that participated in 
the Paris Conference on Cambodia was to see Cambodia develop as a liberal democracy. The 
Special Rapporteur sees a role for the international community, including that of his 
mandate, in assisting the people and the Government of Cambodia in moving towards a fuller 
liberal democracy underpinned by sustainable peace and equitable economic development. 
As will be seen from an account of the achievements made in implementing his 
recommendations throughout this report, while some of his recommendations seem to have 
been implemented, some others seem to be under active consideration for implementation. 
These are encouraging indications and the Government should be commended for these 
achievements. While the process of judicial, parliamentary and electoral reform has been 
slow, the Government is yet to act on most of the recommendations relating to the granting 
and management of economic and other land concessions. It is in this context that, as ever, he 
stands ready to assist the Government of Cambodia. With this in mind, he urges the 
Government to speed up the process of promised reform of State institutions responsible for 
protecting and promoting human rights and to accelerate the process of democratization of 
the country so that the benefits of economic growth can be shared equitably by all in the 
country.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the fifth report of the present Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Cambodia submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 18/25. 
</p>
<p>2. During the year under review, the Special Rapporteur continued to monitor the 
situation of human rights in Cambodia. He continued to receive information on the situation 
of human rights from different stakeholders in Cambodia, including the Government, the 
opposition political parties, civil society organizations and private citizens, some of whom 
had sought the help of the Special Rapporteur in addressing the violation of human rights in 
the country. The Special Rapporteur conducted two country visits during the review period 
&#8211; one in December 2012 and the other in May 2013. While the Government resumed its 
regular mode of cooperation with the Special Rapporteur and he was able to meet with a 
broad range of stakeholders within the Government in May 2013, the Special Rapporteur 
regrets the gap in information that was created by the Government&#8217;s refusal to meet with 
him in December 2012. The key pillars to the work of a special rapporteur are 
independence, impartiality and objectivity. To this end, it is imperative in the exercise of 
his mandate that the Special Rapporteur have the opportunity to interact with all segments 
of Cambodian society, without any exception. The missed opportunity for dialogue with the 
Government is a significant one, particularly as the objective of the two missions was to 
take stock of the progress achieved on the implementation of the recommendations the 
Special Rapporteur had made in his previous reports and to jointly identify how best to 
address the remaining challenges. It is in this context that the Special Rapporteur presents 
this report to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>3. During his mission to the country in May 2013 the Special Rapporteur was able to 
meet with a broad range of stakeholders from the Government, other political parties, civil 
society and development partners of Cambodia. He met with senior members of the 
Government, notably, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Mr. Sar 
Kheng, the Senior Minister and the President of the Cambodian Human Rights Committee, 
Mr. Om Yentieng, the President of the National Election Committee, Mr. Im Sousdey, the 
Chairman of the Commission on Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation, Information, 
and Media of the National Assembly, Mr. Chheang Vun, the Secretary-General of the 
Senate, Mr. Oum Sarith, and Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice Mr. Prum Sidhra. 
The Special Rapporteur was very pleased with the constructive engagement and dialogue 
he had with these dignitaries. During his meeting with the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Om 
Yentieng handed over an undated document to the Special Rapporteur outlining the 
response and comments of the Government to some of the issues contained in the previous 
reports of the Special Rapporteur. The document had never been submitted by the 
Government to the Special Rapporteur and thus he was pleased to receive the document 
which was helpful in understanding the position of the Government on some of the human 
rights issues facing the country. While helpful for understanding the position of the 
Government, its response did not significantly alter the analysis presented by the Special 
Rapporteur in his reports or the recommendations contained therein. 
</p>
<p>4. Generally speaking, Cambodia continues to do well on a number of economic 
indicators, supported by political stability. The country appears to be on course to achieve 
some of the Millennium Development Goals. With the death, in October 2012, of the 
former king, Norodom Sihanouk, who played such a crucial role in preserving the 
independence and integrity of the country through some of the most challenging times in 
modern history, the country has entered a new era. The Special Rapporteur visited the 
Royal Palace to pay his last respects to the late king during his mission to the country in 
December 2012 and expressed the view that the mourning period of the death of the king </p>


<p>was also an opportunity to celebrate what he had achieved during his lifetime for peace, 
stability, political reconciliation, democracy, rule of law and human rights and what 
Cambodia had achieved since the conclusion of the Paris Peace Agreements in 1991. This 
was a period for contemplation and demonstration of a new resolve to move forward in 
harmony and reconciliation for the greater good of the country. 
</p>
<p>5. Since his appointment as Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Cambodia by the Human Rights Council in March 2009, the Special Rapporteur has 
produced four substantive and substantial reports each with a thorough analysis of the 
situation of human rights and a series of constructive recommendations designed to assist 
the Government with its reform agenda and the process of democratization in the country. 
However, in spite of the progress made in a number of areas, there are a number of other 
human rights issues that remain a matter of concern for the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>6. For instance, land rights continue to be a major issue in this country. Another area of 
concern is freedom of expression which remains weak and has come under attack 
throughout the review period. Impunity is a long-standing issue. So are the independence of 
the judiciary and the ability of parliament to function as an effective check on the 
executive. It is in this context that the Special Rapporteur chose to focus both of his 
missions during the review period on the follow-up to his recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Communications sent to the Government 
</b>7. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur addressed a number of 
communications to the Government on specific cases of human rights concern as outlined 
below.   
</p>
<p>8. On 4 June 2012, a joint urgent appeal was made in relation to the families in the 
Boeung Kak Lake dispute. The communication was sent jointly by the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
right to non-discrimination in this context, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences. The appeal drew attention to 
information regarding the arrests and sentencing of 13 women from the Boeung Kak Lake 
community during their peaceful protest, including the arrest of two other representatives 
from the area, as well as the arrest of Venerable Loun Savath and exertion of undue 
influence on him to cease his human rights work. Concerns were expressed that the rights 
to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly of the 15 representatives of the Boeung 
Kak Lake community and Venerable Loun Savath might have been violated, and that those 
violations might have been directly related to their activities in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. On 13 August 2012, an allegation letter was sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders. The communication addressed the situation of Mr. Pen 
Bonnar and Mr. Chim Savuth, two staff members of the human rights non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC) 
and the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) respectively. CCHR, along with 
other human rights NGOs, was the subject of a communication sent on 26 September 2011 
regarding the events that took place on 27 July 2012. Mr. Pen Bonnar and Mr. Chim Savuth </p>


<p>were delivering a training course on land rights issues in Patang village. Despite a letter to 
the Village Chief of Patang to inform him of the training session, law enforcement officials 
interrupted the session. Law enforcement officials also accused ADHOC of undertaking 
&#8220;incitement activities&#8221; and warned both men to leave the area, otherwise their security 
would not be guaranteed. Concerns were expressed that the disruption of the human rights 
training course and the threats against the two staff members might have been related to the 
exercise of their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association. 
</p>
<p>10. Another joint urgent appeal was sent on 29 August 2012 with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders. The letter addressed charges brought against Mr. Mam Sonando, director 
and owner of independent radio station 105 (Beehive Radio). Mr. Sonando was the subject 
of a number of communications submitted to the Government of Cambodia on behalf of 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council, including an urgent appeal letter sent on 
14 October 2005 and an allegation letter of 28 February 2006. On 16 July 2012, Mr. 
Sonando (president of an NGO established to promote democratic freedoms and raise 
awareness of civil political rights) was formally charged by the Phnom Penh Municipal 
Court in accordance with six articles derived from the Penal Code including &#8220;insurrection&#8221; 
and &#8220;inciting people to take up arms against the authorities&#8221;. Reports suggested that the 
charges brought against Mr. Sonando might have stemmed from a speech made by Prime 
Minister Hun Sen in which Mr. Sonando was accused of instigating a plot for a village in 
Kratie Province to secede from Cambodia and become an independent state. The Prime 
Minister&#8217;s speech came a day after Beehive Radio had broadcast a report about a complaint 
lodged in the International Criminal Court on 22 June, accusing the Government of 
committing crimes against humanity by displacing thousands of people through forced 
evictions. Concern was expressed that the alleged arrest, detention and sentencing of Mr. 
Sonando might have been directly related to his legitimate work in raising awareness of 
civil and political rights in Cambodia. There was also concern that the charges brought 
against him might have represented a direct attempt to prevent him from exercising his 
legitimate right to freedom of expression.   
</p>
<p>11. Further, a joint allegation letter sent on 25 October 2012 concerned Mr. Sonando&#8217;s 
trial, and was also written by the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers. On 1 October 2012, Mr. Sonando was found guilty of being the instigator of an 
insurrectionary movement, inciting people to take arms against State authority, obstruction 
of public officials with aggravating circumstances, and unlawful interference in the 
discharge of public functions. Mr. Sonando reportedly contracted a serious respiratory 
infection in prison and required access to the necessary medical care. Serious concern was 
expressed that the long prison sentence imposed on Mr. Sonando might have represented a 
direct attempt to prevent him from exercising his legitimate right to freedom of expression. 
Further, concern was expressed at allegations received indicating that Mr. Sonando&#8217;s 
situation could have been linked to his activities in the promotion of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.   
</p>
<p>12. On 15 March 2013, the Special Rapporteur welcomed, through a press statement, the 
release of Mr. Sonando following the decision of the Cambodian Court of Appeal on 14 
March 2013. He noted that the Court of Appeal had found that there was no evidence to 
support many of the charges, after first instance sentences of periods up to 20 years on 
charges including instigating insurrection. He also noted that some of the significant defects 
in the original trial, which were highlighted by some of his interlocutors with whom the </p>


<p>Special Rapporteur met during his mission to Cambodia in December 2012, were remedied 
on appeal. However, he regretted that some of the convictions remained in place, and new 
charges and convictions were introduced, with no opportunity for the accused to prepare his 
defence.  
</p>
<p>13. In addition, on 8 May 2013, the Special Rapporteur appealed to the Minister of Land 
Management, Urban Planning and Construction for disaggregated data by province on the 
implementation of Directive 01 on the Measures to Strengthen and Foster Effectiveness for 
the Management of ELCs (economic land concessions), including the number of hectares 
distributed for the purposes of private title, the location in which the titles had been issued 
and which private companies had been involved. He noted with appreciation the updated 
information placed on the website by province, and called for enhanced information related 
to the concessions subject to excision of land, and the role of the concessionaires. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to further dialogue on how the ministry is 
addressing titling in disputed areas, including addressing petitions by villagers who have 
protested against their exclusion from the titling programme, or disagreement related to the 
measuring process during the 30-day period of public display. Preventing encroachment 
and ensuring the right to remedy remain of paramount concern to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Follow-up to recommendations on the judiciary 
</b>14. The report of the Special Rapporteur to the fifteenth session of the Human Rights 
Council in 2010 focused on the judiciary (A/HRC/15/46). Three years on, the Special 
Rapporteur sought to assess the status of implementation of the recommendations contained 
in that report. 
</p>
<p>15. In terms of legal reform, the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that the four main 
codes are now in place, namely the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the 
Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure. Nonetheless, several other important pieces of 
legislation remain pending after many years. In particular, the three fundamental laws on 
the status of judges and prosecutors, on the organization of courts and the reform of the 
Supreme Council of Magistracy have still not been adopted. Nonetheless, he was 
encouraged by the assurance given to him that drafts of the three fundamental laws that 
were part of his key recommendations were almost ready and will be tabled before 
Parliament in the first half of 2014.  
</p>
<p>16. Overall, the situation of the judiciary in Cambodia has not fundamentally changed 
since 2010. Despite some progress, the pace of judicial reform remains very slow. The 
challenges are the same, namely lack of independence, problems of capacity, lack of 
resources, widespread corruption, all resulting in a lack of confidence by the general public 
in the ability of the court system to provide effective remedies when human rights 
violations do occur. 
</p>
<p>17. During his May 2013 mission, the Special Rapporteur was able to meet with 
representatives of the Ministry of Justice, representatives of the Bar Association and NGOs 
working in the legal and judicial sector. Despite several attempts, he regrets that he was not 
able to meet with any judge or prosecutor during his mission. 
</p><p>18. In order to protect the independence of judges and prosecutors, it is imperative that 
Cambodia adopt the three fundamental laws on the status of judges and prosecutors, on the 
organization and functioning of the courts, and on the reform of the Supreme Council of 
Magistracy. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to engage in full and 
meaningful consultations with all the relevant stakeholders before the adoption of these 
three laws and looks forward to their adoption in 2014. </p>


<p>19. In the meantime, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that according to 
information received, some judges and prosecutors continue to be actively involved in 
political activities. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his previous recommendation that the 
current draft Law on the Status of Judges and Prosecutors ban active party political 
members from holding judicial positions and ban judges and prosecutors from acting as 
advisers to party political leaders or ministers.  
</p>
<p>20. Adequate remuneration of judges and prosecutors remains essential to ensure their 
independence. The Special Rapporteur notes that the basic salary and allowance of judges 
and prosecutors has not been increased since his last report on the judiciary. Moreover, the 
overall budget of the justice system has not increased in any significant way. According to 
figures contained in the annual report of the Ministry of Justice, the justice sector received 
US$ 9 million in 2011, which amounts to a paltry 0.36 per cent of the national budget.  
</p><p>21. The Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that the independence of prosecutors is as 
important as the independence of judges in order to ensure the integrity of the justice 
system. On the status of prosecutors, it remains unclear whether prosecutors will be under 
the control of the Ministry of Justice or the Supreme Council of Magistracy when the new 
law on the status of judges and prosecutors is adopted. 
22. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by some positive developments in the 
criminal justice sector. He was informed that following a donors meeting convened by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Australia 
(AusAID) agreed to fund an additional building for the Court of Appeal. The construction 
of this building has been completed and the new building was inaugurated in 2012. There 
are now two additional courtrooms which allows for more cases to be heard, and upgraded 
facilities for the court clerks. The number of appeal judges has also increased. Appeal cases 
are now heard within one or two years, which is a great improvement on the previous 
situation. The President of the Court of Appeal and OHCHR worked together over the past 
year to reduce the appeal backlog &#8211; it is expected that the backlog of oldest cases (pending 
for more than seven years) will be cleared by the end of 2013. Australia has provided 
funding for a new computerized system to register and manage cases. Overall, court 
management at the Court of Appeal has improved. According to information received, the 
draft law on the organization of courts provides for the creation of new courts of appeal in 
the provinces, which will hopefully further improve the appeal process. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to hear that the Bar Association has 
amended its Code of Professional Conduct for lawyers, with the technical assistance of 
OHCHR. The new Code was adopted in September 2012. It provides that lawyers will 
respect and promote human rights. The new Code also provides that lawyers do not need to 
consult, nor inform the Bar President when they wish to speak to the media, which was the 
case under the old Code. Earlier this year, the new Bar President caused controversy by 
warning lawyers to be careful before participating in law dissemination programmes on 
radio or television. This was interpreted as a veiled attempt to dissuade lawyers from 
speaking to the media. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear a representative of the 
Bar President confirm that lawyers are free to speak to the media. 
</p>
<p>24. The number of lawyers remains extremely low in Cambodia in comparison to many 
other countries. The number of legal aid lawyers is clearly insufficient and most of them 
work in Phnom Penh. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, those who are arrested have 
access to a lawyer only after 24 hours. Even then, very few in practice enjoy access to a 
lawyer, either because the judicial police continue to deny such access or because there are 
simply no lawyers available. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate 
his previous recommendation that the Government consider amending the Code to provide 
for immediate access to a lawyer during police custody, in line with international good 
practices.<b> </b></p>


<p>25. Legal aid is mainly provided through NGOs supported by international donors. 
However, funding has been significantly reduced in recent years. In addition, most donor 
funding is earmarked for specific types of cases such as trafficking cases, cases of domestic 
violence, juvenile cases, etc. There is little funding available for general legal aid work. In 
several provinces of Cambodia, there is not a single legal aid lawyer, which raises serious 
problems in terms of access to justice. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, legal 
representation is compulsory in felony and juvenile cases, which means that if there is no 
lawyer available, the case cannot proceed.  
</p>
<p>26. In order to ensure access to justice for the poorest, the Government needs to urgently 
consider the establishment of a national legal aid system, in line with the recently adopted 
United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice 
Systems (General Assembly resolution 67/187 of 28 March 2013)<i>. </i>The Special Rapporteur 
also wishes to recall that access to justice can also be improved through measures such as 
increasing the number of lawyers and using paralegals in the criminal justice system, and 
encourages the Government to explore these avenues. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that judges continue to use the provisions of 
the Criminal Code against human rights defenders and all those who express opinions 
which are not favourable to the Government. The Special Rapporteur has observed over the 
last few years that prosecutors have tended to abandon defamation and disinformation 
charges and use incitement instead (arts. 494-498 of the Criminal Code). It should be noted 
here that defamation can lead to a fine, whereas incitement can lead to a prison sentence. 
</p>
<p>28. Over the last year, the most high profile case that also attracted significant 
international attention was that of Mam Sonando, the owner of the Beehive Radio station, 
who was sentenced to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment on some spurious charges focusing on 
incitement to secession. His sentence was reduced on appeal and he was released. 
According to information received, it appears that NGO workers are regularly threatened 
with prosecution for incitement.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Follow-up to recommendations on Parliament 
</b></p>
<p>29. In his 2011 report to the eighteenth session of the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/18/46), the Special Rapporteur outlined a series of measures that he considers 
critical for Cambodia in order to accelerate the process of democratization in the country in 
relation to the Parliament. Many of them concerned specific matters that directly impact on 
the ability of the Parliament to function properly, to enact laws that promote and protect 
human rights, to be accessible to its diverse constituency, and to be a model for society in 
internalizing a culture of constructive criticism, the sharing of views and power, and a 
genuine sense of common purpose.  
</p>
<p>30. Among his key recommendations: 
</p>
<p>(a)  He suggested that the procedure for removing parliamentary immunity and 
other disciplinary actions against sitting Members of Parliament should be brought in line 
with the principles of natural justice, constitutional standards and freedom of expression; 
</p>
<p>(b)  The Government should increase the resources allocated to Parliament to 
enhance the overall capacity of Parliament as an independent and effective institution and 
the capacity of individual Members of Parliament to scrutinize draft laws tabled before 
Parliament by the Government; 
</p>
<p>(c)  He also highlighted that the Constitution of Cambodia makes it mandatory to 
hold a National Congress once a year under the chairmanship of the King to enable the 
people to be directly informed on various matters of national interest and to raise issues of </p>


<p>concern to the authorities of all three main organs of the State. One interlocutor was of the 
view that the concept of the National Congress was no longer needed in the country now 
that the National Assembly and Senate were bodies composed of people&#8217;s representatives. 
The Congress however remains a constitutional requirement. As the King is the guarantor 
of the Constitution, the monarch should be able to receive people in audience and receive 
information from people from all walks of life. It should be held every year as mandated by 
the Constitution. For this, the organic law relating to the National Congress should be 
enacted without delay; 
</p>
<p>(d)  He called for the strengthening of the role of the Human Rights Commissions 
in Parliament to mainstream human rights as a cross-cutting issue and to ensure the 
compliance of domestic laws with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>(e)  He called on all Members of Parliament, including members of opposition 
parties, to participate fully in the work of Parliament and cooperate, in particular in the 
work of the Commissions of the National Assembly; 
</p>
<p>(f)  Regarding the Constitutional Council, he recommended that it review not 
only the laws enacted by Parliament but also the internal rules of Parliament in general and 
the National Assembly in particular, to ascertain whether they were compatible with the 
Constitution, international human rights standards, and the principles of rule of law, 
including the principles of natural justice; 
</p>
<p>(g)  Among the urgent tasks before Parliament is the review of the new Criminal 
Code with a view to ensuring its compliance with the permissible limitation to freedom of 
expression under international human rights law. Parliament should safeguard the right to 
freedom of expression of its own members and protect their parliamentary immunity. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to his recommendations on parliamentary reform, the Special 
Rapporteur was encouraged by a positive response from the President of the Foreign 
Relations Commission of the National Assembly and the Secretary-General of the Senate 
and by a willingness to implement many of them in the next Parliament. He was given 
information about the efforts being made to implement some of his recommendations and 
the difficulties involved in implementing others. In regard to nearly all of them, however, 
he regrets that recent developments demonstrate not an advancement towards better 
protection of human rights but, on the contrary, a disturbing reversal. The passage of most 
of the critical laws raised in his report had not progressed. The days following his mission 
saw the dismissal of 29 opposition Members of Parliament on 5 June 2013, on the eve of 
the start of the official electoral campaigning period. By this act, those Members of 
Parliament were denied not only the ability to carry their messages through Parliament, but 
also their salaries and parliamentary immunity from prosecution, which has created an 
unhealthy and undemocratic environment for this important imminent milestone in the 
political development of the nation. 
</p>
<p>32. With this in mind, the Special Rapporteur once again calls upon the Government to 
revisit the recommendations on parliamentary reform contained in his report with a view to 
implementing them without further delay.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Follow-up to recommendations on elections  
</b></p>
<p>33. The subject of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the twenty-first session of the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/21/63) was electoral reform. While the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mission in May 2013 took place at an important time when the country was 
on the cusp of elections for the National Assembly, the present report was finalized some </p>


<p>weeks prior to the parliamentary elections and thus does not contain developments in the 
fast-moving election process since then.  
</p>
<p>34. Cambodians will go to the polls on 28 July 2013 for the eighth time since the 1991 
Paris Peace Agreements.1 The National Election Committee (NEC) announced that 9.67 
million Cambodians would be eligible to cast their ballots in 19,009 polling stations to elect 
the 123-seat Parliament by proportional representation.2 The election is contested by 8 
political parties.3 Seats in the current National Assembly are held by the Cambodian 
People&#8217;s Party (90 seats), the Sam Rainsy Party (26 seats), the Human Rights Party (3 
seats), FUNCINPEC (2 seats) and the Norodom Ranariddh party (2 seats). In July 2012, the 
Sam Rainsy Party and the Human Rights Party agreed to merge to create a new political 
party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).   
</p><p>35. Compared to previous national elections, the overall pre-electoral situation was very 
calm at the time of drafting. In rural areas, human rights groups reported only rare cases of 
politically motivated violence or physical intimidation. This consistent reduction in the 
level of political violence is showing an important improvement towards democratization. 
However, a campaign of intimidations and pressure still prevails particularly in rural areas. 
Local State human resources such as the village chiefs and the commune chiefs have been 
reported to have been used as political agents to persuade people to vote for the ruling 
party. That is a clear breach of the electoral law. It has also to be reported that a number of 
signboards advertising the CNRP have been pulled down or destroyed in Svay Rieng, Prey 
Veng, Takeo, Kandal and Battambang provinces, contributing to the creation of more 
intimidation. One mass rally was organized by the opposition in Phnom Penh in May. The 
Special Rapporteur was pleased to see that it unfolded peacefully and he hopes that mass 
gatherings, whether for election purposes or to highlight particular concerns or issues such 
as working conditions or forced evictions, will also be conducted and dealt with peacefully. 
</p>
<p>36. A number of concerns have been raised, however, in relation to the context in which 
the elections are taking place, some of which might not be conducive to a free and fair 
outcome. In this regard, while the Special Rapporteur realizes that time may be required to 
implement some of his recommendations and to generate the necessary political will to do 
so, he regrets that most of his recommendations with regard to electoral reform have not 
been acted upon. Specifically, the Special Rapporteur continues to have concerns over the 
independence of the NEC, freedom of expression, access to media for all political parties 
(particularly television) during the pre-electoral period, use of State resources by political 
parties in campaigning, the use of threats of legal action against politicians, concerns over 
the integrity of the voter list, reports of intimidation of voters, and a general lack of 
transparency in the electoral process. 
</p>
<p>37. During his mission in May, the Special Rapporteur reiterated these concerns during 
his meetings with the President of the NEC and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Interior. He sought assurance from them that the necessary measures would be taken to

<p>ensure equitable access to State media by all political parties and the impartiality of the 
police and army personnel and civil servants during the elections. The NEC provided a 
detailed response to the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on electoral reform 
contained in his report and on the current concerns of civil society and opposition political 
parties in this regard. While the Special Rapporteur was satisfied by some of the responses 
and assurances provided, the response to many of the recommendations was unsatisfactory 
as explained below.  
</p>
<p>38. In particular, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the principal law governing 
elections in Cambodia, the Law on Election of Members of the National Assembly 
(LEMNA) has not been amended since the publication of his report on elections in July 
2012, despite his recommendations to that effect. The Special Rapporteur is, however, 
aware that the NEC made efforts to strengthen its independence by appointing two senior 
retired judges to its membership. It has also accepted some suggestions of civil society 
organizations such as the prohibition of the use of State resources such as cars, buildings 
and the services of civil servants in partisan election campaigns; the granting of permission 
to use public places such as the market for political campaigning by all parties; the 
prohibition of the placement of signboards and campaign materials supporting specific 
political parties in or on State buildings. Unfortunately, these welcome efforts are offset by 
a number of instances of political interference by civil servants that are still being reported. 
Despite the assurances expressed by the NEC that public servants are not permitted as 
officials to engage in active campaigning for a political party during their working hours, 
public servants from the lowest to the highest levels of Government have not strictly abided 
by this rule. This is even more pronounced in the rural areas. The Special Rapporteur is 
therefore obliged to recall that all civil servants, police and military, are not permitted to 
carry out activities that favour one political party. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned 
about several issues brought to his attention by a number of independent election 
monitoring and human rights organizations.  
</p>
<p>39. A key concern is the integrity of the voter registration process and subsequent voter 
lists. Two audits of the voter lists undertaken in early 2013, one by the National Democratic 
Institute (NDI) and the election monitoring group, the Neutral and Impartial Committee for 
Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia (NICFEC), the other by the election monitoring group, 
the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia (COMFREL) have revealed flaws 
that would directly impact the vote. While the Special Rapporteur is not in a position to 
verify the accuracy of these findings, he is of the view that such concerns must be noted 
and if appropriate, duly addressed, particularly given that they originate from more than one 
source. The NDI/NICFEC Voter Registry Audit (VRA) reported &#8220;an overall decline in the 
quality of the voters list since 2008 with regard to comprehensiveness, accuracy and 
currency&#8221;. It suggests that the voter registration rate has decreased from 87.9 per cent 
eligible voters in 2008 to 82.9 per cent in 2013 and that &#8220;10.8% of eligible citizens who 
believe they are registered cannot be found on the list and will not be able to vote on the 
election day&#8221;. The audit also revealed that &#8220;only 63.6% of the names on the voters list can 
be verified in person to currently live where they are registered, while another 17.9% of 
respondents exist but live most of the time in another location and a further 10.4% do not 
exist in person&#8221;. Another survey conducted by COMFREL, using a different methodology, 
arrived at similar conclusions. The NEC declared the audits unreliable for methodological 
reasons. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that the NEC hired an independent firm 
to conduct another audit of the voter list. It found that 9.7 per cent of the voter names were 
missing, which is close to the results of the NDI/NICFEC and COMFREL audits. However, 
by cross-checking the results with their private database, the NEC finally reported that only 
3 per cent of eligible voters who claimed to have registered were unaccounted for in the 
registry. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, based on the results of the first audits, the 
correction of the list could not have been made earlier, permitting a larger number of people </p>


<p>to exercise their right to vote. The Special Rapporteur commends the initiative of the NEC 
to undertake its own audit. He maintains his view that only a transparent check of the voter 
registration list, conducted through a process that allows for corrections in case of errors, 
will conclusively determine that exclusion from the list will not lead to a denial of the right 
to vote of any eligible voters. There is concern that public confidence in the process and the 
results of the election will be undermined. 
</p>
<p>40. In order to allow the voter list to be verified in time for the election, civil society 
organizations urged the NEC to post voter lists in all villages so that voters could easily 
check their names and report any anomalies to the Commune/Sangkat Election 
Commissions (CECs), which could then review and revise the voter list. During its meeting 
with the NEC, the Special Rapporteur raised these issues. The NEC reiterated its refusal to 
post the voter lists at village level for the reason that &#8220;the law, regulation and procedures do 
not state about the posting of voters&#8217; list in the village&#8221;.4 At the same time, the Special 
Rapporteur noted that the NEC agreed to post the lists at the level of Communes/Sangkats 
one month before election day and proposed the establishment of telephone hotlines and the 
posting of the voter list on a website in order to facilitate the checking of the names. He 
understands that the NEC has acted on these two points. The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges the significant improvements that they represent, while also noting that they 
are nevertheless insufficient to ensure easy access to this basic information for the majority 
of the population that inhabits the Cambodian countryside. 
</p>
<p>41. Another measure proposed by civil society organizations to ensure the neutrality and 
the independence of the CECs was to establish an ad hoc commission to recruit and accredit 
CECs and polling/counting station officers involving members of political parties who hold 
a seat at the National Assembly. This was rejected by the NEC. 
</p><p>42. In addition, the Special Rapporteur notes that an excessive number of extra ballots 
have been printed (more than 2.5 million more ballots than registered voters). He expresses 
hope that every single ballot will be accounted for by the NEC, as this would go far in 
alleviating some of the potential apprehension about the results of the election.  
</p>
<p>43. The weeks following the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit were marked by intimidation 
against opposition leaders through the use of legal actions such as their removal from the 
National Assembly and the use of laws to penalize some of their alleged statements and 
activities.  
</p>
<p>44. On 5 June 2013, the 12-member National Assembly Standing Committee comprised 
of legislators from the ruling party (CPP) decided to strip 29 opposition members of their 
parliamentary status. While the question of the legality of this action is open to discussion, 
this action resonates as politically motivated intimidation against the opposition parties. 
This builds on a number of other developments that appear aimed at intimidating opposition 
figures. The loss of their status also deprives opposition Members of Parliament of 
parliamentary immunity, which impacts their ability to speak out safely and leaves them 
open to criminal prosecution.  
</p>
<p>45. Legal action, notably prosecution for defamation or incitement, has been used to 
discredit the main opposition party, the CNRP. Kem Sokha, the acting President of the 
CNRP, has found himself in several controversies which erupted into lawsuits filed against 
him and threats of more.  
</p>
<p>46. On 25 May 2013, a transcript of an alleged audio recording of Kem Sokha was 
released by the Press and Quick Reaction Unit of the Council of Ministers, purportedly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Letter from the NEC (N. 05.22/13 NEC/S.G/PIB) dated 9 May. </p>


<p>saying that the Khmer Rouge&#8217;s notorious S-21 prison, also commonly known as &#8220;Tuol 
Sleng&#8221;, was an artificial invention set up by the Vietnamese. On 27 May, the Prime 
Minister called for a law to criminalize denial of crimes by the Khmer Rouge to be drafted 
and enacted. On 7 June, following the removal of all opposition Members of Parliament, 86 
participating lawmakers from the ruling Cambodian People&#8217;s Party and its coalition 
FUNCINPEC party unanimously approved a Law on the Denial of Crimes Committed 
during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned 
that this important law was voted upon without any public debate.   
</p>
<p>47. Another area of concern is the restriction on freedom of expression. The ruling party 
has a near monopoly on national radio and television in the country. The predominantly 
rural population has little access to independent news other than through programmes 
broadcast by foreign radios. On 28 June, the Ministry of Information released two 
directives aiming to ban foreign radio broadcasting during the election period. One signed 
on 25 June stated that all FM radio stations must suspend relaying and airing all Khmer-
language foreign radio programmes during the 31 days prior to election day, adding that if 
any FM radio station did not respect the directive, the Ministry of Information would take 
legal measures. The second directive dated 21 June ordered a halt to broadcasting and direct 
relay from foreign radio stations about surveys or the results of surveys related to the 
election process during the five days preceding election day and a halt to broadcasting on 
all campaign activities during the final 24 hours before the election and on election day. 
From that very day, the ban immediately silenced Khmer-language radio broadcasts from 
several foreign stations, which media and civil society organizations said are a vital source 
of independent information. On 29 June, the Ministry of Information issued a reversal on 
the first directive but maintained the second. The Special Rapporteur stresses that ensuring 
public access to independent media is essential for levelling the playing field in the 
electoral process and allowing voters to make an informed choice on election day. He 
welcomes the rescindment of the 25 June directive but regrets that the 21 June directive has 
not been revoked. The Special Rapporteur firmly recommends that such initiatives that are 
not provided for in law and contravene freedom of information and expression be 
effectively prohibited in the future. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Follow-up to recommendations on economic and other land 
concessions 
</b></p>
<p>48. Regarding the recommendations in the report on economic and other land 
concessions submitted to the twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council in 2012 
(A/HRC/21/63/Add.1), the Special Rapporteur notes the positive developments resulting 
from the private land titling programme of the Government led by the Prime Minister 
himself. During his visit to Kompong Chhnang Province in December 2012, the Special 
Rapporteur spoke directly with villagers who had received their long-awaited land titles. 
Along with many national and international stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur had long 
been calling for a speedy land titling programme and he is pleased to see it now taking 
place. Nevertheless, further implementation of the existing framework on land rights and 
strengthening of land management institutions are necessary for these gains to be 
sustainable, and a significant number of the recommendations outlined in the above-
mentioned report have not yet been adequately addressed. 
</p>
<p>49. Insecure land tenure, ineffective systems (court and cadastral) to handle claims 
related to land and other obstacles to access to justice, and widespread land disputes 
continue to be a challenge. The continued number of clashes between authorities (civilian 
and military), company representatives involved in agro-industry and infrastructure and 
property development (including private security personnel) and communities affected is a </p>


<p>concern, especially as a number of incidents involved the use of live ammunition and other 
violence. Human rights defenders involved in land rights education and advocacy and 
individuals making land claims continue to be persecuted and freedom of expression and 
assembly has been continually curtailed. 
</p>
<p>50. As with the previous reporting period, activists (mostly women) associated with the 
Boeung Kak Lake and Borei Keila communities continued to be on the front line of regular 
protests, with a number of excluded families&#8217; cases still unresolved by the Municipality of 
Phnom Penh and Shukaku Inc. and the Phan Imex Company, respectively. Representatives 
of the communities threatened by the planned expansion of Phnom Penh International 
Airport have also protested regularly during the reporting period. Phnom Penh continues to 
be a site of regular protests, demonstrations and, regrettably, violence between communities 
and police, including now the use of electrified riot shields and water cannons by 
authorities. In some cases, private security personnel were employed by the Municipality of 
Phnom Penh for use in confrontations and detentions of activists. Two women housing 
activists sentenced to prison terms were believed to be targeted for their activism, namely 
Tim Sakmony of Borei Keila and Yorm Bopha of Boeung Kak Lake. On appeal Ms. 
Sakmony&#8217;s sentence was suspended after three months in prison, while Ms. Bopha remains 
in prison after her appeal.  
</p>
<p>51. Those already evicted and relocated reportedly suffer poor living conditions 
(including low standards of housing and unsafe water and sanitation conditions) and scant 
opportunities for employment, coupled with limited access to health and education services. 
Resettlement sites have continued to be poorly planned and developed before evictions, and 
promises by the companies involved and municipal governments have many times not 
materialized. For example, the Phnom Bath relocation site, housing over 100 families from 
Borei Keila, including those forcibly evicted in January 2012, has developed in part with 
the assistance of donors, but assistance from the Phan Imex Company and the Municipality 
of Phnom Penh has been minimal. 
</p>
<p>52. During the reporting period there was little progress in tackling the root causes of 
land disputes in Phnom Penh and other major cities, and access to justice and remedy 
remain key concerns. For example, a forced eviction in March 2013 in Sihanouk province 
affecting 21 families occurred while an appeal was still pending with the court. The issue 
was ultimately solved following a demonstration by the families in Phnom Penh, and the 
subsequent intervention by the Prime Minister. As highlighted before, obstacles such as 
time-consuming administrative and procedural processes, financial costs associated with 
submitting a complaint, power inequalities and political interference have led to 
inconsistent use of the courts. 
</p>
<p>53. In rural areas, the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the campaign for private 
land titling targeting State land (including economic land and forestry concessions, and 
other land managed by the Ministry of Environment) initiated by the Prime Minister under 
the auspices of the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction in 
June 2012, which has reported aggregate statistics on its website. This campaign followed a 
directive issuing a moratorium on the granting of new ELCs and a review of existing 
concessions on 7 May 2012, but the full progress of the review is unknown. In August 
2012, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Ministry of Land Management outlining a 
number of preliminary concerns with the implementation of this directive, and 
acknowledges the detailed response provided to him by the Ministry in September 2012. 
The Special Rapporteur also notes that despite some new ELCs reported in the <i>Royal 
Gazette</i> from May to December 2012, no new ELCs were reported during the first half of 
2013. 
</p>
<p>54. The granting and management of economic and other land concessions was the 
subject of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s May 2012 mission and thematic report to the twenty-</p>


<p>first session of the Human Rights Council.5 The aim of the report, which followed the 2004 
and 2007 reports of previous mandate holders on this theme, was to improve awareness 
about the lack of compliance with the legal and policy framework governing the granting 
and management of land concessions, information on the use of protected areas (location, 
size, use), and the lack of evidence of economic benefits of land concessions for the 
majority of Cambodians.  
</p><p>55. Since the presentation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2012 report on economic and 
other land concessions, the Ministry of Land Management has made progress in attempting 
to address long-standing land disputes and improve tenure security for families living on 
and around land concessions by devoting human and financial resources to measuring land 
and providing titles. There was little progress, however, on developing an improved system 
for the granting, management, reporting and cataloguing of economic and other land 
concessions with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and other ministries, 
and the issues of access to information and transparency highlighted in the report of the 
Special Rapporteur remain of concern. 
</p>
<p>56. Despite the progress in registering land in rural areas under the Prime Minister&#8217;s 
initiative, there were a number of concerns with this process as well. Foremost of concern is 
the connection reportedly drawn by authorities in a coercive fashion between the provision 
of land titles and the outcome of the elections. In addition, it is not clear, for example, why 
some land is being measured and other areas excluded. This resulted in a number of 
communities making appeals to the Prime Minister directly. For example, communities&#8217; 
land associated with the sugar plantations, which benefit from the European preferential 
trade agreement (Everything But Arms) in Koh Kong, Oddar Meanchey and Kampong 
Speu provinces, have reportedly not yet had their land measured. In addition, NGOs, which 
often fill a gap in explaining rights and procedures to communities, were barred from 
monitoring the process, contributing to confusion in some cases. In addition, there have 
been reports of encroachment by concessionaires of land already in the process of titling, 
for example by the Pheapimex Company in Pursat province and the Kao Su Ea Lev rubber 
company in Ratanakiri province (involving Jarai indigenous peoples). In some cases 
disputes have been violent, such as involving a clash between representatives of the DM 
Group rubber plantation and the military in Ratanakiri province, which resulted in multiple 
injuries to community members. 
</p><p>57. It appears that the Government, at least in the short-term, is only making slow 
progress in implementing the well-developed domestic legal framework which recognizes 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to collective land title. At least in the short-term, it seemed that 
the indigenous land titling programmes were being deprioritized, and resources diverted 
from the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction. There have 
been reports of intimidation, harassment and coercion of indigenous peoples in some cases, 
and in other cases confusion among some indigenous individuals who opted for private land 
title without fully understanding their rights to communal land title. Affected villages 
include those of the Suoy peoples in Kampong Speu province, the Jarai, Tumpoun, Krung 
and Kachak peoples in Ratanakiri province, the Phnong and Stieng peoples in Mondulkiri, 
and the Kuy people in Preah Vihear. 
</p>
<p>58. In another case of concern regarding the construction of a dam by Hydropower 
Lower Sesan 2 Company Ltd. (of the  Royal Group of Cambodia in partnership with 
China&#8217;s Hydrolancang International Energy Co. Ltd. and Viet Nam&#8217;s EVN International 
Joint Stock Company), there are reportedly inadequacies regarding consultation on the

<p>environmental, social and economic impacts of the project, on compensation and on 
resettlement planning. The Special Rapporteur visited these communities in May 2012 and 
investigated their complaints. The National Assembly has approved a guarantee for 
financial backing of the project, and construction is reportedly imminent, but communities 
still lack information on the plans, and have yet to agree to terms of remedy and relocation. 
</p>
<p>59. Finally, during the reporting period there were a number of legislative 
developments. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the draft law on the management 
and use of agricultural land was under revision, and hopes that a more inclusive 
consultation would ensue led by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries with 
the support of the Asian Development Bank. He was encouraged by the consultation 
process for a draft law on environmental impact assessment led by the Ministry of 
Environment with the support of a public interest law firm. He regrets that the draft housing 
policy pending for some years has yet to be finalized and approved by the Council of 
Ministers. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b>60.<b> It has been four years since the present Special Rapporteur took up his 
functions following his appointment by the Human Rights Council in March 2009. 
Over this time, he witnessed the country&#8217;s move forward in a number of areas. 
Cambodia is a forward-looking country which has benefited tremendously from the 
work of civil society organizations supplementing the services delivered to the people 
by the Government, particularly where they fall short. Civil society is increasingly 
vibrant in many areas, including the defence of human rights. As stated in the 
preceding paragraphs, having presented four substantial reports on judicial, 
parliamentary and electoral reform and on the human rights impact of economic and 
other land concessions, each containing a series of recommendations, the Special 
Rapporteur has focused his attention during his last two missions on the follow-up to 
his recommendations. While there have been encouraging developments in some 
areas, as outlined throughout the present report, progress in a number of other areas 
remains unnecessarily slow and developments in some areas disturbing. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> Tolerance is a bedrock of democracy. However, the degree of tolerance on the 
part of the Government and the ability to listen to constructive criticism of its policy 
decisions and shortcomings seems to be decreasing. Democracy is about dialogue and 
that dialogue is missing especially amongst the Government and the opposition 
parties. Political leadership is about forging consensus on issues of national 
importance through dialogue and reconciliation. The Special Rapporteur urged for 
political reconciliation to be achieved before the country went to the polls to elect the 
National Assembly in July 2013. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the 
granting of a royal pardon to the Cambodian opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, on 12 
July 2013, just ahead of the elections due to take place on 28 July 2013. The Special 
Rapporteur hoped that with that development, the Government would take the 
necessary action in order to allow Sam Rainsy to play a full part in the national 
politics of Cambodia and applauded the Government for having taken that important 
step towards reconciliation, which was in the interests of stronger and deeper 
democratization in Cambodia. However, the Special Rapporteur remains of the view 
that the culture of reconciliation and consensus-building on major issues of national 
interest is very weak in Cambodia. The country could benefit a great deal if the 
leadership were to be more open to ideas, in the absence of which the political 
situation will inevitably suffer from stagnation and lost opportunities from stifled 
creativity.  </b></p>


<p>62.<b> Much of the political mindset seems to be trapped in the past. For democracy to 
function properly in Cambodia and for the democratic culture to take root in society, 
those holding public positions must be willing to acknowledge shortcomings, for only 
then can solutions be found that are acceptable to all. This realization does not yet 
seem to be prevalent in contemporary Cambodian society. As the Special Rapporteur 
has stated elsewhere,6 criticism is not a crime but an exercise of freedom of conscience, 
an act of intelligence. These are inherent attributes of democracy. Their absence is one 
of the reasons why Cambodia falls short of the full liberal democracy envisaged in the 
Constitution of the country. It is important for the international community to 
continue assisting Cambodia on the road to democracy. The manner in which the 
Special Rapporteur has sought to implement his United Nations mandate in the 
country is part of that endeavour. He regrets the unhelpful raw remarks made against 
him that degenerated to the personal level in the aftermath of the publication of his 
reports on electoral reform and on land concessions and the orchestrated protests 
against his human rights work in the country during his mission in May 2013. 
However, the Special Rapporteur remains firm in his belief that Cambodia continues 
to require assistance in the form of his mandate, particularly in the light of the many 
expressions of support for his work from the general public that followed the latter 
protests. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> There still seems to be a lack of proper comprehension of the nature of the 
work and mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the country. 
However, the mission to the country in May 2013 was helpful in bringing the dialogue 
between the Special Rapporteur and the Government back on track and the Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Government for the cooperation that he received. He looks 
forward to continuing to work with the Government and all other stakeholders in 
Cambodia for the greater good of the country.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>To conclude, Cambodia has come a long way, but the Special Rapporteur is of 
the view that there is still some way to go in promoting and protecting human rights, 
strengthening good governance, and enhancing the independence and capacity of 
State institutions responsible for upholding people&#8217;s rights. Accordingly, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government of Cambodia to keep moving forward on the 
implementation of his recommendations regarding the judiciary, Parliament, electoral 
reform and economic and other land concessions. He stands ready to assist with 
remaining challenges.

<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The Government should commit to a clear time frame to implement the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations, identifying areas of difficulty wherever relevant.  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Government should accelerate the implementation of its promised reform 
agenda of State institutions responsible for upholding people&#8217;s rights, including 
enacting the three fundamental laws concerning enhancing the independence and 
capacity of the judiciary. 
</b>67<b>. Regardless of the results of the elections to the National Assembly, due to take 
place on 28 July 2013, appropriate measures should be taken to enhance the

should be carried out as a matter of priority and the interests of the people affected by 
such concessions should be at the heart of such review.

transparency on a range of issues, including consultation and oversight, in line with 
the recommendations contained in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on the granting

</b></p>
<p>72.<b> Additional measures should be taken to further implement the access to 
remedy related to land disputes, whether through strengthening formal and dedicated 
national dispute resolution systems, ensuring improved oversight over business 
enterprises which are party to disputes, or through improving the conflict prevention 
and consultation capacity of officials and armed forces in their dealings with affected 
communities. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Government should develop an action plan with a time frame to accelerate 
the process of parliamentary reform.

have not been properly investigated in which no one has been brought to justice. 
</b>75.<b> The Special Rapporteur expresses hope that all the political parties and the 
National Election Committee will have ensured free, fair and peaceful elections on 28 
July 2013, with all sides enabled to play on a level playing field.
