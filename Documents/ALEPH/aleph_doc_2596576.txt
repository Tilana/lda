ENSERVCO Reports Second Quarter Financial Results
●Reduced industry-wide drilling and completion activity and normal seasonal decline
impact revenue and profitability
●Positive cash flow from operations for first six months resulting in solid debt to equity
and working capital ratios
●Continued growth in hot oiling and acidizing business in Eagle Ford Basin
●Construction services revenue up significantly with commencement of $2.6 million dirt
hauling contract
●HydroFLOW® bacteria and scale treatment field trial underway with large E&P customer
for frac water application
DENVER, CO – August 12, 2016 – ENSERVCO Corporation (NYSE MKT: ENSV), a diversified
national provider of well-site services to the domestic onshore conventional and unconventional
oil and gas industries, today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30,
2016.
“Decreased drilling and completion activity continued to negatively impact our revenue and
margins in the second quarter, which is traditionally one of our two slowest quarters due to the
seasonal decline in frac water heating activity during the warmer months,” said Rick Kasch,
chairman and CEO. “However, over the past few months we’ve been encouraged by steadily
rising rig counts, an uptick in completions activity and resumption of deferred maintenance work
with some of our customers – all signs that a recovery may be underway. In the meantime, we
continue to focus on providing superior customer service, reducing our cost structure, re-
deploying assets to more active areas, and capitalizing on new business opportunities to sustain
us during the downturn and position us for accelerated growth when commodity prices recover.
“We continue to build our presence in the Eagle Ford Basin, where a growing number of hot
oiling and acidizing assignments with several E&Ps drove a $728,000, or 270%, year-over-year
revenue increase in the second quarter,” Kasch added. “We’re also encouraged by initial trial
results on our new HydroFLOW® product line, which offers E&Ps an environmentally friendly
means of treating bacteria and scale while reducing the use and cost of chemicals. Having
achieved encouraging results in reducing bacteria in a frac water application, we’re beginning a
new trial to demonstrate cost savings related to reduced biocide usage. We have a number of
other potential customers awaiting results of these trials and are optimistic that our HydroFLOW®
product line should start generating revenue by year-end and grow to become an important
component of our revenue mix over the long term.
“Another highlight in the second quarter was growth in construction services, where
commencement of a $2.6 million dirt hauling contract in late May resulted in an incremental
$590,000 of revenue in the second quarter,” Kasch said. “We expect to book the balance of the
$2.6 million contract in the third and fourth quarters. This project is proving beneficial in helping
us retain key employees during our slower summer months.
“In spite of the industry downturn, ENSERVCO has generated $1.6 million in cash from
operations year to date and continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with solid debt to equity
and working capital ratios. We remain in compliance with terms of our credit facility and at the
end of the second quarter we had approximately $5.6 million in availability under our line. We
continue to believe ENSERVCO is well positioned to weather the downturn and emerge a
stronger company when the recovery occurs.”
Second Quarter Results
Total second quarter revenue was $4.1 million, down 27% from $5.7 million in the same quarter
last year. The decline was primarily attributable to reduced drilling and completion activities due
to lower commodity prices, the earlier than normal suspension of heating activities due to a
continuation of the warm weather from 2015, and management’s decision to de-emphasize low
margin water hauling activity.
The $1.6 million decline in total revenue was primarily comprised of a $1.0 million decline in frac
water heating, a $532,000 decline in water hauling, and a $513,000 decline in hot oiling.
Acidizing revenue increased by $64,000, due in part to the Company’s expansion into the Eagle
Ford Basin where combined revenue for hot oiling and acidizing increased 270%, or $728,000,
year over year. In addition, the Company generated approximately $590,000 in incremental new
revenue from the dirt hauling contract that commenced in late May.
Gross loss in the second quarter was $800,000 versus gross profit of $139,000 in the same
quarter last year. The year over year decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to three
factors: 1) lower revenue in the traditionally high margin well enhancement service lines; 2)
startup costs in the Company’s water management division and lower margins in the new dirt
hauling project; and 3) the impact of fixed costs relative to lower revenue.
General and administrative expenses declined 4%, or $39,000, year over year and costs
associated with patent litigation and defense declined 61%, or $61,000. These improvements
were offset by a 12%, or $178,000, increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to
the Company’s acquisition of water transfer assets in early 2016.
The Company incurred a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, versus a net loss of
$1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.
Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was a negative $1.5 million versus a negative $621,000
in the same quarter last year – a reflection of the significant decline in high margin frac water
heating revenue combined with selective price concessions and startup costs related to new
business initiatives.
Six-Month Results
Total revenue for the first six months of 2016 declined 50% year over year to $12.4 million from
$24.8 million due to the overall decline in drilling and completion activities related to lower
commodity prices, warm weather impact on heating services, and a de-emphasis on lower-
margin water hauling activity. Revenue was also negatively impacted by approximately $1.0
million due to a year over year decline in the price of propane, which is billed to customers at cost
plus.
The $12.4 million decline in total revenue was primarily comprised of a $9.7 million decline in
frac water heating, a $1.1 million decline in water hauling, a $236,000 decline in acidizing and a
$1.6 million decline in hot oiling despite a $1.4 million increase in hot oiling and acidizing
revenue in the Eagle Ford Basin, where the Company continues to expand its well maintenance
service lines.
Gross profit in the first half of 2016 was $737,000 versus $8.0 million in the same period last year.
The year over year decline in gross margin – to 6% from 32% – was primarily attributable to the
decline in high-margin well enhancement services due to lower service activity and warm
weather. Startup costs associated with water management and the dirt-hauling project and the
impact of lower revenue on fixed costs also contributed to the decline in gross margin.
General and administrative expenses declined 11%, or $233,000, year over year and costs
associated with patent litigation and defense declined 83%, or $364,000. These improvements
were offset by a 22%, or $603,000, increase in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense
related to the larger fleet size and the addition of water transfer assets.
The Company incurred a net loss of $3.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, versus net income of
$1.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2016 was a negative $873,000 versus positive adjusted
EBITDA of $6.1 million in the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting lower levels of higher-
margin frac water heating revenue.
ENSERVCO generated $1.6 million in cash from operations in the first half of 2016 compared to
$12.7 million in the same period last year. The Company has a long-term debt to equity ratio of
1.6:1. The Company closed the second quarter with working capital of $2.4 million and a current
ratio of 2.0:1.

*Note on non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include a discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures provided as a complement to the results
provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The term
"EBITDA" refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings (net income or loss) plus or
minus net interest plus taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from
EBITDA stock-based compensation and, when appropriate, other items that management does
not utilize in assessing ENSERVCO’s operating performance (as further described in the
attached financial schedules). None of these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized
terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of
operating performance or any other GAAP measure. We have reconciled Adjusted EBITDA to
GAAP net income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations table at the end of this release.
We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future
earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will
provide consistency in our financial reporting.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains information that is "forward-looking" in that it describes events and
conditions ENSERVCO reasonably expects to occur in the future. Expectations for the future
performance of ENSERVCO are dependent upon a number of factors, and there can be no
assurance that ENSERVCO will achieve the results as contemplated herein. Certain statements
contained in this release using the terms "may," "expects to," and other terms denoting future
possibilities, are forward-looking statements. The accuracy of these statements cannot be
guaranteed as they are subject to a variety of risks, which are beyond ENSERVCO's ability to
predict, or control and which may cause actual results to differ materially from the projections or
estimates contained herein. Among these risks are those set forth in ENSERVCO’s annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and subsequently filed documents.
Forward looking statements in this news release that are subject to risk include expectations for,
and sustainability of, an industry recovery; prospects that new business opportunities will sustain
the Company during the downturn and position the Company for accelerated growth; prospects
for continued revenue growth in the Eagle Ford Basin; expectations that HydroFLOW® will be
effective, contribute to revenue by year end and become an important component of revenue mix;
expectations of booking the balance of the dirt hauling contract by year end; and the Company’s
ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, remain in compliance with loan covenants, weather
the industry downturn and emerge as a stronger company when the industry recovers. It is
important that each person reviewing this release understand the significant risks attendant to the
operations of ENSERVCO. ENSERVCO disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement made herein.

* Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Non-GAAP results are presented only as a
supplement to the financial statements and for use within management’s discussion and
analysis based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP
  
financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of the Company’s
financial performance, but no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the
most directly comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided herein.
EBITDA is defined as net income (earnings), before interest expense, income taxes, and
EBITDA is defined as net income (earnings), before interest expense, income taxes, and
depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation from
EBITDA and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing the
Company’s ongoing operating performance as set forth in the next paragraph. None of these
non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an
alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or any other GAAP measure.
All of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to EBITDA and from EBITDA to
Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased
intangibles, stock-based compensation, warrants issued, etc.) or (ii) items that management
does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company’s ongoing operating performance
(e.g., income taxes, gain on sale of investments, loss on disposal of assets, patent litigation and
defense costs, etc.). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can
better assess the company’s operating performance if the measures are presented without such
items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect the Company’s ability to
generate free cash flow or invest in its business.
We use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with
an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the
impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We
believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in
evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure
a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and
depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company
depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method
by which assets were acquired. Additionally, our leverage and fixed charge ratio covenants
associated with our 2014 Credit Agreement require the use of Adjusted EBITDA in specific
calculations.
Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company’s presentation of non-
GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the Company’s
performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide
users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures.
