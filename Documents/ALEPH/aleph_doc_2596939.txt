APPENDIX 4E (RULE 4.3A)
PRELIMINARY FINAL REPORT
*Definition of Cash / Non Cash 
The Group’s Cash EBITDA/NPAT is stated after eliminating the following from total Group EBITDA/NPAT:
  Fair value gain of biological assets; 
  Revenue from recognition of deferred lease and management fees;  
  Change in the fair value of land and buildings; 
  Accounting treatment relating to the business combination transactions; and 
  Unrealised foreign exchange gain / (loss).
Entities acquired during the period 
On 31 July 2015, T.F.S. Corporation Ltd acquired Santalis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Santalis”) and ViroXis Corporation (“ViroXis”).  
Santalis  manufactures  and  markets  botanical  pharmaceuticals  using  Indian  Sandalwood  oil,  whilst  ViroXis  is  a  bio-
pharmaceutical  company  focused  on  developing  and  commercialising  innovative,  proprietary,  botanical  pharmaceuticals 
derived from Indian Sandalwood oil. The strategic rationale behind the acquisition was to:
  Extend the Group’s vertically integrated business and bring within the Group the formulation and development of
products which is likely to maximise the demand for the Group’s Indian Sandalwood oil;
  Provide the Group with increased access to the significant potential returns from royalty and licensing fees from
dermatology products; and
  Provide a direct contractual and operational relationship with leading global pharmaceutical companies.
The business combinations contributed revenues of $0.140m from ViroXis and $0.537m from Santalis and net loss before 
tax of $3.299m from ViroXis and $3.412m from Santalis for the year ended 30 June 2016 from their date of acquisition.  It is 
expected that the Group would have reported $268.86m in consolidated revenues and $82.385m consolidated net  profit 
after  tax  attributable  to  members  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  had  the  business  combination  occurred  at  the 
beginning of the reporting period.
