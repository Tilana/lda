practicable following the Closing and in any event within 60 days after the Closing, a
Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous shelf basis following the date

               (b) The Registration Statement shall not be deemed to have become effective under the

Act by the Commission and remains effective pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Securities on a continuous shelf basis until all such Registrable
Securities are sold or cease to be Registrable Securities, or (ii) if the offering of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, cease
trade order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or any other
governmental agency, court or stock exchange.
          1.3 Expenses of Registration. The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses whether
or not such registration shall become effective.
          1.4 Registration Procedures. In the case of the registration effected by the Company
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will keep each Holder advised in writing as to the
initiation of such registration and as to the completion thereof. At its expense, the Company will
use its best efforts to:
               (a) Keep such registration effective until all such Registrable Securities are sold or
cease to be Registrable Securities;
               (b) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement
as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;
               (c) Furnish such number of prospectuses and other documents incident thereto,
including any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus, as a Holder from time to time may
reasonably request;
               (d) Notify each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such
registration statement, as then in effect, (i) no longer meets the requirements of Section 10(a)(3)
of the Securities Act, or (ii) includes an untrue
3
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or incomplete in the light of the
circumstances then existing, and that offers and sales of Registrable Securities in reliance on the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement must cease. At the request of any such seller,
the Corporation shall prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such shares, such prospectus used shall meet the requirements of
Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, or not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading or incomplete in the light of the circumstances then existing;
               (e) Cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder to be listed on
each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;
               (f) Use its best efforts to obtain all other approvals, consents, exemptions, or
authorizations from such governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable
the Holders to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities;
               (g) Provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered
pursuant to the Registration Statement and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities,
in each case not later than the effective date of such registration;
               (h) Otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of
the Commission, and make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable,
an earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months,
beginning with the first month after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which
earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act;
               (i) Subject to compliance with the requirements of the Securities Act, cooperate with the
Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates not bearing any restrictive
legends representing the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement, and
cause such Registrable Securities to be issued in such denominations and registered in such
names in accordance with instructions of the Holders that are provided to the Company;
               (j) In connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to a registration statement filed
pursuant to Section 1 hereof, the Company will enter into an underwriting agreement with an
underwriter selected and retained by the selling securityholders, and reasonably acceptable to
the Company in its discretion, in form reasonably necessary to effect the offer and sale of
common shares, provided such underwriting agreement contains reasonable and customary
provisions; and
4
(k) Furnish, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters
for sale, if such securities are being sold through underwriters or, if such securities are not being
sold through underwriters, on the date that the Registration Statement becomes effective, (i) an
opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in a underwritten
public offering and (ii) a letter, dated as of such date, from the independent certified public
accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by the Company’s
independent registered public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering,
addressed to the underwriters, if any, and if permitted by applicable accounting standards, to the
Holders participating in such registration.
          1.5 Indemnification.
               (a) The Company will indemnify each Holder, each of its officers, directors and partners,
legal counsel, and accountants and each person controlling such Holder within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act, with respect to which registration, qualification, or compliance
has been effected pursuant to this Agreement, and each underwriter, if any, and each person
who controls within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act any underwriter, against all
expenses, claims, losses, damages, and liabilities (or actions, proceedings, or settlements in
respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any prospectus or other document (including any related registration
statement, notification, or the like) incident to any such registration, qualification, or compliance,
or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by the
Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to the Company
and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any such
registration, qualification, or compliance, and will reimburse each such Holder, each of its
officers, directors, partners, legal counsel, and accountants and each person controlling such
Holder, each such underwriter, and each person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal
and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and defending or
settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or action, provided that the Company will not be
liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or expense
arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission based upon written information
furnished to the Company by such Holder or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use
therein. It is agreed that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 1.5 shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement
is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld).
               (b) Each Holder will, if Registrable Securities held by such Holder are included in the
securities as to which such registration, qualification, or compliance is being effected, indemnify
the Company, each of its directors, officers, partners, legal counsel, and accountants and each
underwriter, if any, of the Company’s securities covered by such a registration statement, each
person who controls the
5
Company or such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, each other
such Holder, and each of their officers, directors, and partners, and each person controlling such
Holder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising
out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained
in any such registration statement, prospectus, or other document, or any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and such Holders, directors,
officers, partners, legal counsel, and accountants, persons, underwriters, or control persons for
any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or action, in each case to the extent, but only to
the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged
omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus or other document in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Holder and stated to
be specifically for use therein provided, however, that the obligations of such Holder hereunder
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claims, losses, damages, or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) if such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided that in no event shall any
indemnity under this Section 1.5 exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such
Holder.
               (c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 1.5 (the “Indemnified Party”)
shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the “Indemnifying Party”)
promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity
may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such claim or
any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall
conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at such party’s expense, and provided further that the
failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 1.5, to the extent such failure is not
prejudicial. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except
with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in
question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably
required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.
               (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 1.5 is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim,
damage, or expense referred to therein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party as a result of such
6
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other
in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage,
or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party
and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission.
               (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification
and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the
underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the
underwriting agreement shall control.
          1.6 Information by Holder. Each Holder shall furnish to the Company such information
regarding such Holder and the distribution proposed by such Holder as the Company may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with any
registration, qualification, or compliance referred to in this Agreement.
          1.7 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and
regulations of the Commission that may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public
without registration, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to:
               (a) File with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at any time it is subject
to such reporting requirements;
               (b) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to the Holder forthwith
upon written request a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting
requirements of Rule 144, and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most
recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed
as a Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission
allowing a Holder to sell any such securities without registration.
          1.8 Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights. The registration rights granted to a
Holder by the Company under this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by a Holder
provided that the Company is given written notice at the time of or within a reasonable time after
said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of the transferee or assignee and
identifying the Registrable Securities being transferred or assigned. Such transferees (other than
transferees that acquire the Registrable Securities
7
in a registered public offering or pursuant to a sale under Rule 144) shall automatically be
entitled to receive the benefits of and be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by the
terms and provisions of this Agreement as if it were a party hereto, and shall be deemed to be
Holders under this Agreement.
          1.9 Delay of Registration. No Holder shall have any right to take any action to restrain,
enjoin, or otherwise delay any registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with
respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Section 1.
2. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.
     The Company hereby covenants and agrees, so long as any Holder owns any Registrable
Securities, as follows:
          2.1 Maintain Listing. The Company covenants that, once it has registered the Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the listing of
such securities on each stock exchange or quotation system on which such securities are listed
or quoted.
3. MISCELLANEOUS.
          3.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the
State of New York.
          3.2 Third Party Beneficiaries Each Holder other than the Agent shall be a beneficiary of
this Agreement and entitled to all of the rights and benefits of this Agreement as if such Holder
was a party and signatory to this Agreement and shall, for all purposes, be deemed a Holder
under this Agreement. If the Company shall so request, each Holder other than the Agent shall
agree in writing to be subject to all of the terms hereof.
          3.3 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the

regard to the subjects hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended,
waived, discharged or terminated, except by a written instrument signed by the Company and the
holders of at least 50% of the Registrable Securities and any such amendment, waiver,
discharge or termination shall be binding on all the Holders, but in no event shall the obligation of
any Holder hereunder be materially increased, except upon the written consent of such Holder.

furnished to each Holder in writing. All such notices and other written communications shall be
effective on the date of mailing, confirmed facsimile transfer or delivery.
          3.6 Delays or Omissions. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy
accruing to any Holder, upon any breach or default of the Company under this Agreement shall
impair any such right, power or remedy of such Holder nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of
any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default
thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of
any other breach or default therefore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or
approval of any kind or character on the part of any Holder of any breach or default under this
Agreement or any waiver on the part of any Holder of any provisions or conditions of this
Agreement must be made in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth

provision of the Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

contents of such information, and its attorneys), except in connection with the exercise of rights
under this Agreement, unless the Company has made such information available to the public
generally or such Holder is required to disclose such information by a governmental body.

are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting
