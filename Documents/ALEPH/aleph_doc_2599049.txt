information circular of GTO, Polaris and Western dated September 18, 2009 (the “Information Circular”).
On  September  8,  2009,  GTO,  Polaris,  Western  and  Ram  Power,  Inc.  (“Ram”)  entered  into  an  arrangement 
agreement  (the  “Arrangement  Agreement”)  pursuant  to  which  GTO  agreed  to  acquire  all  of  the  issued  and

will be wholly owned subsidiaries of GTO. Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, GTO will acquire the 
securities of Polaris and Western on the following basis:

(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)

the issued and outstanding GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares shall be consolidated on a 10:1 ratio so

All holders of share purchase warrants of Polaris and Western not otherwise subject to the Arrangement, will receive 
GTO Shares in accordance with the adjustment provisions of such warrants upon the due exercise by the holders 
thereof.
In connection with the Arrangement, GTO has agreed to acquire issued and outstanding shares of Ram pursuant to a 
purchase  and  sale  agreement  dated  September  8,  2009  among  GTO,  Ram  and  certain  shareholders  of  Ram  (the 
“Ram Acquisition”). Upon completion of the Ram Acquisition, Ram will be a subsidiary of GTO. Completion of 
the  Ram  Acquisition  is  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  completion  of  the 
Arrangement.
In connection with the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, GTO will change is name to “Ram Power, Corp.” 
(“New GTO”).  If  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are  completed  as  contemplated,  New  GTO  will  be 
engaged  in  the  business  of  acquiring,  exploring,  developing  and  operating  geothermal  properties  through  its 
subsidiaries and will have an interest in geothermal projects in British Columbia, California, Nevada and Nicaragua.
The special resolution to approve the Arrangement must be approved by not less than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by the 
GTO Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the GTO Meeting. Completion of the Arrangement is subject to 
various conditions, including the receipt of all regulatory, securityholder and court approvals. If the Arrangement is 
approved by the GTO Shareholders and all other conditions to the implementation of the Arrangement are satisfied 
or waived, it is anticipated that the Arrangement will become effective on or about October 19, 2009.
Cormark Securities Inc. has provided the board of directors of GTO (the “GTO Board”) with an opinion (the 
“GTO  Fairness  Opinion”)  that  as  of  September  4,  2009,  the  consideration  to  be  received  by  the  GTO 
Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the GTO Shareholders.  
The GTO Board, based upon its own investigations, including its consideration of the GTO Fairness Opinion, 
has unanimously determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of the GTO Shareholders and has 
unanimously resolved to recommend that the GTO Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement.
The accompanying Information Circular provides detailed information regarding GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram 
and a detailed description of the matters to be considered at the GTO Meeting, including the Arrangement. Please 
give this material your careful consideration and, if you require assistance, consult your financial, legal, tax or other 
professional advisor.

thereof.
In connection with the Arrangement, GTO has agreed to acquire issued and outstanding shares of Ram pursuant to a

The special resolution to approve the Arrangement must be approved by: (i) not less than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by

person or by proxy at the Polaris Meeting, after excluding the votes of “interested parties” (as defined in Multilateral 
Instrument  61-101).  Completion  of  the Arrangement  is  subject  to  various  conditions,  including  the  receipt  of  all 
regulatory, securityholder and court approvals. If the Arrangement is approved by the Polaris Securityholders and all 
other  conditions  to  the  implementation  of  the  Arrangement  are  satisfied  or  waived,  it  is  anticipated  that  the 
Arrangement will become effective on or about October 19, 2009.
Canaccord Capital Corporation has provided the board of directors of Polaris (the “Polaris Board”) with an 
opinion (the “Polaris Fairness Opinion”) that as of September 1, 2009, the consideration to be received by the 
Polaris  Shareholders,  Polaris  Preferred  Shareholders  and  Polaris  Warrantholders  pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement  is  fair,  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  to  the  Polaris  Shareholders,  Polaris  Preferred 
Shareholders and Polaris Warrantholders.  The Polaris Board, based upon its own investigations, including 
its consideration of the Polaris Fairness Opinion, has unanimously determined that the Arrangement is in the 
best  interests  of  the  Polaris  Securityholders  and  has  unanimously  resolved  to  recommend  that  the  Polaris 
Securityholders vote in favour of the Arrangement.
Polaris’ future operations and ability to continue as a going concern may be dependent upon its ability to 
complete the Arrangement. The Polaris Debentures mature on October 11, 2009, at which time the entire 
principal sum of $27,000,000 plus accrued interest owing thereunder is repayable in full.  Polaris does not 
currently have sufficient funds to repay the Polaris Debentures or advance construction of the San Jacinto-
Tizate geothermal project within the timeframe prescribed by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Energy and Mines.  
See “Appendix L – Information Concerning Polaris – Risk Factors” for further details.
The accompanying Information Circular provides detailed information regarding GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram

give this material your careful consideration and, if you require assistance, consult your financial, legal, tax or other 
professional advisor.

the  Ram  Acquisition  is  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  completion  of  the 
Arrangement.
In connection with the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, GTO will change is name to “Ram Power, Corp.” 
(“New GTO”).  If  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are  completed  as  contemplated,  New  GTO  will  be 
engaged  in  the  business  of  acquiring,  exploring,  developing  and  operating  geothermal  properties  through  its 
subsidiaries and will have an interest in geothermal projects in British Columbia, California, Nevada and Nicaragua.
The special resolution to approve the Arrangement must be approved by: (i) not less than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by 
the Western Shareholders and Western Optionholders voting together as a single class; (ii) not less than 66(cid:1152)% of 
the  votes  cast  by  the  Western  Shareholders;  and  (iii)  not  less  than  66(cid:1152)%  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  Western 
Warrantholders. In addition, the Arrangement must also be approved by a simple majority of the votes cast by the 
Western Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the Western Meeting, after excluding the votes of “interested 
parties”  (as  defined  in  Multilateral  Instrument  61-101).  Completion  of  the  Arrangement  is  subject  to  various 
conditions,  including  the  receipt  of  all  regulatory,  securityholder  and  court  approvals.  If  the  Arrangement  is 
approved by  the Western Securityholders  and  all  other  conditions  to  the  implementation of  the Arrangement  are 
satisfied or waived, it is anticipated that the Arrangement will become effective on or about October 19, 2009.
Primary Capital Inc. has provided the board of directors of Western (the “Western Board”) with an opinion 
(the  “Western  Fairness  Opinion”)  that  as  of  September  8,  2009,  the  consideration  to  be  received  by  the 
Western Securityholders pursuant to the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Western 
Securityholders other than GTO and the associates and affiliates thereof. The Western Board, based upon its 
own investigations, including its consideration of the Western Fairness Opinion, has unanimously determined

recommend that the Western Securityholders vote in favour of the Arrangement.

available to each of GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram. Details of the Arrangement are set forth below under “The 
Arrangement”.
Information for United States Securityholders
The offer and sale of the GTO Securities issuable in exchange for Securities pursuant to the Arrangement have not 
been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act, and such securities will be issued in reliance upon the exemption 
from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof.  The solicitation of proxies 
for the Meetings is not subject to the requirements of Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act.  Accordingly, this Information 
Circular has been prepared solely in accordance with disclosure requirements in Canada, and the solicitations and 
transactions  contemplated  in  this  Information  Circular  are  made  in  the  United  States  for  securities  of  Canadian 
issuers in accordance with Canadian corporate and securities laws.  Securityholders in the United States should be 
aware that such requirements are different from those of the United States applicable to registration statements under
15
the 1933 Act and proxy statements under the 1934 Act.  None of the Securities are, and none of the GTO Securities 
issuable pursuant to the Arrangement will be, listed for trading on any United States stock exchange.
All financial statements and other financial information included or incorporated by reference in this Information 
Circular  have  been  prepared  in  Canadian  dollars  (excluding  the  financial  statements  of  Ram  which  have  been 
prepared in U.S. dollars) and in accordance with Canadian GAAP, and are subject to Canadian auditing and auditor 
independence standards, which differ from United States generally accepted accounting principles and United States 
auditing and auditor independence standards in certain material respects.  Consequently, such financial statements 
and other financial information are not comparable in all respects to financial statements prepared in accordance 
with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  that  are  subject  to  United  States  auditing  and 
auditor  independence  standards.    Likewise,  pro  forma  information  concerning  the  assets  and  operations  of  New 
GTO  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Canadian  standards  and  is  not  comparable  in  all  respects  to  similar 
information for United States companies.
The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the United States securities laws may be affected adversely by 
the fact that GTO, Western and Polaris are, and New GTO will be, incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction 
outside of the United States, that some or all of their officers and directors are, or will be, residents of countries 
other than the United States, that the experts named in this Information Circular are residents of countries other than 
the United States, and that all or a substantial portion of the assets of GTO, Polaris, Western, New GTO and such 
persons are, or will be, located outside the United States.
The  GTO  Securities  issuable  in  exchange  for  Securities  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  will  be  freely  transferable 
under U.S. federal securities laws, except by persons who are “affiliates” of New GTO after the Arrangement or 
were affiliates of GTO within 90 days prior to the completion of the Arrangement.  However, the GTO Options 
issuable  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  may  be  exercised  only  pursuant  to  an  exemption  or  exclusion  from  the 
registration requirements of the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws.  See “The Arrangement – Securities 
Law Considerations – U.S. Securities Laws”.
Securityholders should be aware that the Arrangement and the ownership of GTO Securities may have material tax 
consequences in the United States.  See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”.
THE  GTO  SECURITIES  ISSUABLE  IN  EXCHANGE  FOR  SECURITIES  PURSUANT  TO  THE 
ARRANGEMENT  HAVE  NOT  BEEN  APPROVED  OR  DISAPPROVED  BY  THE  UNITED  STATES 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY 
OF  ANY  STATE  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES,  NOR  HAS  THE  UNITED  STATES  SECURITIES  AND 
EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY SUCH STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY PASSED ON THE 
ADEQUACY  OR  ACCURACY  OF  THIS  INFORMATION  CIRCULAR.  ANY  REPRESENTATION  TO 
THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE.

17
statements or disclosures.  The foregoing statements expressly qualify any forward-looking information contained

the  TSXV’s  ongoing  listing  standards.    Management  of  GTO  has  an  ongoing  mandate  to  identify  and  evaluate 
potential business mergers and acquisitions in an effort to increase shareholder value.
In May 2009, management of GTO began working with Cormark to actively identify and pursue viable geothermal 
business opportunities.  Through this relationship, Cormark introduced Ram to GTO.  As previously disclosed, Ram
34
is a private company that, at the time, was reviewing various alternatives to raising capital to finance opportunities 
in the geothermal industry in North America.
During the months of May and June, management of GTO and Ram discussed the various alternatives available to 
them,  and,  with  the  support  of  Cormark,  also  reviewed  the  opportunities  to  approach  other  companies  currently 
carrying on business in the geothermal sector. Cormark was aware of other Canadian geothermal companies seeking 
additional capital and began a process of identifying and evaluating companies to approach.  Two such companies 
were Polaris and Western.
Management of Ram and GTO approached the boards of the companies identified by Cormark to determine interest 
and the viability of a business combination.  At the same time, management of Ram and GTO continued to negotiate 
the terms of a formal relationship between them.
On  June  30,  2009,  the  GTO  Board  held  a  meeting  to  consider  and  discuss  a  number  of  factors  in  determining 
optimal strategic alternatives available to GTO, including the opportunities of a formal relationship between Ram 
and GTO.  The GTO Board authorized management to sign a non-binding letter of intent to continue to investigate a 
formal relationship with Ram and to pursue a business combination with a number of other synergistic companies.
On  June  30,  2009,  Ram  and  GTO  entered  into  the  Ram  Letter  of  Intent  outlining  the  general  terms  of  the  Ram 
Acquisition  and  their  joint  pursuit  of  a  business  combination  with  other  companies  carrying  on  business  in  the 
geothermal industry.
On June 30, 2009, GTO entered into an engagement letter with Cormark to formally engage Cormark as its financial 
advisor and lead financing agent to provide financial advisory services including the identification and evaluation of 
potential  corporate  opportunities.    GTO  also  requested  Cormark  to  complete  the  work  necessary  to  provide  a 
fairness opinion with regard to the Business Combination, which was subsequently delivered to the GTO Board for 
their consideration.
From June 30, 2009 to July 14, 2009, management of GTO and Ram continued to work with the boards of Polaris 
and Western and another geothermal company with the goal of entering into a letter of intent to complete a business 
combination and complete a significant financing.
On July 13, 2009, the Western Board appointed the Western Special Committee to consider the Arrangement and 
make a recommendation to the Western Board with regards to the Arrangement.
On  July  14,  2009,  the  Polaris  Board  appointed  the  Polaris  Special  Committee  to  consider  the  Arrangement,  to 
conduct due diligence investigations of the remaining Parties and to make a recommendation to the Polaris Board 
with regards to the Arrangement.
On  July  14,  2009,  the  GTO  Board  held  a  meeting  to  consider  and  evaluate  the  proposed  business  combination 
between  GTO,  Ram,  Polaris  and  Western,  including  the  aspects  of  a  significant  financing  to  be  completed 
conditional upon the completion of the Business Combination.  The GTO Board authorized management to sign a 
non-binding letter of intent to continue to investigate the proposed Business Combination.
On July 14, 2009, the Western Special Committee met to consider and evaluate the Letter of Intent outlining the 
general  terms  of  the  proposed  Business  Combination.    The  Western  Special  Committee  recommended  to  the 
Western Board that Western enter into the Letter of Intent and later that same day, the Western Board authorized 
Western to enter into the Letter of Intent.
On  July  14,  2009,  the  Polaris  Special  Committee  met  to  consider  and  evaluate  the  Letter  of  Intent  outlining  the 
general terms of the proposed Business Combination.  The Polaris Special Committee recommended to the Polaris 
Board that Polaris enter into the Letter of Intent and later that same day, the Polaris Board authorized Polaris to enter 
into the Letter of Intent.
35
On July 14, 2009 management of GTO, Ram, Polaris and Western were successful in their negotiations and entered 
into the Letter of Intent, including the requirement for a significant financing.
Between  July  15,  2009  and  September  8,  2009,  GTO,  Ram,  Polaris  and  Western  negotiated  the  terms  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement, including whether any fees would be payable by the parties in the event the transaction did 
not proceed for certain reasons.  During this time period, the parties also conducted a comprehensive due diligence 
process of each others’ business and operations.  During that time, GTO and Ram also continued to negotiate the 
terms of the Ram Acquisition.
On July 22, 2009, the Western Special Committee met and engaged Davis & Company LLP as independent legal 
counsel to the Western Special Committee.
From  July  22,  2009  to  August  11,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  and  Western  Board  met  on  multiple 
occasions  to  discuss  the  progress  regarding  the  Arrangement  and  negotiations  regarding  the  Arrangement 
Agreement.
On  August  11,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  met  and  approved  the  engagement  of  Primary  Capital  as 
financial advisor to Western with respect to the Arrangement.
Between  August  11,  2009  and  September  1,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  and  Western  Board  met  on 
multiple occasions to receive updates regarding the Arrangement and the status of the Arrangement Agreement.
On August 20, 2009, GTO closed the Financing.
On  September  1,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  met  to  receive  an  update  from  Primary  Capital  and  to 
receive  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion.    Following  the  presentation  by  Primary  Capital,  the  Western  Special 
Committee  reviewed  and  considered  the  terms  of  the  proposed  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase 
Agreement  in  light  of  current  opportunities  available  to  Western  and  an  analysis  of  the  advantages  and 
disadvantages presented by the Business Combination.
On September 3, 2009, the Western Special Committee held a meeting to further consider the terms of the proposed 
Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  and  after  careful  consideration  of  the  alternatives 
available  to  Western,  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion,  the  advice  of  legal  counsel  and  other  relevant  matters,  the 
Western Special Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that the Western Board approve the Arrangement 
Agreement  and  the  Arrangement.    Later  that  same  day,  the  Western  Board  met  and  unanimously  approved  the 
recommendations made by the Western Special Committee.
On September 4, 2009, the GTO Board held a meeting to further consider the terms of the proposed Arrangement 
Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  and  to  review  and  approve  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram 
Acquisition.  The GTO Board specifically reviewed the opportunities currently available to GTO and the advantages 
presented by the Business Combination.  Accordingly, the GTO Board voted unanimously to recommend that the 
GTO Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement and approved, among other things, the entering into of the 
Arrangement Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement.
Legal advisors for GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram attended several conference calls to negotiate the terms of the 
Arrangement  Agreement,  Share  Purchase  Agreement  and  related  documentation  and  on  September  8,  2009,  the 
Arrangement Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement were signed.
Benefits of and Reasons for the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition
The board of directors of each of GTO, Polaris and Western believe that the Arrangement provides the following 
benefits for the Securityholders:
36
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
the Arrangement, once completed, will create a significantly stronger geothermal company than 
any  of  Polaris,  Western  or  Ram  alone,  spanning  all  development  stages  from  exploration  to 
production;
the increased size of New GTO is expected to create synergies in development and operations and 
contribute to lower average expenses and cost of capital;
New GTO will have a greater market value and the GTO Shares are expected to trade on the TSX, 
which is expected to improve liquidity for certain shareholders, as well as the ability to attract new 
capital;
upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition,  New  GTO  will  have  a  strong 
balance  sheet  as  a  result  of  the  Financing  with  approximately  $162,000,000  cash  and  cash 
equivalents as indicated on the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as at June 30, 2009;
subject to the provisions of the Tax Act, the exchange of Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares, 
Western Shares, Polaris Warrants and Western Warrants under the Arrangement should generally 
occur on a tax-deferred basis;
current GTO Shareholders and Polaris Securityholders and Western Securityholders who receive 
GTO Securities under the Arrangement will have continued participation in the upside of GTO 
through a stake in New GTO;
New  GTO  will  have  a  highly  experienced  management  team  with  complementary  skills  in 
exploration, business, project development and operations;
in connection with the Arrangement, the Polaris Debentures, which are currently due to mature on 
October 11, 2009, will be restructured and the Polaris Debentureholders will receive GTO Shares, 
reducing the long-term debt in New GTO; and
New GTO will have sufficient funds to advance construction of the San Jacinto Tizate geothermal 
project within the time frame prescribed by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Energy and Mines.
The Arrangement
The purpose of the Arrangement is to effect an exchange of all of the Polaris Securities and the Western Securities 
for GTO Securities on the basis provided for in the Plan of Arrangement, such that each of Polaris and Western will

the  Western  Shareholders  and  Western  Optionholders,  either  in  person  or  by  proxy, 
voting together as a single class;
the Western Shareholders, either in person or by proxy; and
the Western Warrantholders, either in person or by proxy.
42
In  addition,  the  Arrangement  must  also  be  approved  by:  (i)  a  simple  majority  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  Polaris  
Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the Polaris Meeting, after excluding the votes of “interested parties” 
(as defined in MI 61-101); and (ii) a simple majority of the votes cast by the Western Shareholders present in person 
or by proxy at the Western Meeting, after excluding the votes of “interested parties” (as defined in MI 61-101). See 
“The Arrangement – Procedure for the Arrangement to Become Effective – Securityholder Approvals” and “The 
Arrangement – Securities Law Considerations – Canadian Securities Laws – MI 61-101”.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Arrangement  Resolutions  authorize  the  board  of  directors  of  the  respective 
Corporations, without further notice to or approval of their respective securityholders and subject to the terms of the 
Arrangement Agreement, to amend the Plan of Arrangement or to decide not to proceed with the Arrangement at 
any time prior to the Effective Date. See Appendices A, C and D to this Information Circular for the full text of the 
Arrangement Resolutions.
Court Approval
The Arrangement requires approval by the Court under the provisions of Division 5 of Part 9 of the BCBCA. On 
September  17,  2009,  GTO,  Polaris  and  Western  obtained  the  Interim  Order,  which  provides  for  the  calling  and 
holding of the Meetings and other procedural matters.  A copy of the Interim Order is attached as Appendix F to this 
Information Circular.
Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  approval  of  the  Arrangement  Resolutions  at  the 
Meetings, the hearing in respect of the Final Order is currently scheduled to take place on October 19, 2009 at 9:45 
a.m. (Vancouver time) at the Law Courts, 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia. Any Securityholder or 
other interested party who wishes to participate or to be represented or to present evidence or argument may do so, 
subject to filing with the Court a notice of their intention in accordance with the British Columbia Rules of Civil 
Procedure, serving such notice setting out the basis for opposition and a copy of the materials to be used to oppose 
the application upon the solicitors of GTO, Polaris and Western and upon all other parties who have filed a notice of 
appearance before 4:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on October 15, 2009. A copy of the petition for the Final Order is 
attached as Appendix G to this Information Circular.
Each of GTO, Polaris and Western have been advised by their respective counsel that the Court has broad discretion 
under  the  BCBCA  when  making  orders  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement  and  that  the  Court,  in  hearing  the 
application  for  the  Final  Order,  will  consider,  among  other  things,  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement  to  the 
Securityholders  and  any  other  interested party  as  the  Court determines  appropriate.   The  Court  may  approve  the 
Arrangement either as proposed or as amended in any manner the Court may direct, subject to compliance with such 
terms and conditions, if any, as the Court may determine appropriate.
The offer and sale of the GTO Securities issuable in exchange for Securities pursuant to the Arrangement have not 
been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act, and such securities will be issued in reliance upon the exemption 
from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof.  The Final Order is required 
for  the  Arrangement  to  become  effective  and  the  Court has been  advised  that  if  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
Arrangement are approved by the Court pursuant to the Final Order, the GTO Securities issuable in exchange for 
Securities pursuant to the Arrangement will not require registration under the 1933 Act, pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) 
thereof.
See “The  Arrangement  –  Procedure  for  the  Arrangement  to  Become  Effective  –  Court  Approval”  and “The 
Arrangement – Securities Law Considerations – U.S. Securities Laws”.
Regulatory Approvals
It  is  a  condition  to  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  that  all  necessary  regulatory  approvals  shall  have  been 
completed or obtained. There are no material filings, consents or approvals required to be made with, applicable to, 
or  required  to  be  received  from  any  Governmental  Authority  or  other  regulatory  body  in  connection  with  the 
Arrangement,  other  than  the  Final  Order.    See  “The  Arrangement  –  Procedure  for  the  Arrangement  to  Become 
Effective – Regulatory Approvals”.
43
Timing
Subject to all conditions precedent to the Arrangement as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement being satisfied or 
waived by the appropriate Party, the Arrangement will become effective upon the filing with the BC Registrar of a 
copy of the Final Order and the Arrangement Filings.  If the Arrangement Resolutions are approved at the Meetings 
as required by the Interim Order, GTO, Polaris and Western will apply to the Court for the Final Order approving 
the  Arrangement.    If  the  Final  Order  is obtained on October 19,  2009,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  the 
Parties and all other conditions specified in the Arrangement Agreement are satisfied or waived, the Parties expect 
the  Effective  Date  will  be  on  or  about  October  19,  2009.    The  Effective  Date  could  be  delayed,  however,  for  a 
number of reasons, including an objection before the Court in the hearing of the application for the Final Order. It is 
a condition to the completion of the Arrangement that the Arrangement shall have become effective on or prior to 
the Outside Date, being November 4, 2009.  See “The Arrangement – Timing”.
Stock Exchange Listings
The  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares  are  listed  and  posted  for  trading  on  NEX  under  the  symbol  “GTR.H”,  the 
Polaris Shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSX under the symbol “GEO” and the Western Shares are 
listed and posted for trading on the TSXV under the symbol “WGP”.
It is a condition to the completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition that the TSX shall have approved 
the listing of all of the GTO Shares issuable pursuant to the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition.  An application 
has been made to list the new GTO Shares on the TSX upon completion of the Arrangement. Such listing will be 
conditional upon New GTO fulfilling all the requirements of the TSX.
See “The Arrangement – Stock Exchange Listings”.
Procedure for Exchange of Securities
A Letter of Transmittal has been sent to the Depositing Securityholders with this Information Circular. The Letter of 
Transmittal  sets  out  the  procedure  to  be  followed  by  Depositing  Securityholders  to  deposit  their  Deposited 
Securities. If the Arrangement becomes effective, in order to receive the GTO Shares in exchange for the Deposited 
Securities  to  which  the  Depositing  Securityholder  is  entitled  under  the  Plan  of  Arrangement,  a  Depositing 
Securityholder  must deliver the applicable Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together 
with certificate(s) representing its Deposited Securities and all other required documents to the Depositary at the 
address  set  forth  in  the  applicable  Letter  of  Transmittal.  It  is  each  Depositing  Securityholder’s  responsibility  to 
ensure that the applicable Letter of Transmittal is received by the Depositary. If the Arrangement is not completed, 
the applicable Letter of Transmittal will be of no effect and the Depositary will return all certificates representing 
Deposited  Securities  to  the  holders  thereof  as  soon  as  practicable  at  the  address  specified  in  the  Letter  of 
Transmittal. Depositing Securityholders whose Deposited Securities are registered in the name of a broker, dealer, 
bank, trust company or other nominee must contact their nominee to deposit their Deposited Securities. See “The 
Arrangement – Procedure for Exchange of Securities”.
Right of Dissent
Pursuant to the Interim Order, Registered Shareholders are entitled to exercise Dissent Rights by providing a written 
notice of dissent to: (i) in the case of GTO, to GTO c/o its counsel, Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, 1000, 400 – 3rd
Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta  T2P 4H2, Attention: Melinda Park; (ii) in the case of Polaris, to Polaris, 200 King

time) at least two business days before the applicable Meeting or, in case of adjournment or postponement, no later 
than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the day that is two business days before the reconvened applicable Meeting, in 
the manner described under the heading “The Arrangement – Right of Dissent”. If a Registered Shareholder dissents 
and the Arrangement is completed, the Dissenter is entitled to be paid, pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, the fair 
value that their Dissenting Securities had immediately before the passing of the applicable Arrangement Resolution.
44
Shareholders who are not Registered Shareholders and who wish to exercise Dissent Rights must arrange for 
their Intermediary to dissent on their behalf. Shareholders who wish to dissent should take note that strict 
compliance with the Dissent Procedures is required. Dissent rights are not available to Polaris Optionholders, 
Polaris Warrantholders, Polaris Debentureholders, Western Optionholders or Western Warrantholders.
The Arrangement Agreement provides that it is a condition precedent to the Arrangement that holders of not greater 
than  5%  of  each  of  the  outstanding  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares,  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  or 
Western Shares shall have exercised rights of dissent in respect of the Arrangement that have not been withdrawn as 
at the Effective Date.  See “The Arrangement – The Arrangement Agreement – Conditions to the Arrangement”.
Related Transactions
The Polaris Continuation
In connection with the Arrangement, Polaris intends to continue from the Yukon Territory to the Province of British 
Columbia  under  the  BCBCA.  Accordingly,  at  the  Polaris  Meeting,  Polaris  Shareholders  and  Polaris  Preferred 
Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, to approve the Polaris Continuation Resolution. 
The  Polaris  Continuation  Resolution  must  be  approved  by  at  least  66(cid:1152)%  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  Polaris 
Shareholders  and  Polaris  Preferred  Shareholders  present  in  person  or  by  proxy  at  the  Polaris  Meeting,  voting 
together  as  a  single  class.  The  Arrangement  is  conditional  upon  the  Polaris  Continuation  Resolution  being 
approved  at  the  Polaris  Meeting  and  the  Polaris  Continuation  being  effected.    In  the  event  the  Polaris 
Continuation has been effected and the Arrangement is not subsequently completed, the Polaris Continuation 
Resolution  also  authorizes  the  Polaris  Board  to  discontinue  from  British  Columbia  into  the  Yukon  under 
section 190 of the YBCA.
There will be no change in the name of Polaris or its directors and officers as a result of the Polaris Continuation. 
The  rights  and  privileges  of  shareholders  of  a  corporation  governed  by  the  BCBCA  are,  in  many  instances, 
comparable to those of shareholders of a corporation governed by the YBCA. However, there are some important 
differences.  See  “Matters  to  be  Approved  at  the  Meetings  –  The  Polaris  Meeting”  for  a  description  of  the 
differences between the YBCA and the BCBCA.
Each registered Polaris Shareholder and Polaris Preferred Shareholder has a right to dissent in respect of the 
Polaris Continuation Resolution pursuant to section 193 of the YBCA. Registered Polaris Shareholders and 
Polaris Preferred Shareholders who dissent in the manner required by the YBCA with respect to the Polaris 
Continuation Resolution are entitled to be paid the fair value of their Polaris Shares and Polaris Preferred 
Shares,  respectively,  in  accordance  with  the  YBCA,  subject  to  certain  conditions.  The  right  to  dissent  in 
respect  of  the  Polaris  Continuation  are  described  in  this  Information  Circular  and  in  Appendix  R  to  this 
Information Circular. Failure to strictly comply with requirements set forth in section 193 of the YBCA may 
result in the loss of any right to dissent.
See “Related Transactions – The Polaris Continuation”, “Matters to be Approved at the Meetings – The Polaris 
Meeting” and Appendix R.
The Ram Acquisition
In connection with the Arrangement, GTO has agreed to acquire the Purchased Shares such that Ram will become a 
subsidiary of GTO upon completion of the Ram Acquisition. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, each Ram 
Acquisition Shareholder will receive 0.900154 GTO Shares for each Ram Acquisition Share held and each Ram 
Preferred Shareholder will  receive  0.9002 GTO  Shares  for  each  Ram  Preferred Share  held. As  at September  15, 
2009, 5,340,000 Ram Acquisition Shares and 5,277,777 Ram Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding. It is 
expected that an aggregate of 9,557,877 GTO Shares will be issued to the former Ram Acquisition Shareholders and 
Ram Preferred Shareholders to effect the Ram Acquisition. See “Related Transactions – The Ram Acquisition”.
45
The Ram Acquisition will be completed immediately following the Effective Time. The Ram Acquisition is subject 
to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, completion of the Arrangement.  See “Related Transactions 
– The Ram Acquisition”.
Ram is a private corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with a head office located in Reno, 
Nevada, engaged primarily in the exploration and development of geothermal projects in the United States. Ram 
currently  has  several  geothermal  projects  under  development  in  California  and  Nevada.  See  “Appendix  N  – 
Information Concerning Ram”.
The Financing
On  August  20,  2009,  GTO  completed  the  Financing  pursuant  to  which  an  aggregate  of  59,800,000  Subscription 
Receipts were issued at a price of $3.00 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of $179,400,000. The Escrowed 
Proceeds are being held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Subscription Receipt Agreement. Pursuant 
to the Agency Agreement, the Agents will receive the Agents’ Fee in consideration for their services provided in 
connection with the Financing upon the Escrow Release Conditions having been satisfied.
The Escrowed Proceeds, less the Agents’ Fee, will be released to GTO, or as otherwise directed by GTO, together 
with interest thereon, if, on or before 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Release Deadline, the Release Certificate is 
delivered to the Subscription Receipt Agent stating that the Release Event has occurred. In the event the Release 
Event does not occur prior to the Release Deadline, the Subscription Receiptholder’s Funds, plus a pro rata share of 
any Earnings, less applicable withholding taxes if any, shall be returned to the Subscription Receiptholders and the 
Subscription Receipts shall be deemed cancelled.
Upon the occurrence of the Release Event, each Subscription Receipt will be automatically exercised as a step in the 
Plan of Arrangement, for no additional consideration and without further action on the part of the holder, into one 
(1) GTO Share. Assuming completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, an aggregate of 59,800,000 
GTO Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of the Subscription Receipts.
The net proceeds of the Financing are intended to be used to develop key projects of New GTO upon completion of 
the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, to repay debt of New GTO and for general working capital purposes.
See “Related  Transactions  –  The  Financing”  and  “Appendix  K  –  Information  Concerning  GTO”.  For  a  more 
detailed  description  of  the  use  of  proceeds  of  the  Financing,  see  “Appendix  O  –  Information  Concerning  New 
GTO”.
Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
The exchange of Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares and Western Shares for GTO Shares will not generally be a 
taxable event to a Canadian resident shareholder. The exchange of Polaris Warrants and Western Warrants for GTO 
Shares will generally be a taxable event to a Canadian resident securityholder. A Securityholder who makes a valid 
election under section 85 of the Tax Act with GTO, may obtain a full or partial deferral (rollover) of any capital gain 
otherwise arising upon the exchange of such respective securities for GTO Shares.  A Securityholder interested in 
making  the  rollover  election  should  so  indicate  on  the  applicable  Letter  of  Transmittal.    Securityholders 
should contact their tax advisors with respect to the exchange of such securities and the availability of such 
tax deferred treatment and the making of such election.
Holders  of  securities  who  are  non-residents  of  Canada  will  only  be  subject  to  tax  under  the  Tax  Act  if  their 
respective securities constitute “taxable Canadian property” and the non-resident holders of respective securities are 
not offered relief under an applicable tax treaty.
Holders of securities are urged to carefully read the general summary of certain tax considerations noted below and 
to  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  for  advice  with  respect  to  their  own  particular  circumstances.    See  “Certain 
Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  –  Securityholders  of  the  Corporations  Resident  in  Canada.”    For
46
information  relative  to  non-residents  of  Canada,  see  “Certain  Canadian  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  – 
Securityholders of the Corporations Not Resident in Canada”.
Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
It is the intent of each Acquired Company that the exchange of its respective shares for GTO Shares pursuant to the 
Arrangement qualify as a tax-deferred “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code and/or 
as  part  of  a  tax-deferred  exchange  under  Section  351  of  the  Code  (each,  a  “Tax-Deferred  Transaction”)  with 
respect to itself and its U.S. Holders.  However, such qualification is not clear and may depend to some extent upon 
events subsequent to the date of this Circular, including events subsequent to the effective date of the Arrangement, 
which events cannot be predicted with accuracy.  Subject to application of the passive foreign investment company 
(“PFIC”) rules described under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders”, if an Exchange 
qualifies as a Tax-Deferred Transaction, a participating U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the 
receipt of GTO Shares for its Acquired Company Shares.  If an Exchange is taxable, subject to the PFIC rules, a 
U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the fair market value 
(expressed in U.S. dollars) of the GTO Shares received in exchange for its Acquired Company Shares pursuant to 
the  Arrangement  and  (ii)  the  adjusted  tax  basis  (expressed  in  U.S.  dollars)  of  such  U.S.  Holder  in  the  Acquired 
Company Shares exchanged.   It is possible that one Exchange may qualify as a Tax-Deferred Transaction while the 
other many not.  U.S. Holders should consult their own U.S. tax advisors regarding the proper tax reporting of the 
exchange of their respective shares for GTO Shares pursuant to the Arrangement.
A limited discussion of certain material anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders 
resulting from an Exchange and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of GTO Shares received pursuant to the 
Arrangement is included under the heading “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” below, and 
the foregoing is qualified in full by the information in that section.  U.S. Holders are strongly urged to read that 
section in its entirety.
Other Tax Considerations
This Information Circular does not address any tax considerations of the Arrangement other than certain 
Canadian and U.S. federal income tax considerations.  Holders of securities who are resident in jurisdictions 
other than Canada and the U.S. should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax implications of 
the Arrangement, including any associated filing requirements, in such jurisdictions and with respect to the 
tax implications in such jurisdictions of owning GTO Securities after the Arrangement.  Holders of securities 
should also consult their own tax advisors regarding provincial, territorial or state tax considerations of the 
Arrangement or of holding GTO Securities.
See “Other Tax Considerations”.

Following  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition,  Polaris,  Western  and  Ram  will  each  be  a 
subsidiary  of  GTO.    Concurrently  with  the  completion  of  the  Business  Combination:  (i)  the  current  directors  of 
GTO, with the exception of A. Murray Sinclair, and the current officers of GTO will resign; (ii) the current directors 
of Polaris and the current officers of Polaris, with the exception of C. Thomas Ogryzlo, will resign; (iii) the current 
directors of Western, with the exception of Daryl S. Clark, and the current officers of Western will resign; (iv) the 
current  directors  of  Ram,  with  the  exception  of  Yeheskel  (Hezy)  Ram,  will  resign;  (v)  Chris  Thompson,  Walter

48
Risk Factors
There are certain risk factors associated with the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition which should be carefully 
considered  by  securityholders,  including  the  fact  that  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  may  not  be 
completed if, among other things, the Arrangement Resolutions are not approved at the Meetings or if any other 
conditions precedent to the completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition are not satisfied or waived as 
applicable. See “Risk Factors”.
If the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition are completed as contemplated, GTO will acquire all of the issued and 
outstanding securities of Polaris and Western and the Ram Acquisition Shares and Ram Preferred Shares and each of 
Polaris,  Western  and  Ram  will  become  subsidiaries  of  GTO.  If  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are 
completed  as  contemplated,  New  GTO  will  be  engaged  in  the  business  of  acquiring,  exploring,  developing  and 
operating geothermal properties through its subsidiaries and will have an interest in geothermal projects in British 
Columbia (through its holdings in Western), California (through its holdings in Ram and Western), Nevada (through 
its holdings in Ram) and Nicaragua (through its holdings in Polaris). There are numerous risks associated with such 
business and such risk factors are more particularly described in “Appendix O – Information Concerning New GTO 
– Risk Factors”.

Solicitation of Proxies
GENERAL PROXY MATTERS
This Information Circular is provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the management of the 
Corporations for use at the Meetings for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notices of Meetings of 
each of the Corporations and the associated costs will be borne by the Corporations.  In addition to solicitation 
by  mail,  proxies  may  be  solicited  by  personal  interviews,  telephone  or  other  means  of  communication  and  by 
directors, officers and employees of the Corporations (who will not be specifically remunerated therefor).
The  Meetings are  being  called  pursuant  to the  Interim  Order  to  seek  the  approval of the  GTO  Shareholders,  the

the Meetings”.
Appointment and Revocation of Proxies
The persons named in the enclosed forms of proxy are directors and/or officers of GTO, Polaris or Western, as the

the applicable Meeting.  To exercise this right, the respective Securityholder should strike out the names of 
management designees in the enclosed form of proxy and insert the name of the desired representative in the 
blank  space  provided  in  the  form  of  proxy  or  submit  another  appropriate  form  of  proxy.    In  order  to  be 
effective, a proxy must be forwarded so as to reach, or be deposited with: (i) in the case of the GTO Meeting, CIBC 
Mellon Trust Company, c/o Postlinx, Proxy Dept., P.O. Box 721, Agincourt, Ontario M1S 0A1, not less than 48

Securityholder or such Securityholder’s attorney authorized in writing, or if such Securityholder is a corporation, 
under its corporate seal or by a duly authorized officer or attorney.
In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law, a Securityholder may revoke a proxy: 
(a) by instrument in writing executed by the respective Securityholder or such respective Securityholder’s attorney 
authorized in writing or if the respective Securityholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal or by an officer or 
attorney thereof, duly authorized, and deposited either with the scrutineers at the office of the scrutineers designated 
in the respective Notice of Meeting and the Information Circular not later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time), on the 
Business Day preceding the day of the Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) or with the Chairman 
on  the  day  of  the  Meeting  (or  any  adjournment  or  postponement  thereof);  (b)  by  a  duly  executed  and  deposited 
proxy bearing a later date or time than the date or time of the proxy being revoked; or (c) by voting in person at the 
Meeting (although attendance at the Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of proxy).
In order for GTO Shareholders to revoke a proxy, such revocation must be delivered to the registered office of GTO, 
1200  Waterfront  Centre,  200  Burrard  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia    V6C  3L6,  Attention:  Corporate

postponement thereof), or to the Chair of the GTO Meeting on the day of the GTO Meeting (or any adjournment or 
postponement thereof), before any vote in respect of which the proxy to be used shall have been taken. A revocation 
of a proxy does not affect any matter on which a vote has been taken prior to the revocation.
In order for Western Securityholders to revoke a proxy, such revocation must be delivered to the registered office of 
Western,  25th  Floor,  700  West  Georgia  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia    V7Y  1B3,  Attention:  Corporate 
Secretary, at any time up to the Business Day preceding the date of the Western Meeting (or any adjournment or 
postponement  thereof),  or  to  the  Chair  of  the  Western  Meeting  on  the  day  of  the  Western  Meeting  (or  any
50
adjournment or postponement thereof), before any vote in respect of which the proxy to be used shall have been 
taken. A revocation of a proxy does not affect any matter on which a vote has been taken prior to the revocation.
Voting of Proxies
The securities represented by an effective proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions specified therein.  
Where  no  choice  is  specified,  the  securities  will  be  voted  in  favour  of  the  matters  set  forth  therein.    The 
enclosed form of proxy confers discretionary authority in respect of amendments or variations to matters identified 
in the Notice of Meeting and with respect to other matters which may properly come before the Meeting, or any 
adjournment  or  postponement  thereof.    As  of  the  date  hereof,  management  of  the  Corporations  know  of  no 
amendments, variations or other matters to come before the Meeting; however, if any other matter properly comes 
before  the  Meeting,  the  accompanying  form  of  proxy  will  be  voted  on  such  matter  in  accordance  with  the  best 
judgment of the person(s) voting the proxies.
Advice to Nonregistered Securityholders
to
in
in
their  own  name  (referred
The  information  set  forth  in  this  section  is  of  significant  importance  to  many  Securityholders,  as  a  substantial 
number  of  Securityholders  do  not  hold  securities  in  their  own  name.    Securityholders  who  do  not  hold  their 
this  Information  Circular  as  “Nonregistered 
respective  securities 
Securityholders”) should note that only proxies deposited by Securityholders whose names appear on the records of 
the Corporations as the Registered Securityholders thereof can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting.  If 
securities are listed in an account statement provided to a Securityholder by a broker, then, in almost all cases, those 
securities will not be registered in the Securityholder’s name on the records of the Corporation.  Such securities will 
more likely be registered in the name of the broker or an agent of the broker.  In Canada, the vast majority of such 
securities  are  registered  under  the  name  of  CDS  &  Co.  (the  registration  name  for  the  Canadian  Depositary  for 
Securities,  which  acts  as  a  nominee  for  many  Canadian  brokerage  firms).    Securities  held  by  brokers  or  their 
nominees  can  only  be  voted  (for  or  against  resolutions)  upon  instructions  of  the  Nonregistered  Securityholder.  
Without  specific  instructions,  brokers/nominees  are  prohibited  from  voting  securities  for  their  clients.  The 
Corporations  do  not  know  for  whose  benefit  the  securities  registered  in  the  names  of  CDS  &  Co.  are  held.  
Therefore, Nonregistered Securityholders cannot be recognized at the Meeting for purposes of voting their securities 
in person or by way of proxy.
Applicable regulatory policies require Intermediaries to seek voting instructions from Nonregistered Securityholders 
in  advance  of  the  Meetings.    Every  Intermediary  has  its  own  mailing  procedures  and  provides  its  own  return 
instructions  which  should  be  carefully  followed  by  Nonregistered  Securityholders  in  order  to  ensure  that  their 
securities are voted at the respective Meeting.  Often, the form of proxy supplied to a Nonregistered Securityholder 
by  its  broker  is  identical  to  that  provided  to  Registered  Securityholders.    However,  its  purpose  is  limited  to 
instructing  the  Registered  Securityholder  on  how  to  vote  on  behalf  of  the  Nonregistered  Securityholder.  The 
majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge.  Broadridge 
typically mails a scannable voting instruction form in lieu of the form of proxy.  Nonregistered Securityholders are 
asked  to  complete  and  return  the  voting  instruction  form  to  them  by  mail  or  facsimile  or  to  follow  specified 
telephone  or  internet  voting  procedures.    Broadridge  then  tabulates  the  results  of  all  instructions  received  and 
provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting.  If a Nonregistered 
Securityholder receives a voting instruction form from Broadridge it cannot be used as a proxy to vote securities 
directly at the Meeting as the voting instruction forms must be returned to Broadridge or the telephone or internet 
procedures completed well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the shares voted.
If  you  are  a  Nonregistered  Securityholder  and  wish  to  vote  in  person  at  the  Meeting,  please  contact  your 
broker or agent well in advance of the Meeting to determine how you can do so.

Background to the Arrangement
THE ARRANGEMENT
The  terms  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are  the  result  of  extensive  arm’s  length  negotiations 
conducted  between  representatives  of  GTO,  Polaris,  Western,  Ram  and  their  respective  legal  advisors.    The 
following  is  a  summary  of  the  background  to  the  finalization  of  the  terms  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram 
Acquisition.
GTO is a corporation without active business operations currently listed on NEX as it had previously fallen below 
the  TSXV’s  ongoing  listing  standards.    Management  of  GTO  has  an  ongoing  mandate  to  identify  and  evaluate 
potential business mergers and acquisitions in an effort to increase shareholder value.
In May 2009, management of GTO began working with Cormark to actively identify and pursue viable geothermal 
business opportunities.  Through this relationship, Cormark introduced Ram to GTO.  As previously disclosed, Ram 
is a private company that, at the time, was reviewing various alternatives to raising capital to finance opportunities 
in the geothermal industry in North America.
During the months of May and June, management of GTO and Ram discussed the various alternatives available to 
them,  and,  with  the  support  of  Cormark,  also  reviewed  the  opportunities  to  approach  other  companies  currently 
carrying on business in the geothermal sector. Cormark was aware of other Canadian geothermal companies seeking 
additional capital and began a process of identifying and evaluating companies to approach.  Two such companies 
were Polaris and Western.
Management of Ram and GTO approached the boards of the companies identified by Cormark to determine interest 
and the viability of a business combination.  At the same time, management of Ram and GTO continued to negotiate 
the terms of a formal relationship between them.
On  June  30,  2009,  the  GTO  Board  held  a  meeting  to  consider  and  discuss  a  number  of  factors  in  determining 
optimal strategic alternatives available to GTO, including the opportunities of a formal relationship between Ram 
and GTO.  The GTO Board authorized management to sign a non-binding letter of intent to continue to investigate a 
formal relationship with Ram and to pursue a business combination with a number of other synergistic companies.
On  June  30,  2009,  Ram  and  GTO  entered  into  the  Ram  Letter  of  Intent  outlining  the  general  terms  of  the  Ram 
Acquisition  and  their  joint  pursuit  of  a  business  combination  with  other  companies  carrying  on  business  in  the 
geothermal industry.
On June 30, 2009, GTO entered into an engagement letter with Cormark to formally engage Cormark as its financial 
advisor and lead financing agent to provide financial advisory services including the identification and evaluation of 
potential  corporate  opportunities.    GTO  also  requested  Cormark  to  complete  the  work  necessary  to  provide  a 
fairness opinion with regard to the Business Combination, which was subsequently delivered to the GTO Board for 
their consideration.
From June 30, 2009 to July 14, 2009, management of GTO and Ram continued to work with the boards of Polaris 
and Western and another geothermal company with the goal of entering into a letter of intent to complete a business 
combination and complete a significant financing.
On July 13, 2009, the Western Board appointed the Western Special Committee to consider the Arrangement and 
make a recommendation to the Western Board with regards to the Arrangement.
On  July  14,  2009,  the  Polaris  Board  appointed  the  Polaris  Special  Committee  to  consider  the  Arrangement,  to 
conduct due diligence investigations of the remaining Parties and to make a recommendation to the Polaris Board 
with regards to the Arrangement.
54
On  July  14,  2009,  the  GTO  Board  held  a  meeting  to  consider  and  evaluate  the  proposed  business  combination 
between  GTO,  Ram,  Polaris  and  Western,  including  the  aspects  of  a  significant  financing  to  be  completed 
conditional upon the completion of the Business Combination.  The GTO Board authorized management to sign a 
non-binding letter of intent to continue to investigate the proposed Business Combination.
On July 14, 2009, the Western Special Committee met to consider and evaluate the Letter of Intent outlining the 
general  terms  of  the  proposed  Business  Combination.    The  Western  Special  Committee  recommended  to  the 
Western Board that Western enter into the Letter of Intent and later that same day, the Western Board authorized 
Western to enter into the Letter of Intent.
On  July  14,  2009,  the  Polaris  Special  Committee  met  to  consider  and  evaluate  the  Letter  of  Intent  outlining  the 
general terms of the proposed Business Combination.  The Polaris Special Committee recommended to the Polaris 
Board that Polaris enter into the Letter of Intent and later that same day, the Polaris Board authorized Polaris to enter 
into the Letter of Intent.
On July 14, 2009 management of GTO, Ram, Polaris and Western were successful in their negotiations and entered 
into the Letter of Intent, including the requirement for a significant financing.
Between  July  15,  2009  and  September  8,  2009,  GTO,  Ram,  Polaris  and  Western  negotiated  the  terms  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement, including whether any fees would be payable by the parties in the event the transaction did 
not proceed for certain reasons.  During this time period, the parties also conducted a comprehensive due diligence 
process of each others’ business and operations.  During that time, GTO and Ram also continued to negotiate the 
terms of the Ram Acquisition.
On July 22, 2009, the Western Special Committee met and engaged Davis & Company LLP as independent legal 
counsel to the Western Special Committee.
From  July  22,  2009  to  August  11,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  and  Western  Board  met  on  multiple 
occasions  to  discuss  the  progress  regarding  the  Arrangement  and  negotiations  regarding  the  Arrangement 
Agreement.
On  August  11,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  met  and  approved  the  engagement  of  Primary  Capital  as 
financial advisor to Western with respect to the Arrangement.
Between August 11, 2009 and September 1, 2009, the Western Special Committee and Western Board held frequent 
meetings to receive updates regarding the Arrangement and the status of the Arrangement Agreement.
On August 20, 2009, GTO closed the Financing.
On  September  1,  2009,  the  Western  Special  Committee  met  to  receive  an  update  from  Primary  Capital  and  to 
receive  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion.    Following  the  presentation  by  Primary  Capital,  the  Western  Special 
Committee  reviewed  and  considered  the  terms  of  the  proposed  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase 
Agreement  in  light  of  current  opportunities  available  to  Western  and  an  analysis  of  the  advantages  and 
disadvantages presented by the Business Combination.
On September 3, 2009, the Western Special Committee held a meeting to further consider the terms of the proposed 
Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  and  after  careful  consideration  of  the  alternatives 
available  to  Western,  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion,  the  advice  of  legal  counsel  and  other  relevant  matters,  the 
Western Special Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that the Western Board approve the Arrangement 
Agreement  and  the  Arrangement.    Later  that  same  day,  the  Western  Board  met  and  unanimously  approved  the 
recommendations made by the Western Special Committee.
On September 4, 2009, the GTO Board held a meeting to further consider the terms of the proposed Arrangement 
Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  and  to  review  and  approve  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram 
Acquisition.  The GTO Board specifically reviewed the opportunities currently available to GTO and the advantages
55
presented by the Business Combination.  Accordingly, the GTO Board voted unanimously to recommend that the 
GTO Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement and approved, among other things, the entering into of the 
Arrangement Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement.
Legal advisors for GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram attended several conference calls to negotiate the terms of the 
Arrangement  Agreement,  Share  Purchase  Agreement  and  related  documentation  and  on  September  8,  2009,  the 
Arrangement Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement were signed.
Benefits of and Reasons for the Arrangement
The board of directors of each of GTO, Polaris and Western believe that the Arrangement provides the following 
benefits for the Securityholders:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
the Arrangement, once completed, will create a significantly stronger geothermal company than 
any  of  Polaris,  Western  or  Ram  alone,  spanning  all  development  stages  from  exploration  to 
production;
the increased size of New GTO is expected to create synergies in development and operations and 
contribute to lower average expenses and cost of capital;
New GTO will have a greater market value and the GTO Shares are expected to trade on the TSX, 
which is expected to improve liquidity for certain shareholders, as well as the ability to attract new 
capital;
upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition,  New  GTO  will  have  a  strong 
balance  sheet  as  a  result  of  the  Financing  with  approximately  $162,000,000  cash  and  cash 
equivalents as indicated on the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as at June 30, 2009;
subject to the provisions of the Tax Act, the exchange of Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares, 
Western Shares, Polaris Warrants and Western Warrants under the Arrangement should generally 
occur on a tax-deferred basis;
current GTO Shareholders and Polaris Securityholders and Western Securityholders who receive 
GTO Securities under the Arrangement will have continued participation in the upside of GTO 
through a stake in New GTO;
New  GTO  will  have  a  highly  experienced  management  team  with  complementary  skills  in 
exploration, business, project development and operations;
in connection with the Arrangement, the Polaris Debentures, which are currently due to mature on 
October 11, 2009, will be restructured and the Polaris Debentureholders will receive GTO Shares, 
reducing the long-term debt in New GTO; and
New GTO will have sufficient funds to advance construction of the San Jacinto Tizate geothermal 
project within the time frame prescribed by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Energy and Mines.
Fairness Opinions
The GTO Fairness Opinion
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated June 30, 2009, Cormark was engaged by the GTO Board to act as financial 
advisor in connection with the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, which included the preparation and delivery 
to  the  GTO  Board  of  the  GTO  Fairness  Opinion.  On  September  4,  2009,  Cormark  delivered  the  GTO  Fairness 
Opinion  to  the  GTO  Board.  In  the  GTO  Fairness  Opinion,  Cormark  concluded  that  subject  to  the  assumptions, 
qualifications and limitations contained in the GTO Fairness Opinion, as of September 4, 2009, the consideration to
56
be received by the GTO Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement, is fair from a financial point of view. The GTO 
Fairness Opinion was provided to the GTO Board solely for the purpose of its consideration of the Arrangement and 
addresses the fairness of the Arrangement, from a financial point of view, to the GTO Shareholders.
The full text of the GTO Fairness Opinion, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions, qualifications, 
considerations  and  limitations  on  the  scope  of  review  undertaken  by  Cormark  in  rendering  the  GTO  Fairness 
Opinion, is included as Appendix H to this Information Circular. The GTO Shareholders are urged to read the GTO 
Fairness Opinion in its entirety. The GTO Fairness Opinion does not constitute advice or a recommendation as to 
whether GTO Shareholders should vote in favour of the Arrangement or any other transaction to be considered at 
the GTO Meeting and the GTO Fairness Opinion states that it may not be used or relied upon by any other person 
other than the GTO Board without the express prior written consent of Cormark. This summary of the GTO Fairness 
Opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the GTO Fairness Opinion, attached as Appendix 
H.
The  GTO  Fairness  Opinion  was  rendered  on  the  basis  of  securities  markets,  economic,  financial  and  general 
business conditions prevailing as at the date of the GTO Fairness Opinion and the condition and prospects, financial 
and otherwise of GTO and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as they were reflected in the information and documents 
reviewed  by  Cormark  and  as  they  were  represented  to  Cormark  in  discussions  with  management  of  GTO. 
Subsequent developments may affect the GTO Fairness Opinion and although Cormark has no obligation to do so, it 
reserves  the  right  to  change,  modify  or  withdraw  the  GTO  Fairness  Opinion  prior  to  the  completion  of  the 
Arrangement.
Cormark  is  a  member  of  the  Investment  Industry  Regulatory  Organization  of  Canada  and  the  Canadian  Investor 
Protection Fund and is an independent investment dealer providing investment research, equity sales and trading and 
investment  banking  services.  The  GTO  Fairness  Opinion  represents  the  opinion  of  Cormark  and  the  form  and 
content of the GTO Fairness Opinion have been approved for release by a committee of its directors and officers, 
each  of  whom  is  experienced  in  merger,  acquisition,  divestiture  and  fairness  opinion  matters.  The  terms  of  the 
engagement  provide  that  Cormark  is  to  be  paid  an  advisory  fee  by  GTO  upon  successful  completion  of  the 
Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition and be issued the GTO M&A Shares.
Neither Cormark nor any of its associates or affiliates is an insider, associate or affiliate (as those terms are defined 
in MI 61-101) of GTO, Polaris, Western or Ram or any of their respective associates or affiliates. Other than as 
disclosed herein, neither Cormark nor any of its associates or affiliates have provided any financial advisory services 
or participated in any financings involving GTO, Polaris, Western or Ram or any of their respective associates or 
affiliates within the past two years. Cormark may, in the ordinary course of its business, provide financial advisory 
or investment banking services for GTO, Polaris, Western or Ram or any of their respective associates or affiliates. 
Cormark acted as a junior agent on behalf of Western in a $7.3 million offering of flow-through shares and non-flow 
through units in April 2005.
Cormark acted as lead-agent in connection with the Financing. In consideration of its services, pursuant to the terms 
of the Agency Agreement, Cormark will receive its proportionate share of the Agents’ Fee and the GTO Broker’s 
Warrants. See “Related Transactions – The Financing”.
The Polaris Fairness Opinion
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated August 6, 2009, Canaccord was engaged by the Polaris Board and the Polaris 
Special Committee to consider the Arrangement and provide its opinion as to the fairness of the Arrangement, from 
a financial point of view, to the Polaris Shareholders, Polaris Preferred Shareholders and Polaris Warrantholders. On 
September  1,  2009,  Canaccord  orally  delivered  a  form  of  the  Polaris  Fairness  Opinion  to  the  Polaris  Special 
Committee  and  the  Polaris  Board.  Subsequent  to  the  delivery  of  the  oral  form  of  the  Polaris  Fairness  Opinion, 
Canaccord delivered the written Polaris Fairness Opinion to the Polaris Special Committee and the Polaris Board 
dated  September  1,  2009.  In  the  Polaris  Fairness Opinion,  Canaccord concluded  that  subject  to  the  assumptions, 
qualifications and limitations contained in the Polaris Fairness Opinion, as of September 1, 2009, the consideration 
to be received by the Polaris Shareholders, Polaris Preferred Shareholders and Polaris Warrantholders pursuant to 
the Arrangement, is fair from a financial point of view. The Polaris Fairness Opinion was provided to the Polaris 
Special  Committee  and  the  Polaris  Board  solely  for  the  purpose  of  its  consideration  of  the  Arrangement  and
57
addresses  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement,  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  to  the  Polaris  Shareholders,  Polaris

Preferred  Shareholders  and  Polaris  Warrantholders  should  vote  in  favour  of  the  Arrangement  or  any  other 
transaction to be considered at the Polaris Meeting and the Polaris Fairness Opinion states that it may not be used or 
relied upon by any other person other than the Polaris Special Committee or the Polaris Board without the express 
prior  written  consent  of  Canaccord.  This  summary  of  the  Polaris  Fairness  Opinion  is  qualified  in  its  entirety  by 
reference to the full text of the Polaris Fairness Opinion, attached as Appendix I.
The  Polaris  Fairness  Opinion  was  rendered  on  the  basis  of  securities  markets,  economic,  financial  and  general 
business  conditions  prevailing  as  at  the  date  of  the  Polaris  Fairness  Opinion  and  the  condition  and  prospects, 
financial and otherwise of Polaris and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as they were reflected in the information and 
documents reviewed by Canaccord and as they were represented to Canaccord in discussions with management of 
Polaris.  Subsequent  developments  may  affect  the  Polaris  Fairness  Opinion  and  although  Canaccord  has  no 
obligation to do so, it reserves the right to change, modify or withdraw the Polaris Fairness Opinion prior to the 
completion of the Arrangement.

Protection  Fund  and  is  a  full  service  investment  dealer  engaged  in  wealth  management  and  financial  advisory

The Western Fairness Opinion
Pursuant  to  an  engagement  letter  dated  August  20,  2009,  Primary  Capital  was  engaged  by  the  Western  Special 
Committee  to  consider  the  Arrangement  and  provide  its  opinion  as  to  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement,  from  a 
financial point of view, to the Western Securityholders. On September 1, 2009, Primary Capital orally delivered a 
form of the Western Fairness Opinion to the Western Special Committee. Subsequent to the delivery of the oral 
form  of  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion,  Primary  Capital  delivered  the  written  Western  Fairness  Opinion  to  the 
Western Special Committee dated September 8, 2009. In the Western Fairness Opinion, Primary Capital concluded 
that  subject  to  the  assumptions,  qualifications  and  limitations  contained  in  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion,  as  of 
September 8, 2009, the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Western Securityholders, other 
than  GTO  and  the  associates  and  affiliates  thereof.  The  Western  Fairness  Opinion  was  provided  to  the  Western 
Special Committee and solely for the purpose of its consideration of the Arrangement and addresses the fairness of 
the Arrangement, from a financial point of view, to the Western Securityholders.
The following is a summary of the Western Fairness Opinion only. The full text of the Western Fairness Opinion, 
which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions, qualifications, considerations and limitations on the scope of 
review undertaken by Primary Capital in rendering the Western Fairness Opinion, is included as Appendix J to this 
Information Circular. The Western Securityholders are urged to read the Western Fairness Opinion in its entirety.
58
The Western Fairness Opinion is not to be construed as a recommendation to any securityholder as to whether to 
tender or vote its securities of Western, GTO, Polaris or Ram, as the case may be, in favour of the Transaction (as 
defined in the Western Fairness Opinion). The Western Fairness Opinion states that it may not be used or relied 
upon by any other person other than the members of the Western Special Committee and may not be used or relied 
upon by any such person or for any purpose other than the purposes stated in the Western Fairness Opinion without 
the express prior written consent of Primary Capital. This summary of the Western Fairness Opinion is qualified in 
its entirety by reference to the full text of the Western Fairness Opinion, attached as Appendix J.
The  Western  Fairness  Opinion  was  rendered  as  of  September  8,  2009,  and  on  the  basis  of  securities  markets, 
economic,  financial  and  general  business  conditions  prevailing  as  of  that  date  and  the  condition  and  prospects, 
financial and otherwise of Western, GTO, Polaris and Ram and the respective subsidiaries and affiliates thereof, as 
reflected in the information (as defined in the Western Fairness Opinion) reviewed by Primary Capital and as they 
were represented to Primary Capital in discussions with the directors, officers and management of Western. Primary 
Capital disclaims any undertaking or obligations to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter which 
affects the Western Fairness Opinion that may come or be brought to the attention of Primary Capital after the date 
of  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion  and  without  limiting  the  scope  of  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  there  is  any 
material change in any fact or matter which affects the Western Fairness Opinion after September 8, 2009, Primary 
Capital reserves the right to change, modify or withdraw the Western Fairness Opinion.
Primary  Capital  is  a  registered  limited  market  dealer  in  Ontario.  The  Western  Fairness  Opinion  represents  the 
opinion  of  Primary  Capital  and  the  form  and  content  of  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion  have  been  approved  for 
release  by  the  principals  of  Primary  Capital,  each  of  whom  is  experienced  in  merger,  acquisition,  divestiture, 
valuation, fairness opinion and capital market matters. Primary Capital was paid a fee upon delivery of the written 
Western  Fairness  Opinion,  plus  out-of-pocket  expenses,  and  is  to  be  indemnified  by  Western  in  certain 
circumstances.
Primary Capital is not an insider, associate or affiliate of Western, GTO, Polaris or Ram and is not an advisor to any 
person  or  company  other  than  Western  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement.  Primary  Capital  has  not  acted  as  lead 
underwriter  or  agent  of  Western,  GTO,  Polaris  or  Ram  in  respect  of  an  offering  of  securities  of  Western,  GTO, 
Polaris or Ram, respectively, in the past 24 months, nor has Primary Capital entered into any other agreements or 
arrangements  with  Western,  GTO,  Polaris,  Ram  or  any  of  their  respective  affiliates  with  respect  to  any  future 
dealings. Primary Capital may, however, in the ordinary course of its business, provide financial advisory services 
or investment banking services to Western, GTO, Polaris, Ram or any of their respective associates or affiliates from 
time to time. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Primary Capital may actively trade common shares 
and other securities of Western, as well as common shares and other securities of GTO or Polaris for its own account 
and,  accordingly,  may  at  any  time  hold  a  long  or  short  position  in  such  securities.  As  a  limited  market  dealer, 
Primary Capital conducts research on securities and may, in the ordinary course of its business, provide investment 
advice  to  its  clients  on  investment  matters,  including  with  respect  to  Western,  GTO,  Polaris  or  Ram  or  their 
respective associates or affiliates, or with respect to the Transaction (as defined in the Western Fairness Opinion).
Special Committees of Polaris and Western
Polaris Special Committee
On July 14, 2009, the Polaris Board appointed the Polaris Special Committee to consider the Arrangement and to 
make  recommendations  to  the  Polaris  Board with  respect  to  the  Arrangement.  The  Polaris  Special  Committee  is 
comprised of Tony Mitchell (Chairman), C. Thomas Ogryzlo, Narinder Nagra and Michael Atkinson.  On August 6, 
2009,  the  Polaris  Special  Committee  engaged  Canaccord  to  provide  a  fairness  opinion  with  respect  to  the 
Arrangement.  See “Fairness Opinions”.
The Polaris Special Committee met with Northwest Law Group on a number of occasions following the execution of 
the Letter of Intent to discuss various matters pertaining to the Arrangement, including a review of the mandate of 
the Polaris Special Committee, the duties and responsibilities of the Polaris Special Committee and the procedures to 
be adopted by the Polaris Special Committee in its deliberations, due diligence matters and matters pertaining to the 
negotiation and settlement of the Arrangement Agreement.  The Polaris Special Committee also met with Wildeboer 
Dellelce LLP with respect to the application and interpretation of MI 61-101 and related regulatory matters.
59
After careful consideration, including a thorough review of strategic alternatives available to Polaris and the Polaris 
Fairness Opinion, completion of extensive due diligence with respect to the remaining Parties and their assets and 
operations, as well as a thorough review of other matters, and consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the 
Polaris  Special  Committee  unanimously  concluded  that  the  Polaris  Board  should  recommend  to  the  Polaris 
Securityholders that they vote in favour of the Arrangement. In deciding to approve the Arrangement Agreement 
and the terms of the Arrangement, the Polaris Board considered, among other things, the recommendation of the 
Polaris Special Committee.
Western Special Committee
On July 13, 2009, the Western Board appointed the Western Special Committee to consider the Arrangement and to 
make recommendations to the Western Board with respect to the Arrangement. The Western Special Committee is 
comprised  of  Daryl  S.  Clark,  Harry  Knutson  and  Gudmundur  Sigurjonsson.  The  Western  Special  Committee 
engaged Davis & Company LLP to act as legal counsel to the Western Special Committee. The Western Special 
Committee  and  the  Western  Board  engaged  Primary  Capital  to  provide  a  fairness  opinion  with  respect  to  the 
Arrangement.  See “Fairness Opinions”.
After  careful  consideration  of  the  alternatives  available  to  Western,  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion,  the  advice  of 
legal counsel and other relevant matters, the Western Special Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that 
the Western Board approve the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement.
Recommendations of the Board of Directors
Recommendation of the GTO Board
In reaching its decision to approve the Arrangement and to recommend to the GTO Shareholders that they vote for 
the  GTO  Arrangement  Resolution,  the  GTO  Board  obtained  advice  from  financial  and  legal  advisors.  The  GTO 
Board  carefully  considered  all  aspects  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Arrangement  and  considered  a 
number  of  factors  in  concluding  that  the  Arrangement  is  in  the  best  interests  of  GTO  and  is  fair  to  GTO 
Shareholders, including the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
the reasons outlined under “Benefits of and Reasons for the Arrangement” above;
the GTO Fairness Opinion;
Supporting Securityholders and Mr. MacLeod have agreed to vote their securities in favour of the 
Arrangement;
the requirement for approval by 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by the GTO Shareholders represented at 
the GTO Meeting in person or by proxy;
the  fact  that  GTO  Shareholders  that  do  not  approve  of  the  Arrangement  may  exercise  Dissent 
Rights;
under the Arrangement Agreement, the GTO Board remains able to respond, in accordance with 
its fiduciary duties, to an Acquisition Proposal that such directors determine could reasonably be 
expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and
that the Arrangement will only become effective if, after hearing from all interested parties who 
choose  to  appear  before  it,  and  after  considering  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement,  the  Court 
approves it.
The  foregoing  discussion  of  the  information  and  factors  considered  by  the  GTO  Board  is  not  intended  to  be 
exhaustive but summarizes the material factors considered by the GTO Board. The GTO Board collectively reached
60
its  decision  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement  in  light  of  the  factors  described  above  and  other  factors  that  each 
member of the GTO Board considered appropriate.
In reaching its determination to approve and recommend the Arrangement, the GTO Board did not find it useful or 
practicable to, and did not, quantify, rank or otherwise attempt to make any specific assessments of, or otherwise 
assign  any  relative  or  specific  weight  to,  the  factors  that  were  considered.  The  GTO  Board’s  determination  and 
recommendation were made after consideration of all of the factors relating to the Arrangement and in light of their 
own knowledge of the business, financial condition and prospects of GTO and were based upon the advice of the 
financial and legal advisors to GTO. Individual directors may have assigned or given different weights to different 
factors.
The GTO Board unanimously recommends that the GTO Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement.  
The contents and delivery of this Information Circular have been approved by the GTO Board.
Recommendation of the Polaris Board
In reaching its decision to approve the Arrangement and to recommend to Polaris Securityholders that they vote for 
the  Polaris  Arrangement  Resolution,  the  Polaris  Board  obtained  advice  from  financial  and  legal  advisors  and 
received the recommendation of the Polaris Special Committee. The Polaris Board carefully considered all aspects 
of  the  Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Arrangement  and  considered  a  number  of  factors  in  concluding  that  the 
Arrangement is in the best interests of Polaris and is fair to Polaris Securityholders, including the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
(j)
the reasons outlined under “Benefits of and Reasons for the Arrangement” above;
the risks associated with failing to complete the Arrangement, as more particularly described in 
“Appendix L – Information Concerning Polaris – Risk Factors”;
the Polaris Fairness Opinion;
Polaris  Securityholders  are  expected  to  own  approximately  35.7%  of  the  GTO  Shares  upon 
completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition and, through ownership of GTO Shares, 
will continue to participate in any increase in the value of Polaris’ current projects. In addition, 
Polaris Securityholders will participate in any increase in the value of the assets currently owned 
by GTO, Western and Ram;
the  Polaris  Special  Committee  unanimously  recommended  that  the  Polaris  Board  approve  the 
Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated thereby;
Supporting  Securityholders  holding  approximately  57.5%  of  Polaris  Shares,  80.8%  Polaris 
Preferred Shares, 69.2% Polaris Warrants and 97.8% Polaris Debentures have agreed to vote their 
Polaris Securities, as the case may be, in favour of the Polaris Arrangement Resolution;
the requirement for approval by 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by the Polaris Securityholders represented 
at the Polaris Meeting in person or by proxy;
the requirement for approval by a simple majority of the votes cast by Polaris Shareholders after 
excluding the votes of “interested persons” (as defined in MI 61-101) represented at the Polaris 
Meeting in person or by proxy;
the fact that Polaris Shareholders and Polaris Preferred Shareholders that do not approve of the 
Arrangement may exercise Dissent Rights;
that the Arrangement will only become effective if, after hearing from all interested parties who 
choose  to  appear  before  it,  and  after  considering  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement,  the  Court 
approves it;
61
(k)
(l)
under the Arrangement Agreement, the Polaris Board remains able to respond, in accordance  with 
its fiduciary duties, to an Acquisition Proposal that such directors determine could reasonably be 
expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and
the  evaluation  by  the  Polaris  Board  of  other  possible  strategic  alternatives  to  maximize 
shareholder value, and the perceived risks to Polaris (many of which are beyond Polaris’ control) 
associated with such alternatives and the timing and uncertainty of successfully accomplishing any 
of such alternatives, and the conclusion of the Polaris Board that none of those alternatives were 
reasonably  likely  to  present  superior  opportunities  for  Polaris,  or  reasonably  likely  to  create 
greater value for Polaris Securityholders in comparison to the Arrangement.
In the course of its deliberations, the Polaris Board also identified and considered a variety of risks, including, but 
not limited to:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
the risks to Polaris if the Arrangement is not completed, including the costs incurred in pursuing 
the Arrangement;
as Polaris Securityholders (excluding Polaris Optionholders) will receive GTO Shares based on 
fixed  exchange  ratios,  GTO  Shares  received  by  Polaris  Securityholders  (excluding  Polaris 
Optionholders) under the Arrangement may have a market value lower than expected;
the issue of GTO Shares under the Arrangement and their subsequent sale may cause the market 
price of GTO Shares to decline;
the conditions contained in the Arrangement Agreement regarding GTO and Western’s obligation 
to  complete  the  Arrangement,  and  the  conditions  contained  in  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement 
regarding Ram’s obligation to complete the transaction contemplated thereby; and
the limitations contained in the Arrangement Agreement on the ability of Polaris to solicit further 
expressions of interest from third parties.
The  foregoing  discussion  of  the  information  and  factors  considered  by  the  Polaris  Board  is  not  intended  to  be 
exhaustive  but  summarizes  the  material  factors  considered  by  the  Polaris  Board.  The  Polaris  Board  collectively 
reached its decision with respect to the Arrangement in light of the factors described above and other factors that 
each member of the Polaris Board considered appropriate.
In reaching its determination to approve and recommend the Arrangement, the Polaris Board did not find it useful or 
practicable to, and did not, quantify, rank or otherwise attempt to make any specific assessments of, or otherwise 
assign any relative or specific weight to, the factors that were considered. The Polaris Board’s determination and 
recommendation were made after consideration of all of the factors relating to the Arrangement and in light of their 
own knowledge of the business, financial condition and prospects of Polaris and were based upon the advice of the 
financial and legal advisors to Polaris and the Polaris Special Committee. Individual directors may have assigned or 
given different weights to different factors.
The  Polaris  Board  unanimously  recommends  that  the  Polaris  Securityholders  vote  in  favour  of  the 
Arrangement.  The contents and delivery of this Information Circular have been approved by the Polaris 
Board.
Recommendation of the Western Board
In reaching its decision to approve the Arrangement and to recommend to Western Securityholders that they vote for 
the  Western  Arrangement  Resolution,  the  Western  Board  obtained  advice  from  financial  and  legal  advisors  and 
received  the  recommendation  of  the  Western  Special  Committee.  The  Western  Board  carefully  considered  all 
aspects of the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement and considered a number of factors in concluding that
62
the  Arrangement  is  in  the  best  interests  of  Western  and  that,  based  upon  the  Western  Fairness  Opinion,  the 
Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Western Securityholders, including the following:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
(i)
(j)
(k)
(l)
the reasons outlined under “Benefits of and Reasons for the Arrangement” above;
the Western Fairness Opinion;
Western  Securityholders  are  expected  to  own  approximately  13.3%  of  the  GTO  Shares  upon 
completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition and, through ownership of GTO Shares, 
will continue to participate in any increase in the value of Western’s current projects.  In addition, 
Western Securityholders will participate in any increase in the value of the assets currently owned 
by GTO, Polaris and Ram;
the Western Special Committee unanimously recommended that the Western Board approve the 
Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement;
Supporting Securityholders and Mr. Kenneth MacLeod holding approximately 42.6% of Western 
Shares  and  100%  Western  Warrants,  have  agreed  to  vote  their  Western  Shares  and  Western 
Warrants, as the case may be, in favour of the Western Arrangement Resolution;
the  requirement  for  approval  by  66(cid:1152)%  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  Western  Securityholders 
represented at the Western Meeting in person or by proxy;
the requirement for approval by a simple majority of the votes cast by Western Shareholders after 
excluding the votes of “interested persons” (as defined in MI 61-101) represented at the Western 
Meeting in person or by proxy;
the fact that Western Shareholders that do not approve of the Arrangement may exercise Dissent 
Rights;
that the Arrangement will only become effective if, after hearing from all interested parties who 
choose  to  appear  before  it,  and  after  considering  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement,  the  Court 
approves it;
the fact that Western was unable to raise equity financing on satisfactory terms in order to service 
its indebtedness;
under  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  the  Western  Board  remains  able  to  respond,  in  accordance  
with its fiduciary duties, to an Acquisition Proposal that such directors determine could reasonably 
be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and
the  evaluation  by  the  Western  Board  of  other  possible  strategic  alternatives  to  maximize 
shareholder  value,  and  the  perceived  risks  to  Western  (many  of  which  are  beyond  Western’s 
control)  associated  with  such  alternatives  and  the  timing  and  uncertainty  of  successfully 
accomplishing  any  of  such  alternatives,  and  the  conclusion  of  the  Western  Board  that  none  of 
those  alternatives  were  reasonably  likely  to  present  superior  opportunities  for  Western,  or 
reasonably  likely  to  create  greater  value  for  Western  Securityholders  in  comparison  to  the 
Arrangement.
In the course of its deliberations, the Western Board also identified and considered a variety of risks, including, but 
not limited to:
(a)
the risks to Western if the Arrangement is not completed, including the costs incurred in pursuing 
the  Arrangement,  the  diverting  of  significant  management  attention  away  from  the  conduct  of 
Western’s  business,  and  the  uncertainty  that  current  and  prospective  Western  employees  may
63
experience  concerning  their  future  roles  with  Western  following  successful  completion  of  the 
Arrangement, which may adversely affect Western’s ability to attract or retain key management 
and other personnel;
as Western Shareholders will receive GTO Shares based on a fixed exchange ratio, GTO Shares 
received by Western Shareholders under the Arrangement may have a market value lower than 
expected;
the issue of GTO Shares under the Arrangement and their subsequent sale may cause the market 
price of GTO Shares to decline;
the conditions contained in the Arrangement Agreement regarding GTO and Polaris’ obligation to 
complete  the  Arrangement,  and  the  conditions  contained  in  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement 
regarding Ram’s obligation to complete the transaction contemplated thereby; and
the limitations contained in the Arrangement Agreement on the ability of Western to solicit further 
expressions of interest from third parties.

Arrangement.  The contents and delivery of this Information Circular have been approved by the Western 
Board.

or  are  likely  to  be  available;  (2) (after  consultation  with  its  financial  advisor) 
would,  if  consummated  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  result  in  a  transaction

thereto; or
(vi)
(vii)
comply with CSA Multilateral Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids and 
OSC  Rule  62-504  –  Take-Over  Bids  and  Issuer  Bids  (as  applicable)  relating  to  the 
provision of directors’ circulars and make appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to 
its securityholders; and
accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal 
from  a  third  party,  but  only  if  prior  to  such  acceptance,  recommendation,  approval  or 
implementation,  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Receiving  Party  shall  have  concluded  in 
good  faith,  after  considering  all  proposals  to  adjust  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
Arrangement  Agreement  as  contemplated  by  section 3.4(c)  of  the  Arrangement 
Agreement and after receiving the advice of outside counsel as reflected in minutes of the 
board of directors of such Party, that the taking of such action is necessary for the board 
of  directors  in  discharge  of  its  fiduciary  duties  under  Applicable  Laws  and  such  Party 
complies with its obligations set forth in section 3.4(c) of the Arrangement Agreement  
and  terminates  the  Arrangement  Agreement  in  accordance  with  section 9.1  of  the 
Arrangement Agreement, as applicable; and

Parties (the “Responding Parties”), orally and in writing, at least 72 hours advance notice of any 
decision by its board of directors to accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to 
implement  a  Superior  Proposal,  which  notice  shall  confirm  that  the  board  of  directors  of  the 
Receiving Party has determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, 
shall identify the third party making the Superior Proposal and shall provide a true and complete 
copy thereof and any amendments thereto. During such 72 hour period, the Receiving Party agrees 
not  to  accept,  recommend,  approve  or  enter  into  any  agreement  to  implement  such  Superior 
Proposal and not to release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions 
and  shall  not  withdraw,  redefine,  modify  or  change  its  recommendation  in  respect  of  the 
Arrangement. In addition, during such 72 hour period the Receiving Party shall and shall cause its 
financial  and  legal  advisors  to,  negotiate  in  good  faith  with  the  Responding  Parties  and  their 
financial  and  legal  advisors  to  make  such  adjustments  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Arrangement  as  would  enable  the  Receiving  Party  to  proceed 
with the Arrangement as amended rather than the Superior Proposal. In the event the Responding 
Parties propose to amend the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement to provide that the 
securityholders of the Receiving Party (the “Receiving Party Securities”) shall receive a value 
per Receiving Party Security equal to or having a value greater than the value per Receiving Party 
Security provided in the Superior Proposal and so advises the board of directors of the Receiving 
Party prior to the expiry of such 72 hour period, the board of directors of the Receiving Party shall 
not accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such Superior Proposal 
and shall not release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and 
shall enter into an amendment of the Arrangement Agreement to reflect such proposed amendment 
and  shall  not  withdraw,  redefine,  modify  or  change  its  recommendation  in  respect  of  the 
Arrangement.

subject to filing with the Court a notice of their intention in accordance with the British Columbia Rules of Civil 
Procedure, serving such notice setting out the basis for opposition and a copy of the materials to be used to oppose 
the application upon the solicitors of GTO, Polaris and Western and upon all other parties who have filed a notice of 
appearance before 4:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on October 15, 2009. A copy of the petition for the Final Order is 
attached as Appendix G to this Information Circular.
Each of GTO, Polaris and Western have been advised by their respective counsel that the Court has broad discretion 
under  the  BCBCA  when  making  orders  with  respect  to  the  Arrangement  and  that  the  Court,  in  hearing  the 
application  for  the  Final  Order,  will  consider,  among  other  things,  the  fairness  of  the  Arrangement  to  the 
Securityholders  and  any  other  interested party  as  the  Court determines  appropriate.   The  Court  may  approve  the 
Arrangement either as proposed or as amended in any manner the Court may direct, subject to compliance with such 
terms and conditions, if any, as the Court may determine appropriate.
The offer and sale of the GTO Securities issuable in exchange for Securities pursuant to the Arrangement have not 
been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act, and such securities will be issued in reliance upon the exemption 
from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act provided by section 3(a)(10) thereof.  The Final Order is required 
for the Arrangement to become effective, and the Court has been advised that if the terms and conditions of the 
Arrangement are approved by the Court pursuant to the Final Order, the GTO Securities issuable in exchange for 
Securities pursuant to the Arrangement will not require registration under the 1933 Act, pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) 
thereof.  See “The Arrangement – Securities Law Considerations – U.S. Securities Laws”.
Regulatory Approvals
It  is  a  condition  to  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  that  all  necessary  regulatory  approvals  shall  have  been 
completed or obtained. There are no material filings, consents or approvals required to be made with, applicable to, 
or  required  to  be  received  from  any  Governmental  Authority  or  other  regulatory  body  in  connection  with  the 
Arrangement, other than the Final Order.
Timing
Subject to all conditions precedent to the Arrangement as set forth in the Arrangement Agreement being satisfied or 
waived by the appropriate Party, the Arrangement will become effective upon the filing with the BC Registrar of a 
copy of the Final Order and the Arrangement Filings.  If the Arrangement Resolutions are approved at the Meetings 
as required by the Interim Order, GTO, Polaris and Western will apply to the Court for the Final Order approving 
the  Arrangement.    If  the  Final  Order  is obtained on October 19,  2009,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  the 
Parties and all other conditions specified in the Arrangement Agreement are satisfied or waived, the Parties expect 
the  Effective  Date  will  be  on  or  about  October  19,  2009.    The  Effective  Date  could  be  delayed,  however,  for  a 
number of reasons, including an objection before the Court in the hearing of the application for the Final Order.  It is 
a condition to the completion of the Arrangement that the Arrangement shall have become effective on or prior to 
the Outside Date, being November 4, 2009.
Stock Exchange Listings
The  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares  are  listed  and  posted  for  trading  on  NEX  under  the  symbol  “GTR.H”,  the 
Polaris Shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSX under the symbol “GEO” and the Western Shares are

It is a condition to the completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition that the TSX shall have approved 
the listing of all of the GTO Shares issuable pursuant to the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition.  An application 
has been made to list the new GTO Shares on the TSX upon completion of the Arrangement. Such listing will be 
conditional upon New GTO fulfilling all the requirements of the TSX.
Procedure for Exchange of Securities
Letters of Transmittal
(collectively,
the
and  Western  Warrantholders
A Letter of Transmittal has been sent to the registered Polaris Shareholders, Polaris Preferred Shareholders, Polaris 
“Depositing 
Warrantholders,  Western  Shareholders 
Securityholders”) with this Information Circular. The Letter of Transmittal sets out the procedure to be followed by 
Depositing  Securityholders  to  deposit  their  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares,  Polaris  Warrants,  Western 
Shares and Western Warrants (collectively, the “Deposited Securities”), as the case may be. If the Arrangement 
becomes  effective,  in  order  to  receive  the  GTO  Shares  in  exchange  for  the  Deposited  Securities  to  which  the 
Depositing Securityholder is entitled under the Plan of Arrangement, a Depositing Securityholder must deliver the 
applicable Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with certificate(s) representing its 
Deposited Securities and all other required documents to the Depositary at the address set forth in the applicable 
Letter  of  Transmittal.  It  is  each Depositing  Securityholder’s  responsibility  to  ensure that  the  applicable  Letter of 
Transmittal is received by the Depositary. If the Arrangement is not completed, the applicable Letter of Transmittal 
will be of no effect and the Depositary will return all certificates representing Deposited Securities to the holders 
thereof as soon as practicable at the address specified in the Letter of Transmittal. Depositing Securityholders whose 
Deposited  Securities  are  registered  in  the  name  of  a  broker,  dealer,  bank,  trust  company  or  other  nominee  must 
contact their nominee to deposit their Deposited Securities.
Depositing  Securityholders  are  encouraged  to  deliver  a  properly  completed  and  duly  executed  Letter  of 
Transmittal together with the relevant certificate(s) to the Depositary as soon as possible.
The  use  of  mail  to  transmit  certificates  representing  Deposited  Securities  and  the  applicable  Letter  of 
Transmittal  is  at  each  holder’s  risk.    Each  of  Polaris  and  Western  recommend  that  such  certificates  and 
documents be delivered by hand to the Depositary and a receipt therefor be obtained or that registered mail 
be used and appropriate insurance be obtained.
Lost Securities
In the event any certificate, which immediately before the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding GTO 
Pre-Consolidation  Shares,  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares,  Polaris  Warrants,  Western  Shares  or  Western 
Warrants that is to be exchanged pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making 
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will 
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the GTO Shares to which such person is entitled in 
respect  of  the  securities  represented  by  such  lost,  stolen,  or  destroyed  certificate  pursuant  to  the  Plan  of 
Arrangement.  When authorizing such issuances in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person 
to  whom  the  GTO  Shares  is  to  be  issued  will,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the  issuance  thereof,  give  a  bond 
satisfactory to GTO, Western and Polaris and their respective transfer agents in such sum as GTO, Western and 
Polaris may direct or otherwise indemnify GTO, Western and Polaris in a manner satisfactory to them, against any 
claim that may be made against one or all of them with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or 
destroyed.
Withholding Rights
GTO and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any 
holder of Western Securities or Polaris Securities, as applicable, such amounts as GTO or the Depositary is required 
to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, or any Applicable Laws related to Taxes in 
each case, as amended.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all 
purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the Western Securities or Polaris Securities, as applicable, in
82
respect  of  which  such  deduction  and  withholding  was  made,  provided  that  such  withheld  amounts  are  actually 
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
Cancellation of Rights After Six Years
Any  certificate  which  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Date  represented  outstanding  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris 
Preferred  Shares,  Polaris  Warrants,  Western  Shares  and  Western  Warrants  that  have  not  been  surrendered  on  or 
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date, shall cease to represent any claim against or interest of any kind 
or nature in GTO, Polaris, Western or the Depositary.
Right of Dissent
Shareholders  who  wish  to  dissent  should  take  note  that  strict  compliance  with  the  Dissent  Procedures  is 
required.
Every Registered Shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair value of the holder’s GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, 
Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  or  Western  Shares,  as  the  case  may  be,  provided  that  the  holder  duly 
dissents  to  the  Arrangement  and  the  Arrangement  becomes  effective.  Shareholders  who  are  not  Registered 
Shareholders and who wish to exercise Dissent Rights must arrange for the Registered Shareholder holding their 
GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares or Western Shares, as the case may be, to 
deliver  the  Notice  of  Dissent.  The  Dissent  Rights  are  those  rights  pertaining  to  the  right  to  dissent  from  the 
applicable Arrangement Resolution that are contained in sections 237 to 247 of the BCBCA, as modified by the 
Interim Order, the Final Order and the Plan of Arrangement. A Shareholder is not entitled to exercise Dissent Rights 
if the holder votes any GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares or Western Shares, 
as applicable, in favour of the applicable Arrangement Resolution.
A Registered Shareholder who intends to exercise Dissent Rights must deliver a written notice of dissent (a “Notice 
of Dissent”) to:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
in the case of GTO, to GTO c/o its counsel, Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, 1000, 400 – 3rd Avenue S.W., 
Calgary, Alberta  T2P 4H2, Attention: Melinda Park;
in the case of Polaris, to Polaris, 200 King Street West, Suite 1705, Toronto, Ontario  M5H 3T4, Attention: 
Chief Financial Officer; and
in the case of Western, to Western c/o its counsel, Farris, Vaughan, Wills & Murphy LLP, 25th Floor, 700 
West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1B3, Attention: Trevor Scott;
to be received on or before 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) at least two business days before the applicable Meeting or, 
in case of adjournment or postponement, no later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the day that is two business 
days  before  the  applicable  reconvened  Meeting.  The  Notice  of  Dissent  must  set  out  the  number  of  GTO  Pre-
Consolidation  Shares,  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  or  Western  Shares,  as  applicable,  held  by  the 
Dissenter. Shareholders who are not Registered Shareholders and wish to exercise Dissent Rights must arrange for 
the Registered Shareholder holding their GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares or 
Western Shares, as the case may be, to deliver the Dissent Notice.
A  brief  summary  of  the  Dissent  Procedures  is  set  out  below.  This  summary  does  not  purport  to  provide  a 
comprehensive statement of the procedures to be followed by a dissenting Shareholder who seeks payment of the 
fair value of the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares or Western Shares, as the 
case may be, held and is qualified in its entirety by reference to sections 237 to 247 of the BCBCA, as modified by 
the Interim Order, the Final Order and the Plan of Arrangement. Sections 237 to 247 of the BCBCA are reproduced 
in Appendix Q to this Information Circular. The Dissent Procedures must be strictly adhered to and any failure by a 
Shareholder  to  do  so  may  result  in  the  loss  of  that  holder’s  Dissent  Rights.  Accordingly,  each  Shareholder  who 
wishes to exercise Dissent Rights should carefully consider and comply with the Dissent Procedures and consult 
such holder’s legal advisers.
83
The delivery of a Notice of Dissent does not deprive a Shareholder of the right to vote at the applicable Meeting on 
the applicable Arrangement Resolution. A vote against the applicable Arrangement Resolution, whether in person or 
by proxy, does not constitute a Notice of Dissent. A Shareholder is not entitled to exercise the Dissent Right with 
respect  to  any  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares,  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  or  Western  Shares,  as 
applicable, if the Shareholder votes in favour of the applicable Arrangement Resolution. A Shareholder, however, 
may vote as a proxyholder for another Shareholder whose proxy required an affirmative vote, without affecting the 
right of the proxyholder to exercise Dissent Rights.
If the applicable Arrangement Resolution is passed at the applicable Meeting, GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case 
may be, must send by registered mail to every Dissenter, prior to the date set for the hearing of the Final Order, a 
notice  (“Notice  of  Intention”)  stating  that,  subject  to  receipt  of  the  Final  Order  and  satisfaction  of  the  other 
conditions set out in the Arrangement Agreement, GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case may be, intends to complete 
the Arrangement, and advising the Dissenter that if the Dissenter intends to proceed with its exercise of its Dissent 
Rights, it  must deliver to GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case  may be, within one month of the mailing of the 
Notice of Intention, a written statement containing the information specified in the Interim Order together with any 
certificates  representing  the  holder’s  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares,  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  or 
Western Shares, as applicable. If a Dissent Right is being exercised by someone other than the beneficial owner of 
the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, Polaris Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares or Western Shares, as the case may be, 
this written statement must be signed by such beneficial owner.
A Dissenter delivering such written statement may not withdraw from its dissent and, at the Effective Time, will be 
repurchased  by  the  issuing  Corporation  thereof,  as  applicable,  and  cancelled.  GTO,  Polaris  or  Western,  as 
applicable, will pay to each Dissenter the fair value agreed between GTO, Polaris or Western, as applicable, and the 
Dissenter for the Dissenting Securities. Either GTO, Polaris or Western or a Dissenter may apply to the Court if no 
agreement on the terms of the fair value of the Dissenting Securities is reached, and the Court may:
(a)
(b)
(c)
determine the fair value that the Dissenting Securities had immediately before the passing of the 
applicable Arrangement Resolution, or order that such value be established by arbitration or by 
reference to the registrar, or a referee of the Court;
join in the application each Dissenter who has not agreed with GTO, Polaris or Western, as the 
case may be, on the amount of the payout value of the Dissenting Securities; and
make consequential orders and give directions as it considers appropriate.
If a Dissenter fails to strictly comply with the requirements of the Dissent Rights set out in the Interim Order, it will 
lose its Dissent Rights, GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case may be, will return to the Dissenter the certificates 
representing the Dissenting Securities, if any, that were delivered to GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case may be, 
and if the Arrangement is completed, the Dissenter will be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the 
same terms as a Shareholder.
If a Dissenter strictly complies with the foregoing requirements of the Dissent Rights, but the Arrangement is not 
completed prior to the Outside Date, GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case may be, will return to the Dissenter the 
certificates, if any, delivered to GTO, Polaris or Western, as the case may be.
Shareholders should consult their legal advisors with respect to the legal rights available to them in relation 
to the Arrangement and the Dissent Rights. Shareholders should also note that the exercise of Dissent Rights 
can  be  complex,  time-consuming  and  expensive.  Dissent  rights  are  not  available  to  Polaris  Optionholders, 
Polaris Warrantholders, Polaris Debentureholders, Western Optionholders and Western Warrantholders.
The Arrangement Agreement provides that it is a condition precedent to the Arrangement that holders of not greater 
than  5%  of  each  of  the  outstanding  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares,  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  or 
Western Shares shall have exercised rights of dissent in respect of the Arrangement that have not been withdrawn as 
at the Effective Date. See “The Arrangement – Arrangement Agreement – Conditions to the Arrangement”.

Securities Law Considerations
Canadian Securities Laws
Issuance and Resale of GTO Securities Under Canadian Securities Laws
GTO Securities to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition will be issued in reliance on 
exemptions  from  prospectus  and  registration  requirements  of  applicable  securities  laws  of  the  various  applicable 
provinces in Canada and will generally not be subject to any restricted or hold period if the following conditions are 
met: (i) the trade is not a control distribution (as defined in applicable securities legislation); (ii) no unusual effort is 
made  to  prepare  the  market  or  to  create  a  demand  for  the  securities  that  are  the  subject  of  the  trade;  (iii)  no 
extraordinary commission or consideration is paid to a person in respect of the trade; and (iv) if the selling holder of 
GTO Securities is an Insider or an officer of GTO, the selling securityholder has no reasonable grounds to believe 
that GTO is in default of securities legislation.
It  is  a  condition  to  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  that  all  necessary  regulatory  approvals  shall  have  been 
completed or obtained, including the approval by the TSX of the listing of the GTO Shares, subject only to the filing 
of required documents.
Securityholders  should  consult  their  legal  advisors  with  respect  to  the  legal  rights  available  to  them  in 
relation to the Arrangement.
MI 61-101
If any of the “related parties”, as such term is defined in MI 61-101, of the Corporations is entitled to receive a 
“collateral benefit”, as such term is defined in MI 61-101, in connection with the Arrangement, the Arrangement 
will constitute a “business combination” for the purposes of MI 61-101.
If  the  Arrangement  constitutes  a  “business  combination”,  the  applicable  Arrangement  Resolution  will  require 
“minority approval” in accordance with MI 61-101. If “minority approval” is required, the applicable Arrangement 
Resolution will have to be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the applicable holders of “affected securities”, 
excluding those votes attaching to the applicable “affected securities” beneficially owned, or over which control or 
direction is exercised, by the “related parties” of the applicable Corporation who can be considered to be receiving a 
“collateral  benefit”  in  connection  with  the  Arrangement.  This  approval  is  in  addition  to  the  requirement  that  the 
applicable Arrangement Resolution must be approved by not less than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by the applicable 
Securityholders that vote in person or by proxy at the Meetings.
Certain officers of Western (each a “related party” under MI 61-101), namely Messrs. Smith, Drolet and Falcone 
and  Ms.  Khanuja,  have  entered  into  the  Employment  Agreements.  Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  such  Employment 
Agreements,  the  Arrangement  will  be  considered  to  be  a  change  of  control  of  Western,  which  may  trigger  the 
payment  of  certain  severance  amounts  to  the  officers.  The  receipt  of  severance  amounts  under  the  Employment 
Agreements may be considered to be “collateral benefits” for the purposes of MI 61-101. See “Interests of Certain 
Persons or Companies in the Arrangement – Western”.
As  a  result,  the  votes  attaching  to  the  Western  Shares  beneficially  owned,  or  over  which  control  or  direction  is 
exercised,  by Messrs.  Drolet  (243,000 Western Shares)  and  Falcone  (100,000 Western  Shares)  and Ms.  Khanuja 
(455,000 Western Shares), in the aggregate amount of 798,000 Western Shares, will be excluded in determining 
whether  minority  approval  of  the  Western  Arrangement  Resolution  has  been  obtained.  Mr.  Smith  does  not 
beneficially own, or exercise control or direction over, directly or indirectly, any of the Western Shares.
Skyberry  is  receiving  GTO  Shares  in  exchange  for  the  Polaris  Debentures  held  by  Skyberry  pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement.  As  Skyberry  is  a  person  that  has  beneficial  ownership  of,  or  control  or  direction  over,  directly  or 
indirectly,  securities  of  Polaris  that  carry  more  than  10%  of  the  voting  rights  attached  to  the  outstanding  voting 
securities of Polaris, Skyberry is considered a “related party” of Polaris. Accordingly, the receipt of the GTO Shares 
in exchange for the Polaris Debentures held by Skyberry is considered to be a “collateral benefit” for the purposes of
85
MI  61-101.  As  a  result,  the  votes  attaching  to  the  17,641,667  Polaris  Shares  beneficially  owned,  or  over  which 
control  or  direction  is  exercised,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  Skyberry  will  be  excluded  in  determining  whether 
minority approval of the Polaris Arrangement Resolution has been obtained.  See “Interests of Certain Persons or 
Companies in the Arrangement – Polaris”.
The  Polaris  Debentures  held  by  Skyberry  include  $6,900,000  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Polaris  Debentures 
transferred by Exploration Capital 2000 to an affiliate of Skyberry (an “interested party” for the purposes of MI 61-
101) on August 28, 2009, subsequent to the announcement of the Arrangement, in exchange for 9,323,064 Polaris 
Preferred Shares.  As  Exploration Capital 2000 is a person that has beneficial ownership of, or control or direction 
over,  directly  or  indirectly,  securities  of  Polaris  that  carry  more  than  10%  of  the  voting  rights  attached  to  the 
outstanding voting securities of Polaris, Exploration Capital 2000 is considered a “related party” of Polaris for the 
purposes  of  MI  61-101.  The  receipt  of  GTO  Shares  by  Exploration  Capital  2000  for  the  Polaris  Securities  (as 
discussed in the paragraph below) it received in exchange for its Polaris Debentures may be an indirect “collateral 
benefit” within the meaning of MI 61-101, equivalent to that which Exploration Capital 2000 would have received 
had  it  not  transferred  its  Polaris  Debentures  to  an  affiliate  of  Skyberry  subsequent  to  the  announcement  of  the 
Arrangement.  As a result, based on the information available to Polaris as at the date of this Information Circular, it 
has been determined that, absent the receipt of further information, the votes attaching to the 44,514,585 Polaris 
Shares  beneficially  owned,  or  over  which  control  or  direction  is  exercised,  directly  or  indirectly,  by  Exploration 
Capital 2000 will be excluded in determining whether minority approval of the Polaris Arrangement Resolution has 
been obtained.  See “Interests of Certain Persons or Companies in the Arrangement – Polaris”.
Upon  completion  of  the  exchange  of  Polaris  Debentures  for  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  on  August  28,  2009, 
Exploration Capital 2000 held a total of 22,059,064 Polaris Preferred Shares, of which 20,997,729 were converted 
into Polaris Shares on September 15, 2009 on a one-to-one basis in accordance with their terms.
Amalgamated International Holdings SA (“Amalgamated”) is receiving GTO Shares in exchange for the Western 
Warrants  held  by  Amalgamated  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement.  As  Amalgamated  is  a  person  that  has  beneficial 
ownership of, or control or direction over, directly or indirectly, securities of Western that carry more than 10% of 
the voting rights attached to the outstanding securities of Western, Amalgamated is considered a “related party” of 
Western.  Accordingly,  the  receipt  of  GTO  Shares  in  exchange  for  the  Western  Warrants  held  by  Western  is 
considered  to  be  a  “collateral  benefit”  for  the  purposes  of  MI  61-101.  As  a  result,  the  votes  attaching  to  the 
25,995,543  Western  Shares  beneficially  owned,  or  over  which  control  or  direction  is  exercised,  directly  or 
indirectly, by Amalgamated will be excluded in determining whether minority approval of the Western Arrangement 
Resolution has been obtained. See “Interests of Certain Persons or Companies in the Arrangement – Western”.
U.S. Securities Laws
The offer and sale of the GTO Securities issuable in exchange for Securities pursuant to the Arrangement have not 
been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act, and such securities will be issued in reliance upon the exemption 
from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act provided by section 3(a)(10) thereof.  Section 3(a)(10) exempts 
the offer and sale of securities issued in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities from the general 
requirement of registration where the terms and conditions of the issuance and exchange of such securities have 
been approved by any court of competent jurisdiction, after a hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions 
of the issuance and exchange at which all persons to whom the securities will be issued have the right to appear and 
receive timely notice thereof.  The Court is authorized to conduct a hearing at which the fairness of the terms and 
conditions of the Arrangement will be considered.  The Court granted the Interim Order on September 17, 2009 and, 
subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Arrangement  by  Securityholders,  a  hearing  on  the  Arrangement  will  be  held  on 
October 19, 2009 by the Court.  See “The Arrangement – Procedure for the Arrangement To Become Effective – 
Court Approval”.
The  GTO  Securities  issuable  in  exchange  for  Securities  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  will  be  freely  transferable 
under U.S. federal securities laws, except by persons who are “affiliates” of New GTO after the Arrangement or 
were affiliates of GTO within 90 days prior to the completion of the Arrangement.  Persons who may be deemed to 
be  “affiliates”  of  an  issuer  generally  include  individuals  or  entities  that  control,  are  controlled  by,  or  are  under 
common control with, the issuer, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and 
generally include executive officers and directors of the issuer as well as principal shareholders of the issuer.
86
Any resale of such GTO Securities by such an affiliate (or, if applicable, former affiliate) may be subject to the 
registration  requirements  of  the  1933  Act,  absent  an  exemption  therefrom.  Subject  to  certain  limitations,  such 
affiliates  (and  former  affiliates)  may  immediately  resell  such  GTO  Securities  outside  the  United  States  without 
registration under the 1933 Act pursuant to Regulation S.  If available, such affiliates (and former affiliates) may 
also resell such GTO Securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the 1933 Act.  Unless certain conditions are satisfied, 
Rule 144 is not available for resales of securities of issuers that have ever had (i) no or nominal operations and (ii) 
no or nominal assets other than cash and cash equivalents.  Prior to completion of the Arrangement, GTO may be 
deemed  to  be  such  an  issuer.    Therefore,  Rule  144  under  the  1933  Act  may  be  unavailable  for  resales  of  GTO 
Securities unless and until New GTO has satisfied the applicable conditions.  In general terms, the satisfaction of 
such conditions would require New GTO to have been a registrant under the 1934 Act for at least 12 months, to be 
in compliance with its reporting obligations thereunder, and to have filed certain information with the SEC at least 
12 months prior to the intended resale.
Section  3(a)(10)  of  the  1933  Act  does  not  exempt  the  issuance  of  securities  upon  the  exercise  or  conversion  of 
securities that were issued pursuant to section 3(a)(10).  Therefore, the GTO Shares issuable upon the exercise of 
GTO Options may not be issued in reliance upon section 3(a)(10), and such GTO Options may be exercised only 
pursuant  to  an  exemption  or  exclusion  from  the  registration  requirements  of  the  1933  Act  and  applicable  state 
securities laws.
The foregoing discussion is only a general overview of certain requirements of United States federal securities laws 
applicable to the resale and exercise of GTO Securities received upon completion of the Arrangement.  All holders 
of such GTO Securities are urged to consult with counsel to ensure that the resale and exercise of their GTO 
Securities complies with applicable securities legislation.
The Polaris Continuation
RELATED TRANSACTIONS
In connection with the Arrangement, Polaris intends to continue from the Yukon Territory to the Province of British 
Columbia  under  the  BCBCA.  Accordingly,  at  the  Polaris  Meeting,  Polaris  Shareholders  and  Polaris  Preferred 
Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, to approve the Polaris Continuation Resolution. 
The  Polaris  Continuation  Resolution  must  be  approved  by  at  least  66(cid:1152)%  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  Polaris 
Shareholders  and  Polaris  Preferred  Shareholders  present  in  person  or  by  proxy  at  the  Polaris  Meeting.  The
Arrangement is conditional upon the Polaris Continuation Resolution being approved at the Polaris Meeting 
and the Polaris Continuation being effected.  In the event the Polaris Continuation has been effected and the 
Arrangement is not subsequently completed, the Polaris Continuation Resolution also authorizes the Polaris 
Board to discontinue from British Columbia into the Yukon under section 190 of the YBCA.
There will be no change in the name of Polaris or its directors and officers as a result of the Polaris Continuation. 
The  rights  and  privileges  of  shareholders  of  a  corporation  governed  by  the  BCBCA  are,  in  many  instances, 
comparable to those of shareholders of a corporation governed by the BCBCA. However, there are some important 
differences.  See  “Matters  to  be  Approved  at  the  Meetings  –  The  Polaris  Meeting”  for  a  description  of  the 
differences between the YBCA and the BCBCA.
Each registered Polaris shareholder has a right to dissent in respect of the Polaris Continuation Resolution 
pursuant to section 193 of the YBCA. A registered Polaris shareholder who dissents in the manner required 
by the YBCA with respect to the Polaris Continuation Resolution is entitled to be paid the fair value of such 
registered Polaris shareholder’s shares in accordance with the YBCA, subject to certain conditions. The right 
to dissent in respect of the Polaris Continuation are described in this Information Circular and in Appendix 
R to this Information Circular. Failure to strictly comply with requirements set forth in section 193 of the 
YBCA may result in the loss of any right to dissent.  See “Matters to be Approved at the Meetings – The Polaris 
Meeting”.

without  limitation,  through  any  advisors or  other parties on  its behalf),  if  any, with  any  parties 
conducted  before  the  date  of  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  with  respect  to  any  Acquisition 
Proposal and shall immediately request the return or destruction of all information provided to any

employees or any financial advisor, expert or other representative retained by it) seeks to 
initiate such discussions or negotiations and, subject to execution of a confidentiality and 
standstill  agreement  (provided  that  such  confidentiality  agreement  shall  provide  for 
disclosure  thereof  (along  with  all  information  provided  thereunder)  to  the  other 
Acquisition  Parties  as  set  out  below),  may  furnish  to  such  third  party  information 
concerning such Acquisition Party and its business, properties and assets, in each case if, 
and only to the extent that:
(A)
(B)
the  third  party  has  first  made  a  written  unsolicited  bona  fide  Acquisition 
Proposal which the board of directors of such Acquisition Party determines in 
good  faith:  (1) that  funds  or  other  consideration  necessary  for  the  Acquisition 
Proposal are or are likely to be available; (2) (after consultation with its financial 
advisor)  would,  if  consummated  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  result  in  a 
transaction financially superior for securityholders of the Ram Receiving Party 
(as  defined  below)  than  the  transaction  contemplated  by  the  Share  Purchase 
Agreement; and (3) after receiving the advice of outside counsel as reflected in 
minutes of the board of directors of such Acquisition Party, that the taking of 
such action is necessary for the board of directors in discharge of its fiduciary 
duties under Applicable Laws (a “Ram Superior Proposal”); and
prior to furnishing such information to or entering into or participating in any 
such  discussions  or  negotiations  with  such  third  party,  such  Acquisition  Party 
provides  prompt  notice  to  the  other  Acquisition  Parties  to  the  effect  that  it  is 
furnishing  information  to  or  entering  into  or  participating  in  discussions  or 
negotiations  with  such  person  or  entity  together  with  a  copy  of  the 
confidentiality agreement referenced above and if not previously provided to the 
other Acquisition Parties, copies of all information provided to such third party 
concurrently  with  the  provision  of  such  information  to  such  third  party,  and 
provided further that such Acquisition Party shall notify the other Acquisition 
Parties orally and in writing of any inquiries, offers or proposals with respect to 
a Ram Superior Proposal (which written notice shall include, without limitation, 
a copy of any such proposal (and any amendments or supplements thereto), the 
identity  of  the  person  making  it,  if  not  previously  provided  to  the  other 
Acquisition Parties, copies of all information provided to such third party and all 
other information reasonably requested by the other Acquisition Parties), within 
24 hours of the receipt thereof, shall keep the other Acquisition Parties informed 
of the status and details of any such inquiry, offer or proposal and answer the 
other Acquisition Parties’ questions with respect thereto; or
89
(c)
(vi)
(vii)
comply with CSA Multilateral Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids and 
OSC  Rule  62-504  –  Take-Over  Bids  and  Issuer  Bids  (as  applicable)  relating  to  the 
provision of directors’ circulars and make appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to 
its securityholders; and
accept,  recommend,  approve  or  enter  into  an  agreement  to  implement  a  Ram  Superior 
Proposal  from  a  third  party,  but  only  if  prior  to  such  acceptance,  recommendation, 
approval or implementation, the board of directors of the Ram Receiving Party shall have 
concluded in good faith, after considering all proposals to adjust the terms and conditions 
of the Share Purchase Agreement as contemplated by section 4.4(c) of the Share Purchase 
Agreement and after receiving the advice of outside counsel as reflected in minutes of the 
board of directors of such Acquisition Party, that the taking of such action is necessary 
for the board of directors in discharge of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws and 
such  Acquisition  Party  complies  with  its  obligations  set  forth  in  section 4.4(c)  of  the 
Share Purchase Agreement and terminates the Share Purchase Agreement in accordance 
with section 9.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement, as applicable.
in the event an Acquisition Party is in receipt of a Ram Superior Proposal (a “Ram Receiving
Party”), it shall give the other Acquisition Parties (the “Ram Responding Parties”), orally and in 
writing,  at  least  72  hours  advance  notice  of  any  decision  by  its  board  of  directors  to  accept, 
recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a Ram Superior Proposal, which 
notice shall confirm that the board of directors of the Ram Receiving Party has determined that 
such  Acquisition  Proposal  constitutes  a  Ram  Superior  Proposal,  shall  identify  the  third  party 
making  the  Superior  Proposal  and  shall  provide  a  true  and  complete  copy  thereof  and  any 
amendments thereto. During such 72 hour period, the Ram Receiving Party agrees not to accept, 
recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such Ram Superior Proposal and 
not to release the party making the Ram Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall 
not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect of the Arrangement or the 
transactions  contemplated  by  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement.  In  addition,  during  such  72  hour 
period the Ram Receiving Party shall and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate 
in good faith with the Ram Responding Parties and their financial and legal advisors to make such 
adjustments  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  as  would  enable  the 
Ram Receiving Party to proceed with the acquisition of the Purchased Shares as amended rather 
than the Ram Superior Proposal. In the event the Ram Responding Parties propose to amend the 
Share Purchase Agreement to provide that the securityholders of the Ram Receiving Party (the 
“Ram Receiving Party Securities”) shall receive a value per Ram Receiving Party Security equal 
to or having a value greater than the value per Ram Receiving Party Security provided in the Ram 
Superior Proposal and so advises the board of directors of the Ram Receiving Party prior to the 
expiry of such 72 hour period, the board of directors of the Ram Receiving Party shall not accept, 
recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such Superior Proposal and shall 
not release the party making the Ram Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall 
enter into an amendment of the Share Purchase Agreement to reflect such proposed amendment 
and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect of the Share 
Purchase Agreement.
Conditions of the Share Purchase Agreement
The  respective  obligations  of  the  Acquisition  Parties  to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by  the  Share 
Purchase Agreement are subject to a number of conditions which must be satisfied or waived in order for the Ram 
Acquisition  to  become  effective.  Such  conditions  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  Arrangement  having  been 
completed in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the TSX having approved the listing of 
all of the GTO Shares issuable pursuant to the Ram Acquisition and the Arrangement and such GTO Shares to be

Superior  Proposal  in  accordance  with  section  4.4(b)(vii)  of  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement, 
provided that the Purchaser has complied with its obligations set forth in section 4.4(c) thereof;
by Ram, in order to enter into a binding written definitive agreement to implement a Ram Superior

The Financing
On  August  20,  2009,  GTO  completed  the  Financing  pursuant  to  which  an  aggregate  of  59,800,000  Subscription 
Receipts were issued at a price of $3.00 per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of $179,400,000. The 
Escrowed Proceeds are being held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Subscription Receipt Agreement. 
Pursuant  to  the  Agency  Agreement,  the  Agents  will  receive  the  Agents’  Fee  in  consideration  for  their  services 
provided in connection with the Financing upon the Escrow Release Conditions having been satisfied. The Agents 
also received the GTO Broker’s Warrants in consideration for their services.
The Escrowed Proceeds, less the Agents’ Fee, will be released to GTO, or as otherwise directed by GTO, together 
with interest thereon, if, on or before 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Release Deadline, the Release Certificate is 
delivered to the Subscription Receipt Agent stating that the Release Event has occurred. Pursuant to the Subscription 
Receipt Agreement, the Release Event means the occurrence of the satisfaction of the following conditions prior to 
the Release Deadline:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
the GTO Shares being listed and posted for trading on the TSX;
receipt of conditional listing approval of the TSX for the GTO Shares underlying the Subscription 
Receipts and such GTO Shares not being subject to resale restrictions in Canada;
the  Plan  of  Arrangement  becoming  effective  resulting  in  the  automatic  exercise  of  the 
Subscription Receipts without further action on the part of the Subscription Receiptholders as one 
of the steps of the Plan of Arrangement;
the Business Combination being completed; and
GTO  and  Cormark,  on  its  own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  the  other  Agents,  acting  reasonably, 
delivering a joint notice to the Escrow Agent confirming that (i) all regulatory and other approvals 
required in respect of the sale and issuance of the Subscription Receipts have been obtained; and 
(ii) all other Escrow Release Conditions have been met or waived,
(collectively, the “Escrow Release Conditions”).
91
In the event the Release Event does not occur prior to the Release Deadline, the Subscription Receiptholder’s Funds, 
plus a pro rata share of any Earnings, less applicable withholding taxes, if any, shall be returned to the Subscription 
Receiptholders and the Subscription Receipts shall be deemed cancelled.
Upon the occurrence of the Release Event, each Subscription Receipt will be automatically exercised as a step in the 
Plan of Arrangement, for no additional consideration and without further action on the part of the holder, into one 
(1) GTO Share. Assuming completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, an aggregate of 59,800,000 
GTO Shares will be issued pursuant to exercise of the Subscription Receipts.
The net proceeds of the Financing are intended to be used to develop key projects of New GTO upon completion of 
the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, to repay debt of New GTO and for general working capital purposes. For 
a more detailed description of the use of proceeds of the Financing, see “Appendix O – Information Concerning New 
GTO”.
In connection with the closing of the Financing, the Locked-Up Shareholders entered into the Lock-Up Agreements 
with the Agents. Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreements, the Locked-Up Shareholders have agreed that, for a period 
of 12 months following the Release Conditions, not to, directly or indirectly, offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any 
GTO Shares (except that in the case of officers of New GTO other than Hezy Ram, GTO Shares acquired as a result 
of participation in the Financing shall not be subject to the Lock-Up Agreements).  See “Appendix O – Information 
Concerning New GTO”.

that  occurred  on  or  prior  to  the  Effective  Date.    Alternatively,  prior  to  the  Effective  Time,  Western  may,  at  its 
option, and shall, at the request of GTO, purchase prepaid non-cancellable run-off directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance providing coverage (on terms comparable to those contained in Western’s current insurance policies) for a 
period of up to six years from the Effective Date with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events 
which occur prior to the Effective Date.

The  constating  documents  of  Western  provide  for  the  indemnification  in  certain  circumstances  of  Western’s 
directors and officers. The Arrangement Agreement provides that GTO will ensure that the constating documents of 
Western, and any successor to Western, will contain provisions with respect to indemnification such that rights to 
indemnification  existing  in  favour  of  the  present  and  former  directors  and  officers  of  Western  will  survive  and 
continue  in  full  force  and  effect  and  without  modification,  and  GTO  will  cause  Western  and  any  successor  to 
Western to honour such rights of indemnification to the fullest extent possible with respect to actions or omissions 
of  such  present  and  former  directors  and  officers  of  Western  occurring  prior  to  the  Effective  Time,  such 
indemnification to continue in full force and effect and without modification for a period of not less than six years 
from the Effective Time.
Western has also entered into customary indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers. 
The Arrangement Agreement provides that GTO agrees that all indemnification rights existing as at the date of the 
Arrangement Agreement pursuant to any indemnification agreement in favour of Western’s directors and officers 
will survive the completion of the Arrangement and continue in full force and effect and without modification, and 
GTO  will  cause  Western  and  any  successor  to  Western  to  honour  such  rights  of  indemnification  and  indemnify 
present  and  former  directors  and  officers  of  Western  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  with  respect  to  actions  or 
omissions of the present and former directors and officers of Western occurring prior to the Effective Time, such 
indemnification to continue in full force and effect and without modification for a period of not less than six years 
from the Effective Time.
Employment Agreements
Western has entered into employment or consulting agreements with certain officers of Western or with companies 
controlled  by  such  officers  (collectively,  the  “Employment  Agreements”),  which  contain  control  change 
provisions.    The  completion  of  the  Arrangement  may  constitute  a  control  change  under  such  Employment 
Agreements, entitling such officers or the companies controlled by them to, assuming the other applicable conditions 
are satisfied, the payments described in this section.
Western has entered into a consulting agreement with Donald Smith for his services as the Interim Chief Financial 
Officer  and  Corporate  Secretary  of  Western.    If  within  six  months  following  a  control  change,  Mr.  Smith’s 
agreement  is  terminated by Western other than for just cause or is terminated by Mr. Smith for “good reason”, 
Western is obligated to pay Mr. Smith by way of a lump sum, if not yet paid, the amount of $12,500.  Such amount 
is otherwise payable to Mr. Smith if he is providing services to Western pursuant to his agreement on November 30, 
2009.
Western  has  entered  into  an  employment  agreement  with  Rupi  Khanuja  for  her  services  as  the  Chief  Financial 
Officer of Western.  If, within 18 months following a control change, the agreement is terminated by Western for 
other than just cause, disability or death or is terminated by Ms. Khanuja for “good reason”, then (i) Western is to 
pay to Ms. Khanuja by lump sum an amount equal to the compensation which would have otherwise been payable to 
Ms. Khanuja for the 12 month period following the date of termination, and (ii) all unexercised options are to be 
accelerated so as to become immediately exercisable in full.  Had Ms. Khanuja been terminated pursuant to this 
obligation on September 18, 2009, she would have received $156,000 (Ms. Khanuja does not currently hold any 
unvested options).  Ms. Khanuja commenced a leave from Western on November 1, 2008.
Western has entered into a consulting agreement with Drolet Energy Services L.L.C. (“DES”) for Thomas Drolet’s 
services as Chief Executive Officer of Western’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Western GeoPower Inc.  If, within 18 
months following a control change, the agreement is terminated by Western other than for just cause or death or is 
terminated by DES for “good reason”, then Western is to pay to DES by lump sum an amount equal to 12 months 
compensation at the rate in effect for the month immediately preceding the month in which the termination occurs.  
Had  DES  been  terminated  pursuant  to  this  obligation  on  September  18,  2009,  DES  would  have  received 
US$180,000.
Western has entered into a consulting agreement with Domenic J. Falcone Associates, Inc. (“DFA”) for Domenic 
Falcone’s consulting services. Mr. Falcone is a director of Western. The agreement provides that in the event of a 
change of control during the term of the agreement, and the agreement is terminated, Western is to pay DFA six
95
months’ fees and any amounts due to DFA out of the bonus pool then accrued by DFA.  Had DFA been terminated 
pursuant to this obligation on September 18, 2009, DFA would have received US$90,000.
For the purposes of the Employment Agreements between Western and each of Mr. Smith, Ms. Khanuja and DES, 
“good  reason”  generally  includes:  (a)  an  assignment  of  duties  inconsistent  with  those  immediately  prior  to  the 
control  change  or  those  otherwise  specified  in  the  applicable  Employment  Agreement;  (b)  a  reduction  in 
compensation;  (c)  a  failure  to  continue  in  effect  the  employee’s/consultant’s  participation  in  any  Western  stock 
option  plan,  or  in  the  case  of  certain  Employment  Agreements,  other  applicable  benefit  plans,  in  which  the 
employee/consultant  was  participating  in  immediately  prior  to  the  control  change;  (d)  a  relocation  of  the 
employee/consultant  to  any  place  other  than  the  location  at  which  the  employee/consultant  performed  duties 
immediately  prior  to  the  control  change;  (e)  a  breach  of  the  Employment  Agreement;  or  (f)  in  the  case  of  the 
Employment  Agreements  with  Mr.  Smith  and  DES,  any  failure  by  Western  to  obtain  the  assumption  of  the 
Employment Agreement by any successor or assignee of Western.

CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
In the opinion of Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, counsel to GTO (“counsel”), the following is, as of the date hereof, a 
fair and adequate summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax consequences under the Tax Act in respect 
of  the  exchange  of  Polaris  Shares,  Polaris  Preferred  Shares  and  Western  Shares  (in  either  case,  “Shares”)  and 
Polaris Warrants and Western Warrants (in either case, “Warrants”) under the Arrangement, generally applicable to 
(a) Securityholders  who, for the  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act and  at  all  relevant  times,  hold  Shares  and Warrants  as 
capital property and are not and will not be affiliated with, and deal and will at arm’s length with, the Corporations 
and GTO.  Generally, Shares will be considered to be capital property to the holder thereof unless they are held in 
the course of carrying on a business of trading or dealing in securities or were acquired in one or more transactions 
considered to be an adventure in the nature of trade.
This  summary  is  not  applicable  to  a  Securityholder  (a)  that  is  a  “financial  institution”  or  a  “specified  financial 
institution” as defined in the Tax Act; (b) an interest in which would be a “tax shelter” or “tax shelter investment” as 
defined  in  the  Tax  Act;  (c)  who  is  exempt  from  tax  under  Part  I  of  the  Tax  Act;  (d)  to  whom  the  “functional 
currency”  reporting  rules  apply.    This  summary  does  not  address  the  income  tax  considerations  of  exercising, 
cancelling or otherwise disposing of any options, nor of the exercise or cancellation of Warrants to acquire Shares, 
nor does it address all issues relevant to Polaris Shareholders or Western Shareholders who acquired Shares on the 
exercise of options or warrants.  This summary does not address the income tax consequences of exchanging Polaris 
Debentures for GTO Shares nor the holding or disposing of GTO Shares.  Such Securityholders should consult 
their own tax advisors with respect to the Arrangement.
This summary is based on the current provisions of the Tax Act and the regulations thereunder (“Regulations”) that 
are in force as of the date hereof, all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act and the Regulations which have been 
publicly  announced  prior  to  the  date  hereof  (the “Proposed  Amendments”)  and  counsel’s  understanding  of  the 
current published administrative and assessing policies of the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”).  Other than the 
Proposed Amendments (for which no assurance can be given that such Proposed Amendments will be enacted as 
proposed, or at all), this summary does not take into account any future changes to law or administrative practice 
(whether  by  judicial,  administrative,  governmental  or  legislative  action),  and  is  not  exhaustive  of  all  possible 
Canadian federal income tax considerations applicable to a particular Securityholder and specifically does not take 
into account provincial, territorial or foreign income tax considerations, which may differ from the Canadian income 
tax consequences described herein.
This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal, 
business or tax advice to any particular Securityholder, and no representations with respect to the income tax 
consequences to any particular Securityholder are made herein.  Accordingly, holders of Securities should 
consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to their own particular circumstances, including their
97
place of residence and the application and effect of the income and other tax laws of any country, province, 
state or local tax authority.  Advance income tax rulings have not been sought from the CRA with respect to 
the tax consequences described below.
Securityholders Resident in Canada
The following portion of the summary is applicable only to holders of Shares or Warrants who, for the purposes of 
the Tax Act and any applicable income tax treaty, and at all relevant times, are resident or deemed to be resident in 
Canada (“Resident Securityholders”). Certain Resident Securityholders who are resident in Canada who may not 
otherwise be considered to hold their Shares as capital property may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to make 
an  irrevocable  election  in  accordance  with  subsection  39(4)  of  the  Tax  Act  in  respect  of  all  of  their  “Canadian 
securities” (as defined in the Tax Act) in order to have their Shares treated as capital property.
Exchange of Shares and Warrants for GTO Shares
Automatic Rollover
Under  Section  85.1  of  the  Tax  Act,  a  Resident  Securityholder  who  receives  GTO  Shares  in  exchange  for 
consideration consisting only of Shares, will generally be considered to have disposed of Shares for proceeds of 
disposition equal to the adjusted cost base of the Shares disposed of, will not recognize a capital gain or a capital 
loss in respect of the disposition and will be deemed to acquire their GTO Shares at a cost equal to the adjusted cost 
base of its Shares disposed of.  This cost will be averaged with the adjusted cost base of all other GTO Shares held 
by the Resident Securityholder as capital property for purposes of determining the adjusted cost base of each GTO 
Share held by such Resident Securityholder.  Section 85.1 will generally apply to the exchange provided that: (i) 
such  Resident  Securityholder  does  not  include  any  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  otherwise  determined  from  such 
exchange in computing the Resident Securityholder’s income; (ii) immediately before the exchange, the Resident 
Securityholder  and  GTO  are  dealing  with  each  other  at  arm’s  length;  (iii)  immediately  after  the  exchange,  such 
Resident Securityholder, persons with whom such holder does not deal at arm’s length or the holder together with 
such persons, does not control GTO or beneficially owns shares of GTO having a fair market value of more than 
50% of the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of GTO; (iv) a Joint Tax Election (as defined below) 
under subsection 85(1) or (2) is not filed in respect of the exchange of Shares; and (v) no consideration other than 
GTO Shares is received on the exchange.
A Resident Securityholder may choose to file a Canadian tax return recognizing a capital gain or capital loss on the 
exchange  of  Shares  for  GTO  Shares  under  the  Arrangement  in  such  holder’s  taxation  year  which  includes  the 
Effective  Date.    In  such  event,  the  holder  will  be  considered  to  have  disposed  of  the  Shares  for  proceeds  of 
disposition equal to the fair market value of the GTO Shares received on the exchange.  Such holder will realize a 
capital gain to the extent that such proceeds of disposition exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base of that 
holders’  Shares  immediately  before  the  exchange  and  any  reasonable  costs  of  disposition.    Any  Resident 
Securityholder that chooses to recognize a capital gain or capital loss will acquire the GTO Shares at a cost equal to 
the  fair  market  value  of  such  GTO  Shares  received  on  the  exchange.    The  cost  of  such  GTO  Shares  must  be 
averaged with the adjusted cost base of all other GTO Shares held by such Resident Securityholder to determine the 
adjusted cost base of each GTO Share to the holder.  Such capital gain (or capital loss) will be subject to the tax 
treatment described below under “Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses”. It is not possible for a Resident 
Securityholder to elect to recognize only a portion of the gain otherwise realized on a disposition of Shares using the 
mechanism  described  above.  Should  a  Resident  Securityholder  desire  to  recognize  only  a  portion  of  the  gain 
otherwise  realized  on  the  disposition  of  Shares,  such  holder  should  elect  to  exchange  Shares  under  a  Joint  Tax 
Election.
The automatic rollover provision in section 85.1 will not apply to the exchange of Warrants for GTO Shares. Unless 
holders thereof make a Joint Tax Election as described below, they will realize a capital gain or capital loss on the 
exchange, as described above.
98
Section 85 Election
A Resident Securityholder may be entitled to make a joint election (“Joint Tax Election”) with GTO pursuant to 
subsection 85(1) of the Tax Act (or, in the case of a holder that is a partnership, pursuant to subsection 85(2) of the 
Tax  Act)  with  respect  to  the  Shares  or  Warrants  and  thereby  obtain  a  full  or  partial  tax-deferred  “rollover”  for 
Canadian income tax purposes, depending on the amount specified in that election (the “Elected Amount”) and the 
adjusted  cost  base  to  the  Resident  Securityholder,  of  Shares  and  Warrants,  respectively,  immediately  before  the 
exchange.
Where a Resident Securityholder and GTO make a Joint Tax Election, the Resident Securityholder will be deemed 
to have disposed of the Shares or Warrants, as the case may be, for proceeds of disposition equal to the Elected 
Amount.  If such deemed proceeds of disposition are equal to the adjusted cost base to the Resident Securityholder 
of the Shares or Warrants immediately before the exchange, net of any reasonable costs incurred by the Resident 
Securityholder  in  connection  with  the  exchange,  the  Resident  Securityholder  will  not  realize  any  capital  gain  or 
capital loss on the exchange.
There  are  detailed  rules  in  the  Tax  Act  prescribing  limits  as  the  Elected  Amount.    Resident  Securityholders  are 
referred  to  Information  Circular  76-19R3  and  Interpretation  Bulletin  IT-291R3  issued  by  the  CRA  for  further 
information  respecting  the  Joint  Tax  Election.    Resident  Securityholders  wishing  to  make  a  Joint  Tax  Election 
should consult their own tax advisors in respect of whether to do so, to select the appropriate Elected Amount and in 
respect  of  any  applicable  provincial  tax  legislation.    The  comments  herein  with  respect  to  such  elections  are 
provided  for  general  information  only.    The  law  in  this  area  is  complex  and  contains  numerous  technical 
requirements.
In  general,  the  Elected  Amount  cannot  be  less  than  the  lesser  of:  (i)  the  adjusted  cost  base  to  the  Resident 
Securityholder of the Shares or Warrants, determined immediately before the time of the Arrangement; and (ii) the 
fair market value of the Shares or Warrants at the time of the Arrangement. In addition, the Elected Amount cannot 
exceed the fair market value of the Shares and Warrants at the time of the Arrangement.
A  Resident  Securityholder  who  does  not  make  a  valid  Joint  Tax  Election  and  is  not  eligible  for  the  automatic 
rollover under section 85.1 of the Tax Act will be considered to have disposed of each Share and each Warrant for 
proceeds of disposition equal to the fair market value of the GTO Shares received in exchange for the Shares and 
Warrants, respectively, which may give rise to a capital gain or a capital loss. The tax consequences or realizing a 
capital gain or a capital loss are discussed below. See “Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses” below.
In order to make a Joint Tax Election, among other requirements, a Resident Securityholder must provide to GTO, 
on or before March 31, 2010 (a) two signed copies of the necessary election form, duly completed including the 
details of the number of Shares and Warrants transferred and the applicable Elected Amount for the purposes of the 
election; and (b) a tax election filing authorization letter, if applicable (collectively, the “Tax Election Package”). 
Subject to the election form complying with the provisions of the Tax Act, the form will be executed by GTO and 
forwarded  by  mail  (within  30  days  after  the  receipt  thereof  by  GTO)  to  the  CRA  with  a  copy  to  the  Resident 
Securityholder.  GTO will not execute any Joint Election Package received after March 31, 2010. The relevant tax 
election form is CRA form T2057 (or if the Resident Securityholder is a partnership, CRA form T2058).
GTO will  make an election under section 85 of the Tax Act only at the Elected Amount selected by a Resident 
Securityholder and subject to the limitations set out in the Tax Act.  GTO will not be responsible for the proper 
completion of any election form.  GTO agrees only to execute any properly completed election received on or before 
March 31, 2010 and to forward such election by mail within 30 days after the receipt thereof to the CRA.  With the 
exception  of  such  execution  and  filing  of  the  election  by  GTO,  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  a  valid 
election,  including  selection  of  the  appropriate  Elected  Amount,  will  be  the  sole  responsibility  of  the  Resident 
Securityholder making the election.  Accordingly, GTO will not be responsible or liable for taxes, interest, penalties, 
damages or expenses resulting from the failure by anyone to properly complete any Joint Tax Election form or to 
properly file such form within the time prescribed and in the form prescribed under the Tax Act or the corresponding 
provisions of any applicable provincial tax legislation.
99
In order for the CRA to accept a Joint Tax Election form without a late filing penalty being payable by a Resident 
Securityholder, the Joint Tax Election, duly completed and signed by both the Resident Securityholder and GTO, 
must be received by the CRA on or before the day that is the earliest of the days which either GTO or the Resident 
Securityholder is required to file an income tax return for the taxation year in which the disposition occurs.  Resident 
Securityholders should determine whether they may be required to forward their Tax Election Package to GTO prior 
to March 31, 2010 to avoid late filing penalties.
It is the responsibility of the Resident Securityholder to provide to GTO any relevant provincial tax election forms.  
GTO  agrees  to  execute  any  properly  completed  provincial  election  forms  and  return  such  forms  to  the  Resident 
Securityholder for filing with the applicable tax authority.
Any Resident Securityholder who does not ensure that GTO has received a duly completed election on or before 
March 31, 2010 will not be able to benefit from the rollover provisions of the Tax Act.  Accordingly, all Resident 
Securityholders who wish to enter into an election with GTO should give their immediate attention to this matter.
Where Shares or Warrants are held in joint ownership and two or more of the co-owners wish to elect, one of the co-
owners designated for such purpose should provide GTO with a letter signed by each co-owner and the designated 
co-owner to complete, sign and file the Joint Tax Election and the designation and two signed copies of the Joint 
Tax Election (and where applicable the corresponding provincial form) for each co-owner along with a list of all co-
owners electing, which list should contain the address and social insurance number or tax account number of each 
co-owner.  Where the Shares or Warrants are held as partnership property, a partner designated by the partnership 
must  provide  GTO  with  two  signed  copies  of  the  Joint  Tax  Election,  including  (and  where  applicable  the 
corresponding provincial form) on behalf of all members of the partnership. Such form must be accompanied by a 
list containing the name, address, social insurance number or tax account number of each partner as well as the letter 
signed by each partner authorizing the designated partner to complete and file the form.
Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses
A Resident Securityholder who disposes of Shares or Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement and thereby realizes a 
capital gain or capital loss will be required to include one half of the amount of any such capital gain (a “taxable 
capital gain”) in income in the year in which such disposition occurs and will generally be entitled to deduct one half 
of the amount of any capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) against taxable capital gains realized in the year of 
disposition,  in  accordance  with  the  detailed  rules  of  the  Tax  Act.    Allowable  capital  losses  not  deducted  in  the 
taxation year in which they are realized may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation 
years or carried forward and deducted in any following taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in 
such taxation years, to the extent and under the circumstances as specified in the Tax Act.
The  amount  of  any  capital  loss  otherwise  arising  upon  the  disposition  of  a  Share  held  by  a  corporation  may  be 
reduced  by  certain  dividends  previously  received  or  deemed  to  have  been  received  on  such  Share  or  on  another 
share for which such Share was exchanged pursuant to certain tax deferred rollover provisions, all to the extent and 
under the circumstances prescribed by the Tax Act.  Similar rules may also apply in other circumstances, including 
where a corporation, trust or partnership is a member of a partnership or a beneficiary of a trust that owns such 
shares.    Shareholders  of  the  Corporations  to  whom  these  rules  may  be  relevant  should  consult  their  own  tax 
advisors.
Capital  gains  realized  by  an  individual  or  trust,  other  than  certain  specified  trusts,  may  give  rise  to  alternative 
minimum  tax  under  the  Tax  Act.  A  Resident  Securityholder  that  throughout  the  relevant  taxation  year  is  a 
“Canadian controlled private corporation”, as defined in the Tax Act, may be liable to pay an additional refundable 
tax of 6 (cid:1152)% on certain investment income, including taxable capital gains.
Securityholders’ Exercise of Dissent Rights
Dissenters  are  deemed  to  have  transferred  their  Shares  to  the  issuer  thereof  and  are  entitled  to  receive  a  cash 
payment from such issuer equal to the fair value of such Shares.  Such Resident Securityholders will generally be 
deemed to have received a taxable dividend equal to the amount by which such payment (excluding any portion
100
thereof  that  is  interest  awarded  by  a  court)  exceeds  the  “paid-up  capital”,  for  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act,  of  their 
Shares,  respectively.  Any  such  dividend  deemed  to  be  received  will  be  included  in  computing  the  Resident 
Securityholder’s income for purposes of the Tax Act and will be subject, among other things, to the gross-up and 
dividend tax credit provisions for individuals, the refundable tax under Part IV of the Tax Act applicable to “private 
corporations”  and  “subject  corporations”  (as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act),  and  the  deduction  in  computing  taxable 
income in respect of dividends received by taxable Canadian corporations. Any such deemed taxable dividends will 
not be designated by the issuer as “eligible dividends”. Dividends received or deemed to be received on the Shares 
by an individual or certain trusts may give rise to alternative minimum tax. Subsection 55(2) of the Tax Act provides 
that where certain corporate holders of shares receive a dividend or deemed dividend in specified circumstances, and 
such dividend is otherwise deductible in computing the corporate shareholder’s taxable income, all or part of the 
dividend may be treated as proceeds of disposition from the disposition of capital property and to have realized a 
capital gain or capital loss. See “Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses” above. Shareholders that are considering 
dissenting to the Arrangement should consult their own tax advisors for specific advice in this regard.
A dissenting Resident Securityholder will also be considered to have disposed of the Shares and will realize a capital 
gain (or capital loss) to the extent that the cash received, less any deemed dividend and net of any reasonable costs 
of disposition and exclusive of any interest, exceeds (or is less than) the Dissenter’s adjusted cost base of the Shares. 
The tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses is discussed above under the heading “Taxation of Capital Gains 
and Capital Losses”.
Securityholders Not Resident in Canada
This portion of the summary is generally applicable to a holder of Shares or Warrants who, for purposes of the Tax 
Act and at all relevant times, is not resident or deemed to be resident in Canada, does not use or hold and is not 
deemed  to  use  or  hold,  Shares  or  Warrants,  as  the  case  may  be,  in,  or  in  the  course  of,  carrying  on  business  in 
Canada  and  is  not  an  insurer  who  carries  on  an  insurance  business  in  Canada  and  elsewhere  (herein  a  “Non-
Resident Securityholder”). Special rules which are not discussed in this summary may apply to a Non-Resident 
Securityholder that is an insurer carrying on business in Canada and elsewhere.
Disposition of Shares or Warrants to GTO Pursuant to the Arrangement
Non-Resident Securityholders will be subject to taxation in respect of the disposition of their Shares or Warrants to 
GTO  only  to  the  extent  that  their  Shares  or  Warrants  constitute  or  are  deemed  to  constitute  “taxable  Canadian 
property” as defined in the Tax Act and the Non-Resident Securityholder is not afforded relief under an applicable 
tax treaty.  Generally, Shares will not constitute “taxable Canadian property” to a Non-Resident Securityholder at 
the Effective Time provided that (i) such Shares are listed on a designated stock exchange (which currently includes 
the TSX and TSXV) at the Effective Time and at no time during the sixty (60) month period immediately preceding 
the  exchange  did  the  Non-Resident  Securityholder,  persons  with  whom  the  Non-Resident  Securityholder  did  not 
deal at arm’s length for purposes of the Tax Act, or the Non-Resident Securityholder together with all such persons, 
own 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of shares in the capital stock of the Corporations; and 
(ii) such Shares are not otherwise deemed to be “taxable Canadian property. A Warrant will generally not constitute 
“taxable  Canadian  property”  to  a  Non-Resident  Securityholder  if:  (i)  the  shares  of  the  particular  Corporation  to 
which the Warrant relates are listed on a designated stock exchange as described above at the time of the exchange; 
and (ii) at no time during the sixty (60) month period preceding the exchange did that holder, persons with whom 
that holder did not deal at arms’ length for purposes of the Tax Act or the holder together with all such persons, own 
25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of shares in the capital of the particular Corporation. ”.  A 
Share  or  Warrant  may  be  deemed  to  be  “taxable  Canadian  property”  where  the  Non-Resident  Securityholder 
acquired or held the Share in certain circumstances, including acquiring the share in consideration of the disposition 
of other taxable Canadian property to the issuer of such Share.
In  the  event  that  the  Shares  or  Warrants  constitute  taxable  Canadian  property  to  a  particular  Non-Resident 
Securityholder on the disposition thereof pursuant to the Arrangement, and a capital gain realized on the disposition 
of such taxable Canadian property is not exempt from tax under the Tax Act pursuant to the terms of an applicable 
income  tax  treaty  or  convention,  such  Non-Resident  Securityholder  may  realize  a  capital  gain  (or  capital  loss) 
generally in the circumstances and computed in the manner described above under “Taxation of Capital Gains and 
Capital Losses”.  Such Non-Resident Securityholder may be eligible for the automatic rollover (in respect of the
101
Shares)  and  Joint  Tax  Election  (in  respect  of  the  Shares  and  Warrants)  in  the  circumstances  generally  described 
above under “Exchange of Shares and Warrants for GTO Shares” under the headings “Automatic Rollover” and 
“Section 85 Election”.
In addition, a Non-Resident Securityholder will be required to apply for a “certificate of compliance” pursuant to 
section 116 of the Tax Act in respect of the exchange of Polaris Preferred Shares for GTO Shares pursuant to the 
Arrangement if such shares constitute taxable Canadian property.  Such application may be submitted before the 
exchange, but in any event must be submitted no later than 10 days thereafter.  If a certificate of compliance, in form 
and substance satisfactory to GTO, is not obtained prior to the date of the exchange, GTO will withhold all or a 
portion of the GTO Shares otherwise deliverable to the Non-Resident Securityholder, and such shares will be held in 
escrow pending the issuance of such certificate of compliance.  In the event that the Non-Resident Securityholder 
does not apply for a certificate of compliance, or for whatever reason a certificate of compliance is not ultimately 
issued to the Non-Resident Securityholder, the escrow agent will be authorized to sell a sufficient number of the 
GTO Shares otherwise deliverable to the Non-Resident Securityholder  to generate net cash  proceeds equal to 25% 
of  the  fair  market  value,  as  of  the  date  of  the  exchange,  of  the  GTO  Shares  otherwise  deliverable  to  the  Non-
Resident  Securityholder  and  remit  such  funds  to  the  Receiver  General  of  Canada  as  tax  on  behalf  of  the  Non-
Resident Securityholder.
Taxable  gains  realized  by  a  Non-Resident  Securityholder  may  be  exempt  from  taxation  under  the  terms  of  an 
applicable income tax convention.  Non-Resident Securityholders may be required to report the disposition of any 
taxable Canadian property by filing a tax return under the Tax Act for the Non-Resident Securityholder taxation year 
that includes the disposition, whether or not the disposition is subject to tax.  Non-Resident Securityholders whose 
Shares  or  Warrants  are  taxable  Canadian  property  should  consult  their  own  advisors  for  advice  having 
regard to their particular circumstances.
Non-Resident Securityholders’ Exercise of Dissent Rights
Upon the exercise of dissent rights where a Non-Resident Securityholder is paid the fair value of its Shares by the 
issuer thereof, such Non-Resident Securityholder will be deemed to have received a taxable dividend equal to the 
amount  by  which  such  payment  (excluding  any  portion  thereof  that  is  interest  awarded  by  a  court)  exceeds  the 
“paid-up  capital”,  for  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act,  of  the  Shares  held,  respectively.  Such  dissenting  Non-Resident 
Securityholders will be subject to withholding tax on the amount of such deemed dividend at a rate of 25%, subject 
to reduction under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty or convention. For example, in the case of a resident of 
the United States who is entitled to the benefits of the Canada-United States Tax Convention, the withholding tax 
rate generally will be reduced to 15%.
Dissenting Non-Resident Securityholders will also be considered to have disposed of their Shares and will realize a 
capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent that the cash received (excluding interest), less any deemed dividend and 
net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceeds (or is less than) the holder’s adjusted cost base of the Shares. 
Such  dissenting  shareholders  may    be  subject  to  tax  under  the  Tax  Act,  and  the  related  reporting  and  filing 
requirements (including the requirement to obtain a certificate of compliance pursuant to section 116 of the Tax Act) 
in  respect  of  such  disposition,  in  the  same  manner  as  discussed  above  under  the  heading  “Securityholders  Not 
Resident in Canada”.
Securityholders who are not resident in Canada and who are considering dissenting to the Arrangement are 
urged  to  consult  their  own  Canadian  tax  advisors  with  respect  to  the  tax  payment,  reporting  and  filing 
requirements applicable thereto.
CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
Introduction
The  following  is  a  limited  discussion  of  certain  material  anticipated  U.S.  federal  income  tax  considerations 
applicable  to  a  U.S.  Holder  (as  defined  below)  arising  from  an  Exchange  and  the  acquisition,  ownership  and 
disposition of GTO Shares received pursuant to the Arrangement.  This summary does not address the U.S. federal
102
income tax consequences of the Polaris Exchange to Polaris Shareholders who are U.S. Holders (as defined below) 
to the extent their Polaris Shares were received as a result of their prior ownership of securities of Iriana Resources 
Corporation. This summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis 
or listing of all potential U.S. federal income tax considerations that may apply to a U.S. Holder as a result of the 
Exchanges  or  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition,  ownership  and  disposition  of  GTO  Shares  received  pursuant  to  the 
Arrangement. In addition, this summary does not take into account the individual facts and circumstances of any 
particular U.S. Holder that may affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to such U.S. Holder. 
Accordingly, this summary is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or U.S. federal income tax 
advice with respect to any U.S. Holder. Moreover, this summary is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the 
“IRS”) or the U.S. courts, and no assurance can be provided that the conclusions reached in this summary will not 
be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a U.S. court if so challenged. None of the Acquired Companies and 
GTO has requested, and none of the Acquired Companies and GTO intend to request, a ruling from the IRS or an 
opinion from legal counsel regarding any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement. Each 
U.S.  Holder  should  consult  its  own  tax  advisor  regarding  the  U.S.  federal,  U.S.  state  and  local,  and  foreign  tax 
consequences of the Exchanges and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of GTO Shares received pursuant to 
the Arrangement.
Notice Pursuant to IRS Circular 230
To ensure compliance with U.S. Treasury Department Circular 230, U.S. Holders are hereby notified that: (a) any 
discussion of U.S. federal tax issues in this Circular is not intended or written to be relied upon, and cannot be relied 
upon by a U.S. Holder, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed under the Internal Revenue Code; 
(b) this summary was written in connection with the promotion or marketing of the transactions or matters addressed 
in this Circular; and (c) each U.S. Holder should seek advice based on such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances 
from an independent tax advisor.
Scope of this Disclosure
Authorities
This  summary  is  based  on  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”),  Treasury  Regulations 
(final, temporary, and proposed), U.S. court decisions, published IRS rulings, published administrative positions of 
the IRS and the Convention Between Canada and the United States of America with Respect to Taxes on Income 
and on Capital, signed September 26, 1980, as amended (the “Canada-U.S. Tax Convention”), that are applicable 
and, in each case, as in effect and available, as of the date of this Circular. Any of the authorities on which this 
summary is based could be changed in a material and adverse manner at any time, and any such change could be 
applied on a retroactive basis and could affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations described in this summary.
U.S. Holders
For  purposes  of  this  summary,  a  “U.S.  Holder”  is  an  owner  of  Acquired  Company  Shares  participating  in  the 
Arrangement that is (a) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S. for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 
(b) a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is created or 
organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or any state in the U.S., including the District of Columbia, (c) an estate if 
the income of such estate is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source of such income, or (d) a trust 
if (i) such trust has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) a U.S. 
court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have 
the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust.
Non-U.S. Holders
For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is an owner of Acquired Company Shares participating in the 
Arrangement that is not a U.S. Holder. This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations 
applicable to Non-U.S. Holders arising from the Arrangement. Accordingly, a Non-U.S. Holder should consult its
103
own  tax  advisor  regarding  the  U.S.  federal,  U.S.  state  and  local,  and  foreign  tax  consequences  (including  the 
potential application of and operation of any tax treaties) of the Arrangement.
Transactions Not Addressed
This  summary  does  not  address  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  consequences  of  transactions  effected  prior  or 
subsequent  to,  or  concurrently  with,  the  Arrangement  (whether  or  not  any  such  transactions  are  undertaken  in 
connection with the Arrangement), including, without limitation, the following:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
any  vesting,  exercise,  conversion,  assumption,  disposition,  exchange,  or  other  transaction  involving 
warrants or other rights to acquire shares of any Acquired Company, including the Polaris Options, Polaris 
Warrants, Western Options and Western Warrants;
any conversion into GTO Shares of any Acquired Company notes, debentures or other debt instruments; 
and
any transaction, other than the Arrangement, in which any Acquired Company or GTO Shares or securities 
are acquired.
U.S. Holders Subject to Special U.S. Federal Income Tax Rules Not Addressed
This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the Arrangement to U.S. Holders that 
are subject to special provisions under the Code, including, but not limited to, the following U.S. Holders: (a) U.S. 
Holders that are tax-exempt organizations, qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts, or other tax-
deferred accounts; (b) U.S. Holders that are financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, 
or regulated investment companies or that are broker-dealers, dealers, or traders in securities or currencies that elect 
to apply a mark-to-market accounting method; (c) U.S. Holders that have a "functional currency" other than the U.S. 
dollar; (d) U.S. Holders that own Acquired Company Shares as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, conversion 
transaction, constructive sale, or other arrangement involving more than one position; (e) U.S. Holders that acquire 
Acquired  Company  or  GTO  Shares  in  connection  with  the  exercise  of  employee  stock  options  or  otherwise  as 
compensation for services; (f) U.S. Holders that hold Acquired Company Shares (or after the Arrangement, GTO 
Shares) other than as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code; (g) U.S. Holders who are U.S. 
expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States; and (h) U.S. Holders that own, or will own after the 
Effective  Time,  directly,  indirectly,  or  by  attribution,  5%  or  more,  by  voting  power  or  value, of  the  outstanding 
shares of Polaris, Western or GTO. U.S. Holders that are subject to special provisions under the Code, including 
U.S. Holders described immediately above, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, U.S. 
state and local, and foreign tax consequences of the Arrangement.
If an entity that is classified as a partnership (or “pass-through” entity) for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds 
Acquired  Company  Shares,  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  consequences  of  participating  in  the  Arrangement  and 
owning GTO Shares to such partnership (or “pass-through” entity) and the partners of such partnership (or owners 
of such “pass-through” entity) generally will depend on the activities of the partnership (or “pass-through” entity) 
and the status of such partners (or owners). Partners of entities that are classified as partnerships (and owners of 
“pass-through” entities) for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the 
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement.
Other Tax Consequences Not Addressed
This summary does not address the state, local, U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, estate and gift, or foreign tax 
consequences to U.S. Holders of the Arrangement. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding 
the state, local, U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, estate and gift, and foreign tax consequences to them of the 
Arrangement.
104
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Arrangement
Characterization of an Exchange Pursuant to the Arrangement
It is the intent of each Acquired Company that the Exchange involving such Acquired Company qualify as either a 
tax-deferred “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and/or as part of a tax-deferred 
exchange under Section 351 of the Code (collectively referred to as a “Tax-Deferred Transaction”) with respect to 
itself and its U.S. Holders.  However, such qualification is not clear and may depend to some extent upon events 
subsequent to the date of this Circular, including events subsequent to the effective date of the Arrangement, which 
events cannot be predicted with accuracy.  An Exchange will not qualify as a tax deferred reorganization under 
Section  368(a)(1)  of  the  Code  with  respect  to  an  Acquired  Company  if  GTO,  directly  or  indirectly,  pays  any 
Dissenting Shareholder cash for its shares of such Acquired Company.  Whether an Exchange will qualify as part of 
a tax-deferred exchange under Section 351 depends, among other factors, on whether the Arrangement, the Ram 
Acquisition and the Financing are treated as a single integrated transaction under United States federal income tax 
principles as well as the satisfaction of certain other requirements.  Neither the Acquired Company or GTO has 
sought or obtained either a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel regarding any of the tax consequences of 
either Exchange or the Arrangement.  Consequently, neither Acquired Company can provide any assurances that an 
Exchange involving such Acquired Company will qualify as a Tax-Deferred Transaction with respect to itself or its 
U.S.  Holders.    The  tax  consequences  of  an  Exchange  qualifying  as  a  Tax  Deferred  Transaction  or  as  a  taxable 
transaction are discussed below.  It is possible that an Exchange involving one Acquired Company may qualify as a 
Tax-Deferred Transaction and the Exchange involving the other Acquired Company may not.  U.S. Holders should 
consult their own U.S. tax advisors regarding the proper tax reporting of the exchange of their respective Acquired 
Company Shares for GTO Shares pursuant to the Arrangement.
Tax Consequences of an Exchange if an Acquired Company Classified as a PFIC
A U.S. Holder of the shares of an Acquired Company would be subject to special, adverse tax rules in respect of the 
Arrangement if such Acquired Company is classified as a passive foreign investment company under the meaning of 
Section 1297 of the Code (a “PFIC”) for any tax year during which such U.S. Holder holds or held such shares. 
These  rules  are  discussed  in  detail  below  under  “Passive  Foreign  Investment  Company  Rules  Relating  to  the 
Ownership of GTO Shares”.
Based on the income and asset tests described below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules Relating to 
the Ownership of GTO Shares”, (a) Western believes that it was classified as a PFIC in prior tax years, and based on 
current business plans and financial projections, Western expects that it will be a PFIC for its current tax year and 
(b) excluding from consideration U.S. Holders of Polaris Shares who received their Polaris Shares as a result of their 
prior ownership of securities of Iriana Resources Corporation, Polaris believes that it was not a PFIC in prior tax 
years and based on current business plans and financial projections, Polaris expects that it will not be a PFIC for its 
current tax year.  However, PFIC classification is factual in nature, and generally cannot be determined until the 
close of the tax year in question. Additionally, the analysis depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. 
federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations.  Consequently, there can be no assurances 
regarding the PFIC status of either Acquired Company during the current or any prior, or future tax year.
Under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, absent application of the "PFIC-for-PFIC Exception" discussed below, 
if an Acquired Company is classified as a PFIC for any tax year during which a U.S. Holder holds shares of such 
Acquired Company, special rules may increase such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability resulting from 
the Arrangement. Under the default PFIC rules:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
an Exchange involving such Acquired Company may be treated as a taxable exchange to a U.S. Holder 
even if such transaction qualifies as a Tax-Deferred Transaction;
any gain on the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of such Acquired Company and any “excess 
distribution”  (defined  as  an  annual  distribution  that  is  more  than  25%  in  excess  of  the  average  annual 
distribution over the past three years) will be allocated rateably over such U.S. Holder’s holding period;
105
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the amount allocated to the current tax year and any year prior to the first year in which such Acquired 
Company was classified as a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income in the current year;
the amount allocated to each of the other tax years will be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect 
for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year; and
an interest charge for a deemed deferral benefit will be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable 
to each of the other tax years, which interest charge is not deductible by non-corporate U.S. Holders.
A  U.S.  Holder  who  has  made  certain  elections  (described  in  greater  detail  under  “Passive  Foreign  Investment 
Company  Rules  Relating  to  the  Ownership  of  GTO  Shares”  below)  may  be  able  to  mitigate,  or  possibly  even 
eliminate, the adverse PFIC tax consequences that would apply to such U.S. Holder on an Exchange or as a result of 
the exercise of Dissent Rights with respect to such Exchange  if the relevant Acquired Company is or has been a 
PFIC  during  the  time  such  holder  has  held  shares  in  such  Acquired  Company.    In  particular,  a  U.S.  Holder 
participating  in  the  Arrangement  that  has  made  a  timely  qualified  electing  fund  election  (“QEF  Election”)  for 
shares of an Acquired Company may be able to treat an Exchange as not a taxable transaction (for a discussion of 
the general non-recognition treatment of the Arrangement if it qualifies as a Reorganization, see discussion below 
under the heading “Tax Consequences if the Arrangement Qualifies as a Reorganization”).  There can be no 
assurance that Western will satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a qualified electing fund (“QEF”)
or provide to U.S. Holders of its shares the information required to make a QEF Election with respect to any tax 
year.  U.S. Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC 
rules or any Mark-to-Market (which is described under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules Relating to the 
Ownership of GTO Shares”) or QEF Election in connection with the Arrangement.  The impact of and requirements 
for  making  the  Mark-to-Market  Election  and  QEF  Election  are  discussed  more  fully  under  “Passive  Foreign 
Investment Company Rules Relating to the Ownership of GTO Shares – QEF Election” and “ – Mark-to-Market 
Election”.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, if (i) an Exchange qualifies as a Tax-
Deferred Transaction, (ii) the relevant Acquired Company was classified as a PFIC for any tax year during a U.S. 
Holder’s holding period for shares of such Acquired Company, and (iii) GTO is also classified as a PFIC for the tax 
year  that  includes  the  day  after  the  Effective  Date  of  the  Arrangement,  then  proposed  Treasury  Regulations 
generally would provide for Tax-Deferred Transaction treatment to apply to such Exchange (for a discussion of the 
general  nonrecognition  treatment  of  a  Tax-Deferred  Transaction,  see  discussion  below  under  the  heading  “Tax 
Consequences if the Arrangement Qualifies as a Tax-Deferred Transaction”. For purposes of this summary, this 
exception to taxable treatment for an Exchange will be referred to as the “PFIC-for-PFIC Exception”. If the PFIC-
for-PFIC Exception were to apply, U.S. Holders generally would be required to report certain information to the IRS 
on  their  U.S.  federal  income  tax  returns  for  the  tax  year  in  which  the  applicable  Exchange  occurs  (including  a 
statement regarding the applicability of the PFIC-for-PFIC Exception).
No determination has been made as to whether GTO will be considered a PFIC for the tax year that includes the day 
after the Arrangement. Thus, it is not clear whether the PFIC-for-PFIC Exception will be available with respect to 
either  Exchange.  Each  U.S.  Holder  should  consult  its  own  tax  advisor  regarding  the  potential  application  of  the 
PFIC rules to its respective Exchange.
In  addition,  the  proposed  U.S.  Treasury  Regulations  discussed  above  were  proposed  in  1992  and  have  not  been 
adopted in final form. It is uncertain whether the IRS would consider the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations to be 
effective  for  purposes  of  determining  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  treatment  of  the  Exchanges.  If  gain  is  not 
recognized under the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the GTO Shares for 
purposes of applying the PFIC rules presumably would include the period during which the U.S. Holder held its 
Acquired Company Shares. Consequently a subsequent disposition of the GTO Shares presumably would be taxable 
under the default PFIC rules described below. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding whether 
the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations under Section 1291 would apply if their respective Exchange qualifies as a 
Tax-Deferred Transaction.
106
Tax Consequences if an Exchange Qualifies as a Tax-Deferred Transaction
If  an  Exchange  qualifies  as  a  Tax-Deferred  Transaction,  subject  to  the  PFIC  rules  discussed  above,  then  the 
following U.S. federal income tax consequences will result for U.S. Holders:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
no gain or loss will be recognized by a U.S. Holder on the exchange of  Acquired Company Shares for 
GTO Shares pursuant to the Arrangement;
the  tax  basis  of  a  U.S.  Holder  in  the  GTO  Shares  acquired  in  exchange  for  Acquired  Company  Shares 
pursuant to the Arrangement will be equal to such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in Acquired Company Shares 
exchanged;
the  holding  period  of  a  U.S.  Holder  for  the  GTO  Shares  acquired  in  exchange  for  Acquired  Company 
Shares  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  will  include  such  U.S.  Holder’s  holding  period  for  such  Acquired 
Company Shares; and
U.S. Holders who exchange Acquired Company Shares for GTO Shares pursuant to an Exchange generally 
will be required to report certain information to the IRS on their U.S. federal income tax returns for the tax 
year in which such Exchange occurs, and to retain certain records related to such Exchange.
The IRS could challenge a U.S. Holder’s treatment of an Exchange as a Tax-Deferred Transaction. If this treatment 
were successfully challenged, then such Exchange would be treated as a taxable transaction, with the consequences 
discussed immediately below (including the recognition of any realized gain).
Treatment if an Exchange is a Taxable Transaction
If an Exchange does not qualify as a Tax-Deferred Transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to the 
PFIC rules discussed above, then the following U.S. federal income tax consequences will result for U.S. Holders:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the fair 
market value (expressed in U.S. dollars) of the GTO Shares received in exchange for Acquired Company 
Shares pursuant to such Exchange and (ii) the adjusted tax basis (expressed in U.S. dollars) of such U.S. 
Holder in the Acquired Company Shares exchanged;
the  tax  basis  of  a  U.S.  Holder  in  the  GTO  Shares  received  in  exchange  for  Acquired  Company  Shares 
pursuant to such Exchange will be equal to the fair market value of such GTO Shares on the date of receipt; 
and
the  holding  period  of  a  U.S.  Holder  for  the  GTO  Shares  received  in  exchange  for  Acquired  Company 
Shares pursuant to such Exchange will begin on the day after the date of receipt.
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed in this summary, any gain or loss described in the first of the three bullet points 
immediately  above  generally  will  be  capital  gain  or  loss,  which  will  be  long-term  capital  gain  or  loss  if  such 
Acquired Company Shares have a holding period of more than one year for the U.S. Holder.  Preferential tax rates 
apply  to  long-term  capital  gains  of  a  U.S.  Holder  that  is  an  individual,  estate,  or  trust.    There  are  currently  no 
preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is a corporation.  Deductions for capital losses 
are subject to complex limitations under the Code.
U.S. Holders Exercising Dissent Rights
A U.S. Holder that exercises Dissent Rights with respect to an Exchange pursuant to the Arrangement and is paid 
cash in exchange for all of such U.S. Holder’s Acquired Company Shares generally will recognize gain or loss in an 
amount equal to the difference, if any, between (a) the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in exchange for 
such Acquired Company Shares (other than amounts, if any, that are or are deemed to be interest for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, which amounts will be taxed as ordinary income) and (b) the tax basis of such U.S. Holder in
107
the Acquired Company Shares surrendered. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed in this summary, such gain or loss 
generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Acquired Company Shares 
are held for more than one year. Preferential tax rates apply to long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is an 
individual, estate, or trust.  Deductions for capital losses are subject to complex limitations under the Code. U.S. 
Holders that receive Canadian currency as a result of exercising Dissent Rights should read the section below under 
the heading “Other Considerations - Receipt of Canadian Currency”.
Ownership of GTO Shares
Distributions With Respect to GTO Shares
Subject  to  the  discussion  below  under  the  heading  “Passive  Foreign  Investment  Company  Rules  Relating  to  the 
Ownership  of  GTO  Shares”,  U.S.  Holders  that  receive  a  distribution  (including  a  constructive  distribution,  but 
excluding  certain  pro  rata  distributions  of  stock  described  in  Section  305  of  the  Code)  with  respect  to  the  GTO 
Shares will be required to include the amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend (without reduction 
for any Canadian income tax withheld from such distribution) to the extent of the current or accumulated “earnings 
and profits” (determined under U.S. federal income tax rules) of GTO. To the extent that a distribution exceeds the 
current and accumulated “earnings and profits” of GTO, such distribution will be treated (a) first, as a tax-free return 
of capital to the extent of a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the GTO Shares, and (b) thereafter, as gain from the sale or 
exchange of such shares. (See more detailed discussion under the heading “Disposition of GTO Shares” below). 
However, GTO does not intend to maintain the calculations of earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal 
income tax principles, and each U.S. Holder should therefore assume that any distribution by GTO with respect to 
GTO Shares will constitute ordinary dividend income. Dividends paid on GTO Shares generally will not be eligible 
for the "dividends received deduction" generally available to U.S. corporate shareholders receiving dividends from 
U.S. corporations.
For tax years beginning before January 1, 2011, a dividend paid by GTO generally will be taxed at the preferential 
tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains if (a) GTO is a “qualified foreign corporation” (as defined below), (b) 
the U.S. Holder receiving such dividend is an individual, estate, or trust, and (c) certain holding period requirements 
are met. GTO generally will be a “qualified foreign corporation” under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code (a “QFC”) if 
(a) it is eligible for the benefits of the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention, or (b) the GTO Shares are readily tradable on 
an established securities market in the U.S. However, even if GTO satisfies one or more of such requirements, it will 
not be treated as a QFC if it is a PFIC for the tax year during which it pays a dividend or for the preceding tax year.  
See a more detailed discussion of the PFIC rules under the heading “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules 
Relating to the Ownership of GTO Shares”.
If  GTO  is  not  a  PFIC,  but  a  U.S.  Holder  otherwise  fails  to  qualify  for  the  preferential  tax  rate  discussed  in  the 
preceding paragraph, a dividend paid to a U.S. Holder generally will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates (and not 
at the preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains). The dividend rules are complex, and each U.S. 
Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the dividend rules.
Dispositions of GTO Shares
A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of GTO Shares in an amount equal 
to the difference, if any, between (a) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received and (b) 
such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the GTO Shares sold or otherwise disposed of.  Subject to the PFIC rules discussed 
below, any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the 
respective shares sold have been held for more than one year.
Preferential tax rates apply to long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate, or trust. There are 
currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains of a U.S. Holder that is a corporation. Deductions for 
capital losses are subject to significant limitations under the Code.

Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules Relating to the Ownership of GTO Shares
If GTO is classified as a PFIC for any tax year during which such U.S. Holder holds GTO Shares, the preceding 
sections  of  this  summary  may  not  describe  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  consequences  to  U.S.  Holders  of  the 
acquisition, ownership and disposition of GTO Shares received pursuant to the Arrangement.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Status of GTO
A foreign corporation generally will be considered a PFIC if, for a tax year, (a) 75% or more of its gross income for 
such tax year is passive income or (b) 50% or more of the assets held by such corporation either produce passive 
income or are held for the production of passive income, based on the fair market value of such assets. With respect 
to sales by a company, “gross income” generally means sales revenues less cost of goods sold. “Passive income” 
includes,  for  example,  dividends,  interest,  certain  rents  and  royalties,  certain  gains  from  the  sale  of  stock  and 
securities, and certain gains from commodities transactions.
For purposes of the PFIC income test and assets test described above, if GTO owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or 
more  of  the  total  value  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  another  corporation,  it  will  be  treated  as  if  it  (a)  held  a 
proportionate share of  the  assets  of  such other  corporation  and  (b) received directly  a  proportionate  share of  the 
income of such other corporation. In addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above, 
“passive income” does not include any interest, dividends, rents, or royalties that are received or accrued from a 
“related person” (as defined in Section 954(d)(3) of the Code), to the extent such items are properly allocable to the 
income of such related person that is not passive income.
In addition, if GTO is a PFIC and owns shares of another foreign corporation that also is a PFIC (a “Subsidiary 
PFIC”), under certain indirect ownership rules, a disposition of the shares of the Subsidiary PFIC or a distribution 
received by GTO from the Subsidiary PFIC generally will be treated as a deemed disposition of such corporation’s 
shares by a U.S. Holder or as a distribution deemed to be received by a U.S. Holder with respect to shares in such 
corporation, subject to taxation under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code discussed below. To the extent that gain 
recognized on the actual disposition by a U.S. Holder of its GTO Shares or income recognized by a U.S. Holder on 
an actual distribution received from GTO was previously subject to U.S. federal income tax under these indirect 
ownership rules, such amount generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
As noted above, no determination has been made as to whether GTO will be considered a PFIC for the tax year that 
includes the day after the Arrangement. Consequently, there can be no assurances regarding the PFIC status of GTO 
for the tax year that includes the day after the Effective Date or any future tax year. Each U.S. Holder should consult 
its own tax advisor regarding the PFIC status of GTO.
Default PFIC Rules under Section 1291 of the Code
If GTO is a PFIC, the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder of the acquisition, ownership, and 
disposition of GTO Shares will depend on whether such U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to GTO 
under  Section  1295  of  the  Code  or  has  made  a  Mark-to-Market  Election  with  respect  to  its  GTO  Shares  under 
Section 1296 of the Code. A U.S. Holder that does not make either a QEF Election or a Mark-to-Market Election 
with respect to GTO will be referred to in this summary as a “Non-Electing U.S. Holder”.
A Non-Electing U.S. Holder will be subject to the rules of Section 1291 of the Code with respect to (a) any gain 
recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of GTO Shares and (b) any excess distribution paid on the GTO 
Shares. A distribution generally will be an “excess distribution” to the extent that such distribution (together with all 
other distributions received in the current tax year) exceeds 125% of the average distributions received during the 
three preceding tax years (or during a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the GTO Shares, if shorter).
Under Section 1291 of the Code, any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of shares of a PFIC, 
and  any  excess  distribution  paid  on  such  shares,  must  be  rateably  allocated  to  each  day  in  a  Non-Electing  U.S. 
Holder’s holding period for such shares. The amount of any gain or excess distribution allocated to prior years of 
such Non-Electing U.S. Holder’s holding period for the GTO Shares will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the
109
highest tax applicable to ordinary income in each such prior year. A Non-Electing U.S. Holder will be required to 
pay interest on the resulting tax liability for each such prior year, calculated as if such tax liability had been due in 
each such prior year. Such a Non-Electing U.S. Holder that is not a corporation must treat any such interest paid as 
“personal  interest”,  which  is not  deductible.  The  amount of  any  such gain or  excess distribution  allocated  to  the 
current  year  of  such  Non-Electing  U.S.  Holder’s  holding  period  for  the  GTO  Shares  will  be  treated  as  ordinary 
income in the current year, and no interest charge will be incurred with respect to the resulting tax liability for the 
current year.
If GTO is a PFIC for any tax year during which a Non-Electing U.S. Holder holds such GTO Shares, GTO will 
continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such Non-Electing U.S. Holder, regardless of whether it ceases to be 
a PFIC in one or more subsequent years. A Non-Electing U.S. Holder may terminate this deemed PFIC status by 
electing to recognize gain (which will be taxed under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code discussed above) as if 
the GTO Shares were sold on the last day of the last tax year for which GTO was a PFIC.
QEF Election
A U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election generally will not be subject to the rules of Section 1291 of the Code 
discussed above with respect to PFIC shares held or sold. However, a U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election with 
respect to GTO or any Subsidiary PFIC will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such U.S. Holder’s pro rata 
share of (a) the net capital gain of the relevant corporation, which will be taxed as long-term capital gain to such 
U.S. Holder, and (b) and the ordinary earnings of such corporation, which will be taxed as ordinary income to such 
U.S.  Holder.  Generally,  “net  capital  gain”  is  the  excess  of  (a)  net  long-term  capital  gain  over  (b)  net  short-term 
capital loss, and “ordinary earnings” are the excess of (a) “earnings and profits” over (b) net capital gain. A U.S. 
Holder that makes a QEF Election will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such amounts for each tax year in 
which the subject corporation is a PFIC, regardless of whether such amounts are actually distributed to such U.S. 
Holder by the corporation. However, for any tax year in which GTO and/or a subsidiary is a PFIC and has no net 
income or gain, U.S. Holders that have made a QEF Election with respect to the relevant corporation would not have 
any income inclusion as a result of the QEF Election.  If a U.S. Holder that made a QEF Election has an income 
inclusion,  such  a  U.S.  Holder  may,  subject  to  certain  limitations,  elect  to  defer  payment  of  current  U.S.  federal 
income tax on such amounts, subject to an interest charge. If such U.S. Holder is not a corporation, any such interest 
paid will be treated as “personal interest”, which is not deductible.
A U.S. Holder that makes a QEF Election with respect to GTO or a Subsidiary PFIC generally (a) may receive a tax-
free distribution to the extent that such distribution represents “earnings and profits” of the relevant corporation that 
were previously included in income by the U.S. Holder because of such QEF Election and (b) will adjust such U.S. 
Holder’s tax basis in his or her shares to reflect the amount included in income (resulting in an increase in basis) or 
allowed as a tax-free distribution (resulting in a decrease in basis) because of the QEF Election. In addition, a U.S. 
Holder  that  makes  a  QEF  Election  generally  will  recognize  capital  gain  or  loss  on  the  sale  or  other  taxable 
disposition of GTO Shares.
The procedure for making a QEF Election, and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of making a QEF Election, 
will  depend  on  whether  such  QEF  Election  is  timely.  A  QEF  Election  will  be  treated  as  “timely”  if  such  QEF 
Election is made for the first year in the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the applicable shares in which the relevant 
corporation was a PFIC. A U.S. Holder may make a timely QEF Election by filing the appropriate QEF Election 
documents at the time such U.S. Holder files a U.S. federal income tax return for such first year. However, if GTO 
or the subsidiary in question was a PFIC in a prior year during such U.S. Holder's holding period, then in order for a 
U.S.  Holder  to  avoid  the  Section  1291  rules  on  a  going-forward  basis,  in  addition  to  filing  the  QEF  Election 
documents, a U.S. Holder must elect to recognize gain (which will be taxed under the rules of Section 1291 of the 
Code  discussed  above)  as  if  the  GTO  Shares  or  subsidiary  shares  were  sold  on  the  qualification  date.  The 
“qualification  date”  is  the  first  day  of  the  first  tax  year  in  which  GTO  or  the  Subsidiary  PFIC  was  a  QEF  with 
respect to such U.S. Holder. The election to recognize such gain or “earnings and profits” can only be made if such 
U.S. Holder’s holding period for the relevant shares includes the qualification date. By electing to recognize such 
gain or “earnings and profits”, such U.S. Holder will be deemed to have made a timely QEF Election. In addition, 
under very limited circumstances, a U.S. Holder may make a retroactive QEF Election if such U.S. Holder failed to 
file the QEF Election documents in a timely manner.
110
A QEF Election will apply to the tax year for which such QEF Election is made and to all subsequent tax years, 
unless such QEF Election is invalidated or terminated or the IRS consents to revocation of such QEF Election. If a 
U.S. Holder makes a QEF Election and, in a subsequent tax year, GTO or a Subsidiary PFIC ceases to be a PFIC, 
the  QEF  Election  will  remain  in  effect  (although  it  will  not  be  applicable)  during  those  tax  years  in  which  the 
relevant  corporation  is  not  a  PFIC.  Accordingly,  if  GTO  and/or  a  subsidiary,  as  applicable,  becomes  a  PFIC  in 
another subsequent tax year, the QEF Election will be effective and the U.S. Holder will be subject to the QEF rules 
described  above  during  any  such  subsequent  tax  year  in  which  GTO  or  the  subsidiary  qualifies  as  a  PFIC.  In 
addition, the QEF Election will remain in effect (although it will not be applicable) with respect to a U.S. Holder 
even  after  such  U.S.  Holder  disposes  of  all  of  such  U.S.  Holder’s  direct  and  indirect  interest  in  the  relevant 
corporation’s  shares.  Accordingly,  if  such  U.S.  Holder  reacquires  an  interest  in  GTO  such  U.S.  Holder  will  be 
subject to the QEF rules described above for each tax year in which GTO is a PFIC.
U.S. Holders should be aware that there can be no assurances that GTO will satisfy the record keeping requirements 
that apply to a QEF, or that GTO will supply U.S. Holders with information that such U.S. Holders require to report 
under the QEF rules, in the event that GTO is a PFIC and a U.S. Holder wishes to make a QEF Election.  Each U.S. 
Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the availability of, and procedure for making, a QEF Election.
Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the availability of, and procedure for making, a QEF 
Election with respect to GTO and any Subsidiary PFIC.
Mark-to-Market Election
A  U.S.  Holder  may  make  a  Mark-to-Market  Election  with  respect  to  the  GTO  Shares  only  if  such  shares  are 
marketable stock. Such shares generally will be “marketable stock” if they are regularly traded on (a) a national 
securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (b) the national market system 
established pursuant to section 11A of the Exchange Act, or (c) a foreign securities exchange that is regulated or 
supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located, provided that (i) such foreign 
exchange has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, and other requirements and the laws of the country in 
which  such  foreign  exchange  is  located,  together  with  the  rules  of  such  foreign  exchange,  ensure  that  such 
requirements are actually enforced and (ii) the rules of such foreign exchange ensure active trading of listed stocks.  
Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the availability of a Mark-to-Market Election 
with respect to GTO Shares.
A U.S. Holder that makes a Mark-to-Market Election generally will not be subject to the rules of Section 1291 of the 
Code discussed above. However, if a U.S. Holder makes a Mark-to-Market Election after the beginning of such U.S. 
Holder’s holding period for the GTO Shares and such U.S. Holder has not made a timely QEF Election, the rules of 
Section  1291  of  the  Code  discussed  above  will  apply  to  certain  dispositions  of,  and  distributions  on,  the  GTO 
Shares.
A U.S. Holder that makes a Mark-to-Market Election generally also will adjust such U.S. Holder’s tax basis his 
GTO Shares to reflect the amount included in gross income or allowed as a deduction because of such Mark-to-
Market Election. In addition, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of GTO Shares subject to a Mark-to-Market 
Election, a U.S. Holder will recognize ordinary income or loss (such loss not to exceed the excess, if any, of (a) the 
amount  included  in  ordinary  income  because  of  such  Mark-to-Market  Election  for  prior  tax  years  over  (b)  the 
amount allowed as a deduction because of such Mark-to-Market Election for prior tax years).
A  Mark-to-Market  Election  applies  to  the  tax  year  in  which  such  Mark-to-Market  Election  is  made  and  to  each 
subsequent tax year, unless the GTO Shares cease to be “marketable stock” or the IRS consents to revocation of 
such election. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the availability of, and procedure for 
making, a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to GTO Shares.
Although a U.S. Holder may be eligible to make a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to the GTO Shares, no 
such election may be made with respect to the stock of any Subsidiary PFIC that a U.S. Holder is treated as owning 
because  such  stock  is  not  marketable.  Hence,  the  Mark-to-Market  Election  will  not  be  effective  to  eliminate  the 
interest charge described above with respect to deemed dispositions of Subsidiary PFIC stock or distributions from a 
Subsidiary PFIC.
111
Other PFIC Rules
Under  Section  1291(f)  of  the  Code,  the  IRS  has  issued  proposed  Treasury  Regulations  that,  subject  to  certain 
exceptions, would cause a U.S. Holder that had not made a timely QEF Election to recognize gain (but not loss) 
upon certain transfers of GTO Shares that would otherwise be tax-deferred (e.g., gifts and exchanges pursuant to 
corporate reorganizations). However, the specific U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder may vary 
based on the manner in which the GTO Shares are transferred.
Certain additional adverse rules will apply with respect to a U.S. Holder if GTO is a PFIC, regardless of whether 
such U.S. Holder makes a QEF Election. For example under Section 1298(b)(6) of the Code, a U.S. Holder that uses 
shares of GTO as security for a loan will, except as may be provided in Treasury Regulations, be treated as having 
made a taxable disposition of such shares. In addition, a U.S. Holder who acquires GTO Shares from a decedent will 
not receive a “step up” in tax basis of such shares to fair market value.
The PFIC rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the PFIC rules and 
how  the  PFIC  rules  may  affect  the  U.S.  federal  income  tax  consequences  of  the  acquisition,  ownership,  and 
disposition of GTO Shares received pursuant to the Arrangement.
Other Considerations
Foreign Tax Credit
A  U.S.  Holder  that  pays  (whether  directly  or  through  withholding)  Canadian  income  tax  in  connection  with  the 
Arrangement or in connection with the ownership or disposition of GTO Shares may be entitled, at the election of 
such U.S. Holder, to receive either a deduction or a credit for such Canadian income tax paid. Generally, a credit 
will reduce a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas a deduction will 
reduce a U.S. Holder’s income subject to U.S. federal income tax. This election is made on a year-by-year basis and 
applies to all foreign taxes paid (whether directly or through withholding) by a U.S. Holder during a year.
Complex limitations apply to the foreign tax credit, including the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the 
proportionate share of a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. Holder’s “foreign source” 
taxable income bears to such U.S. Holder’s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. Holder’s 
various items of income and deduction must be classified, under complex rules, as either “foreign source” or “U.S. 
source”. Generally, dividends paid by a foreign corporation should be treated as foreign source for this purpose, and 
gains recognized on the sale of stock of a foreign corporation by a U.S. Holder should be treated as U.S. source for 
this purpose, except as otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and if an election is properly made 
under the Code. However, the amount of a distribution with respect to the GTO Shares that is treated as a “dividend” 
may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it is for Canadian federal income tax purposes, resulting in a 
reduced  foreign  tax  credit  allowance  to  a  U.S.  Holder.  In  addition,  this  limitation  is  calculated  separately  with 
respect  to  specific  categories  of  income.  The  foreign  tax  credit  rules  are  complex,  and  each  U.S.  Holder  should 
consult its own U.S. tax advisor regarding the foreign tax credit rules.
Receipt of Canadian Currency
The  amount  of  any  distribution  or  proceeds  paid  in  Canadian  dollars  to  a  U.S.  Holder  in  connection  with  the 
ownership of GTO Shares, or on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of GTO Shares, or any Canadian 
dollars received as a result of U.S. Holders exercising Dissent Rights under the Arrangement, generally will be equal 
to  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  such  Canadian  dollars  based  on  the  exchange  rate  applicable  on  the  date  of  receipt 
(regardless  of  whether  such  Canadian  dollars  are  converted  into  U.S.  dollars  at  that  time).  A  U.S.  Holder  that 
receives Canadian dollars and converts such Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars at a conversion rate other than the 
rate in effect on the date of receipt may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss, which generally would be 
treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss for foreign tax credit purposes.
Taxable dividends with respect to GTO Shares that are paid in Canadian dollars will be included in the gross income 
of a U.S. Holder as translated into U.S. dollars calculated by reference to the exchange rate prevailing on the date of
112
actual or constructive receipt of the dividend, regardless of whether the Canadian dollars are converted into U.S. 
dollars at that time. If the Canadian dollars received are not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. 
Holder will have a basis in the Canadian dollars equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt. Any U.S. Holder 
who  receives  payment  in  Canadian  dollars  and  engages  in  a  subsequent  conversion  or  other  disposition  of  the 
Canadian dollars may have a foreign currency exchange gain or loss that would be treated as ordinary income or 
loss, and generally will be U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit purposes.
Each U.S. Holder should consult its own U.S. tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of 
receiving, owning, and disposing of Canadian dollars.
Information Reporting; Backup Withholding Tax
Payments of cash made in connection with the Arrangement, such as payments made to U.S. Holders relating to the 
exercise of Dissent Rights under the Arrangement, payments of cash or property made to U.S. Holders relating to 
dividends on GTO Shares, or proceeds arising from the sale or other taxable disposition of GTO shares, generally 
will be subject to U.S. federal information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding tax, currently at the 
rate of 28%, if a U.S. Holder (a) fails to furnish such U.S. Holder’s correct U.S. taxpayer identification number 
(generally on Form W-9); or (b) fails to certify, under penalty of perjury, that such U.S. Holder has furnished its 
correct U.S. taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. Holder that it is subject to 
backup-withholding  tax.  However,  U.S.  Holders  that  are  corporations  generally  are  excluded  from  these 
information-reporting  and  backup-withholding  tax  rules.  Backup  withholding  is  not  an  additional  U.S.  federal 
income tax. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup withholding tax rules will be allowed as a credit against a 
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or will be refunded to the extent it exceeds such liability, if 
such  U.S.  Holder  furnishes  required  information  to  the  IRS.  A  U.S.  Holder  that  does  not  provide a  correct  U.S. 
taxpayer identification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Each U.S. Holder should consult its 
own U.S. tax advisor regarding the information reporting and backup withholding tax rules.
OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS
This Information Circular does not address any tax considerations of the Arrangement other than Canadian and U.S. 
federal income tax considerations.  Securityholders who are resident in jurisdictions other than Canada and the U.S. 
should consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax implications of the Arrangement, including any associated 
filing  requirements,  in  such  jurisdictions  and  with  respect  to  the  tax  implications  in  such  jurisdictions.  
Securityholders should also consult their own tax advisors regarding provincial, territorial or state considerations of 
the Arrangement.
RISK FACTORS
There are certain risk factors relating to GTO, Polaris, Western, Ram, the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition 
which  should  be  carefully  considered  by  securityholders,  including  the  fact  that  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram 
Acquisition may not be completed if, among other things, the Arrangement Resolutions do not receive the requisite 
approvals at the Meetings, or if any other conditions precedent to the completion of the Arrangement or the Ram 
Acquisition  are  not  satisfied  or  waived  as  applicable.  In  assessing  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition, 
securityholders should carefully consider the risk factors which exist for each of GTO, Polaris, Western, Ram and 
New  GTO  as  described  in  this  Information  Circular  or  the  documents  incorporated  herein  by  reference.  See 
“Appendix K – Information Concerning GTO”, “Appendix L – Information Concerning Polaris”, “Appendix M – 
Information Concerning Western”, “Appendix N – Information Concerning Ram” and “Appendix O – Information 
Concerning New GTO”.
Securityholders  should  also  consider  the  following  risk  factors  associated  with  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram 
Acquisition:
113
The Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition May Not Be Completed
Each of Parties and the Acquisition Parties have the right to terminate the Arrangement Agreement and the Share 
Purchase Agreement, respectively, in certain circumstances. Accordingly, there is no certainty, nor can the Parties or 
the Acquisition Parties as the case may be, provide any assurance, that the Arrangement Agreement or the Share 
Purchase  Agreement  will  not  be  terminated  before  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  or  the  Ram  Acquisition, 
respectively.
In  addition,  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions 
precedent,  certain  of  which  are  outside  the  control  of  the  Parties  and  the  Acquisition  Parties,  including 
securityholder approval of the Arrangement Resolutions, approval of the Court and approval of the TSX. There is no 
certainty,  nor  can  the  Parties  or  the  Acquisition  Parties,  as  the  case  may  be,  provide  any  assurance,  that  these 
conditions will be satisfied.
If for any reason the Arrangement or the Ram Acquisition are not completed, the market price of the GTO Pre-
Consolidation Shares, the Polaris Shares or the Western Shares may be adversely affected. If the Arrangement and 
the Ram Acquisition are not completed and GTO, Polaris or Western cannot obtain financing for working capital 
requirements, the financial condition of GTO, Polaris or Western may be materially adversely affected.
Possible Failure to Realize Anticipated Benefits of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition
The success of New GTO following completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition will depend in large 
part  on  successfully  consolidating  functions  and  integrating  operations,  projects,  procedures  and  personnel  in  a 
timely  and  efficient  manner,  as  well  as  New  GTO’s  ability  to  realize  the  anticipated  growth  opportunities  and 
synergies from combining the business and operations of GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram. The inability to achieve 
such integration could result in the failure of New GTO to realize the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement and 
the Ram Acquisition and could impair the results of operations, profitability and financial results of New GTO. The 
integration of GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram will require the dedication of management effort, time and resources 
and  this  could  divert  management’s  focus  and  resources  from  other  strategic  opportunities  and  from  operational 
matters during this process.
114
MATTERS TO BE APPROVED AT THE MEETINGS
The GTO Meeting
Receipt of Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report
The audited financial statements of GTO for the year ended February 28, 2009 and the auditors’ report thereon will 
be tabled at the GTO Meeting, but no vote by the GTO Shareholders with respect thereto is required or proposed to 
be taken.
Election of Directors
At  the  GTO  Meeting,  it  is  proposed  that  five  (5)  directors  be  elected  until  the  next  annual  meeting  of  GTO 
Shareholders or until their successors are duly elected or appointed. There are currently five (5) directors of GTO, 
all of whom are being nominated for re-election. Pursuant to the BCBCA, the current directors of GTO cease to hold 
office at the close of the GTO Meeting.
It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, if not expressly directed to the contrary 
in such form of proxy, to vote such proxies “FOR” the election of the nominees specified below as directors of 
GTO.

The information as to GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares beneficially owned, or over which control or direction is exercised, directly or 
indirectly, is based upon information furnished to GTO by its respective directors and executive officers as at September 15, 2009. 
Member of the audit committee of GTO.
The term of office of the directors will expire on the date of the next annual meeting of the shareholders of GTO or 
until their successor is duly elected, unless their office is earlier vacated in accordance with the Articles of GTO or 
with the provisions of the BCBCA.
In  the  event  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are  completed,  it  is  intended  that  the  board  of 
directors of New GTO will be reconstituted and that each of the current directors of GTO, other than A. 
Murray Sinclair, will resign in connection with the closing of the Business Combination. For details regarding 
the proposed board of directors of New GTO upon completion of the Business Combination, see “Appendix O 
– Information Concerning New GTO – Directors and Officers of New GTO”.
Corporate Cease Trade Orders
Other  than  as  disclosed  in  this  Information  Circular,  no  proposed  director  of  GTO  is,  as  at  the  date  of  this 
Information Circular, or was within 10 years before the date of this Information Circular, a director, chief executive 
officer or chief financial officer of any company (including GTO), that was:
(i)
subject  to  a  cease  trade  or  similar  order  or  an  order  that  denied  the  relevant  company  access  to  any 
exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that
116
was issued while the director or executive officer was acting in the capacity as director, chief executive 
officer or chief financial officer; or
(ii)
subject  to  a  cease  trade  or  similar  order  or  an  order  that  denied  the  relevant  company  access  to  any 
exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that 
was issued after the director or executive officer ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief 
financial  officer  and  which  resulted  from  an  event  that  occurred  while  that  person  was  acting  in  the 
capacity as director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer.
A. Murray Sinclair was a director of Katanga Mining Limited (formerly Balloch Resources Ltd. and New Inca Gold 
Ltd.)  from  May  1,  1998  to  July  10,  2006.  On  February  25,  2002,  the  British  Columbia  Securities  Commission 
(“BCSC”),  the  Alberta  Securities  Commission  (“ASC”)  and  the  Ontario  Securities  Commission  (“OSC”)  issued 
cease trade orders (collectively, the “Cease Trade Orders”) against New Inca Gold Ltd. (“New Inca”) for failure to 
file financial statements within the prescribed period of time and failing to pay the required filing fees. New Inca 
subsequently filed the financial statements and paid the filing fees as required. The Cease Trade Orders issued by the 
ASC and the BCSC were rescinded in October 2003 and the Cease Trade Order issued by the OSC was issued in 
March 2003.
A. Murray Sinclair was a director of PetroFalcon Corporation (formerly Pretium Industries Inc.) (“PetroFalcon”)
from November 28, 2001 to June 4, 2003. On February 27, 2002, the BCSC issued an order regarding a private 
placement of PetroFalcon to Quest Ventures Ltd. (“Quest Ventures”), a private company in which Mr. Sinclair was 
also a director. The BCSC considered it to be in the public interest to remove the applicability of certain exemptions 
from the prospectus and registration requirements of the Securities Act (British Columbia) for PetroFalcon until a 
shareholders  meeting  of  PetroFalcon  was  held.  In  addition,  the  BCSC  removed  the  applicability  of  the  same 
exemptions  for  Quest  Ventures  in  respect  of  the  common  shares  received  pursuant  to  the  private  placement. 
Approval  of  the  shareholders  was  received  on  May  23,  2002  and  the  BCSC  reinstated  the  applicability  of  the 
exemptions from the prospectus and registration requirements for both companies shortly thereafter.
James S. Kermeen is a director of GLR Resources Inc. (“GLR”). The BCSC and the OSC issued cease trade orders 
against GLR on April 14, 2009 and April 27, 2009, respectively, for failure to file annual financial statements and 
MD&A and an annual information form of GLR in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2008.
Bankruptcies
Other than as disclosed in this Information Circular, no proposed director of GTO:
(i)
(ii)
is,  as  at  the  date  of  this  Information  Circular,  or  has  been  within  the  10  years  before  the  date  of  this 
Information  Circular,  a  director  or  executive  officer  of  any  company  (including  GTO  )  that,  while  that 
person was acting in that capacity, or within a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became 
bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject to or 
instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager 
or trustee appointed to hold its assets; or
has, within the 10 years before the date of this Information Circular, become bankrupt, made a proposal 
under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency,  or  become  subject  to  or  instituted  any 
proceedings,  arrangement  or  compromise  with  creditors,  or  had  a  receiver,  receiver  manager  or  trustee 
appointed to hold the assets of the director, executive officer or shareholder.
James Kermeen is a director of GLR. On May 26, 2009, GLR signed a purchase and sale agreement with Linear 
Gold Corp. (“Linear”) whereby GLR agreed to sell its 100% interest in the Goldfields Mine Project located near 
Uranium  City,  Saskatchewan  (the  “GLR Sale”).   On  May  29, 2009, GLR  filed  a  Notice  of  Intention  to  make  a 
proposal under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) (the “Bankruptcy Act”) regarding the GLR Sale (the 
“Proposal”). On June 5, 2009, the Proposal was filed with the Official Receiver appointed under the Bankruptcy 
Act.  In connection therewith, Paddon + Yorke Inc. was appointed as trustee (the “Trustee”).  A meeting of the 
creditors of GLR was held on July 30, 2009 for the purpose of seeking creditor approval of the Proposal. Of the duly
117
proved claims filed with the Trustee, 98.6% of creditors, either by voting letter or by proxy, voted in favour of the 
Proposal.  On August 18, 2009, the Proposal received court approval and on August 21, 2009, the GLR Sale was 
completed.
Penalties or Sanctions
Other than as disclosed in the Information Circular, no proposed director of GTO has been subject to:
(i)
(ii)
any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory 
authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities regulatory authority; or
any  other  penalties  or  sanctions  imposed  by  a  court or  regulatory  body  that  would  likely  be  considered 
important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision.
Appointment of Auditors
During  the  financial  year  ended  February  28,  2009,  GTO’s  former  auditors,  Manning  Elliott  LLP,  Chartered 
Accountants  (“Manning”),  resigned  as  auditors  of  the  Corporation  on  its  own  initiative.  Effective  December  9, 
2008, Davidson & Company LLP (“Davidson”), Chartered Accountants, were appointed as auditors of GTO.
At the GTO Meeting, GTO Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if thought appropriate, to approve and adopt 
an ordinary resolution appointing Davidson as auditors of GTO to hold office for the next ensuing year until the 
close of the next annual meeting of GTO Shareholders, and authorizing the GTO Board to fix their remuneration.
In accordance with National Instrument 51-102 – Continuous Disclosure Obligations, attached to this Information 
Circular  as  Appendix  U  is  the  requisite  reporting  package,  including  the  Notice  of  Change  of  Auditors  dated 
December  9,  2008  and  letters  from  the  former  and  successor  auditors,  all  as  filed  with  applicable  securities 
commissions.
It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, if not expressly directed to the contrary 
in such form of proxy, to vote such proxies “FOR” the appointment of Davidson to hold office for the next 
ensuing year until the close of the next annual meeting of shareholders of GTO and authorizing the GTO 
Board to fix their remuneration.
In  the  event  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition  are  completed,  it  is  intended  that  subsequent  to 
completion  of  the  Business  Combination,  Davidson  will  resign  as  auditors  and  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP, 
Chartered Accountants and Licensed Public Accountants (“Deloitte”), will be appointed as the auditors of 
New GTO. Deloitte is currently the auditor of Polaris and Ram. See “Appendix O – Information Concerning 
New GTO – Auditors, Transfer Agent and Registrar”.
Approval of GTO Option Plan
GTO has established the GTO Option Plan which reserves for issuance up to 10% of the GTO Pre-Consolidation 
Shares. Pursuant to the policies of the TSXV, stock option plans which reserve for issuance up to 10% of a listed 
issuer’s shares (commonly known as “rolling” stock option plans) must be approved annually by the shareholders of 
the listed issuer. The GTO Option Plan was most recently approved by the GTO Shareholders at the annual general 
and  special  meeting  of  GTO  Shareholders  held  on  November  6,  2008  and  will  be  submitted  to  the  GTO 
Shareholders for re-approval at the GTO Meeting. The GTO Board re-approved the GTO Option Plan on September 
16, 2009. A copy of the GTO Option Plan is attached to this Information Circular as Appendix S. For a description 
of the GTO Option Plan, see “Appendix K– Information Concerning GTO – Executive Compensation”.
The GTO Option Plan is subject to TSXV acceptance and approval of the shareholders of GTO. Thereafter, notice 
of options granted under the GTO Option Plan must be given to the TSXV.
118
The  GTO  Shareholders  will  be  asked  to  consider  and,  if  thought  appropriate,  approve  an  ordinary  resolution  re-
approving the GTO Option Plan. The text of the ordinary resolution which management of GTO intends to place 
before the GTO Shareholders at the GTO Meeting for re-approval of the GTO Option Plan is as follows:
“BE IT RESOLVED AS AN ORDINARY RESOLUTION THAT:
1.
2.
3.
the stock option plan (the “GTO Option Plan”) of GTO Resources Inc. (“GTO”), in substantially the form 
as  attached  to the  joint  management  information  circular of GTO,  Polaris  Geothermal  Inc.  and Western 
GeoPower Corp. dated September 18, 2009, be and is hereby approved and adopted as the stock option 
plan of GTO;
the form of the GTO Option Plan may be amended in order to satisfy the requirements or requests of any 
regulatory authorities without requiring the further approval of the shareholders of GTO;
any  one  director  or  officer  of  GTO  is  authorized  and  directed,  for  and  on  behalf  of  GTO,  to  take  all 
necessary  steps  and  proceedings  and  to  execute,  deliver  and  file  any  and  all  declarations,  agreements, 
documents and other instruments and do all such other acts and things (whether under corporate seal of 
GTO or otherwise) that may be necessary or desirable to give effect to this ordinary resolution.”
It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, if not expressly directed to the contrary 
in such form of proxy, to vote such proxies “FOR” the re-approval of the GTO Option Plan.
Approval of the Arrangement
At the GTO Meeting, GTO Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if thought advisable, to pass, with or without 
variation, the GTO Arrangement Resolution, the full text of which is set forth in Appendix A to this Information 
Circular. For a description of the Arrangement, see “The Arrangement”.
Approval of New GTO Option Plan
In connection with completion of the Business Combination, New GTO intends to adopt the New GTO Option Plan, 
to become effective, subject to receipt of securityholder approval and all requisite regulatory approvals, upon the 
closing  of  the  Business  Combination.  The  New  GTO  Option  Plan,  which  has  been  drafted  to  comply  with  the 
policies of the TSX, will replace the GTO Option Plan. A copy of the New GTO Option Plan is attached to the 
Information  Circular  as  Appendix  T.  For  a  description  of  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan,  see  “Appendix  O  – 
Information Concerning New GTO – Options to Purchase Securities”.
Conditional upon the Arrangement being approved, the GTO Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if thought 
appropriate,  approve  an  ordinary  resolution  to  approve  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan.  The  text  of  the  ordinary 
resolution  which  management  of  GTO  intends  to  place  before  the  GTO  Shareholders  at  the  GTO  Meeting  for 
approval of the New GTO Option Plan is as follows:
“BE IT RESOLVED AS AN ORDINARY RESOLUTION THAT:
1.
2.
3.
the  stock  option  plan  (the  “New  GTO  Option  Plan”)  of  GTO  Resources  Inc.  (“New  GTO”),  in 
substantially  the  form  as  attached  to  the  joint  management  information  circular  of  GTO,  Polaris 
Geothermal Inc. and Western GeoPower Corp. dated September 18, 2009 (the “Information Circular”),
be  and  is  hereby  approved  and  adopted  as  the  stock  option  plan  of  GTO  upon  completion  of  the 
Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, as more particularly described in the Information Circular;
the form of the New GTO Option Plan may be amended in order to satisfy the requirements or requests of 
any regulatory authorities without requiring the further approval of the shareholders of New GTO;
any one director or officer of New GTO is authorized and directed, for and on behalf of New GTO, to take 
all necessary steps and proceedings and to execute, deliver and file any and all declarations, agreements,
119
documents and other instruments and do all such other acts and things (whether under corporate seal of 
New GTO or otherwise) that may be necessary or desirable to give effect to this ordinary resolution.”
It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, if not expressly directed to the contrary 
in such form of proxy, to vote such proxies “FOR” the re-approval of the New GTO Option Plan.
Other Business
Management of GTO is not aware of any other matters to come before the GTO Meeting other than those set out in 
the GTO Notice of Meeting. If other matters come before the GTO Meeting, it is the intention of the individuals 
named in the applicable form of proxy to vote the same in accordance with their best judgement.
The Polaris Meeting
Approval of the Polaris Continuation
Polaris is currently governed by the YBCA.  In order to facilitate the Arrangement, the Polaris Shareholders and the 
Polaris Preferred Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, approve the Polaris Continuation.  
The  Polaris  Continuation  Resolution  must  be  approved  by  not  less  than  66(cid:1152)%  of  the  votes  cast  by  the  Polaris 
Shareholders and the Polaris Preferred Shareholders, voting together as a single class, present in person or by proxy 
at the Polaris Meeting.
Reasons for the Polaris Continuation
The Arrangement is conditional upon: (i) the Polaris Continuation Resolution being approved at the Polaris Meeting; 
and (ii) the Polaris Continuation being effected prior to effecting the Arrangement.
Procedure to Effect the Polaris Continuation
In order to effect the Polaris Continuation, the following steps must be taken:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
the  Polaris  Shareholders  and  the  Polaris  Preferred  Shareholders  must  approve  the  Polaris 
Continuation Resolution at the Polaris Meeting, authorizing Polaris to, among other things, file the 
application for Polaris Continuation with the Yukon Registrar;
the Yukon Registrar must approve the proposed Polaris Continuation, upon being satisfied that the 
Polaris Continuation will not adversely affect Polaris’ creditors or shareholders;
Polaris must apply to the BC Registrar for a Certificate of Continuance under the BCBCA; and
Polaris  must  file  a  Notice  of  Continuance  with  the  Yukon  Registrar,  who  will  then  issue  a 
Certificate of Discontinuance.
Pursuant to the YBCA, Polaris is deemed to cease to be a corporation within the meaning of the YBCA on and after 
the  date  on  which  it  is  deemed  to  be  continued  under  the  laws  of  the  BCBCA  pursuant  to  the  issuance  of  the 
Certificate of Continuance by the BC Registrar.
Comparison of Differences Between YBCA and BCBCA
Polaris  is  of  the  view  that  the  BCBCA  provides  to  shareholders  of  Polaris  substantively  the  same  rights  as  are 
available to shareholders under the YBCA, including rights of dissent and appraisal and rights to bring derivative 
and oppression actions. The following is a comparison of some of the principal provisions of the YBCA and the 
BCBCA that Polaris believes would be relevant to shareholders. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, and 
shareholders  should  consult  their  legal  advisors  with  respect  to  the  detailed  provisions  of  the  BCBCA  and  their 
rights thereunder. Reference should be made to the full text of both statutes for particulars of the differences.
120
Note: Within this summary, the term “articles” when referring to the BCBCA is the equivalent to “by-laws” under 
the  YBCA.  The  term  “notice  of  articles”  when referring to  the  BCBCA  is  the  equivalent  of  “articles”  under  the 
YBCA.
A copy of the proposed new Articles and Notice of Articles will be available for inspection at the Polaris Meeting 
and from Polaris at 200 King Street West, Suite1705, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 3T4, during normal business hours.
Sale of All or Substantially All of the Assets of the Corporation. Under the BCBCA, a sale of all or substantially all 
the property of a corporation other than in the ordinary course of business of a corporation requires approval by a 
majority of not less than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by shareholders who voted in respect of the proposed sale. The 
provisions of the YBCA are substantially the same.
Amendments  to  Notice  of  Articles.  Under  the  BCBCA,  any  substantive  change  to  the  notice  of  articles  of  a 
corporation, such as a change in the name of a corporation and certain changes to the share capital of a corporation, 
require approval by a majority of not less than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by shareholders who voted at a meeting in 
respect of the change. The provisions of the YBCA are substantially the same. Alternatively, under the BCBCA, a 
corporation may change its name by a directors' resolution provided that such form of approval is specified as being 
permitted in the corporation's articles.
Article Amendments. The BCBCA provides that unless the articles or a unanimous shareholder agreement otherwise 
provide, the directors may, by resolution, make, amend, or repeal any articles that regulate the business or affairs of 
a  corporation.  However,  the  directors  must  submit  an  article,  or  an  amendment  or  a  repeal  of  an  article,  to  the 
shareholders of the corporation, and the shareholders may, with approval of a simple majority, confirm, reject or 
amend the article, amendment or repeal. The provisions of the YBCA are substantially the same in connection with 
amendments to a corporation’s by-laws.
Authorization of Unlimited Number of Shares. The BCBCA permits a corporation to have an unlimited number of 
shares without par value. The provisions of the YBCA are substantially the same.
Rights of Dissent and Appraisal. The BCBCA provides that shareholders who dissent to certain actions being taken 
by a corporation may exercise a right of dissent and require such corporation to purchase the shares held by such 
shareholder  at  the  fair  value  of  such  shares.  The  dissent  right  is  applicable  where  a  corporation  proposes  to  (a) 
amend the articles to add, change or remove provisions restricting or constraining the issue, transfer or ownership of 
shares of that class, (b) amend its articles to add, change or remove any restriction on the business that a corporation 
may  carry  on,  (c)  enter  into  amalgamation  agreements,  (d)  enter  into  an  arrangement,  the  terms  of  which 
arrangement  permits  dissent,  (e)  continue  out  of  the  jurisdiction,  or  (f)  sell,  lease  or  otherwise  dispose  of  all  or 
substantially all its undertaking. The dissenting shareholder is required to strictly comply with the provisions of the 
BCBCA in order to exercise this remedy. The YBCA provides similar rights to shareholders. See "Dissent Rights" 
below.
Oppression Remedies. Under the BCBCA, a shareholder of a corporation has the right to apply to a court for an 
order  where  the  business  or  affairs  are  being  or  have  been  conducted,  or  the  exercise  by  the  directors  of  a 
corporation's  or  any  of  its  affiliate's  powers,  in  a  manner  oppressive  or  unfairly  prejudicial  to,  or  which  would 
unfairly disregard the interests of, any securityholder of the corporation. On such an application, the court may make 
any  interim  or  final  order  it  considers  appropriate,  including  regulating  the  conduct  of  the  corporation's  affairs. 
Under the YBCA, the oppression remedy is substantially the same as that contained in the BCBCA.
Shareholder Derivative Actions. Pursuant to the BCBCA, a complainant, which includes a shareholder, may apply to 
the court for leave to bring an action in the name of and on behalf of a corporation or any subsidiary, or to intervene 
in an existing action to which the corporation is a party for the purpose of prosecuting, defending or discontinuing 
the action on behalf of the corporation. On such an application, the court may make any order it thinks fit, including 
an order authorizing the complainant or any other person to control the conduct of the action. Pursuant to the YBCA, 
derivative actions are dealt with in substantially the same manner.
121
Financial Assistance. The BCBCA does not restrict a corporation from giving financial assistance to shareholders or 
directors of a corporation or its affiliates. The provisions of the YBCA require a solvency test to be met in certain 
situations.
Record Date for Voting. The BCBCA provides for the setting of a fixed record date for voting purposes. Transfers of 
shares after the record date are not recognized for voting entitlement purposes. The YBCA also provides for the 
setting of a fixed record date for voting purposes but a subsequent transferee of shares requesting to have its name 
included in the relevant shareholder list at least ten days (or such shorter time as is provided in the by-laws) prior to 
the meeting is still entitled to vote, provided that the transferee can establish that the transferee owns the shares.
Requisition of Meetings. The BCBCA provides that holders of not less than five per cent of the issued shares of a 
corporation that carry the right to vote at a shareholders meeting may requisition the directors to call a meeting of 
shareholders for the purposes stated in the requisition. The provisions of the YBCA are substantially the same.
Shareholder  Communication.  The  BCBCA  contains  exemptions  from  the  restrictions  on  proxy  solicitation  that 
permit  a  shareholder  to  make  a  public  announcement  concerning  the  shareholder's  voting  intentions  (whether by 
way  of  a  speech  in  a  public  forum  or  the  issuance  of  a  press  release,  opinion,  statement  or  advertisement).  In 
addition, the BCBCA enables shareholders to communicate with each other, (i) for the purpose of obtaining support 
for shareholder proposals, (ii) if such communications relate to the business and affairs of the corporation, (iii) to 
organize a dissident's proxy solicitation, (iv) if 15 or fewer shareholders are solicited, (v) as clients, by a person 
engaged in the business of providing proxy voting advice, and (vi) other communications as may be prescribed from 
time to time. The YBCA does not contain such broad exemptions to the proxy solicitation rules and accordingly 
shareholder communication is more limited.
Form  of  Proxy  and  Information  Circular.  The  BCBCA  requires  that  management  of  a  distributing  corporation 
(public  company),  concurrently  with  giving  notice  of  a  meeting  of  shareholders,  send  a  form  of  proxy  in  the 
prescribed  form  to  each  shareholder  who  is  entitled  to  receive  notice  of  the  meeting.  Where  management  of  a 
corporation  solicits  proxies,  an  information  circular  in  prescribed  form  must  also  accompany  the  notice  of  the 
meeting. The YBCA contains similar provisions.
Place of Meetings. The BCBCA provides that meetings of shareholders of a corporation must be held at the place 
within the Province of British Columbia provided in the articles. A meeting of shareholders of a corporation may, 
however, be held at a place outside of British Columbia if the place is specified in the articles or, if the articles do 
not restrict the corporation from approving a location outside of British Columbia, the location is approved by the 
resolution required by the articles for that purpose, or, if no resolution is required for that purpose by the articles, by 
ordinary resolution. Under the YBCA, meetings of shareholders of a corporation must be held at a location in the 
Yukon Territory or, if the articles so provide, at one or more places (within our outside of the Yukon Territory) 
specified  in  the  articles,  or  in  the  absence  of  such  determination,  at  the  place  where  the  registered  office  of  the 
corporation is located.
Quorum  of  Shareholders.  The  BCBCA  states  that  the  quorum  of  shareholders  of  a  corporation  for  a  meeting  of 
shareholders  must  be  established  in  the  articles.  If  no  quorum  is  established  by  the  articles,  the  quorum  is  two 
shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting whether present in person or by proxy. Under the YBCA, unless the 
articles  of  a  corporation  otherwise  provide,  a  quorum  of  shareholders  is  present  at  a  meeting  of  shareholders 
(irrespective of the number of persons actually present at the meeting) if holders of a majority of the shares entitled 
to vote at the meeting are present in person or represented by proxy.
Shareholder  Proposals.  The  BCBCA  contains  eligibility  requirements  for  shareholders  that  wish  to  submit 
proposals for inclusion in a corporation's proxy materials. The YBCA imposes similar requirements.
Duties  of  Directors.  The  BCBCA  provides  that,  subject  to  any  unanimous  shareholder  agreement,  the  directors 
manage,  or  supervise  the  management  of,  the  business  and  affairs  of  a  corporation.  The  YBCA  contains 
substantially the same provisions.
122
Removal of Directors. The BCBCA permits the removal of directors by holders of a majority of the shares being 
voted. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of a corporation, a quorum of directors may fill a vacancy among 
the directors, except for a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number or the minimum or maximum number of 
directors or the failure to elect the number or minimum number of directors provided for in the articles. The YBCA 
contains substantially similar provisions.
Dissent Rights
As  a  result  of  the  proposed  Polaris  Continuation,  the  registered  Polaris  Shareholders  and  Polaris  Preferred 
Shareholders are entitled to the dissent rights set out in section 193 of the YBCA and to be paid the fair value of 
their shares if such shareholder dissents to the Polaris Continuation of Polaris under the BCBCA. Neither a vote 
against the Polaris Continuation Resolution, nor an abstention or the execution or exercise of a proxy vote against 
such resolution, will constitute notice of dissent. A shareholder must dissent with respect to all shares either held 
personally by him or on behalf of any one beneficial owner and which are registered in one name. A brief summary 
of the provisions of section 193 of the YBCA is set out below and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full 
text of section 193 of the YBCA annexed hereto as Appendix R.
Persons who are beneficial owners of shares registered in the name of a broker, custodian, nominee or other 
Intermediary  who  wish  to  dissent  should  be  aware  that  only  a  Registered  Polaris  Shareholder  or  Polaris 
Preferred  Shareholder  is  entitled  to  dissent.  A  shareholder  who  beneficially  owns  shares  but  is  not  the 
registered holder thereof, should contact the registered holder for assistance.
In order to dissent, a shareholder must send to Polaris in the manner set forth below, a written notice of objection 
(the  “Objection  Notice”)  to  the  Polaris  Continuation  Resolution.  On  the  action  approved  by  the  Polaris 
Continuation  Resolution  becoming  effective,  the  making  of  an  agreement  between  Polaris  and  the  dissenting 
shareholder as to the payment to be made for the dissenting shareholder’s shares or the pronouncement of an order 
by the Yukon Court, whichever occurs first, the shareholder ceases to have any rights as a shareholder other than the 
right to be paid the fair value of his shares in an amount agreed to by Polaris and the shareholder or in the amount of 
the  judgment,  as  the  case  may  be,  which  fair  value  shall  be  determined  as  of  the  close  of  business  on  the  last 
business day before the day on which the resolution from which the shareholder dissented was adopted. Until any 
one of such events occurs, the shareholder may withdraw his dissent or Polaris may rescind the resolution and in 
either event, the proceedings shall be discontinued.
If the Polaris Continuation is approved, the dissenting shareholder who sent an Objection Notice, or Polaris, may 
apply to the Yukon Court to fix the fair value of the shares held by the dissenting shareholder and the Yukon Court 
shall make an order fixing the fair value of such shares, giving judgment in that amount against Polaris in favour of 
the dissenting shareholder and fixing the time by which Polaris must pay that amount to the dissenting shareholder. 
If such an application is made by a dissenting shareholder, Polaris shall, unless the Yukon Court otherwise orders, 
send to each dissenting shareholder a written offer (the “Offer to Purchase”) to pay to the dissenting shareholder an 
amount considered by the directors of Polaris to be the fair value of the subject shares, together with a statement 
showing how the fair value of the subject shares was determined. Every Offer to Purchase shall be on the same 
terms. At any time before the Yukon Court pronounces an order fixing the fair value of the dissenting shareholder's 
shares, a dissenting shareholder may make an agreement with Polaris for the purchase of his shares, in the amount of 
the Offer to Purchase, or otherwise. The Offer to Purchase shall be sent to each dissenting shareholder within 10 
days of Polaris being served with a copy of the originating notice. Any order of the Yukon Court may also contain 
directions in relation to the payment to the shareholder of all or part of the sum offered by Polaris for the shares, the 
deposit of the share certificates representing the shares, and other matters.
If Polaris is not permitted to make a payment to a dissenting shareholder due to there being reasonable grounds for 
believing  that  Polaris  is  or  would  after  the  payment  be  unable  to  pay  its  liabilities  as  they  become  due,  or  the 
realizable  value  of  Polaris’s  assets  would  thereby  be  less  than  the  aggregate  of  its  liabilities,  then  Polaris  shall, 
within ten days after the pronouncement of an order, or the making of an agreement between the shareholder and 
Polaris as to the payment to be made for his shares, notify each dissenting shareholder that it is unable lawfully to 
pay such dissenting shareholders for their shares.
123
Notwithstanding that a judgment has been given in favour of a dissenting shareholder by the Yukon Court, if Polaris 
is not permitted to make a payment to a dissenting shareholder for the reasons stated in the previous paragraph, the 
dissenting shareholder by written notice delivered to Polaris within 30 days after receiving the notice, as set forth in 
the  previous  paragraph,  may  withdraw his notice of objection  in which  case  Polaris  is  deemed  to  consent  to  the 
withdrawal and the shareholder is reinstated to his full rights as a shareholder, failing which he retains his status as a 
claimant against Polaris to be paid as soon as it is lawfully able to do so or, in a liquidation, to be ranked subordinate 
to the rights of creditors of Polaris but in priority to its shareholders.
In order to be effective, a written Objection Notice must be received by Polaris at 200 King Street West, Suite 1705, 
Toronto, Ontario, M5H 3T4, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or by the chairman of the Polaris Meeting, prior to 
the commencement or recommencement thereof.
The foregoing summary does not purport to provide a comprehensive statement of the procedures to be followed by 
a dissenting shareholder who seeks payment of the fair value of his shares. Section 193 of the YBCA requires strict 
adherence to the procedures established therein and failure to do so may result in the loss of all dissenters' rights. 
Accordingly,  each  shareholder  who  might  desire  to  exercise  his  right  to  dissent  should  carefully  consider  and 
comply with the provisions of the section and consult with legal counsel.
Shareholder Approval of the Polaris Continuation and Director Discretion
At the Polaris Meeting, Polaris Shareholders and Polaris Preferred Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if 
thought advisable, to pass, with or without variation, the Polaris Continuation Resolution, the full text of which is set 
forth in Appendix B to this Information Circular. The Polaris Continuation Resolution must be passed by not less 
than 66(cid:1152)% of the votes cast by the Polaris Shareholders and Polaris Preferred Shareholders, voting together as a 
single class.
The directors of Polaris reserve the right to abandon the Polaris Continuation should they deem it appropriate and in 
the best interests of Polaris to do so.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Polaris reserves the right to 
abandon the Polaris Continuation under the BCBCA if an excessive number of shareholder dissents are received.
In addition, in the event the Polaris Continuation has been effected and the Arrangement is not subsequently 
completed, the Polaris Continuation Resolution also authorizes the Polaris Board to discontinue from British 
Columbia into the Yukon under section 190 of the YBCA.
Approval of the Arrangement
At the Polaris Meeting, Polaris Securityholders will be asked to consider and, if thought advisable, to pass, with or 
without  variation,  the  Polaris  Arrangement  Resolution,  the  full  text  of  which  is  set  forth  in  Appendix  C  to  this 
Information Circular. For a description of the Arrangement, see “The Arrangement”.
Approval of New GTO Option Plan

policies of the TSX, will replace the GTO Option Plan. A copy of the New GTO Option Plan is attached to the 
Information  Circular  as  Appendix  T.  For  a  description  of  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan,  see  “Appendix  O  – 
Information Concerning New GTO – Options to Purchase Securities”.
Conditional upon the Arrangement being approved, the Polaris Shareholders and Polaris Preferred Shareholders will 
be asked to consider and, if thought appropriate, approve an ordinary resolution to approve the New GTO Option 
Plan.  The  text  of  the  ordinary  resolution  which  management  of  Polaris  intends  to  place  before  the  Polaris 
Shareholders and Polaris Preferred Shareholders at the Polaris Meeting for approval of the New GTO Option Plan is 
as follows:

Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to, completion
of the Arrangement.

The Financing

36. On August 20, 2009, GTO completed an equity ﬁnancing (the “Financing”) of

subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”) pursuant to which an aggregate of
59,800,000 Subscription Receipts were issued at a price of $3.00 per Subscription
Receipt for gross proceeds of $179,400,000. The escrowed proceeds, less the cash
commission and the expenses of the agents of the Financing (the “Escrowed Proceeds"),
are being held in escrow by CiBC Mellon Trust Company (the “Subscription Receipt
Agent") pursuant to a subscription receipt agreement among GTO, Cormark Securities
Inc. (“Cormark”) and the Subscription Receipt Agent.

37. The Escrowed Proceeds will be released to GTO, or as otherwise directed by GTO,
together with interest thereon, if, on or before 5:00 pm (Toronto time) on November 4,
2009 (the “Release Deadline"), the release certiﬁcate is delivered to the Subscription
Receipt Agent stating that the release event (“Release Event”) has occurred, The Release
Event is, essentially, the implementation of the Arrangement and the related transactions
referred to in this petition, in the event the Release Event does not occur prior to the
release deadline, the funds of the holders (“Subscription Receiptholders”) of
Subscription Receipts’ shall be returned to the Subscription Receiptholders and the
Subscription Receipts shall be deemed cancelled.

38, Upon the occurrence of the Release Event, each Subscription Receipt will be
automatically exercised as a step in the Plan of Arrangement, for no additional
consideration and without ﬁmher action on the part of the holder, into one (1) GTO
Share. Assuming completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, an aggegate
of 59,800,000 GTO Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of the Subscription
Receipts.

Beneﬁts of and Reasons for the Proposed Arrangement

39, GT 0 is a corporation without an active business. Its management has an ongoing
mandate to identify and evaluate business opportunities. In May 2009, GTO began
working with Connark to identify and pursue viable geothermal business opportunities

Cormark introduced Ram to GTO. Ram was reviewing alternatives for raising capital to

ﬁnance geothermal business opportunities. GTO and Ram discussed the alternatives

available to them, including approaching other geothermal companies who were seeking
additional capital, Col-mark identiﬁed Polaris and Western as possible companies to

approach. GTO and Ram approached Polaris and Western to determine their interest in a

business combination and the viability of such a combination. The Arrangement, and

related transactions, is the result of the resulting negotiations among the four companim.

The board of directors of each of them has determined that a business combination of the

four of them would be most beneﬁcial to each of them and their securityholders.

40. The board of directors of each of GTO, Polaris and Western believe the Arrangement
provides the following benefits for the Sewrityholders:

(a) the Arrangement, once completed, creates a signiﬁcantly stronger geothermal
company (“New GTO”) than either Polaris, Western or Ram alone, spanning all
development stages from exploration to production;

(b) the increassd size of New GTO upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram
Acquisition is expected to create synergies in development and operations and
contribute to lower average expenses and cost of capital;

(c) New GTO will have a greater market value and the GTO Shares are expected to
trade on the TSX, which is expected to improve liquidity for certain shareholders,
as well as the ability to attract new capital;

((1) upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, New GTO will
have a strong balance sheet as a result of the Financing with approximately
$162,000,000 cash and cash equivalents, as indicated on the pro forma combined
balance sheet as at June 30, 2009;

_ 21 _
VANOI:269M!6:v1


(e) subject to the provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the exchange of Polaris
Shares, Polaris Preferred Shares, Western Shares, Polaris Warrants and Western
Warrants under the Arrangement should generally occur on a tax-deferred basis;

(i) current GTO Shareholders and Polaris Secm'ityholders and Western
Securityholders who receive GTO Shares and GTO Options under the
Arrangement will have continued participation in the upside of GTO through a
stake in New GTO;

(g) New GTO will have a highly experienced management team with complementary
skills in exploration, business, project development and operations; and

(h) in connection with the Arrangement, the Polaris Debentures which are currently
due to mature on October 1], 2009 will be restructured and the Polaris
Debentureholders will receive GTO Shares, reducing the long-term debt in New
GTO.

Cormark Securities has not been asked to prepare and has not prepared a formal valuation of the Company or
Polaris, Western, Ram or any of their respective securities or assets, and the Fairness Opinion should not be
construed as such. Cormark Securities has, however, conducted such analyses as it considered necessary in the
circumstances. In addition, the Fairness Opinion is not, and should not be construed as, advice as to the price at
which the GTO Shares may trade at any future date. Cormark Securities was similarly not engaged to review any
legal, tax or accounting aspects of the Transaction. Cormark Securities has relied upon, without independent
verification or investigation, the assessment by the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors
with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. In addition, the Fairness Opinion does not address the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any other transaction involving the Company, the prospects or

With the approval of the Board and as is provided for in the Engagement Agreement, Cormark Securities has relied
upon the completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of all of the financial and other information, data, advice,
opinions and representations obtained by it from public sources or provided to it by or on behalf of the Company and

Information not misleading. The Fairness Opinion is conditional upon the completeness, accuracy and fair

exercise of professional judgment and except as expressly described herein, Cormark Securities has not attempted to
independently verify or investigate the completeness, accuracy or fair presentation of any of the Information.
With respect to financial and operating forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets provided to Cormark
Securities, as referenced under the “Scope of Review” heading of this Fairness Opinion, and used in the analyses
supporting the Fairness Opinion, Cormark Securities has noted that projecting future results of any company is
inherently subject to uncertainty. Cormark Securities has assumed that such forecasts, projections, estimates and/or
budgets were reasonably prepared consistent with industry practice on a basis reflecting the best currently available
assumptions, estimates and judgments of the respective managements of the Company, Polaris, Western and Ram as
to each companies’ future financial performance and are (or were at the time and continue to be) reasonable in the
circumstances. In rendering the Fairness Opinion, Cormark Securities expresses no view as to the reasonableness of
such forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets or the assumptions on which they are based.
5
Senior officers of the Company have represented to Cormark Securities in a certificate delivered as of the date
hereof, among other things, that (a) the Information provided by, or on behalf, of the Company or any of its affiliates
or its representatives and agents to Cormark Securities for the purpose of preparing the Fairness Opinion was, at the
date such information was provided to Cormark Securities, and is now, complete, true and correct in all material
respects, and did not and does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact in respect of the Company and its
affiliates or the Transaction and did not and does not omit to state a material fact in relation to the Company and its
affiliates or the Transaction necessary to make the Information not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which it was provided; (b) since the dates on which the Information was provided to Cormark Securities, there has
been no material change, financial or otherwise,
liabilities (contingent or
otherwise), business, operations or prospects of the Company and its affiliates and no material change has occurred
in the Information or any part thereof which would have or which would reasonably be expected to have a material
effect on the Fairness Opinion; (c) to the best of the Company’s knowledge, information and belief after due inquiry,
there are no independent appraisals or valuations or material non-independent appraisals or valuations relating to the
Company or any of its affiliates or any of their respective material assets or liabilities which have been prepared as of
a date within the two years preceding the date hereof and which have not been provided to Cormark Securities; and
(d) since the dates on which the Information was provided to Cormark Securities by the Company, no material
transaction has been entered into by the Company or any of its affiliates which has not been disclosed in complete
detail to Cormark Securities.
in the financial condition, assets,
In its analyses and in preparing the Fairness Opinion, Cormark Securities has made numerous assumptions with
respect to expected industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Cormark Securities or any party involved in the Transaction. Cormark Securities has
also assumed that the disclosure provided or incorporated by reference in the Circular and any other documents in
connection with the Transaction will be accurate in all material respects and will comply with the requirements of all
applicable laws, that all of the conditions required to implement the Transaction will be met, that the procedures
being followed to implement the Transaction are valid and effective, and that the Circular will be distributed to GTO
Shareholders in accordance with applicable laws.
This Fairness Opinion is rendered on the basis of securities markets, economic, financial and general business
conditions prevailing as at the date hereof and the condition and prospects, financial and otherwise, of the Company
and its affiliates, as they were reflected in the Information and as they have been represented to Cormark Securities
in discussions with management of the Company.
This Fairness Opinion has been provided for the exclusive use of the Board and may not be used or relied upon by
any other person. The Fairness Opinion is not to be reproduced, disseminated, quoted from or referred to (in whole
or in part) without the express prior written consent of Cormark Securities. Cormark Securities hereby consents to
the reference to Cormark Securities and the description of, reference to and reproduction of the Fairness Opinion in
the Circular prepared in connection with the Transaction for delivery to GTO Shareholders and filing with the
securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in each province and territory of Canada.
Cormark Securities believes that the Fairness Opinion must be considered and reviewed as a whole and that selecting
portions of the analyses or factors considered by Cormark Securities, without considering all the analyses and factors
together, could create a misleading view of the process underlying the Fairness Opinion. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to partial analysis or summary description.
Any attempt to do so could lead to undue emphasis on any particular factor or analysis. The Fairness Opinion is not
to be construed as a recommendation to any GTO Shareholder as to whether or not to vote in favor of the
Transaction.
The Fairness Opinion is given as of the date hereof and Cormark Securities disclaims any undertaking or obligation
to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting the Fairness Opinion which may come or be
brought to Cormark Securities’ attention after the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that there
is any material change in any fact or matter affecting the Fairness Opinion after the date hereof, Cormark Securities
reserves the right to change, modify or withdraw the Fairness Opinion.

FAIRNESS OPINION
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, Cormark Securities is of the opinion that, as at of the date hereof, the GTO
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to GTO Shareholders.

correct as of the date hereof and the Transaction will be completed substantially in accordance with
the terms and requirements of the Arrangement Agreement.
This Fairness Opinion is rendered on the basis of securities markets, economic and general business
and financial conditions prevailing as of the date hereof and the condition and prospects, financial
and otherwise, of Polaris as they were reflected in the information and documents, including, without
limitation, the Information, reviewed by Canaccord and as it was represented to Canaccord in its

its securities pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in
Special Transactions; (ii) an opinion as to the fairness of the process underlying the Transaction; or

(iii) a recommendation to any Polaris Stakeholders to take any actlon with respect to the Transactlon:
and. in each case, this Fairness Opinion should not be construed as such. Canaccord expresses no
opinion on the future trading prices of the securities of Polaris.
Approach to Fairness
The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant assumptions and methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the
partlcular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Qualitative judgments were made based upon Canaccord's
assessment of the surrounding factual circumstances relating to the Transaction and Canaccord‘s
analysis of such factual circumstances in its best judgment. Any attempt to select portions of
Canaccord's analysis or of the factors considered, without considering all of the analysis employed
and factors considered, would likely create an incomplete and misleading view of the process
underlying this Fairness Opinion. This Fairness Opinion should be read in its entirety.

the time required and that all consents, exemptions or orders ofthird parties and relevant authorities will

FAIRNESS ANALYSIS

ln rendering this Fairness Opinion, Primary has considered and performed a variety of ﬁnancial analyses.
The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and
relevant assumptions and methods of ﬁnancial analysis and the application of these methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description, Qualitative judgments were made based upon Primary’s assessment of the
surrounding factual circumstances relating to the Transaction and Primaryis analysis of such factual
circumstances in its best judgment Any attempt to select portions of Primary's analyses or of the factors
considered, without considering all of the analysis employed and factors considered, would likely create
an incomplete and misleading view of the process underlying this Fairness Opinion, This Fairness
Opinion should be read in its entirety

CONCLUSION

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and such other factors as Primary considered relevant, Primary
is of the opinion that, as the date hereof, the Mangement is fair, from a ﬁnancial point of view, to the
shareholders of Western, the holders of Western Options and the holders of Western Warrants other than
GTO and the assocrates and afﬁliates thereof

Yours truly,

K-2
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Description of the Business
During the three most recently completed financial years, GTO did not carry out commercial operations other than 
the active pursuit of potential business opportunities in various industry sectors, including the mining and oil and gas 
sectors. GTO currently has no employees and has no assets other than cash and accounts receivable.
On  June  30,  2009,  GTO  entered  into  the  Ram  Letter  of  Intent,  pursuant  to  which  GTO  agreed  to  acquire  the 
Purchased Shares. On July 14, 2009, GTO entered into the Letter of Intent, whereby GTO, Polaris, Western and 
Ram proposed to combine their respective businesses and operations. On September 8, 2009, GTO entered into the 
Arrangement  Agreement  and  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement.    See  “The  Arrangement”  for  a  description  of  the 
Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition.
Financing
On  August  20,  2009,  GTO  completed  the  Financing  pursuant  to  which  an  aggregate  of  59,800,000  Subscription 
Receipts were issued at a price of $3.00 per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of $179,400,000. The 
Escrowed Proceeds are being held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Subscription Receipt Agreement. 
Pursuant  to  the  Agency  Agreement,  the  Agents  will  receive  the  Agents’  Fee  in  consideration  for  their  services 
provided in connection with the Financing and received the GTO Broker’s Warrants.
The Escrowed Proceeds, less the Agents’ Fee, will be released to GTO, or as otherwise directed by GTO, together 
with interest thereon, if, on or before 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Release Deadline, the Release Certificate is 
delivered to the Subscription Receipt Agent stating that the Release Event has occurred. In the event the Release 
Event does not occur prior to the Release Deadline, the Subscription Receiptholder’s Funds, plus a pro rata share of 
any Earnings, less applicable withholding taxes if any, shall be returned to the Subscription Receiptholders and the 
Subscription Receipts shall be deemed cancelled.
Upon the occurrence of the Release Event, each Subscription Receipt will be automatically exercised as a step in the 
Plan of Arrangement, for no additional consideration and without further action on the part of the holder, into one 
(1) GTO Share. Assuming completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, an aggregate of 59,800,000 
GTO Shares will be issued pursuant to the Subscription Receipts.
The net proceeds of the Financing are intended to be used to develop key projects of New GTO upon completion of 
the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, to repay debt of New GTO and for general working capital purposes.  
For a description of the use of proceeds of the Financing, see “Appendix O – Information Concerning New GTO”.
RISK FACTORS
In addition to the risk factors set out below, readers should also carefully consider the risk factors set out in the 
Information Circular under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Appendix O – Information Concerning New GTO”.
All of the risk factors described below and in such Appendix should be considered in conjunction with the other 
information included in this Information Circular, including the appendices hereto.
The Business Combination May Not Be Completed
The Business Combination is subject to final acceptance of the TSX and securityholder approval. There can be no 
assurance that all of the necessary regulatory and securityholder approvals will be obtained.
Limited Operating History and History of Losses
GTO has a very limited history of operations and has no material assets other than cash. GTO has no history of 
earnings  and  will  not  generate  earnings  or  pay  dividends  until,  at  earliest,  after  completion  of  the  Business 
Combination. It is subject to many of the risks common to enterprises in a similar stage of development, including 
under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and lack of 
revenues.
K-3
Dilution
The Business Combination will be financed in all or part by the issuance of additional securities of GTO and this 
will result in further dilution to the investor, which dilution will be significant and which will also result in a change 
of control of GTO.
Additional Funding Requirements
GTO currently has no cash flow from operations. From time to time, GTO may require additional financing in order 
to carry out its operations. Failure to obtain such financing on a timely basis could cause GTO to reduce or terminate 
its operations. If GTO’s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or 
available on terms acceptable to GTO.
Reliance on Key Personnel
GTO’s success depends in large measure on certain key personnel. The loss of such services of such key personnel 
could have a material adverse effect on GTO. The competition for qualified personnel is intense and there can be no 
assurance that GTO will be able to continue to attract and retain all personnel necessary for the development and 
operation of its business. Shareholders of GTO must rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity 
and good faith of the management of GTO.
Dividends
GTO has not paid any dividends on the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares. Payment of dividends in the future will be 
dependent on, among other things, the cash flow, results of operations and financial condition of GTO, the need for 
funds to finance ongoing operations and other business considerations as the GTO Board considers relevant.
Conflicts of Interest
There are potential conflicts of interest to which the directors and officers of GTO are subject with respect to the 
operations of GTO.  Certain of the directors and/or officers serve as directors and/or officers of other companies or 
have significant shareholdings in other companies.  Situations may arise where the directors and officers of GTO 
will  be  engaged  in  direct  competition  with  GTO.    Any  conflicts  of  interest  will  be  subject  to  and  governed  by 
Applicable  Law  to  directors  and  officers’  conflicts  of  interest,  including  the  procedures  prescribed  under  the 
BCBCA.  The BCBCA requires that directors and officers of GTO, who are also directors or officers of a party 
which enters into a material contract with GTO or otherwise have a material interest in a material contract entered 
into by GTO, must disclose their interest and, in certain instances, refrain from voting on any resolution of GTO’s 
directors to approve the contract.
DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS
Since  incorporation,  GTO  has  not  paid  any  dividends  or  made  any  distributions  on  the  GTO  Pre-Consolidation 
Shares. Dividends or distributions on the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares will be paid solely at the discretion of the 
GTO Board after taking into account the financial condition of GTO and the economic environment in which it is 
operating. No dividends or distributions are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
See the financial statements and related management’s discussion and analysis of GTO for the three month period 
ended  May  31,  2009  and  the  years  ended  February  28,  2009,  February  29,  2008  and  February  28,  2007,  which 
(excluding the unaudited interim financial statements of GTO for the three month period ended May 31, 2009) have 
been  incorporated  by  reference  and  form  a  part  of  this  Information  Circular.  See  “Documents  Incorporated  by 
Reference”. The unaudited interim financial statements of GTO for the three month period ended May 31, 2009 are 
attached to this Appendix as Exhibit 1.
K-4
DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL OF GTO
GTO is authorized to issue an unlimited number of GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares without nominal or par value, of 
which, as at September 15, 2009, 8,027,398 GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares are issued and outstanding as fully paid 
and non-assessable. The holders of GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares are entitled to dividends, if, as when declared by 
the GTO Board, to one vote per share at meetings of GTO Shareholders and, upon dissolution, to share equally in

Corporate Cease Trade Orders
Other than as disclosed in this Information Circular, no director or executive officer of GTO is, as at the date of this 
Information Circular, or was within 10 years before the date of this Information Circular, a director, chief executive 
officer or chief financial officer of any company (including GTO ), that was:
(i)
subject  to  a  cease  trade  or  similar  order  or  an  order  that  denied  the  relevant  company  access  to  any 
exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that 
was issued while the director or executive officer was acting in the capacity as director, chief executive 
officer or chief financial officer; or
K-7
(ii)
subject  to  a  cease  trade  or  similar  order  or  an  order  that  denied  the  relevant  company  access  to  any 
exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that 
was issued after the director or executive officer ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief 
financial  officer  and  which  resulted  from  an  event  that  occurred  while  that  person  was  acting  in  the 
capacity as director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer.
A. Murray Sinclair was a director of Katanga Mining Limited (formerly Balloch Resources Ltd. and New Inca Gold 
Ltd.) from May 1, 1998 to July 10, 2006. On February 25, 2002, the BCSC, the ASC and the OSC issued the Cease 
Trade Orders against New Inca for failure to file financial statements within the prescribed period of time and failing 
to  pay  the  required  filing  fees.  New  Inca  subsequently  filed  the  financial  statements  and  paid  the  filing  fees  as 
required. The Cease Traded Orders issued by the ASC and the BCSC were rescinded in October 2003 and the Cease 
Trade Order issued by the OSC was issued in March 2003.
A. Murray Sinclair was a director of PetroFalcon from November 28, 2001 to June 4, 2003. On February 27, 2002, 
the BCSC issued an order regarding a private placement of PetroFalcon to Quest Ventures, a private company in 
which  Mr.  Sinclair  was  also  a  director.  The  BCSC  considered  it  to  be  in  the  public  interest  to  remove  the 
applicability of certain exemptions from the prospectus and registration requirements of the Securities Act (British 
Columbia) for PetroFalcon until a shareholders meeting of PetroFalcon was held. In addition, the BCSC removed 
the applicability of the same exemptions for Quest Ventures in respect of the common shares received pursuant to 
the private placement. Approval of the shareholders was received on May 23, 2002 and the BCSC reinstated the 
applicability  of  the  exemptions  from  the  prospectus  and  registration  requirements  for  both  companies  shortly 
thereafter.
James S. Kermeen is a director of GLR. The BCSC and the OSC issued cease trade orders against GLR on April 14, 
2009  and  April  27,  2009,  respectively,  for  failure  to  file  annual  financial  statements  and  MD&A  and  an  annual 
information form of GLR in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2008.
Bankruptcies
Other  than  as  disclosed  in  this  Information  Circular,  no  director  or  executive  officer  of  GTO,  or  a  shareholder 
holding a sufficient number of securities of GTO to affect materially the control of GTO:
(i)
(ii)
is,  as  at  the  date  of  this  Information  Circular,  or  has  been  within  the  10  years  before  the  date  of  this 
Information  Circular,  a  director  or  executive  officer  of  any  company  (including  GTO  )  that,  while  that 
person was acting in that capacity, or within a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became 
bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject to or 
instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager 
or trustee appointed to hold its assets; or
has, within the 10 years before the date of this Information Circular, become bankrupt, made a proposal 
under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency,  or  become  subject  to  or  instituted  any 
proceedings,  arrangement  or  compromise  with  creditors,  or  had  a  receiver,  receiver  manager  or  trustee 
appointed to hold the assets of the director, executive officer or shareholder.
James Kermeen is a director of GLR. On May 26, 2009, GLR signed a purchase and sale agreement with Linear 
whereby  GLR  agreed  to  sell  its  100%  interest  in  the  Goldfields  Mine  Project  located  near  Uranium  City, 
Saskatchewan pursuant to the GLR Sale.  On May 29, 2009, GLR filed a Notice of Intention to make a Proposal 
under  the  Bankruptcy  Act  regarding  the  GLR  Sale.  On  June  5,  2009,  the  Proposal  was  filed  with  the  Official 
Receiver appointed under the Bankruptcy Act.  In connection therewith, the Trustee was appointed.  A meeting of 
the creditors of GLR was held on July 30, 2009 for the purpose of seeking creditor approval of the Proposal. Of the 
duly proved claims filed with the Trustee, 98.6% of creditors, either by voting letter or by proxy, voted in favour of 
the Proposal.  On August 18, 2009, the Proposal received court approval and on August 21, 2009, the GLR Sale was 
completed.
Penalties or Sanctions
Other  than  as  disclosed  in  the  Information  Circular,  no  director  or  executive  officer  of  GTO,  or  a  shareholder 
holding a sufficient number of securities of GTO to affect materially the control of GTO, has been subject to:
K-8
(i)
(ii)
any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory 
authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities regulatory authority; or
any  other  penalties  or  sanctions  imposed  by  a  court or  regulatory  body  that  would  likely  be  considered 
important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision.
Conflicts of Interest
There are potential conflicts of interest to which the directors and officers of GTO are subject with respect to the 
operations of GTO.  Certain of the directors and/or officers serve as directors and/or officers of other companies or 
have significant shareholdings in other companies.  Situations may arise where the directors and officers of GTO 
will  be  engaged  in  direct  competition  with  GTO.    Any  conflicts  of  interest  will  be  subject  to  and  governed  by 
Applicable  Law  to  directors  and  officers’  conflicts  of  interest,  including  the  procedures  prescribed  under  the 
BCBCA.  The BCBCA requires that directors and officers of GTO, who are also directors or officers of a party 
which enters into a material contract with GTO or otherwise have a material interest in a material contract entered 
into by GTO, must disclose their interest and, in certain instances, refrain from voting on any resolution of GTO’s 
directors to approve the contract.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
One  of  the  mandates  of  the  GTO  Board  includes  the  review  and  setting  of  executive  compensation.    The  GTO 
Board, in arriving at its compensation decisions, considers the long-term interest of GTO and its stakeholders, and 
its  historical  and  current  stage  of  development.  GTO’s  executive  compensation  program  is  designed  to  reward 
officers where they have contributed to the prosperity and growth of GTO.
Given GTO’s current stage of development, during the financial year ended February 28, 2009, GTO paid no cash 
compensation (including salaries, commissions and bonuses) to the directors and executive officers of GTO. GTO’s 
executive compensation program is currently limited to participation in GTO Option Plan, which provides for equity 
participation in GTO by eligible directors, officers, employees and consultants through the acquisition of GTO Pre-
Consolidation Shares pursuant to the grant of options. The grant of options is intended to encourage and reward 
outstanding performance over the long term.  Given GTO’s current stage of development, no options to purchase 
GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares were granted by GTO during the financial year ended February 28, 2009.
The GTO Board is responsible for administering the GTO Option Plan. Options to purchase GTO Pre-Consolidation 
Shares may be granted on terms that the GTO Board may determine, subject to the limitations of the GTO Option 
Plan and the requirements of any stock exchange or exchange in which the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares are listed.
The GTO Option Plan reserves a rolling maximum of 10% of the issued GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares at the time 
of  the  option  grant.  Unless  disinterested  shareholder  approval  is  obtained,  no  more  than  5%  of  the  GTO  Pre-
Consolidation Shares outstanding at the time of grant may be reserved for issuance to any one individual in any 12 
month  period.  No  more  than  2%  of  the  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares  outstanding  at  the  time  of  grant  may  be 
reserved for issuance to any Consultant (as defined in the policies of the TSXV) in any 12 month period. Further, no 
more  than  an  aggregate  of  2%  of  the  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares  at  the  time  of  grant  may  be  reserved  for 
issuance to any person conducting Investor Relations Activities (as defined in the policies of the TSXV) in any 12 
month period. The minimum exercise price of an option cannot be less than the Market Price (as determined by the 
policies of the TSXV) of the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares less any applicable discount pursuant to the policies of 
the  TSXV.  Any  options  granted  may  have  a  maximum  exercise  period  of  five  (5)  years  and  options  are  non-
assignable and non transferable. The GTO Option Plan contains provisions for adjustment in the number of GTO 
Pre-Consolidation Shares issuable on exercise of incentive stock options in the event of a share consolidation, split, 
reclassification or other relevant change in the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares, or an amalgamation, merger or other 
relevant change in GTO’s corporate structure.
Pursuant to the policies of the TSXV, stock option plans which reserve for issuance up to 10% of a listed issuer’s 
shares (commonly known as “rolling” stock option plans)  must be approved annually by the shareholders of the 
listed issuer. Accordingly, the GTO Option Plan will be submitted to the GTO Shareholders for re-approval at the 
GTO Meeting.  See “Matters to be Approved at the Meetings – The GTO Meeting”.
K-9
Compensation of Named Executive Officers and Directors of GTO
During the financial year ended February 28, 2009, GTO had two “Named Executive Officers”, namely A. Murray 
Sinclair, the President and Chief Executive Officer of GTO and K. Peter Miller, the Chief Financial Officer of GTO 
(collectively, the “GTO Named Executive Officers”). “Named Executive Officer” is defined by Form 51-102F6 – 
Statement  of  Executive  Compensation  (“Form  51-102F6”)  to  mean:  (a)  a  Chief  Executive  Officer;  (b)  a  Chief 
Financial  Officer;  (c)  each  of  the  three  most  highly  compensated  executive  officers,  or  the  three  most  highly 
compensated individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, at the end of the most recently completed financial year whose total compensation was, individually, more 
than $150,000, as determined in accordance with subsection 1.3(6) of Form 51-102F6, for that financial year; and 
(d) each individual who would be a Named Executive Officer under paragraph (c) but for the fact that the individual 
was neither an executive officer of the company, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of the financial year.
During the financial year ended February 28, 2009, the GTO Named Executive Officers received no compensation 
from GTO, either in the form of cash compensation or otherwise. Furthermore, no options to purchase GTO Pre-
Consolidation Shares were granted to the GTO Named Executive Officers and no options to purchase GTO Pre-
Consolidation Shares were held by the GTO Named Executive Officers during the financial year ended February 28, 
2009.
During  the  financial  year  ended  February  28,  2009,  the  directors  of  GTO  received  no  compensation  from  GTO, 
either in the form of cash compensation or otherwise. Furthermore, no options to purchase GTO Pre-Consolidation 
Shares were granted to the directors of GTO and no options to purchase GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares were held 
by the directors of GTO during the financial year ended February 28, 2009. Subsequent to the year ended February 
28, 2009, the directors were each paid a director’s fee in the amount of $10,000.
Incentive Plan Awards
GTO  did  not  have  any  option-based  awards  or  share-based  awards  outstanding  during  the  financial  year  ended 
February 28, 2009.
Pension Plan Benefits
GTO currently does not have any pension plans in place.
Termination and Change of Control Benefits
There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for payments to a GTO Named Executive Officer 
at, following or in connection with any termination (whether voluntary, involuntary or constructive), resignation, 
retirement, a change in control of GTO or a change in a GTO Named Executive Officer’s responsibilities.

Exemption
As a venture issuer, GTO is relying on the exemption in section 6.1 of NI 52-110 - Venture Issuers.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
National Policy 58-201 – Corporate Governance Guidelines sets out a series of guidelines for effective corporate 
governance.  The  guidelines  address  matters  such  as  the  composition  and  independence  of  corporate  boards,  the 
functions to be performed by boards and their committees, and the effectiveness and education of board members. 
Each  reporting  issuer,  such  as  GTO,  must  disclose  on  an  annual  basis  and  in  prescribed  form,  the  corporate 
governance  practices  that  it  has  adopted.  The  following  is  GTO’s  required  annual  disclosure  of  its  corporate 
governance practices in accordance with Form 58-101F2 – Corporate Governance Disclosure (Venture Issuers).
Board of Directors
The  GTO  Board  considers  that  Donn  Burchill,  Eugene  Sekora,  James  S.  Kerman  and  Stewart  Robertson  are 
independent according to the definition of “independence” as set out in NI 52-110 as it applies to the GTO Board. A.  
Murray Sinclair is not independent as he is currently a member of management of GTO.
The GTO Board facilitates its exercise of independent supervision over management by having a majority of the 
GTO Board members consist of individuals who are independent of GTO, as defined in NI 52-110. The GTO Board 
approves all significant decisions that affect GTO before they are implemented. The GTO Board supervises their 
implementation and reviews the results. The GTO Board is actively involved in GTO’s strategic planning process. 
The GTO Board discusses and reviews all materials relating to strategic and operating plans with management. The 
GTO  Board  is  responsible  for  reviewing  and  approving  strategic  and  operating  plans  and  budgets.  Management 
must seek the GTO Board’s approval for any transaction that would have a significant impact on the strategic plan.
The GTO Board is responsible for selecting the President and appointing senior management and for monitoring 
their  performance.  The  GTO  Board  delegates  to  management  responsibility  for,  among  other  things,  meeting 
defined  corporate  objectives,  implementing  approved  strategic  and  operating  plans,  carrying  on  GTO’s  business, 
evaluating new business opportunities and complying with applicable regulatory requirements.

The  management  and  decision  making  structure  of  GTO  closely  aligns  the  senior  management  of  GTO  to  all 
material  decision  making.  This  provides  for  regular  input  to  and  reinforcement  of  a  culture  of  ethical  business 
conduct required by the GTO Board and senior management in day-to-day business activities. The GTO Board has 
also  adopted  a  whistleblower  protection  policy  with  respect  to  the  confidential  and  anonymous  reporting  of 
complaints and irregularities.
Nomination of and Assessments of Directors
The  GTO  Board  as  a whole remains  responsible  for nominating new  members  of  the GTO  Board  and  assessing 
members of the GTO Board on an on-going basis. If it becomes necessary, a nomination committee will be created 
which  in  turn  will  develop  relevant  criteria  for  suitable  candidates  including  the  independence  of  the  individual, 
financial acumen and availability to devote sufficient time to the duties of the GTO Board.
Compensation
The  GTO  Board  as  a  whole  reviews  and  approves  compensation  for  directors  and  senior  officers  including 
determining  the  base  salary,  incentive  compensation  and  long-term  compensation  for  GTO’s  Chief  Executive 
Officer.
Other Board Committees
The only standing committee of the GTO Board is the Audit Committee. For further information regarding the Audit 
Committee, see the description under the heading “Audit Committee”.

effectively.

its assets or properties are subject, nor are there any such proceedings known to be contemplated.

Notes to Financial Statements 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars) 
(Unaudited) 
May 31, 2009
1.  Basis of presentation:
These  unaudited  interim  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Canadian 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.    All  financial  summaries  included  are  presented  on  a 
comparative and consistent basis showing the figures for the corresponding period in the preceding 
year.  The presentation of financial data is based on accounting principles and practices consistent 
with  those  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  annual  financial  statements.    Certain  information  and 
footnote disclosure normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with 
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles has been condensed or omitted.  These interim 
period  statements  should  be  read  together  with  the  audited  financial  statements  and  the 
accompanying notes included in the Company’s latest annual filing.  In  the opinion of the Company, 
its unaudited interim financial statements contain all adjustments necessary in order to present a fair 
statement of the results of the interim period presented.  Operating results for the three month period 
ended May 31, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year 
ended February 28, 2010.
2.  Significant accounting policies:
(a)  Nature and continuance of operations:
GTO  Resources  Inc.,  which  is  listed  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  –  NEX  Board,  is  in  the 
business of acquiring and exploring mineral properties. The Company is currently in a transitional 
stage during which potential new ventures are being sought and evaluated.
The Company's ability to continue its operations and to realize assets at their carrying values is 
dependent  upon  the  continued  support  of  its  shareholders,  obtaining  additional  financing  and 
generating revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs.
These  financial  statements  do  not  give  effect  to  any  adjustments  which  would  be  necessary 
should  the  Company  be  unable  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  therefore  be  required  to 
realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business at amounts different 
from those reflected in the financial statements.
(b)  Use of estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  Canadian  generally  accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the 
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
period. A significant area requiring the use of management estimates is the valuation allowance 
for future income tax assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on 
other assumptions considered to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results 
may differ from the estimates.

3.  Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Recent Pronouncements:
Adoption of New Accounting Standards: 
CICA 3064, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets” 
In February 2008, the CICA issued Handbook Section 3064, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”, which 
replaces  Section  3062,  “Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets”,  and  Section  3450,  “Research  and 
Development  Costs”.  Section  3064  establishes  standards  for  the  recognition,  measurement  and 
disclosure  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets.  The  Company  does  not  hold  any  such  assets  at  this 
time.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")  
In 2006, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board ("AcSB") published a new strategic plan that will 
significantly affect financial reporting requirements for Canadian companies. The AcSB  strategic plan 
outlines the convergence of Canadian GAAP with IFRS over an expected five year transitional period. 
 In  February  2008  the  AcSB  announced  that  2011  is  the  changeover  date  for  publicly-listed 
companies to use IFRS, replacing Canada's own GAAP.  The date is for interim and annual financial 
statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. For GTO this will apply to its 
fiscal  year  commencing  March  1,  2011.   This  transition  date  will  require  the  restatement  for 
comparative purposes of amounts reported by the Company for the year ended February 28, 2011. 
 While  the  Company  has  begun  assessing  the  adoption  of  IFRS  for  2011,  the  financial  reporting 
impact of the transition to IFRS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Business combinations 
Section  1582,  Business  Combinations,  is  replacing  Section  1581,  Business  Combinations  and 
establishes  standards  for  the  accounting  for  a  business  combination.    It  provides  the  Canadian 
equivalent  to  the  IFRS  standard,  IFRS  3  (revised),  Business  Combinations.    The  Section  applies 
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011.  
Earlier application is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new Section.
Consolidated financial statements and non-controlling interests 
Section  1601,  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Section  1602,  Non-Controlling  Interests, 
together  replace  Section  1600,  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.    Section  1601  establishes 
standards  for  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements.    Section  1602  establishes 
standards  for  accounting  for  a  non-controlling  interest  in  a  subsidiary  in  consolidated  financial 
statements subsequent to a business combination.  It is equivalent to the corresponding provisions of 
IFRS  standard,  IAS27  (revised),  Consolidated  and  Separate  Financial  Statements.    The  sections 
apply  to  interim  and  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  relating  to  fiscal  years  beginning  on 
January 1, 2011.  Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year.  The Company is 
currently evaluating the impact of these new Sections.

4. Financial instruments
The Company has determined the fair value of its cash, amounts receivable, prepaids and accounts 
payable approximates their respective carrying amounts as at the balance sheet dates because of the 
short term maturity of those instruments. 
Risk Management
Interest rate, credit and liquidity risk 
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk with regard to the cash.  The Company holds its cash in 
a major Canadian banking institution or in one of its interest bearing financial products for periods up 
to 364 days.  The credit, liquidity and interest rate risks are limited. 
Foreign exchange risk 
The Company did not conduct any foreign business nor did it hold any foreign currencies during the 
reporting period and therefore it has no exposure to foreign exchange risk.

(c)  The  Company  has  a  stock  option  plan  administered  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  which  has  the 
discretion to grant options for up to 10% of the issued shares of the Company at grant date. The 
option  price  under  each  option  shall  be  not  less  than  the  market  price  on  the  grant  date.  The 
expiry date for each option shall be set by the Board of Directors at the time the option is granted 
and  shall  not  be  more  than  five  years  after  the  grant  date.  Options  granted  to  consultants 
performing  investor  relations  activities  will  contain  vesting  provisions  such  that  vesting  occurs 
over at least 12 months with no more than 25% of the options vesting in any three-month period. 
There were no stock options or warrants outstanding at May 31, 2009 and February 28, 2009.

6.  Related Party Transactions:
Pursuant to an agreement dated December 1, 2004 the Company paid a company related by virtue of 
a  director  and  two  officers  in  common,  a  fee  of  $7,500  ($2,500  per  month)  for  office  space, 
administration,  and  accounting  services.  Included  in  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  is

The above transactions were in the normal course of business and were measured at the exchange 
amount which is the amount agreed to by the related parties.
7. Capital disclosures
The Company is a TSX venture company and considers the items included in Shareholders Equity as 
capital.  The Company’s objective in managing its share capital is to ensure it raises sufficient equity 
capital  to  pursue  potential  investments,  to  fund  its  exploration  programs  and  provide  sufficient 
working capital to meet its ongoing obligations. 
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and does not presently 
utilize any quantitative measures to monitor its capital.
8.  Subsequent events
Subsequent to May 31, 2009, GTO entered into a letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Polaris Geothermal 
(“Polaris”; TSX:GEO), Western GeoPower Corp. (“Western”; TSX-V:WGP) and Ram Power, Inc., a 
private Delaware corporation (“Ram”) with respect to a proposed business combination to create a 
new, publicly-traded geothermal power company (the “Transaction”).    
In  connection  with  the  LOI,  GTO  raised  $179,400,000  in  a  private  placement.    An  aggregate  of 
59,800,000  subscription  receipts  were  issued  at  a  price  of  $3.00  per  subscription  receipt,  each 
exercisable  into  one  common  share  of  GTO  (after  giving  effect  to  a  10  for  1  consolidation).    The 
proceeds  from  the  private  placement,  less  agents’  expenses,  are  held  in  escrow  pending  the 
completion of the Transaction.
On September 8, 2009 GTO entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Polaris and Western and a 
Share Purchase Agreement with Ram and Ram’s shareholders to effect the Transaction.  Completion 
of  the  Transaction  is  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions  and  approval  including:  approval  of 
securityholders  of  GTO,  Polaris,  and  Western  at  a  special  meeting  of  such  securityholders;  court 
approval; and the approval of all relevant regulatory authorities and third parties.  There can be no 
assurance that the Transaction will be completed as proposed or at all.  The Arrangement Agreement 
and  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  provide  for  termination  rights,  including  in  the  event  the 
Transaction is not completed by November 4, 2009.

and other parts of the world.  Polaris currently owns and operates, through its subsidiary Polaris Energy Nicaragua 
S.A. (formerly San Jacinto Power S.A.), the San Jacinto Project located near the City of Leon, Nicaragua.  The San 
Jacinto Project currently produces 10 MW of geothermal power, and ongoing Phase I expansion efforts are expected 
to  increase  production  to  34MW  initially  and  then  to  72MW.    The  San  Jacinto  Project  is  currently  the  focus  of 
Polaris’  operations  and  constitutes  Polaris’  principal  property.    Polaris  also  owns,  through  its  subsidiary  Cerro 
Colorado Power, S.A. (Nicaragua), the Casita-San Cristobal geothermal located to the northwest of the San Jacinto 
Project.  Additionally, Polaris also owns 99% of Polaris Energy Chile Limitada (Chile), the purpose of which is the 
exploration and development of geothermal concessions in Chile.
More  detailed  information  regarding  Polaris,  its  operations  and  its  properties  can  be  found  in  the  AIF  and  other 
publicly  filed  documents,  which  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference.    See  “Documents  Incorporated  by 
Reference”.
CONSOLIDATED CAPITALIZATION
Since June 30, 2009, other than as described herein or in the documents incorporated by reference herein, there have 
been no material changes in the share and loan capital of Polaris.
DESCRIPTION OF VOTING SECURITIES
As of September 15, 2009, there were 125,995,395 Polaris Shares issued and outstanding, with each Polaris Share 
entitled to one vote on any matter to be considered by shareholders at the Polaris Meeting.  The outstanding Polaris 
Shares are listed for trading on the TSX under the symbol “GEO”.
Additionally, as of September 15, 2009, there were 5,535,605 Polaris Preferred Shares issued and outstanding, with 
each  Polaris  Preferred  Share  entitled  to  one  vote  on  any  matter  to  be  considered  by  shareholders  at  the  Polaris 
Meeting.  The Polaris Preferred Shares are not listed for trading on any stock exchange or quotation system but are 
convertible into Polaris Shares on a one to one basis in accordance with their terms.
On March 31, 2009, Polaris issued a notice of redemption to redeem all 185,753 outstanding Class B non-voting 
common shares effective March 31, 2009.  The Class B non-voting common shares were issued in conjunction with 
the amalgamation of Polaris and Iriana Resources Corporation on July 21, 2004, on terms which permitted their 
redemption  on  a  date,  no  earlier  than  January  31,  2005,  at  a  redemption  price  of  $1.00  per  Class  B  non-voting 
common  share  (the  “Redemption  Price”)  plus  any  declared  and  unpaid  dividend.    Effective  March  31,  2009, 
holders of Class B non-voting common shares no longer have any rights as shareholders of Polaris, other than the 
entitlement  to  the  Redemption  Price  upon  delivery  to  Equity  Transfer  &  Trust  Company,  Polaris’  registrar  and 
redemption agent, of a duly completed letter of transmittal and all corresponding documentation (including original 
share certificates).  Holders of Class B non-voting common shares are therefore not entitled to receive notice 
of, attend, or vote on any of the resolutions to be voted on at the Polaris Meeting.

RISK FACTORS
In addition to the risk factors cited below, the reader should carefully consider the risk factors listed on pages 18 to 
20 of the AIF, as well as the risk factors and other information contained in this management information circular 
and in the documents incorporated by reference herein.  Please see “Documents Incorporated by Reference”.
Possible Default under Polaris Debentures if the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition are not Completed
Polaris’ future operations and ability to continue as a going concern may be dependent upon its ability to complete 
the Arrangement.  The Polaris Debentures mature on October 11, 2009 (“Maturity” or the “Maturity Date”), at 
which  time  the  entire  principal  sum  of  $27,000,000  plus  accrued  interest  owing  thereunder  (the  “Outstanding 
Balance”) is repayable in full.  Polaris does not currently have sufficient funds to repay the Outstanding Balance.  
Polaris is presently in negotiations with the Polaris Debentureholders seeking an extension of the Maturity Date to 
the  Outside  Date  in  order  to  facilitate  the  transactions  contemplated  herein.    The  Arrangement  Agreement  also 
contemplates that the Polaris Debentures will be exchanged for GTO Shares upon Closing.
In the event that the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition are not completed on or before the Outside Date, Polaris 
will need to seek replacement financing in order to permit the repayment of the Outstanding Balance on or before 
the Maturity Date, and such replacement financing may or may not be available.  In the event that Polaris fails to 
repay the Outstanding Balance on or before the Maturity Date, the Polaris Debentureholders would have the right to 
enforce their security over all of the assets of Polaris.
L-6
Possible  Termination  of  San  Jacinto-Tizate  Geothermal  Concession  by  Nicaraguan  Ministry  of  Energy  and 
Mines
In the event that the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition are not completed on or before the Outside Date, Polaris 
may not have sufficient funds to commence construction of Phase I-MCT steamfield and power plant installations at 
San  Jacinto-Tizate  by  October  31,  2009, as  required by the  Nicaraguan  Ministry of Energy  and  Mines.   In  such 
circumstances,  the  Nicaraguan  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  could  terminate  Polaris’  rights  to  the  San  Jacinto-
Tizate concession.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS
General
Western is engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing geothermal energy properties. Western’s 
principal projects are The Geysers Project located at The Geysers Geothermal Field (“The Geysers”) in Sonoma 
County, California, the South Meager Project located in British Columbia, and the South Brawley Project located in 
Imperial County, California. See “Description of the Business” below.
Three Year History
On  September  8,  2009,  Western  entered  into  the  Arrangement  Agreement  whereby  GTO  will  acquire  all  of  the 
outstanding  securities  of  Polaris  and  Western  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement.  The  closing  of  the  Arrangement  is 
conditional upon the completion of the Ram Acquisition. See “The Arrangement- The Arrangement Agreement” and 
“Related Transactions – The Ram Acquisition” in the Information Circular.
On September 1, 2009, Mr. Kenneth MacLeod resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer of Western, and 
Mr.  Daryl  Clark  assumed  the  positions  of  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Western,  in  addition  to  Mr. 
Clark’s current position as Chairman of Western.  Mr. Clark agreed to provide his services as President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Western as an independent contractor for consideration of $15,000 per month.  The agreement 
is terminable upon two weeks’ notice by Western or Mr. Clark.  Effective as of September 2, 2009, no board or 
board committee fees are payable to Mr. Clark by Western.

Western retained GeothermEx to develop and calibrate a reservoir model of Western’s leasehold for The Geysers 
Project incorporating the data from the wells Western drilled on the leasehold.  GeothermEx’s report of August 11, 
2009, indicates, based on its reservoir model, that it may be possible to sustain a plant capacity of 35 MWe (net) 
over the project life of 20 years, but only if an undrilled portion of Western’s leasehold prove as productive as areas 
drilled to date.  Alternatively, GeothermEx’s reservoir modelling indicates a plant capacity of 25 MWe (net) can be 
sustained  over  the  entire  project  life  of  20  years,  supported  by  seven  production  wells  located  within  proven 
productive areas.  The findings of The Geysers Report are subject to certain assumptions and qualifications.  In light 
of  the  Geysers  Report,  management  of  Western  is  considering  potential  strategies,  including,  without  limitation, 
commencing  the  initial  plant  output  at  25  MWe  (net)  or  expanding  the  drilling  program  to  include  lands  on 
Western’s leasehold for The Geysers Project where resources have not yet been proven.  See “Description of the 
Business – The Geysers Project” below.
In  2009,  Western  completed  the  acquisition  of  approximately  3,000  acres  of  private  geothermal  leases  with  a 
confirmed high-temperature geothermal reservoir, at South Brawley, in Imperial County, California. These leases 
grant  Western  the  right  to  develop  the  geothermal  reservoir  and  build  a  plant  for  electricity  generation.  See 
“Description of the Business - South Brawley Project” below.
In November of 2008, Western secured a US$11 million secured loan facility. In January of 2009, Western secured 
an additional US$11 million credit facility, which in July of 2009 was increased to US$12.35 million. These loans 
are secured by all of the assets of Western. As at the date of this Information Circular the loan facilities have been 
fully drawn upon by Western.
Between March and December of 2008, Western completed the drilling of four geothermal wells at The Geysers 
Project. See “Description of the Business – The Geysers Project” below.
In May of 2008, Western entered into a power purchase agreement with the Northern California Power Agency for 
the supply of approximately 265,000 MWhr per year of electricity at a price of USD$98 per MWhr for 20 years 
from  the  power  plant  planned  to  be  constructed  at  The Geysers  Project.  See  “Description  of  the  Business –  The 
Geysers Project” below.
During 2006 and 2007, Western entered into four geothermal leases covering approximately 1,045 acres within The 
Geysers Geothermal Field in Sonoma County, California. These leases grant Western the right to re-develop the 
geothermal  reservoir  and  build  a  new  plant  for  electricity  generation.  See  “Description  of  the  Business  –  The 
Geysers Project” below.
Overview of Geothermal Energy
DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable and generally sustainable energy source that, because it does not utilize 
combustion in the production of electricity, typically releases significantly lower levels of emissions than result from 
energy generation based on the burning of fossil fuels.  Geothermal energy is derived from the natural heat of the 
earth  when  water  comes  sufficiently  close  to  hot  molten  rock  to  heat  the  water  to  temperatures  of  300  degrees 
Fahrenheit or more. The heated water then ascends toward the surface of the earth where, if geological conditions 
are suitable for its commercial extraction, it can be extracted by drilling geothermal wells. The energy necessary to 
operate a geothermal power plant is typically obtained from several such wells, which are drilled using established 
technology that is in some respects similar to that employed in the oil and gas industry. Geothermal production wells 
are normally located within approximately one to two miles of the power plant as geothermal fluids generally cannot 
be transported economically over longer distances due to heat loss and redistributive costs. The geothermal reservoir 
is a renewable source of energy if natural ground water sources and the re-injection of extracted geothermal fluids 
are adequate over the long term to replenish the geothermal reservoir after the withdrawal of geothermal fluids, as 
long as the wellfield is properly operated. Geothermal energy projects typically have higher capital costs (primarily 
as a result of wellfield development) but tend to have significantly lower variable costs, principally consisting of 
maintenance  capital  expenditures,  than  fossil  fuel-fired  power  plants  that  require  ongoing  fuel  expenses.    The 
primary emission from geothermal energy projects is steam.

The Geysers Project – The Geysers Field, California, USA
Overview
The Geysers Project is a planned project to develop, construct and operate a steam-electric generation facility, an 
electric switchyard with transmission interconnection, a geothermal wellfield with steam collection and condensate 
re-injection systems, and related auxiliary systems located on approximately 200 acres in the Mayacamas Mountains 
of  Sonoma  County,  California,  approximately  12  miles  north  of  the  City  of Healdsburg.    The  site  is  within  The 
Geysers Geothermal Field.
Project Financing
Western plans to finance the construction and further development of The Geysers Project through a combination of 
equity  and  debt  financing.    Western  has  engaged  Raymond  James  &  Associates,  Inc.  to  assist  in  raising  such 
financing.  There can be no assurances that Western will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to Western.  
In the event Western is unable to obtain such financing, Western currently plans not to commence plant construction 
and will be required to curtail development of The Geysers Project.
The Geysers Project’s Geothermal Power Technology
The Geysers Project will employ dry steam technology to convert geothermal resource, primarily steam, to energy.  
In  a  plant  using  dry  steam  technology,  the  steam  is  extracted  from  the  underground  reservoir  by  a  series  of 
production  wells  and  piped  into  the  energy  generating  unit.    At  the  wellhead,  the  geothermal  fluids  consist  of  a 
mixture  of  non-condensable  gases  and  steam.    The  heated  mixture  flows  from  the  wellhead  through  gathering 
system of insulated steel pipes to a steam scrubber where the steam is scrubbed of contaminants that may impact the 
turbine.  This produces a stream of clean dry steam, which goes directly to a turbine, which drives a generator that 
produces electricity.  Steam exhausted from the steam turbine is passed to a surface condenser through which cold 
water circulates.  Moisture in the steam leaving the turbine generators condenses on the condenser tubes and after 
being cooled further in a cooling tower, is used to provide cold circulating water for the condenser or is injected 
back into the geothermal reservoir.  The dry steam technology is depicted in the graphic below.
M-5
Design and Construction
Preliminary power plant and switchyard design for The Geysers Project has been performed by Power Engineers, 
Inc., a power plant and electric transmission design engineering firm founded in 1976 and headquartered in Hailey, 
Idaho.  Development of the geothermal reservoir is being managed by Western, with reservoir analyses and drilling 
program technical assistance provided by GeothermEx.  Well drilling operations to date have been conducted by 
ThermaSource,  Inc.,  an  engineering  consulting  service  and  major  provider  of  drill  rigs  staffed  with  geothermal 
crews responsible for drilling and completing production and exploration wells on geothermal projects, founded in 
1980  and  based  in  Santa  Rosa,  California,  under  a  drilling  contract  that  is  no  longer  in  effect.    Design  and 
construction of all aspects of The Geysers Project other than geothermal resource development and well drilling, 
including  previously  performed  work,  is  planned  to  be  incorporated  into  and  wrapped  by  an  engineering, 
procurement and construction agreement (an “EPC Agreement”) with a third party contractor, which Western has 
been  negotiating.    However,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  Western  will  be  able  to  negotiate  terms  for  an  EPC 
Agreement  satisfactory  to Western  or  enter  into  an  EPC  Agreement.    If  Western  is  unable  to  enter  into  an  EPC 
Agreement on terms satisfactory to Western, the construction of The Geysers Project will not proceed.
Once complete, The Geysers Project facilities are expected to consist of a steam-electric power plant with plans for 
seven  geothermal  production  wells  and  one  or  two  injection  wells,  and  interconnected  pipelines  forming  the 
gathering system.  The 38.5 megawatt steam turbine generator for The Geysers Project has been ordered from Fuji 
Electric Company, Ltd. of Kawasaki, Japan.  In addition, the emission abatement system for The Geysers Project is 
planned to include an incinerator, a quench tank, a caustic scrubber, and a wet electrostatic precipitator.  With the 
exception of the wet electrostatic precipitator, similar abatement systems are operating at other geothermal power 
facilities in The Geysers.  While the wet electrostatic precipitator technology is utilized for particulate removal in a 
variety of industrial applications, to Western’s knowledge this is planned to be its first application in a geothermal 
power production facility.  The secondary condensate emission abatement system is planned to utilize injection of an 
iron chelate compound to the circulating water system.  This abatement system is used at other geothermal power 
plant facilities located in The Geysers.
Water Supply
Western  intends  to  rely  upon  excess  water  generated  by  operation  of  The  Geysers  Project  to  generate  water 
necessary for cooling.  Western anticipates that operation of The Geysers Project will generate sufficient water for 
The  Geysers  Project’s  continued  operation  as  a  byproduct  of  the  conversion  of  geothermal  steam  into  energy.  
Western further plans to maintain on-site water storage tanks where rainwater will be collected to be used primarily 
for injection and will also be available for cooling tower make-up at any time additional water is needed.
Operations
It is currently planned that Western will operate and maintain The Geysers Project following construction.
The cleanout of steam production wells to remove rocks or sand bridges that may restrict flow is generally required 
on  a  periodic  basis.    Injection  well  workovers  may  involve  re-drilling  and/or  replacement  of  the  well  liner  to 
maintain well integrity and capacity.
Sale of Power and Environmental Capacity Attributes
Western  has  entered  into  a  power  purchase  agreement  (the  “Power  Purchase  Agreement”)  to  sell  all  of  The 
Geysers Project’s net electrical output along with associated capacity and environmental attributes to NCPA.  The 
Power  Purchase  Agreement  provides  for  the  supply  of  approximately  265,000  MWhr  per  year of electricity  at  a 
price of USD$98 per MWhr for 20 years.  NCPA is a not-for-profit joint power agency that represents and provides 
support for 17 communities and districts in Northern and Central California.
Western  has  entered  into  negotiations  with  NCPA  to,  among  other  things,  increase  the  price  paid  by  NCPA  for 
electricity under the Power Purchase Agreement.  However, there can be no assurance that Western will be able to 
negotiate such improved pricing or enter into a new Power Purchase Agreement.  If Western is unable to enter into a
M-6
new  Power  Purchase  Agreement  with  improved  pricing,  then  Western  currently  plans  not  to  proceed  with 
construction of The Geysers Project.
Interconnection
The Geysers Project is planned to be interconnected to PG&E’s transmission system at the delivery point required 
by the Power Purchase Agreement pursuant to a long term interconnection agreement entered into by Western on 
February 10, 2009.
Real Property
Western has secured four geothermal leases covering 1,045 acres of private lands in The Geysers.  The leases grant 
Western the right to explore and develop the geothermal reservoir and to build a plant for electricity generation.
The leases were entered into between 2006 and 2007.  Subject to limited exceptions, the initial term of each lease is 
for three years.  Each lease remains effective after its initial three year term so long as hot water, steam, thermal 
energy  or  extractable  minerals  are  produced  in  commercial  quantities  and  utilized  to  produce  gross  revenue.  
Additionally,  each  lease  remains  effective  after  the  three  year  term  in  the  event  that  Western  is  and  has  been 
continuously engaged, during the twelve months preceding the expiration of such lease, in continuous operations for 
drilling, reworking, recompleting or re-drilling of any new well or existing well on the leased land, and in other 
continuous operations to produce hot water, steam, thermal energy or extractable minerals in commercial quantities, 
and to utilize the same to produce gross revenue.  In such case, the lease will remain in force so long as operations 
are  prosecuted  diligently  and  in  good  faith  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  one  hundred  twenty  days.  Western 
believes that it has satisfied the requirements under each lease such that each of the leases is currently effective.
Annual rental payments are payable on each lease.  In addition, royalties are payable on each lease based upon gross 
revenue derived from power plant(s) or from the sale of electricity.  Royalties are also payable on each lease based 
upon  the  gross  proceeds  received  by  Western  from  any  sale  of  extractable  minerals  or  from  utilizing  hot  water, 
steam or thermal energy for purposes other than electrical power generation.
Site Conditions
The power plant and well pads for The Geysers Project are planned to be constructed on the site of PG&E Unit 15, a 
55  megawatt  geothermal  power  plant  that  operated  from  1979  to  1989  and  has  since  been  decommissioned  and 
largely dismantled.  The power plant site is currently level with fill soil covering the abandoned foundations of the 
turbine  generator  and  cooling  tower  of  PG&E  Unit  15.    Existing  structures  remaining  on-site  include  over-land 
steam lines from the well pads and along the plant site, several concrete slabs, two sheds, two steel separator vessels, 
a concrete sedimentation basin, and a vent station with a concrete rock muffler. All are planned to be removed by 
Western except the sedimentation basin and rock muffler, which are planned to be used for The Geysers Project.  In 
addition, five abandoned PG&E Unit 15 well pads are planned to be used for the drilling of steam production wells 
for The Geysers Project.  Western also currently expects to use an existing well for injection.
The Geysers Project site is located within a seismically active region dominated by the San Andreas fault system, 
which is approximately 30 miles to the southwest.  The nearest active fault identified by the California Geological 
Survey is the Mayacama fault, approximately 3.8 miles southwest of The Geysers Project site.  In support of the 
conditional  use  permit  application  submitted  to  the  Sonoma  County  Permit  Resource  Management  Department, 
URS Corporation was engaged to investigate the likelihood that the planned steam production and water reinjection 
activities  for  The  Geysers  Project  would  induce  seismic  events  in  the  vicinity  of  The  Geysers  Project.  URS 
concluded  in  its  Evaluation  of  the  Potential  Impacts  of  Induced  Seismicity  at  the  Proposed  Western  GeoPower 
Geothermal  Power  Plant,  dated  May  14,  2009,  that  any  induced  seismicity  resulting  from  The  Geysers  Project 
operations would be a minor component of the total seismic activity at The Geysers, particularly with respect to 
events that might be felt by local residents.
In  addition,  Kleinfelder  West,  Inc.  prepared  a  Geotechnical  Investigation  Report,  dated  July  18,  2008,  based  on 
subsurface  investigations  at  the  power  plant  site  during  May  and  June  2008.  Among  other  things,  Kleinfelder
M-7
provided  recommendations  with  respect  to  seismic  design  parameters,  excavation  and  backfill,  repair  of  existing 
landslides, retaining walls, floor slabs, and pavement design.  The Kleinfelder report identifies two landslides on the 
power plant site, one on the slope north of the plant site and one on the south. Repair recommendations are provided 
in the Kleinfelder report.  The Kleinfelder report states that the remaining slopes around the site appear to be stable 
at this time; however, future erosion and slumping is possible. Western plans to adopt the material recommendations 
of the Kleinfelder report for The Geysers Project.
Geothermal Reservoir and Resource Production
Commercial electric power generation in The Geysers began in 1960 and reached a peak in the mid 1980s.  Steam 
pressure  has  been  declining  since  the  1980s,  however  since  the  mid  1990s,  the  rate  of  decline  has  slowed  and 
reservoir pressure has stabilized as improved technologies and better resource management procedures have been 
implemented.  Efforts in other parts of The Geysers by local geothermal developers and utilities, which include the 
reinjection of steam condensate and water piped from nearby towns to the reservoirs through injection wells, have 
been have successful in slowing the overall decline in the rate of steam production at The Geysers.  Although there 
are no current reinjection measures involving the injection of delivered water into the west portion of The Geysers 
on which The Geysers Project is located, contemplated injection measures on the west side of The Geysers may 
benefit The Geysers Project in the future.  Despite the decline from its peak capacity in the 1980s, The Geysers 
remains the largest producing dry steam field in the world as well as the world’s largest single source of geothermal 
power.
Western retained GeothermEx to develop and calibrate a reservoir model of Western’s leasehold for The Geysers 
Project incorporating the data from the wells Western drilled on the leasehold.  The following is a summary of the 
findings of The Geysers Report and is qualified in its entirety by reference to The Geysers Report (see “Technical 
Information”  above).    The  Geysers  Report  provides  that  a  reservoir  model  of  The  Geysers  in  its  entirety  was 
developed  to  study  the  planned  Geysers  Project.    The  Geysers  Report  provides  that  this  field-wide  model  was 
necessary to assess the interference between The Geysers Project and those of the other operators, who share The 
Geysers Field.  The Geysers Report provides that results of this study indicate that if most of an unexplored region 
of  Western’s  leasehold  proves  productive  upon  drilling,  a  35  MW  (net)  development  is  possible  to  sustain.  
However,  to  support  this  level  of  generation,  some  of  the  production  wells  would  have  to  be  located  on  this 
unexplored region of Western’s leasehold, which would entail some exploration risk.
The Geysers Report indicates that to minimize exploration risk, modeling efforts focused on developments where 
production wells are located only within the former PG&E Unit 15 area, where proven productive areas are known.  
The Geysers Report states that reservoir modeling indicates that a 25 MW(net) development can be supported by 
seven production wells without the need for any make-up wells on account of resource degradation over the entire 
project life of 20 years.  The Geysers Report states that forecast of steam production indicates the plant would be 
able to operate at 35 MW(net) for several months and then the generation would decline to about 25 MW(net) over 
the next five to six years.
The Geysers Report notes that the forecast from a reservoir model assumes a certain strategy of field and power 
plant operation; in reality, the operator of the project would improve and optimize the field and plant operations and 
maintenance strategy throughout the project life.  The Geysers Report further notes that the forecast based on the 
development  model  has  assumed  only  the  condensed  steam  (amounting  to  25%  of  the  steam  production  rate, 
including the water losses in the cooling tower) to be injected.  Certain other producers at The Geysers inject over 
60%  of  their  produced  steam  mass  when  supplemental  water  from  captured  winter  runoff  and  treated  municipal 
effluent  are  included.    The  Geysers  Report  provides  that  through  the  use  of  supplemental  water  from  these  two 
sources, or ground water, the performance of The Geysers Project can be further improved.  As such, GeothermEx 
indicates in the Geysers Report that they believe The Geysers Project would most likely sustain a capacity higher 
than 25 MW(net), possible 27 to 28 MW(net), over its project life even without any make-up well drilling. In light 
of  the  Geysers  Report,  management  of  Western  is  considering  potential  strategies,  including,  without  limitation, 
commencing the initial plant output at 25 MW (net) or expanding the drilling program to include lands on Western’s 
leasehold for The Geysers Project where resources have not yet been proven.
The planned power generating unit at The Geysers Project is designed to receive geothermal steam at the design 
flow rate of 622,000 pounds per hour gathered from what Western plans will initially be seven production wells
M-8
drilled from three well pads.  Condensate reinjection is planned to be by way of a single injection well with a second 
injection well to be drilled five years after commercial operation.  Four production wells have been completed to 
date, to depths of 7,605 to 9,935 feet.  Remaining PG&E Unit 15 gathering system pipelines have been recently 
inspected and found to be generally unserviceable due to internal corrosion.  New gathering system pipelines are 
planned to be installed along the existing routes so as to utilize existing pipeline supports where possible.
Federal and State Energy Regulatory Matters
Federal Regulation
The following is a summary overview of the electric utility industry and applicable regulations and should not be 
considered a full statement of all issues pertaining thereto.
PURPA
The  PURPA  provides  an  electric  generating  project  with  regulatory  incentives  and  exemptions  for  “Qualifying 
Facilities.”    There  are  two  types  of  Qualifying  Facilities:  “Qualifying  Small  Power  Production  Facilities”  and 
“Qualifying Cogeneration Facilities.” Under PURPA, a power production facility generally meets the requirements 
for being a Qualifying Small Power Production Facility if (i) the facility falls within certain maximum size criteria, 
and (ii) the primary energy source of the facility is biomass, waste, renewable resources or any combination thereof 
and 75% of the total energy input is from these sources.  To obtain Qualifying Facility status, Qualifying Facilities 
must either file with the FERC (i) a notice of self-certification, or (ii) an application that FERC approves in an order.  
Western believes The Geysers Project meets the criteria required for Qualifying Facilities under FERC’s regulations 
and Western plans to provide a notice of self-certification of Qualifying Facility status to FERC prior to commercial 
operations.
Under  PURPA,  the  regulatory  benefits  that  Qualifying  Facilities  receive  depend  upon  the  type  of  facility.    For 
geothermal projects such as The Geysers Project, PURPA exempts Qualifying Small Power Production Facilities 
from regulation under PUHCA, some of the provisions of the FPA, and certain state laws and regulations relating to 
financial, organization and rate regulation of electric utilities.  In addition, unless FERC makes certain findings that 
a new Qualifying Facility has nondiscriminatory access to competitive wholesale markets, FERC regulations under 
PURPA continue to require that (i) electric utilities purchase electricity generated by Qualifying Facilities and (ii) 
the utilities sell supplementary, back-up, maintenance and interruptible power to Qualifying Facilities on a just and 
reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.  As discussed below, however, because the Power Purchase Agreement was 
executed  after  March  17,  2006  and  was  not  made  pursuant  to  a  state  regulatory  authority’s  implementation  of 
PURPA, The Geysers Project is not exempt from FERC rate filing requirements, and must file for market-based rate 
authorization from FERC under Section 205 of the FPA.
If The Geysers Project fails to receive or loses its Qualifying Facility status or if amendments to PURPA are enacted 
that  substantially  reduce  the  benefits  currently  afforded  Qualifying  Facilities,  Western’s  operations  could  be 
adversely affected.  Loss of Qualifying Facility status could, absent another exemption from the PUHCA, cause The 
Geysers Project to become a public utility holding company and subject to additional federal energy regulation.  The 
Geysers Project also could become subject to state energy regulation.
PUHCA
Under PUHCA, FERC regulates as a “holding company” any company that directly or indirectly owns, controls or 
holds, with power to vote, 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a “public-utility company” (which is 
defined  to  include  an  “electric  utility  company”  or  a  “gas  utility  company”)  or  of  a  company  that  is  a  “holding 
company” of a “public-utility company” and that is not otherwise exempt, or benefits from a waiver, from regulation 
under PUHCA.  An entity may also be deemed to be a holding company if FERC determines, after providing notice 
and an opportunity for a hearing, that such entity exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies 
of any public-utility company or holding company as to make it necessary or appropriate for the rate protection of 
utility customers that such entity be subject to regulation as a holding company.  Unless an exemption applies, a 
holding  company  must  provide  FERC  with  access  to  its  books  and  records,  is  subject  to  record-retention
M-9
requirements, and in some cases may be subject to review and oversight of the allocation of costs for non-power 
goods and services provided by an “associate company” within a holding company system.  Under current federal 
law, The Geysers Project is not subject to regulation as a holding company under PUHCA and will not be subject to 
such regulation as long as The Geysers Project continues to meet the requirements applicable to Qualifying Small 
Power Production Facilities as discussed further above.  In addition, even if The Geysers Project loses Qualifying 
Facility status, it may be able to remain exempt from PUHCA by filing a timely certification with FERC that it is an 
“Exempt Wholesale Generator,” which is another class of electric generating facility exempt from regulation under 
PUHCA.
FPA
Under the FPA, FERC has exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and transmission in 
interstate  commerce.    Following  enactment  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  FERC  revised  its  regulations 
applicable to Qualifying Facilities to provide that sales of energy or capacity made by such facilities that are greater 
than  20  MW  would  no  longer  be  exempt  from  FERC  rate  filing  requirements  under  Section  205  of  the  FPA.  
Accordingly, Western would be required to file a market-based rate tariff with FERC, seeking FERC authorization 
to sell electric energy and capacity at negotiated rates.  FERC imposes certain ongoing regulatory requirements on 
entities with market-based rate authority with which Western be will obligated to comply.  For example, Western 
will be required to file electronic quarterly reports summarizing The Geysers Project’s sales, and notices of “change 
in status” relating to changes in facts relied upon by FERC when granting The Geysers Project’s market-based rate 
authorization.  Failure to comply with any of the requirements applicable to Western as a market-based rate seller 
could  result  in  enforcement  action  that  could  adversely  affect  the  Western’s  operations.    FERC’s  enforcement 
authority includes civil penalty authority for violations of the FPA in amounts up to $1 million per violation for each 
day that it continues.  In addition, under Section 206 of the FPA, Western’s rates may be investigated by FERC on 
its  own  motion,  or  upon  the  filing  of  a  complaint  by  a  third  party.    FERC  has  authority  under  Section  206  to 
determine  that  an  existing  rate  is  unjust,  unreasonable,  unduly  discriminatory  or  preferential  and  may,  on  a 
prospective basis, determine a different “just and reasonable” rate by order.
State Regulation
Western intends to provide a notice of self-certification of a Qualifying Facility to FERC, and The Geysers Project 
would  then  be  eligible  for  regulatory  exemptions  from  certain  state  energy  laws  and  regulations,  as  set  forth  in 
FERC’s regulations.  Specifically, by virtue of being a Qualifying Facility The Geysers Project will not be subject to 
rate, financial or organizational regulations applicable to public utilities in California.  Electrical output from The 
Geysers Project is planned to be sold to NCPA, which is a municipal public utility exempt from regulation by the 
California Public Utilities Commission.  Accordingly, the rates under the Power Purchase Agreement are not subject 
to the regulatory review of the California Public Utilities Commission
California  ISO  (“CAISO”),  a  not-for-profit  public  benefit  corporation,  assumed  control  over  California's 
transmission  grid  on  March  31,  1998.  While  CAISO  manages  the  transmission  lines,  the  transmission  lines 
themselves are owned by individual utilities such as PG&E.  CAISO is responsible for ensuring the safe and reliable 
operation of the transmission grid within California, and providing open, non-discriminatory transmission services.  
Through schedules submitted by Scheduling Coordinators, CAISO is responsible for scheduling electricity to match 
customers’  demand  with  available  supply  from  generators.    It  also  manages  congestion.    Pursuant  to  a  FERC-
approved Tariff, CAISO has certain abilities to fine market participants for violations of its rules.  Western will be 
subject to the CAISO Tariff requirements pertaining to certain aspects of The Geysers Project’s operations under a 
Participating Generator Agreement with CAISO.  These obligations may affect The Geysers Project’s operations, 
and any deviation from Western’s obligations under these arrangements could subject Western to penalties under 
applicable provisions of the CAISO Tariff.
RPS Certification
Certain  states  in  the  United  States  have  adopted  renewable  portfolio  standards,  or  renewable  portfolio  goals, 
requiring or encouraging electrical utilities in such states to include a certain percentage of their electricity supply 
from renewable energy resources.  In November 2008, California adopted a goal for all retail suppliers of electricity 
to  serve  33%  of  their  load  with  renewable  energy  by  2020.    Western  has  obtained  a  pre-certification  from  the
M-10
California  Energy  Commission  under  the  California  Renewable  Portfolio  Standard  Program  for  The  Geysers 
Project,  and  the  information  submitted  in  The  Geysers  Project’s  pre-certification  application  will  be  subject  to 
further  verification  once  The  Geysers  Project  has  been  completed.    To  maintain  the  certification  status  of  The 
Geysers  Project,  Western  must  comply  with  all  applicable  requirements  for  certified  or  pre-certified  facilities 
contained in the Renewables Portfolio Standard Eligibility Guidebook, 3d Edition (publication number CEC-300-
2007-006-ED3CMF), including requirements to notify the California Energy Commission immediately if there are 
any material changes in the information submitted in its application for pre-certification, or face disqualification.
Environmental Permitting and Compliance
Overview
The  Geysers  Project  is  subject  to  a  broad  range  of  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  the 
protection of the environment and the safety and health of the personnel operating The Geysers Project and of the 
public.  These  laws  and  regulations  can  relate,  both  indirectly  and  directly,  to  the  ownership,  operation  and 
maintenance  of  The  Geysers  Project  in  ways  similar  to  other  electric  generating  facilities.    Applicable  laws  and 
regulations include those relating to: (1) air emissions, water withdrawals, water discharges, waste storage, treatment 
and  disposal,  hazardous  materials  handling,  exposure  to  hazardous  materials,  noise,  threatened  and  endangered 
species,  cultural  resources  and  petroleum  storage  and  (2)  occupational  safety  and  health  standards,  practices  and 
procedures.
Violation or non-compliance with these laws and regulations could result in significant costs, fines and penalties, 
revocation  of  permits  and  governmental  actions  preventing  Western  from  operating  The  Geysers  Project.  
Environmental laws can often require the installation of new or additional pollution control equipment, as a result of 
either power plant upgrades and modifications or changes in the law.  This can lead to either a material expenditure 
of funds or a modification of current operations.  Although it is not possible at this time to determine the extent or 
timing of such capital expenditures or modifications that could be required, The Geysers Project may incur material 
capital expenditures due to potential future changes to environmental and safety laws and regulations, regulatory 
interpretations or enforcement policies.  These changes could impose more restrictive requirements on The Geysers 
Project in a way that could adversely affect Western’s results of operations.
Environmental Permits
Western believes it has obtained all of the material and discretionary environmental permits required from federal, 
state and local agencies to construct The Geysers Project, including completion of the environmental impact analysis 
under the California Environmental Quality Act, except for the fact that certain permits for The Geysers Project are 
currently held in the name of one subsidiary of Western and those permits must be transferred or reissued to another 
subsidiary of Western to be formed.  The applicable limitations periods for challenging these permits have expired 
without further appeal or litigation.  Certain of these construction-related project permits require further activities by 
Western during construction.  For example, the conditional use permit issued by Sonoma County requires Western 
to post security to secure Western’s restoration obligations under the use permit for The Geysers Project site and 
geothermal  wells.    Sonoma  County  can  review  and  adjust  the  amount  of  such  security  annually  depending  on 
various factors, so the aggregate amount of such security may increase over time.
Western  will  be  required  to  obtain  certain  additional  environmental  permits  prior  to,  and  in  connection  with  the 
planned commencement of commercial operation of The Geysers Project, including an air quality permit to operate 
from the Northern Sonoma County Air Pollution Control District (which has already approved The Geysers Project's 
construction  and  pollution  control  technology),  a  waiver  of  waste  discharge  requirements  from  the  North  Coast 
Regional Water Quality Control Board, a geothermal well injection permit for geothermal process injection from the 
California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (which also administers the federal underground injection 
well program), and certain other environmental permits from other agencies.  Western must also prepare and file 
certain required plans, such as a “business plan” and a spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan required by 
applicable  law  for  the  anticipated  onsite  management  of  certain  hazardous  materials  (including  proposed  onsite 
above-ground oil storage tanks), prior to commencing operations or installing the relevant facilities.

Environmental Site Conditions
Under  applicable  federal  and  state  law,  including  under  the  federal  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended and the California Hazardous Substances Account Act, the 
current and former owners and operators of sites contaminated with hazardous substances may be responsible for 
remediation costs associated with such contamination.  Western has completed a Phase I and Phase II environmental 
site investigation for The Geysers Project site and certain of the surrounding locations, and has identified various 
areas of potential concern arising from past geothermal and mining activities on areas leased or otherwise subject to 
easements in favor of Western.
South Meager Project – British Columbia, Canada
Overview
Under the terms of two licenses of occupation and one geothermal lease, all of which were granted by the British 
Columbia  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  (expiring  at  various  times  in  2017),  Western  holds  a  100%  interest  in 
approximately 4,267 hectares of land located approximately 170 kilometers north of Vancouver, British Columbia.
Geothermal Reservoir
Since  the  late  1970s,  the  South  Meager  geothermal  resource  has  been  periodically  investigated  using  various 
exploration  techniques,  including  geological  mapping,  geochemical  and  geophysical  surveys,  and  by  drilling. 
Numerous  temperature  gradient  wells  (slim-diameter  wells  used  to  measure  subsurface  temperature),  deep  slim 
wells,  and  several  full-diameter  wells  have  been  drilled  in  the  field.  One  of  the  original  full-diameter  wells 
completed by a third party in 1981 sustained continuous flow, but was not a commercial producer due to its low 
flowing wellhead pressure. During one of its longer flow tests (nearly two years), that well was used to supply a 20-
kW geothermal power facility. Three other full-diameter geothermal wells, two of which were completed by a third 
party in 1982 and the third was completed by a third party in 1995, showed high temperatures but were not able to 
flow.
Between  2004  and  2005  Western  drilled  three  wells  on  the  South  Meager  property.    The  maximum  measured 
temperature for each of the wells was 260oC, 259oC and 237oC, but none of the wells were able to flow.
In 2008, Western conducted a testing program at the South Meager Project, under the direction of GeothermEx.  The 
South Meager Report was prepared following such testing.  The following is a summary of the findings of the South 
Meager Report and is qualified in its entirety by that report (see “Technical Information” above). The South Meager 
Report indicates that the testing involved an airlift assisted flow test of one well, which has demonstrated potentially 
commercial permeability.  The South Meager Report provides that although this well itself did not sustain self flow 
after airlifting, wellbore simulation indicates that a well targeting the same permeable zone from a lower elevation 
could flow at the equivalent of over 6 MW of electrical output.  The South Meager Report states that, based on 
information available to date, the thermal reservoir at South Meager has an areal extent of 4.5 to 7.5 km2, a thickness 
of 2,800 m, and an average temperature of 220 to 240°C, with a maximum measured temperature of 275°C. The 
South Meager Report indicates that from volumetric estimation utilizing a probabilistic simulation technique, the 
potentially recoverable heat energy of the field is estimated to be equivalent to at least 110 MW of electrical power 
capacity for a 30-year project life.  The South Meager Report notes that this type of estimate of the recoverable heat-
in-place does not imply any guarantee that a given level of generation can be achieved; before generation can be 
realized, wells capable of extracting the heat from the rock by commercial rates of geothermal fluid production must 
be drilled and tested.
Access
Access to the South Meager Project is via Highway 99 from Vancouver to Pemberton, followed by 25 km of sealed 
provincial highway through Pemberton Meadows, then 36 km of industrial-grade logging roads and 18 km of gravel 
roads that necessitate the use of four-wheel drive vehicles during adverse weather conditions.

Regulatory Matters
BC Hydro is one of the largest electric utilities in Canada, supplying the majority of power generating capacity in 
British Columbia.  The remaining capacity is provided by investor-owned utilities, large and small industrial self-
generators and independent power producers.
The restructuring of the electricity industry in British Columbia began with the announcement by the Government of 
British  Columbia  in  2002  of  “Energy  for  our  Future:  A  Plan  for  BC”.    The  plan  had  four  primary  elements:  (i) 
continuing public ownership of BC Hydro; (ii) developing a secure and reliable supply of energy; (iii) providing 
greater private sector opportunities; and (iv) enhancing conservation and new investment in clean energy sources.  
Under the new plan, BC Hydro was restructured into two separate Crown corporations: BC Hydro for generation 
and distribution and BC Transmission Corporation to operate and provide open access to BC Hydro’s transmission 
system.  BC Hydro’s distribution division is required to acquire all new power on a least-cost basis from all potential 
sources.    All  generation  is  to  be  provided  by  independent  power  producers  with  BC  Hydro  being  limited  to 
undertaking efficiency improvements at existing facilities and only undertaking development of new generation with 
British Columbia Utility Commission approval.
In  February  2007,  British  Columbia  announced  a  new  energy  plan  comprising  a  number  of  policies  including  a 
target of zero net greenhouse gas emissions for all new electricity projects, ensuring clean or renewable electricity 
generation continues to account for at least 90% of total generation (over 90% of generation in British Columbia 
currently comes from hydroelectric resources), acquiring 50% of BC Hydro’s incremental resource needs through 
conservation and establishing a standard offer program for clean energy projects under 10 MW.
Since 2002, BC Hydro has on several occasions solicited requests for proposals from independent power producers 
for the sale to BC Hydro of electricity, with successful proposals being issued electricity purchase agreements.
Status
Western does not plan to devote any material resources to further exploration at the South Meager Project until the 
outcome  of  the  Arrangement  is  determined.    Should  the  Arrangement  not  be  completed,  Western  will  then  re-
evaluate whether to allocate material resources to further exploration at the South Meager Project.
South Brawley Project – South Brawley, California, USA
Overview
Western has entered into a number of geothermal leases, covering approximately 3,000 acres, in the South Brawley 
area, located in Imperial County, Southern California.  The leases grant Western the right to explore and develop the 
geothermal reservoir and to build a plant for electrical generation.
Geothermal Reservoir
Commercial geothermal power has been generated continuously throughout Imperial County since the early 1980’s, 
with  the  present  generation  level  being  approximately  530  MW  from  the  Salton  Sea,  East  Mesa  and  Heber 
geothermal power plants.  Western’s leasehold is situated in the South Brawley Geothermal Resource Area.
Four deep wells plus a side-track of a well (varying in depth from 13,381 feet to 14,000 feet) were drilled and flow 
tested on Western’s South Brawley leasehold by a third party between 1978 and 1982.  In addition, a prolonged (34-
day) pressure interference test was run by a third party in this field during 1982-1983.  Although these wells are now 
plugged and abandoned, they confirmed the existence of a high temperature (up to 278oC) reservoir, and pressure 
interference  testing  has  demonstrated  the  existence  of  high  flow  and  storage  capacities  within  the  reservoir.    A 
wellhead productivity of 700,000 pounds per hour (equivalent to approximately 7 MW) had been demonstrated by 
well testing.  However, these wells had a narrower diameter than is conventional for geothermal wells used today 
and the wells showed major formation damage.  New wells with a larger diameter may produce higher productivity.
M-13
Western has not conducted any drilling on Western’s South Brawley leasehold.
Access
Extensive infrastructure throughout the region provides access for development at the South Brawley Project.
Regulatory Matters
See  “Description  of  the  Business  –  The  Geysers  Project  –  Federal  and  State  Energy  Regulatory  Matters”  for  a 
description of certain federal and state energy regulatory matters applicable to the South Brawley Project.
Status
Western  does  not  plan  to  devote  any  material  resources  to  exploration  at  the  South  Brawley  Project  until  the 
outcome  of  the  Arrangement  is  determined.    Should  the  Arrangement  not  be  completed,  Western  will  then  re-
evaluate whether to allocate material resources to further exploration at the South Brawley Project.
Employees
As at the date of the Information Circular, Western employed approximately seven people and has engaged seven 
people as independent contractors on a full time equivalent basis.
Specialized Skill and Knowledge
The  success  of  a  geothermal  company  is  largely  dependent  on  the  skills,  experience  and  efforts  of  the  senior 
management team and other key personnel.  Western’s core management team includes individuals with extensive 
project  development  experience  in  the  renewable  energy  industry,  including  in  land  acquisition,  permitting, 
geothermal  exploration  and  drilling,  power  plant  construction,  power  purchase  agreements,  transmission,  project 
operation and maintenance, asset management, and financing.
Competitive Conditions
Western competes with other geothermal energy companies in acquiring private or governmental leases or licences 
permitting them to explore and develop geothermal properties.  Western also competes with such other geothermal 
companies  to  secure  power  purchase  agreements  and  in  electricity  pricing.    Geothermal  energy  companies  also 
compete  with  other  forms  of  power  generation,  including  natural  gas,  coal  and  nuclear  power  plants,  as  well  as 
renewable energy sources, such as wind power, solar power and hydro electric power.
Cycles
The acquisition, exploration and development of geothermal energy properties is not generally cyclical or seasonal.
Bankruptcies and Reorganization
There  has  not  been  any  bankruptcy,  or  any  receivership  or  similar  proceedings  against  Western  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries or any voluntary bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings by Western or any of its subsidiaries, 
during the three most recently completed financial years of Western or during or proposed for the current financial 
year of Western.  There have been no material reorganizations of Western or any of its subsidiaries during the three 
most recently completed financial years of Western or during or proposed for the current financial year of Western.

Harry L. Knutson was a director of Donner Petroleum Ltd. (“Donner”) from August 2005 to November 2006.  Due 
to delays in receiving approval from Donner’s auditors with respect to its audited financial statements and related 
management’s discussion and analysis for the year ended February 28, 2006 (the “Donner Annual Financials”), 
each  of  the  Ontario  Securities  Commission  (the  “OSC”)  and  the  British  Columbia  Securities  Commission  (the 
“BCSC”),  on  July  13  and  17,  2006,  respectively,  issued  a  cease  trade  order  against  Donner  for  failure  to  file 
financial  statements.    The  Donner  Annual  Financials  were  subsequently  filed  and  the  cease  trade  orders  were 
revoked by the OSC on August 1, 2006 and by the BCSC on October 17, 2006.
Mr. Knutson has been a director of Canadian Phoenix Resources Corp. (“Canadian Phoenix”) since November 18, 
2008.    Canadian  Phoenix  was  issued  a  Management  Cease  Trade  Order  (“MCTO”)  by  the  Alberta  and  British 
Columbia Securities Commissions on December 3, 2008 for failure to file financial statements due to complications 
associated  with  accounting  for  three  acquisitions  completed  by  Canadian  Phoenix  during  the  three  month  period 
ended  September  30,  2008.    The  MCTO  expired  on  December  17,  2008,  following  the  filing  of  the  financial 
statements on December 15, 2008.
Mr. Knutson was a director of Kasten Chase Applied Research Limited (“Kasten”) during the time in which the 
company  was  subject  to  cease  trade  orders  from  the  Alberta  Securities  Commission,  the  BCSC,  the  Manitoba 
Securities Commission, the OSC and the Autorité des marchés financiers for failure to file its unaudited financial 
statements for the periods ending June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006.  Mr. Knutson was appointed a director on 
February 19, 2007 in order to seek restructuring alternatives for Kasten and was not involved with the failure to file 
the  required  interim  financial  statements  and  corresponding  cease  trade  orders.    The  cease  trade  orders  were 
subsequently revoked in March 2008.
Other than as set forth below, to the knowledge of management of Western, no director or executive officer or a 
shareholder holding a sufficient number of securities of Western to affect materially control of Western: (i) is, as at 
the date of the Information Circular, or has been within ten years before at the date of the Information Circular, a 
director or executive officer of any company (including Western) that, while that person was acting in that capacity, 
or  within  a  year  of  that  person  ceasing  to  act  in  that  capacity,  became  bankrupt,  made  a  proposal  under  any 
legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  or  was  subject  to  or  instituted  any  proceedings,  arrangement  or 
compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets; or (ii) has, 
within  the  ten  years  before  the  date  of  the  Information  Circular,  become  bankrupt,  made  a  proposal  under  any 
legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or become subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or 
compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold assets of the director, 
executive officer or shareholder.
Gudmundur Sigurjonsson was a director of System Advisors A/S (“System Advisors”), which voluntarily filed for 
bankruptcy  in  October  2002  in  Copenhagen,  Denmark.  No  litigation  resulted  from  the  bankruptcy  and  System 
Advisors was dissolved on July 6, 2004.
To the knowledge of management of Western, no director or executive officer or a shareholder holding a sufficient 
number  of  securities  of  Western  to  affect  materially  control  of  Western  has  been  subject  to:  (i)  any  penalties  or 
sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory authority or has entered

Business of Ram
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF RAM
Ram’s management believes that it has one of the most experienced technical and project management teams of new 
geothermal  development  companies,  which  provides  it  with  a  unique  opportunity  to  take  advantage  of  the  U.S. 
electrical  power  sector’s  growing  appetite  for  “green”  energy.  With  environmental  and  national  security  issues  as 
fundamental factors influencing U.S. energy policy, the green energy sector benefits from substantial tax incentives and 
regulatory mandates. The Geothermal Energy Association has reported that in 2007, the U.S. had approximately 3,000 
MW  of  base  load  geothermal  capacity,  and  according  to  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  an  additional  9,000  MW  is 
available  for  future  development  from  identified  resources.  To  capitalize  on  this  opportunity,  Ram  has  focused  on 
deploying the skills of its management team, with their decades of geothermal project experience.
The development of a portfolio of projects minimizes the impact of any individual project and mitigates investor risk. 
To this end, Ram has assembled a portfolio of 10 geothermal projects, in California and Nevada and has signed power 
purchase contracts for up to 300 MW in California. Ram expects to proceed with the development and operation of 
these projects as well as others which may be acquired in the future.
Ram plans to develop, own and operate medium size (20 to 40 MW) air cooled modular solar thermal projects utilizing 
a patent pending Ram proprietary power plant technology in concert with concentrating parabolic collectors. As part of 
its technological enhancements plans, Ram  plans to ultimately combine the solar plants with the geothermal plants, 
offering a unique package of both base load and peak power supply to the utilities, Ram is seeking separate funding for 
its solar thermal development.

History of Ram
Ram was founded as a Delaware corporation on January 4, 2008 and subsequently secured approximately 12.7 million 
U.S. dollars in corporate financing. Ram’s management team includes individuals with extensive project development 
experience in the renewable energy industry, both as individuals and working together as a team at the ORMAT group 
of companies (“Ormat”). See “Employees & Specialized Skill and Knowledge” below.
In August 2008 Ram acquired several geothermal leaseholds in the BLM auction, totalling approximately 25,000 acres 
in Nevada, and subsequently acquired additional leaseholds totalling approximately 32,000 acres in the July 2009 BLM 
auction,  for  a  total  of  approximately  57,000  acres  in  Nevada  and  California.  In  August  2009  Ram  acquired  an 
additional approximately 4,609 acres in Nevada from a third party through a BLM lease assignment. Since late 2008 
Ram has been conducting negotiations to secure geothermal leases on private lands in the Imperial Valley of California. 
To  date,  this  has  resulted  in  approximately  4,000  acres  of  signed  leases  for  the  Orita  and  New  River  projects.  A 
description of Ram’s material projects can be found below under the heading “Ram’s Projects”.
Geothermal Leases
In  the  United  States,  Ram  may  acquire  the  rights  to  geothermal  resources  by  entering  into  a  lease  with  a  private 
property landowner or the U.S. federal government. A geothermal lease grants Ram the exclusive right to explore, drill, 
produce, extract, and use geothermal resources and any extractable minerals therefrom (exclusive of oil or hydrocarbon 
gas that can separately produced) and to construct facilities on the surface of the property for the production and use of 
geothermal and extractable minerals.
Where  a  split  estate  exists,  separate  mineral  and  surface  occupancy  leases  are  expected  to  be  entered  into  with  the 
owners.
Geothermal leases on U.S. federal lands are acquired by competitive bids through the BLM. The primary term of a 
federal lease is ten years with a fixed rental per acre with provision for two five year extensions of term. A private 
geothermal  lease  pays  an  annual  rental  for  a  defined  primary  term  of  the  lease,  generally  five  or  more  years,  with 
provisions for extensions of term. Rental fee rates vary between leases on private land but are fixed for the term of the 
lease.
In both cases, once commercial production of the resource is achieved on the lease, it is held without rental and subject 
to royalties as long as production continues. Federal royalty rates are stipulated by federal code. Private geothermal 
royalty rates are agreed to between the lease parties and stipulated within the lease as a percentage of gross proceeds 
from sale of geothermal fluid or electricity. Royalties are distributed between land owners, whether private or federal, 
based upon the land area contribution to production via a unit agreement between the parties.
Ram Projects
Imperial Valley, California
The  Imperial  Valley  is  a  favourable  area  for  geothermal  development  with  high  temperature  geothermal  resources 
identified in areas where the generated power can be relatively easily connected into the local grid. Imperial Valley 
geothermal  systems  occur  within  the  Salton  Trough,  an  area  that  marks  the  transition  between  two  major  geologic 
provinces. To the south, sea floor spreading characterizes the area that includes the Sea of Cortez in the Baja California 
Province. To the north, the San Andreas Fault system dominates the structural setting.  Either process can produce local 
areas of extended crust that provide enhanced permeability for development of geothermal systems. The process of sea 
floor spreading adds the element of magma intrusion as an enhanced heat source within the already high regional heat 
flow of the thin crust within the Salton Trough. This later process is most evident within the Salton Sea geothermal 
properties where the resulting geothermal resource exceeds 600oF (see Figure 1 – Salton Sea Map). The total estimated 
capacity  of  the  Greater  Salton  Sea  area  in  the  Imperial  Valley  is  over  22,000  MW  (as  reported  by  California’s 
Geothermal  Resource  Data  Base,  Karl  Gawell,  1999).  Ram  has  acquired  several  private  leaseholds  totalling 
approximately 4,000 acres in the Imperial Valley, capable of supporting an estimated 200 MW of geothermal projects 
by using an extensive proprietary database to target geothermal lease acquisitions.
N-4
Figure 1 - Salton Sea Map
Orita Project
One such prospect is the Orita leasehold located in the East Brawley KGRA. Concurrent with KGRA designation in 
1981, a total of eight deep exploration wells were drilled by Unocal, Occidental and Phillips Petroleum in the area (see 
Figure 2 – Orita Leasehold Map). These wells were completed at depths from 8,500 ft to 13,500 ft and all encountered 
high temperature geothermal resources with temperatures as high as 575oF.  Testing of one well confirmed flow rates in 
excess of 500,000 lbs per hour at a well head pressure of 560 psig, demonstrating six MW capacity from the seven inch 
diameter well completion.  In addition, operators drilled shallow gradient and slim-hole wells that confirm the extent of 
the thermal system and bore hole geophysics and mud logs are available to quantify and characterize all sandstone units 
that may be potential production horizons. Commercial diameter wells are expected to produce at levels of 12 MW or 
greater in this resource.  The flow tests demonstrate that a deep high salinity reservoir is present and wells also show 
evidence of low salinity fluids produced from shallower depths.  The temperature profiles within the 15 square mile 
area tested by the existing deep drilling are similar and all demonstrate temperatures of 400oF at a depth of 7,000 ft.  
These shallower “stacked” reservoirs are contained in sand units at these depths and show dissolved solids content in 
the range of 9,000 to 50,000 ppm consistent with other pumped resources found in the Salton Trough. Ram estimates 
that the reservoir can support three (3) 49.9 MW power plants within the current leasehold of about 5.5 square miles.  
Additional leasing in the project area could increase potential to 300 MW.
N-5
Figure 2 - Orita Project Leasehold Map
New River Project
A second Ram prospect is the New River leasehold in the South Brawley resource area, adjacent to the Mesquite 
Lake basin which is defined as a local zone of subsidence within the Salton Trough.  Resource delineation consists 
of a range of data including 40 shallow gradient holes and intermediate depth holes drilled up to 2,000 ft and deep 
tests within the Mesquite Lake basin drilled to 12,910 ft (see Figure 3 – New River Leasehold Map). A thermal 
anomaly  defines  an  area  of  shallow  resource  which  covers  an  area  of  12  square  miles.    The  intermediate  depth 
temperature profiles within this anomaly measure +200oF at 2000 ft and predict +400oF at 6,000 ft.  As in other 
locations  in  the  Imperial  Valley,  the  deep  hyper-saline  resource  is  overlain  by  lower  salinity  fluids  contained  in 
shallower sand units.  Initial development at New River will target the 400oF resource beneath the shallow thermal 
anomaly at depths near 6,000 ft.  Based on the size of the shallow heat anomaly a 49.9 MW development is planned 
for this area with additional leases to be acquired.
Initial development will utilize the lower salinity fluids at depths shallower than 8,000 ft in sandstones containing 
fluids with salinity less than 50,000 ppm and temperatures near 400oF.   Based on the drilling experience in this area, 
these wells may be drilled in less than 30 days.  Development of these lower enthalpy fluids will result in wells that 
are  cased  with  carbon  steel  and  are  not  expected  to  require  more  expensive  metallurgy  in  casing  programs.  
Similarly,  the  produced  fluids  are  chemically  benign  and  are  not  expected  to  require  exceptional  fluid  handling 
capabilities such as reactor-clarifier technology.

Figure 3 – New River Leasehold Map
Clayton Valley, Nevada
At the BLM auction on August 4, 2008 Ram acquired the approximately 6,518 acre Pearl Hot Springs prospect and 
the approximately 7,626 acre Weepah prospect. At the BLM auction in 2009, Ram acquired the approximately 9,581 
acre Weepah North prospect, the approximately 10,201 acre Montezuma prospect, and the approximately 10,118 
acre  Alkali  prospect.  These  five  lease  blocks,  totalling  approximately  44,044  acres  are  all  located  in  Esmeralda 
County  Nevada,  which  is  near  highway  U.S.  95  south  15  miles  out  of  Tonopah  (see  Figure  4  – Clayton  Valley 
Project Areas Map).
In the area of the Clayton Valley prospects some 14 gradient holes have been drilled and temperatures of 247oF have 
been measured at 300 ft depth.  The size of the block as well as the geothermal potential indicates a reservoir that 
may support approximately 30 MW development at each of the five resource prospects for a total Clayton Valley 
potential of up to 150 MW.
Located in the northeast corner of Clayton Valley, Pearl Hot Springs is one of several geothermal prospects within 
the  greater  Clayton  Valley  complex  of  thermal  systems.    A  large  commercial  deposit  of  lithium  derived  from 
geothermal systems and now currently extracted from Clayton Valley attest to the long lived geothermal activity in 
the valley. Pearl Hot Springs are low flow and are part of a multi-square mile thermal plume defined by shallow 
drilling  within  this  corner  of  the  playa.  The  thermal  plume  includes  shallow  temperatures  of  247oF  in  a  300ft 
gradient hole. Geo-thermometers applied to the Pearl Hot Spring waters show loss of silica consistent with some
N-7
distance  of  transport  from  the  reservoir  at  depth  with  the  geo-thermometers  indicating  420o F  to  445oF  reservoir 
temperatures.
The Weepah prospects are within the Weepah uplands some four miles to the northeast of the Pearl Hot Spring lease 
block.  Gradient drilling has been limited within this lease block but published data adjacent to the block document 
thermal fluids near boiling in drill holes and geo-thermometers predict a 302oF to 445oF source for the fluids.
The  Montezuma  lease  block  is  in  the  southern  end  of  Clayton  Valley  and  is  characterized  by  a  zone  of  north-
northeast trending fault systems  that show associated hot spring-related  mineral deposits. There are no identified 
modern hot springs that have been reported but the faults are geologically young and it is likely that a heat source is 
present at depth. This thermal system has structural control similar to that found at Pearl Hot Springs. No significant 
exploration work has been conducted at this location.
The Alkali Hot Springs lease block is centered on the named hot springs which issue at a temperature of 140oF (the 
highest temperature thermal water found in the area). The springs are associated with a zone of hot spring deposits 
similar in nature to the Montezuma lease block. No exploration has been conducted on this block.
The Pearl Hot Springs and Weepah blocks are located in proximity to existing NV Energy transmission lines.
Figure 4 –Clayton Valley Geothermal Leasehold Map
N-8
Delcer Butte, Nevada
The 14,796 acre Delcer Butte prospect consists of three BLM geothermal leases. Access is off highway U.S. 93 
some 50 miles south of Wells, Nevada. Gradient hole drilling covering a portion of the lease show gradients at two 
of  five  sites  in  excess  of  10oF/100  ft.  The  prospect  requires  additional  gradient  and  deep  well  drilling  to  fully 
evaluate its productivity.  It is estimated that the resource can support a 30 MW net power plant.
Delcer Buttes is a green field project that was discovered as a potential “blind” geothermal resource as a result of 
reconnaissance shallow drilling conducted in 1984 by a major operator.  The U.S. Geological Survey reported in 
1999 that five gradient holes showed temperature increase above background values with the highest gradient near 
13oF/100 ft. Conceptual models discuss silica flooding and epithermal mineralization (consistent with geothermal 
activity) but these zones are not indicated on exploration maps.  A shallow two meter temperature survey conducted 
in 2008 confirms a heat flow anomaly within the leasehold and suggests a northeast- southwest structural control 
model.  It  is  believed  that  this  prospect,  based  on  its  size  and  similarity  to  other  Nevada  geothermal  areas,  can 
potentially support a 30 MW power project development (see Figure 5 – Delcer Butte Leasehold Map).
Figure 5 - Delcer Buttes Leasehold Map
Recent Developments
Based on bi-lateral negotiations commenced in early 2009, a long term power sales agreement was executed on July 
31, 2009 with Southern California Edison for the sale of 49.9 MW, which Ram may at its option expand to up to 300
N-9
MW, for power to be delivered from the Orita project. Commercial operation of the first 49.9 MW Orita project is 
targeted for December 2012 at a power price that approaches the 2008 California Market Price Referent.
In early 2009 Ram submitted proposals for the supply of 49.9 MW of geothermal power from New River to the 
SCPPA  and  to  the  IID,  both  publically  owned  entities.  Currently  both  SCPPA  and  IID  have  “short  listed”  these 
proposals for future negotiations.
On June 30, 2009, Ram and GTO entered into the Ram Letter of Intent and on September 8, 2009, Ram, GTO and 
the  Sellers  entered  into  the  Share  Purchase  Agreement  providing  for  the  acquisition  by  GTO  of  the  Purchased 
Shares. On September 8, 2009, GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram entered into the Arrangement Agreement.  The Ram 
Acquisition is subject to the completion of the Arrangement. See the Information Circular under the headings “The 
Arrangement”, “Recent Developments – The Ram Acquisition” and “Risk Factors” for a more detailed description 
of the Arrangement, the Ram Acquisition and the risk factors in respect of the Arrangement, respectively.
Seasonal Considerations
The  geothermal  resource  as  a  fuel  supply  does  not  have  seasonal  variations  and  the  type  of  geothermal  projects 
which Ram expects to construct will not be dependent on weather conditions. However, the various power plant 
technologies perform with somewhat higher efficiency when the ambient temperatures are lower. This is particularly 
the  case  for  the  binary  power  plant  technology which  may  be  utilized  for geothermal  resources  below  350ºF,  as 
typically found in Nevada. For the higher temperature resources, such as at the Orita and New River project areas, 
which may utilize the flash based steam turbine technology, this seasonal effect may be nominal. The major seasonal 
issue is the fact that the California investor owned utilities generally have a “time of use” payment arrangement 
whereby electricity supplied by a geothermal project during summer on-peak periods (during the hottest portion of 
the day) is paid for at a rate that may be two or three times the price per kilowatt hour that is paid for electricity 
supply  during  winter  off-peak  periods  (night  time).  Though  this  seasonality  is  accounted  for  in  scheduling 
maintenance, the effect of unscheduled repairs or equipment failure during peak seasonal payment periods may have 
a severe impact on operating revenues if corrective action is not taken promptly.
Environmental Matters
All geothermal power projects are subject to extensive environmental review, permitting, and reporting. Emissions, 
material storage and disposal, brine production and injection, and worker health and safety are all regulated aspects 
of a geothermal project. Geothermal operations produce significant quantities of brine as the production fluid which 
contains varying amounts of minerals in solution. The wells and gathering systems which transport brine for use are 
conditioned  with  permitted  chemical  treatment  programs  which  prohibit  the  precipitation  of  entrained  minerals. 
With  successful  treatment  the  majority  of  the  minerals  are  returned  to  the  reservoir  by  re-injection.    Brines  can 
contain materials such as arsenic, lead and naturally occurring radioactive materials. Should precipitation of these 
minerals occur, collection and safe disposal is required by law.  Various substances which may be used on the plant 
sites,  including  industrial  lubricants,  and,  for  binary  systems,  motive  fluids  such  as  isopentane  are  hazardous 
materials  and  subject  to  federal,  state  and  local  statutory  and  regulatory  standards  relating  to  their  use,  storage, 
fugitive emissions and disposal. The cost of any investigation, remediation and/or cleanup activities in connection 
with a spill or other release of such contaminants could be significant. The environmental permits and approvals 
necessary for Ram’s projects have not been required at the current level of development and have not, to date, been 
applied for.
Competitive Conditions
The competition for Ram within the green power industry is currently characterized by often intense competition 
from other renewable power developers, as well as from the electric utilities that purchase green power but wish to 
own renewable generation facilities. However some 34 states have instituted mandates known as RPS which require 
load serving utilities to include an ever growing percentage of renewable energy in their electric supply.  Among the 
most ambitious is Nevada’s 20% by 2015 and California’s 33% by 2030. See “Market Opportunity – United Sates”
for a more detailed description of the RPS adopted in Nevada and California.
N-10
These  state  (and  planned  federal)  mandates  have  created  a  demand  for  renewable  projects,  which  need  to  be 
successfully  executed  by  experienced  teams  with  adequate  capital.  The  net  effect  is  that  favourable  market 
conditions  currently  exist  for  the  green  power  industry  and  the  number  of  new  renewable  energy  companies 
(especially wind developers) who have become entrants into the competitive bidding process, (which utilities are 
increasingly using to acquire renewable energy),  may  create  pressure to lower renewable energy prices. However, 
the upside is that geothermal as a reliable base load technology, which makes efficient use of transmission capacity, 
also  competes  well  with  other  renewable  technologies  on  price.  Therefore,  for  the  near  term,  despite  the  lower 
natural gas prices, the RPS mandates are expected to continue to spur the market for geothermal power and the load 
serving utilities are expected to continue to execute long term power purchase agreements for geothermal electricity 
at price levels which support attractive levels of profitability for Ram.
Employees & Specialized Skill and Knowledge
The success of geothermal development and operating companies is largely dependent on the skills, experience and 
efforts of the senior management team and other key personnel. Ram’s core management team includes individuals 
with project development experience in the renewable energy industry, both as individuals and previously working 
together as a development team within Ormat. This team has experience in all relevant areas encompassing land, 
permitting, geothermal exploration and drilling, power plant construction, power purchase agreements, transmission, 
project  operation  and  maintenance,  asset  management  and  financing.  Ram’s  management  believes  the  aggregate 
capabilities  of  this  team  as  well  as  additional  staff  that  will  be  added  in  the  future,  will  create  a  well-balanced 
company that has the experience necessary to pursue Ram’s focused business goals.
As  at  the  date  of  this  Information  Circular,  Ram  had  eight  members  of  its  team  at  its  head  office,  one  in  Los 
Angeles, California and three at Ram Power (Israel) Ltd.’s office in Israel. The key members of the management 
team are as follows:

Overview of Geothermal Power Industry
Geothermal energy is a clean, base load renewable and sustainable form of energy derived from the natural heat of 
the  earth.  Unlike  electricity  produced  by  fossil  fuel  combustion,  electricity  produced  using  geothermal  energy  is 
generated without any GHG emissions, and with far lower emissions of carbon dioxide. For most utilities electricity 
produced from geothermal energy  is the renewable energy of choice, since it is competitively priced, provides a 
portfolio based source which is not tied to fossil fuel pricing, and contributes insignificantly to air pollution and 
global warming.  Geothermal energy is also an attractive indigenous alternative to other sources of energy as part of 
a  national  diversification  strategy  to  avoid  dependence  on  any  one  energy  source  or  politically  sensitive  supply 
sources.
Geothermal  energy  is  delivered  to  the  surface  for  conversion  to  electricity  through  the  medium  of  underground 
entrapped water, which has been heated to temperatures as high as 600oF and is either in the form of steam or highly 
pressurized water. These geothermal resources are known as “hydrothermal resources”.
Hydrothermal energy at temperatures of 300oF or more is suitable for commercial electricity production and can be 
extracted  by  drilling  geothermal  wells.  The  energy  necessary  to  operate  a  geothermal  power  plant  is  typically 
obtained from several such wells, drilled using proven technology that is similar to that employed by the oil and gas 
industry. Since geothermal fluids cannot be transported economically over long distances due to heat and pressure 
loss, geothermal production wells are normally located within one to two miles of the power plant. The geothermal 
reservoir is a renewable source of energy if reinjection of produced geothermal fluids over the long-term replenishes 
the geothermal reservoir and the well field is properly managed. Geothermal energy projects typically have higher 
capital costs as a result of the costs to develop the well field. However  geothermal projects have significantly lower 
variable operating costs  than fossil fuel-fired power plants  since the wells represent the up front capitalization of 
the lifetime supply of fuel.
Binary System
Technology  developments  during  the  1980s  have  advanced  lower  temperature  geothermal  electricity  production. 
These plants, known as “binary” geothermal plants, today make use of resource temperatures as low as 265oF, as
N-12
high as 350oF. In the binary process, the geothermal fluid, which can be either hot water, steam, or a mixture of the 
two, heats another liquid such as isobutene or a refrigerant (known as the “working fluid”), that boils at a lower 
temperature than water. The two liquids are kept completely separate through the use of a heat exchanger used to 
transfer heat energy from the geothermal water to the working fluid. When heated, the working fluid vaporizes into 
gas and (like steam) the force of the expanding gas turns the turbines that power the generators.
Geothermal Binary Power Plant System
Flash Design System 
The most common type of power plant to date is the flash type power plant, where a mixture of liquid water and 
steam is produced from the wells. At a flash technology facility, hot liquid water from deep in the earth is initially 
under pressure and thus kept from boiling. As this hot water moves from deeper in the earth to shallower levels, it 
quickly loses pressure, boils and “flashes” to steam. The steam is separated from the liquid in a surface vessel (steam 
separator) and is used to turn the turbine, and the turbine powers a generator. Flash power plants typically require 
resource  temperatures  in  the  range  of  350  to  500oF.  A  number  of  technology  options  can  be  used  with  a  flash 
system. Double flashing, the most popular of these, may be more expensive than a single flash, but most geothermal 
developers agree that double flash is more cost effective than single flash because a larger portion of the resource is 
used.
N-13
Geothermal Single Flash Power Plant
In some instances, the wells directly produce dry steam (the flashing occurring under ground). In such cases, the 
steam is fed directly to the steam turbine and the rest of the system is similar to the flash power plant described 
above.
Market Opportunity
United States
The geothermal  energy  industry  in  the  United  States  experienced  significant  growth  in  the  1980s, followed by  a 
period of consolidation of geothermal operators during the hiatus in new projects caused by abnormally low natural 
gas prices in the 1990s.  Since 2001 there has been renewed interest in geothermal energy in the United States as 
geothermal  resources  have  become  more  competitive  relative  to  fossil  fuel-based  electricity  generation,  and  as 
legislative  and  regulatory  incentives,  such  as  state  renewable  portfolio  standards  and  federal  renewable  tax 
incentives have become more prevalent. The industry, once dominated by large energy companies, now includes 
several independent power producers.
Although electricity generation from geothermal resources is currently concentrated mainly in California, Nevada, 
Hawaii,  Idaho  and  Utah,  there  are  opportunities  for  development  in  other  states  such  as  Alaska,  Arizona, 
New Mexico and Oregon due to the availability of geothermal resources and, in some cases, a favourable regulatory 
environment in such states. The WGA estimates that some 6,000 MW of identified resources can be developed in 
the coming decade using existing technology at currently competitive pricing.
An  additional  factor  fuelling  recent  growth  in  the  renewable  energy  industry  is  global  concern  about  the 
environment. Power plants that use fossil fuels generate higher levels of air pollution and their emissions have been 
linked to acid rain and global warming. In response to an increasing demand for “green” energy, the United States 
like  many  other  countries  has  adopted  legislation  requiring,  and  providing  incentives  for,  electric  utilities  to  sell 
electricity generated from renewable energy sources. In the United States, 36 states and the District of Columbia 
have adopted RPS requiring or encouraging electric utilities in such states to include a certain percentage of their 
electricity supply from renewable energy sources.
In November 2008, California, adopted a goal for all retail suppliers of electricity to serve 33% of their load with 
renewable energy by 2020. California’s three large investor owned utilities collectively served 12.7% of their 2007 
electricity retail sales with renewable power. Nevada’s renewable portfolio standard requires each Nevada electric 
utility  to  obtain  9%  of  its  annual  energy  requirements  from  renewable  energy  sources  in  2007-2008,  which
N-14
requirement  thereafter  increases  by  3%  every  two  years  until  2015,  when  20%  of  energy  requirements  must  be 
provided  from  renewable  energy  sources  or  energy  efficiency  projects.  As  reported  in  the  Nevada  Energy  2008 
Sustainability  Report,  as  of  December 2007,  9.4%  of  the  electricity  retail  sales  in  Nevada  were  from  renewable 
energy sources.
Regional Initiatives are also being developed to reduce GHG emissions and develop trading systems for renewable 
energy  credits.  Although  individual  and  regional  programs  will  take  some  time  to  develop,  their  requirements, 
particularly the creation of any market-based trading mechanism to achieve compliance with emissions caps, should 
be  advantageous  to  in-state  and  in-region  energy  generating  sources  that  have  low  carbon  emissions  such  as 
geothermal energy. Although it is currently hard to quantify the direct economic benefit of these efforts to reduce 
GHG emissions, we believe they will prove advantageous to the geothermal industry.
The U.S. federal government also encourages production of electricity from geothermal resources through certain 
tax incentives. Under the recently enacted ARRA, geothermal projects are permitted to claim 30% of the cost of the 
equipment (as defined there) of each new geothermal power plant in the United States when such plant is placed in 
service  as  an  investment  tax  credit  against  federal  income  taxes.  Alternatively,  projects  are  permitted  to  claim  a 
“production tax credit”, which in 2008 was 2.1 cents per kWh and which is adjusted annually for inflation. The 
production tax credit may be claimed for ten years on the electricity output from any new geothermal power plants 
put into service prior to December 31, 2013. The owner of the project must choose between the production tax credit 
and the 30% investment tax credit described above. In either case, under current tax rules, any unused tax credit has 
a one-year carry back and a twenty-year carry forward.
Another  alternative  available  in  the  United  States  is  a  grant  in  lieu  of  the  investment  tax  credit  pursuant  to  the 
ARRA.  To qualify, the property must be placed in service in 2009 or 2010 or, if construction begins in 2009 or 
2010,  must  be  placed  in  service  by  the  end  of  2013  and  the  grant  application  is  made  before  October  1,  2011. 
Whether  the  production  tax  credit  or  the  investment  tax  credit  is  claimed,  project  owners  are  also  permitted  to 
depreciate most of the plant for tax purposes over five years on an accelerated basis.  If the investment tax credit is 
claimed, the “tax base” in the plant which is recoverable through depreciation must be reduced by half of the tax 
credit; if the production tax credit is claimed, there is no reduction in the tax basis for depreciation. Collectively, 
these tax benefits (to the extent fully utilized) have a present value equivalent to approximately 30% to 40% of the 
capital cost of a new project.
Production of electricity from geothermal resources is also supported under the new “Temporary Program For Rapid 
Deployment of Renewable Energy and Electric Power Transmission Projects” established with the U.S. Department 
of Energy as part of the Department of Energy’s existing Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. The new 
program: (i) extends the scope of the existing federal loan guarantee program to cover renewable energy projects, 
renewable energy component manufacturing facilities and electricity transmission projects that embody established 
commercial,  as  well  as  innovative,  technologies;  and  (ii) provides  an  appropriation  to  cover  the  “credit  subsidy 
costs” of such projects. Based on the appropriation of $6 billion dollars to pay the credit subsidy costs of guarantees 
issued under the new program, it is likely that between $60 billion to $120 billion of financing will be available to 
eligible projects, including geothermal power plants.
Outside of United States 
Outside  of  the  United  States,  power  generating  capacity  has  historically  been  owned  by  governments.  Since  the 
early  1990s,  however,  many  foreign  governments  have  privatized  their  power  industries  through  sales  to  third 
parties  and  have  encouraged  new  capacity  developments  by  independent  power  developers.  These  governments 
have taken a variety of approaches to encourage the development of competitive power markets, including awarding 
long-term contracts for energy and capacity to independent power generators and creating competitive wholesale 
markets  for  selling  energy,  capacity  and  related  products.  Some  countries  have  also  adopted  active  programs 
designed  to  encourage  clean  renewable  energy  power  generation.  Several  Latin  American  countries  have  such 
renewable energy programs. Currently Ram has no geothermal activities outside of the United States.
N-15
Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in the United States
The  following  is  a  summary  overview  of  the  U.S.  federal  and  state  regulations  which  are  applicable  to  the 
geothermal  industry  in  general.  These  should  not  be  considered  a  full  statement  of  the  law  or  of  all  the  issues 
pertaining:
PURPA
The  PURPA  provides  certain  benefits  described  below,  if  a  project  is  a  “Qualifying  Facility”.  A  small  power 
production facility is a Qualifying Facility if (i) the facility does not exceed 80 MWs, (ii) the primary energy source 
of the facility is biomass, waste, renewable resources, geothermal resources, or any combination thereof, and 75% of 
the  total  energy  input of  the  facility  is  from  these  sources,  and fossil fuel  input  is  limited  to  specified uses;  and 
(iii) the facility has filed with the FERC a notice of self-certification of qualifying status, or has filed with FERC an 
application for FERC certification of qualifying status that has been granted. The 80 MW size limitation, however, 
does not apply to a small power production facility of any size that is designated as “eligible” under section 3(17)(E) 
of the FPA. A small power production is designated as “eligible” under section 3(17)(E) of the FPA if (i) it produces 
electric  energy  solely  by  the  use,  as  a  primary  energy  source,  of  solar  energy,  wind  energy,  waste  resources  or 
geothermal resources; and (ii) an application for certification of the facility as a qualifying small power production 
facility, or a notice that the facility meets the requirements for qualification was submitted to the FERC not later 
than December 31, 1994, and construction of the facility commenced not later than December 31, 1999.
The  following  categories  of  Qualifying  Facilities  are  exempt  from  the  PUHCA,  State  laws  and  regulations 
respecting the rates and financial and organizational aspects of utilities, and most sections (not including sections 
205, 206 and certain other sections) of the FPA:  (i) cogeneration facilities of any size; (ii) small power production 
facilities  30 MW  or  smaller;  (iii) geothermal  and  biomass  small  power  production  facilities  of  any  size;  and 
(iv) small power production facilities of any size that are designated as “eligible” under section 3(17)(E) of the FPA. 
Additionally, energy and capacity sales made by Qualifying Facilities that are 20 MW or small, make sales pursuant 
to  a  contract  executed  on  or  before  March 17,  2006,  and  make  sale  pursuant  to  a  state  regulatory  authority’s 
implementation of section 210 of PURPA, are exempt from scrutiny under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA.
In addition, pursuant to FERC’s regulations promulgated under PURPA, Qualifying Facilities have the right to sell 
energy and capacity to a utility, provided the purchasing utility has not been relieved from its Qualifying Facility 
purchase obligation as discussed below. With limited exceptions, Qualifying Facilities generally have the option of 
selling  to  a  utility  either  at  a  rate  based  on  the  purchasing  utility’s  incremental  cost  of  purchasing  or  producing 
energy (also known as “avoided cost”) or a negotiated rate.
The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  also  allows  FERC  to  terminate  a  utility’s  obligation  to  purchase  energy  from 
Qualifying  Facilities  upon  a  finding  that  Qualifying  Facilities  have  nondiscriminatory  access  to  either 
(i) independently  administered,  auction-based  day  ahead  and  real  time  wholesale  markets  for  the  sale  of  electric 
energy  and  wholesale  markets  for  long-term  sales  of  capacity  and  electric  energy;  (ii) transmission  and 
interconnection  services  provided  by  a  FERC-approved  regional  transmission  entity  and  administered  under  an 
open-access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers, and competitive wholesale 
markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity and energy, including long and short term sales, to 
buyers other than the utility to which the Qualifying Facility is interconnected; or (iii) wholesale markets for the sale 
of capacity and electric energy that are, at a minimum, of comparable competitive quality as markets described in 
(i) and (ii) above. FERC issued Order 688 and 688-A to implement these provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 
2005.  Orders 688  and  688-A  establishes  the  process  by  which  electric  utilities  may  apply  to  be  relieved  of  the 
mandatory purchase obligation after August 8, 2005. Orders 688 and 688-A also create a rebuttable presumption that 
a utility provides nondiscriminatory access if it has an open access transmission tariff or a reciprocity tariff filed by a 
non-jurisdictional utility, in compliance with FERC’s pro forma open access transmission tariff. Further, Orders 688 
and 688-A provide a procedure for utilities that are not members of four named regional transmission organizations 
(Midwest  Independent  Transmission  System  Operator,  Inc.  (Midwest  ISO),  PJM  Interconnection,  L.L.C.  (PJM), 
ISO New England, Inc. (ISO-NE), or New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)) to file to obtain relief from 
the  mandatory  purchase  obligation  on  a  service  territory-wide  basis,  and  establishes  procedures  for  affected 
Qualifying Facilities to seek reinstatement of the purchase obligation. Orders 688 and 688-A protect a Qualifying
N-16
Facility’s rights under any contract or obligation involving purchases or sales that are entered into before FERC has 
determined that the contracting utility is entitled to relief from the mandatory purchase obligation.
Management expects all of Ram’s projects in the United States will meet all of the criteria required for Qualifying 
Facilities under PURPA.
State Regulation
Ram’s projects in California and Nevada, by virtue of being Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of 
electricity,  are  not  subject  to  rate,  financial  and  organizational  regulations  applicable  to  electric  utilities  in  those 
states. The projects will sell their electrical output under power purchase agreements to electric utilities (such as NV 
Energy,  Southern  California  Edison  or  Southern  California  Public  Power  Authority).  In  Nevada  and  California, 
investor owned electric utilities are regulated by their respective state public utility commissions.
RISK FACTORS
In addition to the risk factors set out below, readers should also carefully consider the risk factors set out under the 
heading entitled “Risk Factors” contained in “Appendix O – Information Concerning New GTO”.  All of the risk 
factors  described  below  and  in  such  schedule  should  be  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  other  information 
included in this Information Circular, including the schedules hereto.
Ram has a limited operating history.
Ram  has  a  very  limited  history  of  operations.  It  is  subject  to  many  of  the  risks  common  to  start  up  enterprises, 
including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources 
and  lack  of  revenues.  There  is  no  assurance  that  Ram  will  be  successful  in  achieving  a  return  on  shareholders’ 
investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of Ram’s early stage of operations.
From its inception Ram has incurred net losses. As a result of its planned exploration and plant expansion projects, 
over  the  near  term  management  expects  to  continue  to  incur  net  losses  until  Ram  is  able  to  generate  significant 
revenues. Ram’s ability to generate significant revenues and become profitable will depend on a number of factors, 
including its ability to:
• 
•
• 
• 
•
•
•
• 
• 
• 
•
successfully complete its planned exploration and expansion programs; 
acquire  interests  in  producing  geothermal  power  companies  or  producing  geothermal  power  plants  that 
contribute to profitability; 
acquire additional prospective exploration and development properties; 
advance planned and future exploration programs on exploration properties;  
verify  geothermal  resources  on  exploration  properties  that  that  are  sufficient  to  generate  a  favourable 
economic return from electricity sales; 
acquire  electrical  transmission  and  interconnection  rights  for  our  geothermal  power  plant  development 
projects;
enter  into  power  purchase  agreements  for  the  sale  of  electricity  from  its  geothermal  power  plant 
development projects at prices that support its operating and financing costs; 
finance and complete the development and construction of geothermal power plants on its properties; 
operate producing geothermal power plants on a profitable basis; 
secure adequate capital to support our expansion, exploration and development programs; and 
attract and retain qualified personnel.
Ram may continue to incur negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future.
Ram  currently  has  a  negative  operating  cash  flow  and  may  continue  to  do  so  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Ram’s 
failure  to  achieve  profitability  and  positive  operating  cash  flows  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our 
financial condition and results of operations.
N-17
Reliance on senior management team and outside contractors.
The success of the operations and activities of Ram is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of 
its management and outside contractors. Investors must be willing to rely to a significant extent on management's 
discretion and judgment, as well as the expertise and competence of outside contractors. The loss of one or more of 
these  key  employees  or  contractors,  if  not  replaced,  could  adversely  affect  Ram's  business,  financial  condition, 
results of operations and prospects.
DIVIDENDS
Since incorporation, Ram has not paid a dividend on its common shares or preferred shares and has no express or 
stated  policy  in  respect  of  the  declaration  or  payment  of  any  such  dividends.    Any  decision  to  declare  and  pay 
dividends  on  any  shares  of  Ram  in  the  future  will  be  made  by  the  Ram  Board  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  and 
conditions attaching to such shares, Ram’s earnings, financial conditions and requirements, and other conditions and 
factors existing at the time and which the Ram Board may consider appropriate in the circumstances.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Attached as Exhibit 1 hereto are the audited financial statements of Ram from the date of incorporation (January 4, 
2008) to the period ended December 31, 2008, including the notes thereto and the auditors’ reports thereon and the 
unaudited interim financial statements of Ram as at and for the six months ended June 30, 2009, including the notes 
thereto.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Attached as Exhibit 2 hereto is the management’s discussion and analysis of Ram for the period ended December 
31, 2008 and the interim period ended June 30, 2009.
DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL OF RAM
Ram is authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which, as at

(a)
(b)
(c)
to  receive  notice  of  and  to  attend  and  vote  at  all  meetings  of  shareholders,  except  meetings  at 
which only holders of a special class of shares are entitled to vote;
to  receive  any  dividend  declared  by  Ram  on  that  class  of  shares;  provided  that  Ram  shall  be

without being obligated to declare any dividends on the Ram Shares;
subject to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to any other class of Ram’s 
shares, to receive Ram’s remaining property upon dissolution in equal rank with the holders of all

to the rights, privileges and restrictions normally attached to common shares.
N-18
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements
Ram has entered into certain restricted stock purchase agreements and amendments to each restricted stock purchase 
agreement with certain holders of Ram Shares (the “Restricted Stock Agreements”).  Under the Restricted Stock 
Agreements, if such a holder of Ram Shares ceases to be an employee, advisor, officer or director of Ram or one of 
its subsidiaries (a “Service Provider”), Ram has an option to repurchase (the “Repurchase Option”) any of the 
Ram Shares which have not been released from the Repurchase Option (the “Unreleased Shares”).
Under the Restricted Stock Agreements, 1/4 of the total number of Ram Shares were released from the Repurchase 
Option on March 1, 2009, and thereafter, so long as the holder of Ram Shares remains a Service Provider of Ram, an 
additional  1/48th  of  the  total  number  of  Ram  Shares  will  be  released  from  the  Repurchase  Option  on  the 
corresponding  day  of  each  month  thereafter,  until  all  of  the  Unreleased  Shares  have  been  released  no  later  than 
March 1, 2012.
With regard to Ram Shares subject to a Repurchase Option, in the event of (i) the death or disability of a holder of 
any Ram Shares, (ii) a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Restricted Stock Agreements), (iii) Ram’s 
initial public offering of the Ram Shares, (iv) Ram’s election not to renew the status of any holder of Ram Shares as 
a Service Provider through March 31, 2012 on terms substantially similar to the terms of employment or consulting 
relationship the holder of the Ram Shares had with Ram or one of its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, or (v) 
the termination of any holder of Ram Shares as a Service Provider without cause or for good reason (each as defined 
in the Restricted Stock Agreement), all of the Ram Shares that have not been released from the Repurchase Option 
as of immediately prior to such event, will be immediately released from the Repurchase Option, provided that the 
status of the holder of such Ram Shares as a Service Provider  has not been terminated for cause prior to the date of 
such event described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above.
Before  any  Ram  Shares  subject  to  a  Restricted  Stock  Agreement  can  be  sold,  transferred,  or  encumbered  or 
otherwise disposed of in any way, the Restricted Stock Agreement requires that the holder of Ram Shares must first 
offer to Ram the right to purchase the Ram Shares, with the exception of certain transfers to family.
On  or  before  the  closing  of  the  Ram  Acquisition,  the  Restricted  Stock  Agreements  will  be  terminated,  the  Ram 
Shares  subject  to  the  escrow  under  the  Restricted  Stock Agreement  will  be released  from  escrow and  such  Ram 
Shares will be exchanged for GTO Shares as more fully described in the Information Circular.
Ram Preferred Shares
The following is a summary of certain attributes and characteristics of the Ram Preferred Shares.
Dividends
The holders of Ram Preferred Shares are entitled to receive dividends, if, as and when declared by the Ram Board, 
in priority to any distribution on Ram Shares.  Dividends on Ram Preferred Shares are not cumulative, and shall be 
paid on a pro rata, pari passu basis in proportion to an annual rate of $0.192 per share (subject to adjustment).
Liquidation Rights
Ram Preferred Shares rank in priority to the Ram Shares with respect to distributions on the dissolution, liquidation 
or  winding  up  of  Ram.  A  reorganization  is  deemed  to  be  a  “dissolution,  liquidation  or  winding  up”  event  for 
purposes of the priority rights of Ram Preferred Shares over the Ram Shares.
Conversion Rights
The holders of Ram Preferred Shares can elect to convert the Ram Preferred Shares into fully-paid non-assessable 
Ram common stock, at a quantity determined by dividing the “Original Issue Price” (as defined in Ram’s constating 
documents)  by  the  “Conversion  Price”  (as  defined  in  Ram’s  constating  documents)  in  effect  at  the  time  of 
conversion.  Ram Preferred Shares shall automatically be converted into Ram common stock immediately prior to
N-19
the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering, provided that the aggregate proceeds to Ram 
are not less than $50,000,000 and the public offering price per share is at least $10.00.  Such automatic conversion 
can also occasion (i) upon the request of the majority of the then holders of outstanding Ram Preferred Shares or (ii) 
when cumulative conversion of Ram Preferred Shares constitutes a majority of all Ram Preferred Shares issued by 
Ram.
Voting Rights
Holders of Ram Preferred Shares shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of Ram shares of 
common stock into which the shares of Ram Preferred Shares held by such holder could be converted as of a record 
date.  Holders of Ram Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote on all matters in which the holders of Ram Shares 
are entitled to vote. Ram Shares and Ram Preferred Shares shall vote together and not as separate classes.  Other 
than as provided in Ram’s constating documents or required by law, there shall be no series voting.
Amendments and Changes
The approval of a majority of the holders of Ram Preferred Shares, voting as a separate class, is needed to, among 
other things, liquidate, dissolve, wind up, or reorganize Ram.
There are no pre-emptive or redemption rights attaching to the Ram Preferred Shares.
CONSOLIDATED CAPITALIZATION
There have been no material changes to Ram’s share capital on a consolidated basis since June 30, 2009.

STATEMENT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The  Ram  Board  determines  the  compensation  to  be  provided  to  the  executive  officers  and  directors  of  Ram.  
Compensation of all executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, is based on the underlying philosophy 
that such compensation should be competitive with other corporations of similar size and should be reflective of the 
experience, performance and contribution of the individuals involved and the overall performance of Ram.
“Named Executive Officers” is defined by Canadian securities legislation to mean each of the following individuals, 
namely: (i) the Chief Executive Officer of Ram; (ii) the Chief Financial Officer of Ram; (iii) each of Ram’s three 
most highly compensated executive officers, or the three most highly compensated individuals acting in a similar
N-23
capacity,  other  than  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  at  the  end  of  the  most  recently 
completed financial year whose total compensation was, individually, more than C$150,000 for that financial year; 
and  (iv)  each  individual  who  would  be  a  “Named  Executive  Officer”  under  (iii)  above  but  for  the  fact  that  the 
individual was neither an executive officer of Ram, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of the most recently 
completed financial year end (the “Named Executive Officer”).  For purposes of this Information Circular, the five 
executive  officers  of  Ram  listed  in  the  table  under  the  heading  “Summary  Compensation  Table”  are  the  Named 
Executive Officers for the financial period ended December 31, 2008.
The objectives of Ram’s executive compensation are twofold, namely: (i) to enable Ram to attract and retain highly 
qualified  and  experienced  individuals  to  serve  as  Named  Executive  Officers;  and  (ii) to  align  the  compensation 
levels available to the Named Executive Officers to the successful implementation of Ram’s strategic plans.
Ram’s executive compensation program consists of a combination of the following significant elements, namely: 
base salary, and, where appropriate, annual bonus and participation in the Ram Option Plan.  These elements contain 
both short-term incentives, comprised of cash payments, being those provided by way of base salaries and annual 
bonuses, as well as long-term incentives, comprised of equity-based incentives, being those provided under the Ram 
Option  Plan.    Extended  health  care,  dental  and  insurance  benefits  are  provided  to  all  employees,  including  the 
Named Executive Officers.  The amount for each element of Ram’s executive compensation is determined based 
upon  compensation  levels  provided  by  Ram’s  competitors  as  well  as  upon  the  discretion  of  the  Ram  Board  in 
relation to annual bonuses and the granting of Ram Options.  Each element of Ram’s executive compensation is 
intended to contribute to an overall total compensation package which is designed to provide both short-term and 
long-term financial incentives to the Named Executive Officers and to thereby assist Ram to successfully implement 
its strategic plans.
Stock Option Plan
Ram  created  the  Ram  Option  Plan  to  provide  additional  incentive  to  its  directors,  employees  and  consultants  of 
Ram, which permits the granting of incentive stock options, non statutory stock options and restricted stock as the 
Ram Board may determine up to a maximum of 900,000 shares of common stock.  Non statutory stock options may 
be granted to service providers.  Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees. The Ram Option Plan 
was approved by the board of directors and shareholders of Ram.  The number of Ram Shares subject to an option to 
any one participant and the exercise price of the stock option shall be determined by the Ram Board at the time of 
grant.  Ram Options granted under Ram Option Plan will be for a term of no longer than 10 years from the date of 
grant.
As of the date hereof Ram has not issued any stock options under the Ram Option Plan.

Voting Agreement
On May 15, 2008, Ram entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) among Ram and all the holders 
of  the  Ram  Shares  and  Ram  Preferred  Shares  (the  “Voting  Parties”).  Under  the  Voting  Agreement,  the  Voting 
Parties  agreed  to  vote  all  of  the  shares  of  Ram  to  elect  (and  maintain  in  office)  members  of  the  Ram  Board  as 
follows (i) two (2) directors chosen by Enterra, and (ii) two (2) directors chosen by a  majority-in-interest of the 
holders  of  the  Ram  Shares.  The  Voting  Parties  also  agreed  to  cause  the  elected  members  to  the  Ram  Board  to 
appoint one of the directors chosen by Enterra as the Chairman of the Ram Board (and any replacement thereof) as
N-26
specified by Enterra. On March 9, 2009, the Ram Board, with the approval of the holders of a majority of the Ram 
Preferred Shares, appointed a fifth director to the Ram Board.
The  Voting  Agreement  provides  that  it  terminates  upon  a  “Change  of  Control  Transaction”  which  is  defined  to 
include the direct or indirect acquisition of Ram through the sale by the Ram Shareholders of the total voting power 
represented  by  the  outstanding  voting  securities  of  Ram.  Accordingly,  the  Voting  Agreement  will  automatically 
terminate upon the closing of the transactions contemplated under the Share Purchase Agreement.

1.
Organization and description of business
Ram Power, Inc. (the “Company” or “RPI”) was incorporated on January 4, 2008 under the laws 
of the State of Delaware to take advantage of the opportunities available in the geothermal 
electricity production market in the United States. The Company is a renewable energy 
development company with the primary mission of developing geothermal power projects in 
North America and has acquired several geothermal properties in Nevada and California in the 
United States. The Company continues to accumulate additional interests in geothermal 
resources for potential future projects.
The Company is in the exploration stage on all of its properties and has not determined whether 
they contain geothermal reserves that are economically recoverable. The recoverability of the 
amount shown for geothermal properties is dependent upon the discovery of economically 
recoverable reserves and on attaining future profitable production.
The Company believes it has sufficient funds to finance its current operating, development and 
exploration expenditures. Longer term, the Company may pursue opportunities to raise 
additional capital through equity and/or debt markets as it progresses towards and reaches 
commercial production.  There can, however, be no assurance it will be able to raise funds in 
the future.
2.
Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements and do 
not contain all of the information that is required for annual financial statements. Accordingly, 
they should be read in conjunction with the consolidated annual financial statements for the 
period from the date of incorporation (January 4, 2008) to December 31, 2008.
The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies and 
methods of their application as the December 31, 2008 consolidated annual financial 
statements, except for changes described below.
Future changes in accounting policies
Business Combinations/Consolidated Financial Statements/Non-Controlling Interests
In January 2009, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued Sections 
1582, Business Combinations, 1601, Consolidated Financial Statements, and 1602, Non-
Controlling Interests which superseded current sections 1581, Business Combinations and 1600, 
Consolidated Financial Statements. These sections will be applied prospectively to business 
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual 
reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Earlier adoption is permitted. The 
Company has not early adopted these sections.
Goodwill and intangible assets
In February 2008, the CICA issued Section 3064, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, which 
provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure for goodwill 
and intangible assets, other than the initial recognition of goodwill or intangible assets acquired 
in a business combination. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 
October 1, 2008, and requires retroactive application to prior period financial statements. The 
Company has adopted this Section as of January 1, 2009. This section had no material impact 
on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies (continued)
Changes in accounting policies
Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company has adopted EIC 173, Credit Risk and Fair Value of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which clarifies that the credit risk of counterparties 
should be taken into account in determining the fair value of derivative instruments. EIC 173 
has been applied retrospectively without restatement of prior periods to all financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value for the period ended March 31, 2009. The adoption of this new 
accounting standard did not significantly impact the amounts reported or disclosures in the 
Company’s financial statements.
3.
Cash and cash equivalents
At June 30, 2009, included in cash and cash equivalents are funds invested by the Company in 
Certificates of Deposits of $NIL (December 31, 2008 - $4,000,000) and money market deposits 
of $4,126,149 (December 31, 2008 -$1,514,228).

Financial risks and market management
Pledged financial assets
The Corporation has financial assets that are pledged for reclamation obligations. Reclamation 
deposits and bonds, in the amount of $253,700 (2008 - $254,627), are maintained to satisfy 
the Corporation’s obligation for future reclamation expenditures at its various exploration 
properties. In the event that the Company does not pay its obligations with respect to any 
reclamation expenditures, the bonds will be released to the security holders. The Company 
plans to mitigate this risk by actively monitoring any activities that would give rise to such 
reclamation costs in the future.
10.  Segmented information
The Company currently operates in one reportable operating segment, being the acquisition, 
exploration, and development of geothermal properties, which is conducted principally in the 
United States of America.

recoverable reserves and on attaining future profitable production,
The Company believes it has sufficient funds to finance its current operating, development and
exploration expenditures Longer term, the Company may pursue opportunities to raise
additional capital through equity and/or debt markets as it progresses towards and reaches
commercial production There can, however, be no assurance it will be able to raise funds in the
future.

2. Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies
These Consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles.
Significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiary, Ram Power (Israel) Ltd. All interrcompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated on consolidation.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks and on hand as well as highly liquid
Investments with maturities of 90 days or less.
Equipment
Equipment is recorded at cost and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the Power Purchase Agreement as follows:
Furniture and ﬁxtures 7 years
Office equipment 5 years
Revenue recognition
Revenue for consulting services is generally recognized when pervasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the sen/ices have been rendered] the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. If there is a signiﬁcant uncertainty about
the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenue is deferred
until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. Contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees are
recognized on a proportional performance basis,

Geothermal propertles
All expenditures related to the acquisition and exploration of geothermal properties are
capitalized on an individual prospect basis until such time as commercial production is
established or the project is determined by management to be Impaired, abandoned or sold.
Amounts received for the sale of properties, for option payments and for exploration advances
are treated as reductions of the cost of the property, payments in excess of capitalized costs are
recognized in Income. Costs for a producing project will be amortized on a straightrllne basis
over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease or the PPA, while costs for the prospects
abandoned are written off. The Company reviews the carrying value of the property on a regular
basis for impairment
If there has been a delay in exploration activity that extends beyond three years, the Company
writes off any exploration or acquisition costs related to that property unless persuasive
evidence exists to the contrary to support the carrying value as being recoverable. The amount
shown for the geothermal properties represents toss incurred to date and does not necessarily
reflect present or future values.
The recoverability of the amounts capitalized for the geothermal properties being explored and
developed is dependent upon the determination of economical electrical generation capabilities,
the ability to obtain the necessary financing to complete their development, and future
profitable production or proceeds from the disposition thereof.
Impairment of long/Ned assets
The Company reviews and evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of all its
equipment and geothermal properties when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used are
measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to future undiscounted net cash
ﬂows expected to be generated by the asset. The amount of the Impairment loss is determined
as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.
Foreign currency translation
The United States dollar is the functional currency of the Company and its reporting currency
The Company translates transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than the US.
dollar at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction datest Monetary assets and liabilities of
the Company denominated In foreign currencies are translated into US. dollars at the exchange
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at
the historical exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions
denominated in currencies other than the US. dollar are included in loss for the period.
The Company follows the temporal method when translating the financial statements of its
integrated subsidiary. Under the temporal method, foreign currency—denominated monetary
assets and liabilities are translated using rates at the consolidated balance sheet date and none
monetary assets and liabilities are translated using mtes on the transaction date. Revenue, cost
of revenue and expenses are translated at average rates for the year. Amortization is translated
at the same rate as the related assets. Exchange gains or losses are included in loss for the
year.
Income taxes
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby future income
taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying statutory
tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the ﬁnancial statement carwing
amounts and the tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes a Future
income tax asset when it appears more likely than not that some or all of the future Income tax
assets will be realized,

2. Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Asset retirement obligations
Future costs to retire an asset, including remediation and ongoing treatment and monitoring of
the site, are recognized and recorded as a liability initiain at fair value. The liability is accreted
over time through periodic charges to operations. In subsequent periods, the liability is adjusted
for any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying cash flows. The asset retirement cost
is capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying value and amortized over the asset’s useful life,
once put into use. Future asset retirement obligations are not recorded where timing or amount
of the remediation costs cannot be reasonably estimated.
Use of estimates
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The critical
accounting estimates include estimating the depreciable lives of equipment and geothermal
properties, projecting cash flows used in the determination of the impairment analysis for
equipment and geothermal properties, stock based compensation, and recognizing future
income tax assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
asses and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies as at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Stock based compensation
The Company has adopted the fair value method of accounting for its stock»based
compensation. Under this method, compensation expense for stock options granted to
employees and directors are measured at the fair value at the grant date using the Black-
Scholes valuation model and are recognized as an expense over the vesting period of the
options granted with an offset to Contributed Surplus. When options are exercised, the
corresponding amounts in Contributed Surplus and the proceeds received by the Company are
credited to Share Capital.
Comprehensive income
Comprehensive income includes net income as well as certain gains and losses required to be
recognized in comprehensive income, but excluded from net income. These gains and losses are
recognized in other comprehensive income and include unrealized gains or losses on available-
forasale investments; and the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives designated as
cash flow hedges. These unrealized gains and losses are reclassified from other comprehensive
income to net income when realized.
Should the Company recognize any other comprehensive income in the future, the cumulative
changes in other comprehensive income would be recognized in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income which would be presented as a new category within Shareholders’
Equity on the Balance Sheet.
Financial instruments
The Company has classiﬁed all financial assets into one of the following four categories: 1) loans
and receivables, 2) assets held-to-maturity, 3) assets available—fonsale, and 4) held—for
trading.

2. Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Significant accounting policies (continued)
All financial liabilities have been classified as either: 1) other financial liabilities, or 2) heldvfor—
trading. Financial instruments classified as held»for—trading are measured at fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized in net income. Financial assets classified as availabie-for-sale
are measured at fair Value, with unrealized changes in fair value recognized in other
comprehensive income.
All other ﬁnancial instruments are measured at amortized cost with foreign exchange gains and
losses recognized immediately in net income.
The following is a summary of the accounting model the Company has elected to apply to each
of its significant categories of financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2008:
Cash and cash equivalents Held-for-trading
Redemption deposits and bonds Loans and recaivables
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Other Liabilities
Long term liabilities Other Liabilities
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are separated from their host contracts and
accounted for as derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely
related to those of the host contract; the terms of the embedded derivative are the same as
those of a free standing derivative; and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes therein recognized in net
income. As at December 31, 2008, the Company does not have any outstanding contracts or
ﬁnancial instruments with embedded derivatives that require bifurcation.
Derivatives
Derivatives are carried at fair value and are reported as assets where they have a positive fair
value to the Company and as liabilities where they have a negative fair value to the Company.
The change in fair value during the year is recorded in net loss.
Hedging
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the derivative no longer qualiﬁes as an
effective hedge, or the derivative is terminated or sold, or upon the sale or early termination of
the hedged item. Hedge accounting enables the recording of gains, losses, revenue and
expenses from the derivative financial instruments in the same period as for those related to
the hedged item. The Company did not designate any of its ﬁnancial instruments for accounting
purposes as hedges.
Transaction costs
Transaction costs related to held for trading financial assets and held for trading financial
liabilities are expensed to interest and other income and expenses, net as incurred. Transaction
costs related to available for sale financial assets, held to maturity financial assets, other
liabilities and loans and receivables are capitalized and are then amortized over the expected
life of the Instrument using the effective interest method.

Effective interest method
The Company uses the effective Interest method of amortization for transaction costs or fees,
premiums or discounts earned or incurred for financial instruments.
Determination of fair value
The fair value of a ﬁnancial instrument is the amount of consideration that would be agreed
upon In an arm's length transaction between knowledgeable, Willing parties who are under no
compulsion to act. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is the transaction
price, which is the fair value of the consideration given or received. Subsequent to initial
recognition, the fair values of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets are based
on Did prices for ﬁnancial assets held and offer prices for financial liabilities. When independent
prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques which refer to
observable market data. These include comparisons with similar instruments where market
observable prices exist, discounted cash ﬂow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation
techniques commonly used by market participants, For certain derivatives, fair values may be
determined in whole or in part from valuation techniques using non-observable market data or
transaction prices. A number of factors such as bid 7 offer spread, credit profile and model
uncertainty are taken into account, as appropriate, when values are calculated using valuatlon
techniques.
Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated in accordance with the
treasury stock method which assumes that proceeds received from the exercise of stock options
would be used to repurchase Common shares at the prevailing market rate.
Future changes in accounting policies
Goodwill and intangible assets
in February 2008, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") issued Section
3064, Goodwill and Intangible Assets which provides guidance on the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure for goodwill and intangible assets, other than the
initial recognition of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in a business combination, The
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2008, and requires
retroactive application to prior period financial statements. The Company is evaluating the
impact of this new standard for adoption on January 1, 2009 and does not expect any
significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Business combinations/consoiidated ﬁnanciai statements/non-controiling interests
In January 2009, the CICA adopted Sections 1582, Business Combinations, 1601, Consolidated
Financial Statements, and 1602, Non—Controlling Interests which superseded current sections
1581, Business Combinations and 1600, Consolidated Financial Statements. Section 1582
applies to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2011, however,
earlier adoption is permitted. Sections 1601 and 1602 apply to interim and annual consolidated
financial statements with fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Early adoption is
permitted as of the beginning of a ﬁscal year. If an entity applies these sections before January
‘ l, 2011, it is required to disclose that fact and apply each of the new sections concurrently.
i These new sections were created to converge Canadian GAAP and IFRS.

10. Financial risks and market management
The Company is exposed to ﬁnancial risks arising from its finanmal assets and liabilities, The
financial risks include market risk relating to commodity prices, interest rates and foreign
exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in the market interest rates,
The Company’s interest bearing financial assets comprise short term investments, where the
money market deposits bear interest at a variable rate. As a result of the relatively low interest
rates earned on the variable interest money market deposits, management has determined the
overall interest rate risk is low, and the estimated effect of a 100 basis points change in interest
rates would not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations Further, the
Company has also determined that a 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not
have a material impact on the fair value of the short term investment when compared to its
carrying value.
Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of the changes In the foreign exchange rates, The Company's functional and
reporting currency is the United States dollar. The Company incurs foreign currency risk on
purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the
Company, which Will have an impact on the proﬁtability of the Company and may also affect the
value of the Company’s assets and the amount of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s main
risks are associated with fluctuations in the US dollar (“USD”) and assets and liabilities are
translated based on foreign currency translated policy described in Note 2(c). The Company
does not enter into any foreign exchange contracts. As at December 31, 2008, the Company
had no significant financial instrument stated in a foreign currency.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Company if a partner or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and reclamation deposits and bonds.
The Company has deposited the cash and cash equivalents and short term investments with
reputable financial institutions, from which management believes the risk of loss to be remote.

10. Financial risks and market management (continued)

Credit risk (continued)

Management considers the credit risk associated with reclamation deposits and bonds to be low

as these deposits are held in Certiﬁcates of Deposit With reputable financial institutions,

The carrying value of these instruments represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit

risk.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as

they become due. The Company actively manages its liquidity through cash and equity

management strategies. Such strategies include continuously monitoring forecasted and actual
cash ﬂows from operating, financing and investing activities, available credit under existing
banking arrangements and opportunities to issue additional Company shares

Pledged ﬁnancial assets

The Company has financial assets that are pledged for reclamation obligations. Reclamation

deposits and bonds, in the amount of $254,527, are maintained to satisfy the Corporation’s

obligation for future reclamation expenditures at its various exploration properties, In the event

that the Company does not pay its obligations with respect to any reclamation expenditures, the

bonds Wlll be released to the security holders. The Company plans to mitigate this risk by

actively monitoring any activities that would give rise to such reclamation costs in the future,
11. Capital management

The Company’s objectives when managing capital are:

. To maintain and safeguard its accumulated capital In order to provide an adequate return to
shareholders by maintaining a sufficient level of funds, to support continued evaluation and
maintenance at the Company’s existing properties, and to acquire, explore, and develop
other geothermal properties.

- Tn invest cash on hand in higth liquid and highly rated financial instruments with high
credit quality issuers, thereby minimizing the risk and loss of principal.

- To obtain the necessary financing to complete exploration and development of its
properties, if and when it is required.

In the management of capital, the Company includes working capital and shareholders’ equity in

the definition of capital. The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to

it, based on the level of funds required to manage Its operations in light of changes in economic
conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying assets.

In order to facilitate the management of capital, the Company may issue new equity, incur

additional debt, option its properties for cash and/or expenditure commitments from optionees,

enter into joint venture arrangements, or dispose of certain assets. The Company’s investment
policy is to hold cash in interest bearing accounts at high credit quality ﬁnancial institutions to
maximize liquidity.

The Company nor its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements and do

not have exposure to assetsbatked commercial paper or similar products.

12. Segmented information

The Company currently operates in one reportable operating segment, being the acquisition,

exploration, and development of geothermal properties, which is conducted principally in the

United States of America.

13. Subsequent events
Proposed sale of RP!
On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into a letter of intent with GTO Resources Inc. (“GTO”)
whereby GTO agreed to acquire all the issued and outstanding securities of RPI (the “Proposed
Acquisition”) from each of the security holders, such that the Company will become a wholly-
owned subsidiary of GTO upon completion of the Proposed Acquisition.
Prior to or concurrent with the Proposed Acquisition a ﬁnancing of such dollar amount
satisfactory to both RPI and GTO and commensurate With the magnitude of a Business
Combination (the "Financing") will be completed as a condition to closing the Proposed
Acquisition. The use of proceeds of the Financing will be utilized to develop key projects of a
Business Combination. The terms and conditions of the Financing will be negotiated by the
parties.
Upon closing of the Proposed Acquisition, the board of directors of GTO shall appoint a new
management team that will include the current management of the Company and GTO will
change its name to "Ram Power Corporation".
Completion of the Proposed Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions,
including, but not limited to, acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange. Other necessary
conditions to the closing of the Proposed Acquisitionl include obtaining all other necessary

1. Corporate overview and vision
The  Company  was  incorporated  on  January  4,  2008  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware.    On 
February  12,  2008,  the  Company  incorporated  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Ram  Power  (Israel)  Ltd. 
under the laws of Israel. On June 16, 2009, the Company organized a wholly owned subsidiary, Orita 
Geothermal  1  LLC,  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware.  Subsequently  on  July  16,  2009,  the 
Company  organized  two  additional  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  Orita  Geothermal  2  LLC  and  Orita 
Geothermal 3 LLC, all under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is a renewable energy 
development  company  with  the  primary  mission  of  developing  geothermal  power  projects  in  North 
America.  During  the  period  ended  June  30,  2009,  Ram  acquired  more  private  geothermal  leases  in 
California,  United  States.  The  Company  continues  to  accumulate  additional  interests  in  geothermal 
resources for potential future projects.
The Company is in the exploration stage on all of its properties and has not determined whether they 
contain  geothermal  reserves  that  are  economically  recoverable.  The  recoverability  of  the  amount 
shown  for  geothermal  properties  is  dependent  upon  the  discovery  of  economically  recoverable 
reserves and on attaining future profitable production.
Ram also plans to develop, own and operate a medium size (20 to 40MW) air cooled modular solar 
thermal  project  utilizing  a  patent  pending  Ram  proprietary  Solar  Thermal  Integrated  Cycle  (“STIC”) 
technology  in  concert  with  concentrating  parabolic  collectors.  As  part  of  its  technological 
enhancements  plans,  Ram  plans  to  ultimately  combine  the  solar  plants  with  the  geothermal  plants, 
offering a unique package of both base load and peak power supply to the utilities. Ram is seeking 
separate funding for its solar thermal development.
Based  on  the  Company’s  current  development  plan,  Ram  anticipates  completing  and  operating 
upwards of 200 MW of geothermal power projects by 2014.
Corporate development activities
On March 9, 2009, the Company restructured its Board of Directors to include Mr. Yeheskel (Hezy) 
Ram (Ram’s CEO) as a director, Messrs Alexander Guðmundsson and Assaf Topaz as two new 
directors and to appoint Mr. Ásgeir Margeirsson as a new Chairman of the Board of Directors.
2. Overall performance
During the six months period ended June 30, 2009, the Company recorded a net loss of $1,099,289 or 
$0.21  per  share.  The  Company’s  financial  results  are  discussed  in  further  detail  under  “Results  of 
operations” below.
As at June 30, 2009, the Company has total assets of $10,456,242, including $4,450,084 in cash and 
cash equivalents and $5,641,545 in Geothermal properties, as further described below.
The  Company  continues  to  use  the  proceeds  from  shares  issued  in  the  previous  fiscal  period  for 
acquisition  of  geothermal  properties  in  North  America,  initiation  of  exploration  work  on  these 
properties as well as meeting its working capital requirements, including administrative and corporate 
costs through the 2009 fiscal year. As part of a business combination of Ram with other geothermal 
developers  and  the  equity  funding  as  further  detailed  in  Section  9  below,  Ram  will  have  access  to 
sufficient  additional  capital  to  carry  out  its  exploration  and  development  activities  in  the  next  few 
years.
During the period ended June 30, 2009, through to the date of this MD&A, the Company carried out 
the following significant business development activities:
ϰ
a. Geothermal properties
The Company pursued development of its geothermal projects in Imperial Valley, California through 
acquisition of private geothermal leases, initiation of interconnection studies with the Imperial 
Irrigation District and negotiations of a power purchase agreement with South California Edison 
Company. Subsequently, in July 2009, the Company acquired additional leaseholds covering 
approximately 32,670 acres in Nevada and California through the BLM auction process.  In August 
2009, Ram acquired an additional approximately 4,609 acres in Nevada from a third party through a 
BLM lease assignment. Since late 2008 Ram has been conducting negotiations to secure geothermal 
leases on private lands in the Imperial Valley of California. To date this has resulted in approximately 
4,000 acres of executed leases for the Orita and New River projects.
The Company performed geological studies on private lands in the Imperial Valley of California and on 
BLM lands in Nevada.
Orita, California, United States of America
During  2009  Ram  acquired  approximately  3,552  acres  of  geothermal  leases  on  private  lands  in  the 
Imperial Valley of California for its Orita project.
The  Orita  leasehold  is  located  in  the  East  Brawley  Known  Geothermal  Resource  Area  (“KGRA”). 
Concurrent  with  KGRA  designation  in  1981,  a  total  of  eight  deep  exploration  wells  were  drilled  by 
Unocal,  Occidental  and  Phillips  Petroleum  in  the  area.  These  wells  were  completed  at  depths  from 
8,500 ft to 13,500 ft and all encountered high temperature geothermal resources with temperatures 
as high as 575ºF.  Testing of one well confirmed flow rates in excess of 500,000 lbs per hour at a well 
head  pressure  of  560  psig,  demonstrating  six  MW  capacity  from  the  seven  inch  diameter  well 
completion. In addition, operators drilled shallow gradient and slim-hole wells that confirm the extent 
of  the  thermal  system  and  bore  hole  geophysics  and  mud  logs  are  available  to  quantify  and 
characterize  all  sandstone  units  that  may  be  potential  production  horizons.    Commercial  diameter 
wells  are  expected  to  produce  at  levels  of  12  MW  or  greater  in  this  resource.    The  flow  tests 
demonstrate that a deep high salinity reservoir is present and wells also show evidence of low salinity 
fluids  produced  from  shallower  depths.    The  temperature  profiles  within  the  15  square  mile  area 
tested by the existing deep drilling are similar and all demonstrate temperatures of 400ºF at a depth 
of  7,000  ft.    These  shallower  “stacked”  reservoirs  are  contained  in  sand  units  at  these  depths  and 
show  dissolved  solids  content  in  the  range  of  9,000  to  50,000  ppm  consistent  with  other  pumped 
resources found in the Salton Trough. Ram estimates that the reservoir can support three 49.9 MW 
power plants within the current leasehold of about 5.5 square miles.  Additional leasing in the project 
area could increase potential up to 300 MW.
The  leases  are  subject  to  certain  royalties  whereby,  the  Company  is  required  to  pay  the  private 
landowners certain percentage of gross revenue from the sale of electricity, by products derived from 
geothermal resource production and geothermal resources. Annual lease commitments are disclosed 
under the heading “Contractual obligations and commitments” below.
In July 2009 the Company entered into a power purchase agreement (“PPA”) with Southern California 
Edison Company (“SCE”) for 40 to 100 MW for sale from the Orita project with a planned commercial 
operation date of December 31, 2012. The Company may at its sole discretion exercise two expansion 
options, each of the same size. Each of the Orita expansion projects is planned to be developed at one 
year intervals after the first project. In conjunction with the PPA the Company applied for 200 MW of 
transmission capacity from the Imperial Irrigation District for the delivery to SCE. The Company plans 
to  apply  for drilling  permits  on  the  Orita  leasehold  in  second  half  of  2009  with  drilling  expected  to 
commence  in  early  2010.  Total  expenditures  through  the  end  of  2010,  including  permitting, 
geophysics, drilling, engineering and legal expenses, are expected to be approximately $40 million. An 
application for a US DOE loan guarantee is to be filed in 2009 to support the project financing in 2010.
ϱ
New River, California, United States of America
During  2009  Ram  acquired  approximately  475  acres  of  geothermal  leases  on  private  lands  in  the 
Imperial Valley of California for its New River project.
The New River leasehold is located in the South Brawley resource area, adjacent to the Mesquite Lake 
basin which is defined as a local zone of subsidence within the Salton Trough.  Resource delineation 
consists of a range of data including 40 shallow gradient holes and intermediate depth holes drilled up 
to  2,000  ft  and  deep  tests  within  the  Mesquite  Lake  basin  drilled  to  12,910  ft.  A  thermal  anomaly 
defines an area of shallow resource which covers an area of 12 square miles.  The intermediate depth 
temperature profiles within this anomaly measure +200ºF at 2000 ft and predict +400ºF at 6,000 ft.  
As in other locations in the Imperial Valley, the deep hyper-saline resource is overlain by lower salinity 
fluids  contained  in  shallower  sand  units.    Initial  development  at  New  River  will  target  the  400ºF 
resource  beneath  the  shallow  thermal  anomaly  at  depths  near  6,000  ft.    Based  on  the  size  of  the 
shallow  heat  anomaly  a  49.9  MW  development  is  planned  for  this  area  with  additional  leases  to  be 
acquired.
The  leases  are  subject  to  certain  royalties  whereby,  the  Company  is  required  to  pay  the  private 
landowners certain percentage of gross revenue from the sale of electricity, by products derived from 
geothermal resource production and geothermal resources. Annual lease commitments are disclosed 
under the heading “Contractual obligations and commitments” below.
The  Company  plans  to  complete  its  leasing  process  for  the  New  River  project  during  2010  and 
subsequently commence permitting and exploration activities on the site. The Company estimates that 
its budget for these activities in 2010 will be approximately $5 million with up to an additional $30 
million planned in 2011 for production well drilling and other development activities.
Geothermal database
The  Company  developed  a  GIS  based  geothermal  database  for  the  Imperial  Valley,  California.  The 
database includes both proprietary and public data for over 950 shallow and intermediate depth wells 
that provide temperature profiles and thermal gradients within the Imperial Valley.  The database is 
able to produce temperature gradient maps and depth slices for evaluation of geothermal potential of 
properties  throughout  the  region.    In  addition,  well  data  from  exploration  and  production  drilling 
records are incorporated to correlate deep drilling data with shallow temperature interpretations.
The following is a summary of the carrying values of the Company’s accumulated geothermal property 
costs as at June 30, 2009:

The  Company  continued  to  work  on  a  US  and  European  patent  for  its  STIC  technology.  The  STIC 
technology combines advantageous attributes of both the steam cycle and the organic Rankine cycle 
ϲ
that improves plant economics by using heat supplied at different temperature levels and eliminates 
the  need  for  large  quantities  of  cooling  water.  The  patent  will  provide  the  Company  with  exclusive 
access to the STIC technology. The Company estimates that the patent will be issued to the Company 
in  late  2010.  The  Company  estimates  that  it  will  have  to  spend  additional  $20,000,  mainly  in  legal 
fees, to process the patent application.
c. Electricity contracts
The Company submitted a proposal to SCE for supply of 49.9 MW flash technology geothermal power 
from the Orita project area in the Imperial Valley of California. Subsequently, on July 31, 2009 Ram 
entered into a PPA with SCE for supply of 49.9 MW, which Ram may at its option expand to up to 300 
MW.
The  Company  submitted  several  other  power  supply  proposals  from  its  projects  in  Nevada  and 
California  to  a  number  of  public  utilities.  Some  of  these  proposals  were  shortlisted  by  the  public 
utilities for further discussions. The Company expects that these discussions may result in one or more 
PPAs for the Company in 2010.
3. Results of operations
The Company’s financial data is presented based on Canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”).
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  Company’s  financial  results  of  its  operations  should  be 
read in conjunction with the Company’s unaudited financial statements for the three and six months 
periods ended June 30, 2009 and comparative periods.
As  the  result  of  the  business  combination  and  equity  funding  as  discussed  in  Section  9  below,  the 
Company believes it will have sufficient funds to finance its operating, development and exploration 
expenditures  in  the  next  few  years.  Longer  term,  the  Company  may  pursue  opportunities  to  raise 
additional  capital  through  equity  and/or  debt  markets  as  it  progresses  towards  and  reaches 
commercial production. Management is of the opinion that additional financing is available and may be 
sourced in time to allow the Company to continue its planned activities in the normal course. There 
can, however, be no assurance it will be able to raise funds in the future.
a. Revenues
Six months ended June 30, 2009
The Company is in the exploration stage on all of its properties and has not yet started generating 
power. Revenues decreased to $26,400 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to $57,000 
for the period from January 4, 2008 to June 30, 2008.  These revenues arose from consulting services 
provided.
The net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $1,099,289 compared to $188,182 for the 
comparative period.  The increase in loss is attributed to the hiring of a management team that have 
extensive proven project development experience in the renewable energy industry and the setting up 
of office space and required equipment for a good environment, which occurred mostly towards the 
end  of  June  2008.  Therefore,  the  six  months  period  ended  June  30,  2009  included  six  months  of 
expenses  for  salaries  and  benefits  and  general  and  administrative  costs  which  were  minimal  during 
most of the comparative period.
Current period net loss also included $44,543 of interest income from surplus funds on hand invested 
in  certificates  of  deposits  and  money  market  deposits  compared  to $11,816  for  the  corresponding 
period  in  2008  as  the  proceeds  of  more  than  half  of  the  approximately  $12.6  million  raised  by  the 
Company in 2008 came in after June 30, 2008.
ϳ
The net loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was consequently $0.21 compared to 
$0.04 for the period from January 4, 2008 to June 30, 2008.
Three months ended June 30, 2009
Revenues  were  $2,500  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  versus  $27,000  for  the 
corresponding period in 2008. These revenues arose from consulting services provided.
The  net  loss  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  increased  by  $376,379  to  $567,815  when 
compared with the comparative period in 2008. The increase in loss is attributable to the hiring of a 
management  team  and  directors  and  setting  up  of  adequate  office  space  in  June  2008.  Therefore, 
there were only less than a month of salaries and benefits and general and administration costs in the 
three months period to June 30, 2008. These items are discussed in more details below. Offsetting the 
increase in expenses is a decrease of $37,997 in professional fees as there were more legal fees in 
2008 to set up the corporate structures of the group.
The  net  loss  per  share  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  was  consequently  $0.11  versus 
$0.04 for the three months ended June 30, 2008.

Salaries  and  benefits  were  paid  to  employees  at  both  the  U.S.  office  and  the  Israel  office  and 
increased to $784,036 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 versus $81,247 for the comparative 
period because most of the employees were hired towards the end of June 2008.
Professional fees increased from $134,899 for the period from January 4, 2008 to June 30, 2008 to 
$178,835 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 because of an increase in professional services due 
to the Company’s efforts to acquire more geothermal properties and raise additional capital.
General and administrative expenses, which includes mainly office rent and travel expenses, increased 
from $22,744 for the period ended June 30, 2008 to $174,496 for the period ended June 30, 2009 and 
ϴ
is attributable to the fact that the offices were ready by and employees started working towards the 
end of June 2008.
Amortization for the six months ended June 30, 2009 was $15,512 versus $8,226 for the comparative 
period,  reflecting  the  additional  equipment  acquired  since  June  30,  2008  and  also  the  fact  that  the 
equipment in 2008 was acquired in the second quarter.
Three months ended June 30, 2009
Salaries and benefits, paid to employees at both the U.S. office and the Israel office, increased from 
$81,247 for the three months ended June 30, 2008 to $382,105 for the same period ended in 2009 
because most of the employees were hired towards the end of June 2008.
Professional fees of $108,675 for the three months ended June 30, 2008 included legal fees for setting 
up the corporate structure of the group. There were no such fees for the three months ended June 30, 
2009 and professional fees decreased to $70,678.
The  Company  opened  its  offices  towards  the  end  of  June  2008  and  therefore  general  and 
administrative  expenses  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  ($103,461)  were  much  higher 
than the corresponding period in 2008 ($22,222).
Amortization  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  was  $11,637  versus  $8,226  for  the 
comparative period, reflecting the additional equipment acquired since June 30, 2008.
4. Liquidity and capital resources
As of June 30, 2009, the Company had $4,450,084 in cash and cash equivalents, current assets of 
$4,479,779,  total  current  liabilities  of  $203,468  and  a  working  capital  of  $4,276,311.  The  current 
liabilities consist of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Negative cash flows of $1,064,934 were recorded from operating activities for the six months period 
ended  June  30,  2009  compared  to  negative  $51,511  for  the  comparative  period.  The  increase  in 
negative cash flows was mainly due to the larger net loss during this pre-commercial production phase 
of the Company.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the period from January 4, 2008 (date of incorporation) to 
June 30, 2008 was $4,974,627 and was due to issuance of Common shares and Series A preferred 
shares. There was no issuance of shares during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and consequently 
cash provided by financing activities was nil.
Net cash of $391,094 was used for investing activities during the six months ended June  30,  2009, 
representing an increase of $357,985 compared to the period from January 4, 2008 to June 30, 2008. 
This increase was mainly due to the additions of $390,323 to geothermal properties discussed above.
Reclamation  deposits  and  bonds  are  maintained  to  satisfy  the  Company’s  obligation  for  future 
reclamation  expenditures  at  its  various  exploration  properties.  In  the  event  that  the  Company  does 
not pay its obligations with respect to any reclamation expenditures, the bonds will be released to the 
security holders.

exploration  and  development  leases,  licenses  and  permits  must  be  maintained  and  paid  for 
annually. These obligations may be varied from time to time, subject to approval, and are expected 
to be fulfilled in the normal course of operations of the Company. The lease commitments above 
are minimum annual lease payments based on those properties in which the Company presently 
has an interest and may increase if new applications are granted in the future.
7. Off-balance sheet arrangement
As  of  the  date  of  this  MD&A,  the  Company  does not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  that 
have,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have,  a  current  or  future  effect  on  the  results  of  operations  or 
financial condition of the Company including, without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and 
capital resources that have not previously been discussed.
8. Related party transaction
The following transaction was made in the normal course of business and has been recorded at the 
exchange amount, being the amount agreed upon by the related parties.
On  September  1,  2008,  the  Company  executed  a  consulting  agreement  with  Engeocon  LLC,  a 
company owned by a relative of Stuart D. Johnson, an officer and shareholder of the Company, for the 
total amount of $100,000 to develop a geothermal database for Ram, as detailed above. For the six 
months ended June 30, 2009, the amount paid or accrued under this agreement was $25,000. As of 
ϭϬ
September  15,  2009  there  are  no  on-going  contractual  or  other  commitments  resulting  from  the 
transaction.
9. Proposed transactions
a) Proposed sale
On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into a letter of intent with GTO Resources Inc. (“GTO”) 
whereby  GTO  agreed  to  acquire  all  the  issued  and  outstanding  securities  of  Ram  (the  “Proposed 
Sale”) from each of the security holders, such that Ram will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
GTO upon completion of the Proposed Sale.
One of the conditions to closing the Proposed Sale was that an equity financing be completed. The 
equity  financing  is  discussed  in  further  detail  under  Section  9(f)  “Equity  Financing”  below.  The 
proceeds of the equity financing will be utilized to develop key projects.
Completion of the Proposed Sale is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, 
but not limited to, acceptance by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Other necessary conditions to the 
closing of the Proposed Sale, include obtaining all other necessary director, shareholder, regulatory 
and third-party approvals and authorizations, the completion of a definitive agreement setting forth 
the terms and conditions set out in the Letter of Intent and the completion of due diligence. There 
can be no assurance that the Proposed Sale will be completed as proposed or at all.
On September 8, 2009 GTO and Ram entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which 
GTO agreed to acquire 99.9%  of the issued and outstanding securities of Ram.
b) Proposed business combination
On July 15, 2009 GTO, Polaris Geothermal Inc. (“Polaris”), Western GeoPower Corp. (“Western”) 
and  Ram  announced  that  they  had  entered  into  a  letter  of  intent  (the  “LOI”)  with  respect  to  a 
proposed business combination to create a new, publicly-traded geothermal power company (the 
“Business Combination”) and together raise C$100 million in equity financing.
Shareholders of Polaris, which has geothermal projects in Latin America, are planned to own the 
majority  share  of  the  new  company,  with  approximately  a  35.7%  stake.  Western,  active  in 
California and Canada, is planned to own approximately 13.3%, with Ram owning approximately 
7.0% and GTO owning approximately 0.6%.
Completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions and approvals which 
include completion of the equity financing on acceptable terms; the satisfactory completion of due 
diligence  investigations;  the  completion  of  a  definitive  agreement  setting  forth  the  terms  and 
conditions set out in the LOI; approval of securityholders of GTO, Polaris and Western at a special 
meeting  of  such  securityholders;  approval  of  shareholders  of  Ram;  approval  of  holders  of 
debentures of Polaris; approval of certain lenders of Western; court approval; and the approval of 
all relevant regulatory authorities and third parties.  There can be no assurance that the Business 
Combination or the equity financing will be completed as proposed or at all. The LOI provides for 
termination  rights,  including  in  the  event  the  Business  Combination  is  not  completed  by  October 
30, 2009.
On September 8, 2009, GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram entered into an arrangement agreement, 
whereby GTO agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Polaris and Western 
by way of a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
ϭϭ
c) Acquisition of BLM leases
On  July  14,  2009,  the  Company  acquired  through  the  BLM  auction  process, 32,672  acres  of 
geothermal leases in Nevada and California for a total amount of $265,590.
d) Signing of a power purchase agreement
On  July  31,  2009,  the  Company  executed  an  agreement  with  SCE  for  the  supply  of  up  to  300 
megawatts  of  geothermal  power  from its  Orita  geothermal  project.  Under  the  agreement,  the 
Company has to post a development security in favor of SCE in the amount of approximately US $1 
million, 50% of which was due and paid by August 30, 2009 and the remaining 50% is due upon 
an approval of the agreement by California Public Utilities Commission.
e) Acquisition of geothermal property
On August 3, 2009, Ram entered into two geothermal and one surface use lease agreements with 
private landowners for a total of 3,352 acres for its Orita geothermal project.
f) Equity Financing
On August 6, 2009 GTO announced that it will increase the size of its proposed equity financing 
(the  “Financing”)  of  subscription  receipts  (“Subscription  Receipts”)  to  C$156  million  from  C$100 
million. An aggregate of 52 million Subscription Receipts will be offered at an anticipated price of 
C$3 per Subscription Receipt, each exercisable into one common share of GTO (after giving effect 
to a 10 for 1 consolidation). In addition, GTO agreed to grant its agents an over-allotment option, 
exercisable in whole or in part prior to the closing of the Private Placement, to offer for sale up to 
an additional 7.8 million subscription receipts for additional proceeds of C$23.4 million.
Subsequently,  on  August  20,  2009,  GTO  announced  that  it  successfully  completed  the  Financing 
with  a  syndicate  of  agents  led  by  Cormark  Securities  Inc.  and  including  Raymond  James  Ltd., 
Ambrian  Partners  Limited,  Canaccord  Capital  Corporation,  Dundee  Securities  Corporation  and 
Wellington  West  Capital  Markets (collectively,  the  “Agents”).  Pursuant  to  the  Financing,  an 
aggregate  of  59.8  million  Subscription  Receipts  were  issued  (including  7.8  million  Subscription 
Receipts  issued  pursuant  to  the  exercise  in  full  by  the  Agents  of  an  over-allotment  option)  at  a 
price  of  C$3per  Subscription  Receipt  for  aggregate  gross  proceeds  of  C$179.4  million.  The 
Subscription  Receipts  issued  pursuant  to  the  Financing  are  subject  to  a  hold  period  under 
applicable securities laws expiring on December 21, 2009.
The  proceeds  of  the Financing,  less  the  Agents’  expenses,  will  be  held  in  escrow  pending  the 
completion  of  the  Business  Combination,  as  disclosed  in  9(b)  above.  Each  Subscription  Receipt 
purchased under the Financing will entitle the holder to receive, for no additional consideration, one 
common share in the combined entity following completion of the Business Combination.
The  proceeds  of  the  Financing  will  be  used  to  develop  key  projects  of  the  combined  businesses 
upon  completion  of  the  Business  Combination,  debt  repayment  of  the  combined  entity  and  for 
working capital and general corporate purposes.
10. Risks and uncertainties
Ram  Power,  Inc.  is  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  due  to,  among  other  things,  the  nature  of  the 
business. The following factors should be considered:
Lack of cash flow and additional capital requirements
ϭϮ
Ram  currently  has  a  negative  operating  cash  flow  and  may  continue  to  do  so  for  the  foreseeable 
future. Ram’s failure to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows could have a material 
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In  order  to  proceed  with  the  development  of  the  geothermal  properties,  additional  funds  will  be 
required.  Failure  to  obtain  sufficient  financing  may  result  in  the  development  of  the  properties not 
being accomplished. There can be no assurance that the additional capital or other types of financing 
will  be  available  when  needed  or  that,  if  available,  the  terms  of  such  financing  will  be  on  terms 
favourable to Ram. The principal source of future funds presently available to Ram is through the sale 
of equity and provision of bank debt.
In  the  event  that  the  financing  is  not  available  the  Company  would  have  to  look  to  strategic 
alternatives which may include joint venturing its project with other companies, the sale of assets or 
the postponement of the project.
Seasonal considerations
The  geothermal  resource  as  a  fuel  supply  does  not  have  seasonal  variations  and  the  type  of 
geothermal  projects  which  Ram  expects  to  construct  will  not  be  dependent  on weather  conditions. 
However,  the  various  power  plant  technologies  perform  with  somewhat  higher  efficiency  when  the 
ambient temperatures are lower. This is particularly the case for the binary power plant technology 
which  may  be  utilized  for  geothermal  resources  below  350ºF,  as  typically  found  in  Nevada.  For  the 
higher temperature resources, such as at the Orita and New River project areas, which may utilize the
flash based steam turbine technology, this seasonal effect may be nominal. The major seasonal issue 
is  the  fact  that  the  California  investor  owned  utilities  generally  have  a  “time  of  use”  payment 
arrangement  whereby  electricity  supplied  by  a  geothermal  project  during  summer  on- peak  periods 
(during the hottest portion of the day) is paid for at a rate that may be two or three times the price 
per kilowatt hour that is paid for electricity supply during winter off- peak periods (night time). Though 
this  seasonality  is  accounted  for  in  scheduling  maintenance,  the  effect  of  unscheduled  repairs  or 
equipment  failure  during  peak  seasonal  payment  periods  may  have  a  severe  impact  on  operating 
revenues if corrective action is not taken promptly.
Reliance on senior management team and outside contractors
The success of the operations and activities of Ram is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts 
and  abilities  of  its  management  and  outside  contractors.  Investors  must  be  willing  to  rely  to  a 
significant extent on management's discretion and judgment, as well as the expertise and competence 
of outside contractors. The loss of one or more of these key employees or contractors, if not replaced, 
could adversely affect Ram's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Resource risks
The ability to extract sufficient geothermal fluid of usable quality from the resource, in a cost-effective 
manner, is typically the greatest uncertainty in a geothermal power development. This encompasses a 
number  of  risks  including:  (i)  whether  the  stored  heat  capacity  of  the  resource  is  sufficient  for  the 
proposed power output, (ii) whether the well targeting, design and drilling and prevailing geological 
conditions  permit  ready  extraction  of  the  fluid  and  (iii)  whether  the  production  fluid  composition 
facilitates convenient and economical handling and utilization. 
The Company has performed geological studies on the geological properties acquired to help reduce 
this risk from that which is normal for projects of this type; however, there are risks as to whether the 
geothermal reserves are economically recoverable.
Limited operating history
Ram has a very limited history of operations. It is subject to many of the risks common to start up 
enterprises,  including  under-capitalization,  cash  shortages,  limitations  with  respect  to  personnel, 
financial, and other resources and lack of revenues. There is no assurance that Ram will be successful
ϭϯ
in achieving a return on shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in 
light of Ram’s early stage of operations.
From  its  inception  Ram  has  incurred  net  losses.  As  a  result  of  its  planned  exploration  and  plant 
expansion projects, over the near term management expects to continue to incur net losses until Ram 
is  able  to  generate  significant  revenues.  Ram’s  ability  to  generate  significant  revenues  and  become 
profitable will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
successfully complete its planned exploration and expansion programs;
acquire  interests  in  producing  geothermal  power  companies  or  producing  geothermal  power 
plants that contribute to profitability;
acquire additional prospective exploration and development properties;
advance planned and future exploration programs on exploration properties;
verify  geothermal  resources  on  exploration  properties  that  that  are  sufficient  to  generate  a 
favourable economic return from electricity sales;
acquire  electrical  transmission  and  interconnection  rights  for  our  geothermal  power  plant 
development projects;
enter  into  power  purchase  agreements  for  the  sale  of  electricity  from  its  geothermal  power 
plant development projects at prices that support its operating and financing costs;
finance  and  complete  the  development  and  construction  of  geothermal  power  plants  on  its 
properties;
operate producing geothermal power plants on a profitable basis;
secure  adequate  capital  to  support  our  expansion,  exploration  and  development  programs; 
and
attract and retain qualified personnel.
State and federal legislative or regulatory developments
Ram’s  activities  are  subject  to  various  laws  governing  development,  production,  taxes,  labour 
standards and occupational health, safety, toxic substances, resource exploitation and other matters. 
No assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules 
and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. 
Amendments  to  current  laws  and  regulations  governing  Ram’s  operations  and  activities  or  more 
stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company.
Environmental matters
Geothermal operations can produce significant quantities of brine and scale, which builds up on metal 
surfaces in any equipment with which the brine comes into contact. These waste materials, some of 
which  are  currently  reinjected  into  the  subsurface,  can  contain  materials  (such  as  arsenic,  lead  and 
naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials)  in  concentrations  that  exceed  regulatory  limits  used  to 
define hazardous waste. Various substances are used, including isopentane, and industrial lubricants, 
that could become potential contaminants and are generally flammable. Hazardous materials are also 
used and generated in connection with equipment manufacturing operations. As a result, all projects 
are  subject  to  numerous  domestic  and  foreign  federal,  state  and  local  statutory  and  regulatory 
standards relating to the use, storage, fugitive emissions and disposal of hazardous substances. The 
cost  of  any  investigation,  remediation  and/or  cleanup  activities  in  connection  with  a  spill  or  other 
release  of  such  contaminants  could  be  significant.  Any  disposal  or  release  of  these  materials  onto 
project  sites,  other  than  by  means  of  permitted  injection  wells,  could  lead  to  contamination  of  the 
environment  and  result  in  material  cleanup  requirements  or  other  responsive  obligations  under 
applicable environmental laws. As of the date hereof the environmental permits and approvals
necessary for the development of Ram’s current projects have not been applied for.
Economic conditions
Once  production starts, Ram’s business will be dependent on the sale of electricity and by products 
derived from geothermal resource production and geothermal resources and its operating results will 
be  sensitive  to  prevailing  economic  conditions,  including  changes in  local,  regional  and  national
ϭϰ
economic  conditions,  particularly  as  they  may  affect  demand  for  energy.  Ram’s  operating  results  in 
individual markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns, which could 
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of the Company.
Competitive conditions
The competition for Ram within the green power industry is currently characterized by often intense 
competition from other renewable power developers, as well as from the electric utilities that purchase 
green power but wish to own renewable generation facilities. However some 34 states have instituted 
mandates  known  as    Renewable  Portfolio  Standards,  (“RPS”)  which  require  load  serving  utilities  to 
include  an  ever  growing  percentage  of  renewable  energy  in  their  electric  supply.  Among  the  most 
ambitious is Nevada’s 20% by 2015 and California’s 33% by 2030. These state (and planned federal) 
mandates have created a demand for renewable projects, which need to be successfully executed by 
experienced teams with adequate capital. The net effect is that favourable market conditions currently 
exist  for  the  green  power  industry  and  the  number  of  new  renewable  energy  companies  (especially 
wind developers) who have become entrants into the competitive bidding process, (which utilities are 
increasingly  using  to  acquire  renewable  energy),  may  create  pressure  to  lower  renewable  energy 
prices.  However  the  upside  is  that  geothermal  as  a  reliable  base  load  technology,  which  makes
efficient use of transmission capacity, also competes well with other renewable technologies on price. 
Therefore, for the near term, despite the lower natural gas prices, the RPS mandates are expected
to  continue  to  spur  the  market  for  geothermal  power  and  the  load  serving  utilities  are  expected  to 
continue  to  execute  long  term  power  purchase  agreements  for  geothermal  electricity  at  price  levels 
which support attractive levels of profitability for Ram.
11. Critical accounting policies and estimates
The  Company’s  significant  accounting  policies  are  presented  in  Note  2  of  the  interim  consolidated 
financial statements for the period from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009. The preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates 
and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of 
income and expenses during the reported period. These estimates include:
•
•
•
•
the carrying values of geothermal property costs;
the carrying values of equipment;
the rates of amortization of equipment; and
the valuation allowances and estimates for future income tax obligations.
Management  believes  the  estimates  used  are  reasonable;  however,  actual  results  could  differ 
materially from those estimates and, if so, would impact future results of operations and cash flows. 
Factors that could potentially affect these estimates include risks inherent  in  geothermal  exploration 
and development, prices and markets for electricity and changes in government policy.  The Company 
is  engaged  in  an  industry  that  is  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  that  may  be  beyond  the 
Company’s control including environmental and legal risks, the existence of economically recoverable 
resources  and  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  obtain  necessary  financing  to  construct  plant  and 
transmission facilities. Management has assessed the carrying value of its assets and does not believe 
that the assets have suffered any impairment. The Company is in the development stage and defers 
all  expenditures  related  to  its  geothermal  properties  until  such  time  as  the  properties  are  put  into 
production,  sold,  or  abandoned.  Management  will  assess  the  exploration  results  on  its  geothermal 
projects  and  determine  whether  these  results  warrant  further  exploration.  If  results  do  not  indicate 
potential  for  an  economic  geothermal  property,  the  deferred  exploration  costs  will  be  written  off. 
Under this method, all amounts shown as geothermal properties represent costs incurred to date less 
amounts,  if  any,  amortized  and/or  written  off  and  do  not  necessarily  represent  present  or  future 
values.

12. Changes in accounting policies
Goodwill and intangible assets
In  February  2008,  the  CICA  issued  Section  3064,  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets  which  provides 
guidance  on  the  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and  disclosure  for  goodwill  and  intangible 
assets,  other  than  the  initial  recognition  of  goodwill  or  intangible  assets  acquired  in  a  business 
combination.  The  standard  is  effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  October  1,  2008,  and 
requires  retroactive  application  to  prior  period  financial  statements.  The  Company  has  adopted  this 
Section  as  of  January  1,  2009.  This  section  had  no  material  impact  on  the  Company's  consolidated 
financial statements.
Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company has adopted EIC 173, Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial 
Assets  and  Financial  Liabilities,  which  clarifies  that  the  credit  risk  of  counterparties  should  be  taken 
into  account  in  determining  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments.  EIC  173  has  been  applied 
retrospectively without restatement of prior periods to all financial assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value for the period ended June 30, 2009. The adoption of this new accounting standard did not 
significantly impact the amounts reported or disclosures in the Company’s financial statements
13. New accounting pronouncements
Business Combinations/Consolidated Financial Statements/Non-Controlling Interests
In  January  2009,  the  CICA  adopted  Sections  1582,  “Business  Combinations”,  1601,  “Consolidated 
Financial Statements”, and 1602, “Non-Controlling Interests” which superseded current sections 1581, 
“Business  Combinations”  and  1600,  “Consolidated  Financial  Statements”.  Section  1582  applies  to 
business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2011, however, earlier adoption 
is  permitted. Sections 1601 and 1602 apply to  interim  and  annual  consolidated  financial  statements 
with fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning 
of  a  fiscal  year. If an entity applies these sections before January 1, 2011, it is required to disclose 
that  fact  and  apply  each  of  the  new  sections  concurrently.  These  new  sections  were  created  to 
converge Canadian GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
14. Financial instruments
Under  GAAP,  all  financial  instruments  must  be  classified  into  a  defined  category,  namely,  held-to-
maturity,  available  for  sale,  loans  and  receivables,  held-for-trading  financial  assets  or  financial 
liabilities and other financial liabilities.
The  carrying  values  of  the  Company’s  financial  instruments  as  at  June  30,  2009  and  December  31, 
2008 are classified into the following categories:
Category
Held for trading assets (liabilities) (a)

(a) Cash and cash equivalents measured at fair value.
(b) Reclamation deposits and bonds measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
(c) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long term liabilities measured at amortized cost.
Fair value
Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant 
information  about  financial  markets  and  specific  financial  instruments.  As  these  estimates  are 
subjective  in  nature,  involving  uncertainties  and  matters  of  significant  judgement,  they  cannot  be 
determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair values.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate 
their carrying values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Company’s interest bearing financial assets comprise short term investments, where the money 
market deposits bear interest at a variable rate. As a result of the relatively low interest rates earned 
on the variable interest money market deposits, management has determined the overall interest rate 
risk is low, and the estimated effect of a 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a 
material  effect  on  the  Company’s  results  of  operations.  Further,  the  Company  has  also  determined 
that a 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value 
of the short term investment when compared to its carrying value.
Currency risk
The  Company’s  functional  and  reporting  currency  is  the  United  States  dollar.  The  Company  incurs 
foreign  currency  risk  on  purchases  that  are  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional 
currency of the Company, which will have an impact on the profitability of the Company and may also 
affect the value of the Company’s assets and the amount of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s main 
risks are associated with fluctuations in the US dollar (“USD”). The Company does not enter into any 
foreign exchange contracts. As at June 30, 2009, the Company had no significant financial instrument 
stated in a foreign currency.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of 
cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable  and  reclamation  deposits  and  bonds.  The  Company 
has  deposited  the  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short  term  investments  with  reputable  financial 
institutions,  from  which  management  believes  the  risk  of  loss  to  be  remote. Management  considers 
the credit risk associated with reclamation deposits and bonds to be low as these deposits are held in 
Certificates  of  Deposit  with  reputable  financial  institutions.  The  carrying  value  of  these  instruments 
represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity Risk
The Company  actively  manages  its  liquidity  through  cash  and  equity  management  strategies.    Such 
strategies include continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows from operating, financing
ϭϳ
and  investing  activities,  available  credit  under  existing  banking  arrangements  and  opportunities  to 
issue additional Company shares.
15. Outlook
The  Company  will  continue  its  effort  towards  building  a  geothermal  portfolio  and  proceed  with  the 
development  and  operation  of  these  geothermal  properties,  as  well  as  consider  future  project 
acquisitions to create sustainable growth to Ram’s asset base.

1. Corporate overview and vision
The  Company  was  incorporated  on  January  4,  2008  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Delaware.    On 
February  12,  2008,  the  Company  incorporated  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Ram  Power  (Israel)  Ltd. 
under the laws of Israel. The Company is a renewable energy development company with the primary 
mission  of  developing  geothermal  power  projects  in  North  America.  During  the  period  ended 
December 31, 2008, Ram has acquired several geothermal properties in Nevada, United States. The 
Company  continues  to  accumulate  additional  interests  in  geothermal  resources  for  potential  future 
projects.
The Company is in the exploration stage on all of its properties and has not determined whether they 
contain  geothermal  reserves  that  are  economically  recoverable.  The  recoverability  of  the  amount 
shown  for  geothermal  properties  is  dependent  upon  the  discovery  of  economically  recoverable 
reserves and on attaining future profitable production.
Ram also plans to develop, own and operate a medium size (20 to 40MW) air cooled modular solar 
thermal  project  utilizing  a  patent  pending  Ram  proprietary  Solar  Thermal  Integrated  Cycle  (“STIC”) 
technology  in  concert  with  concentrating  parabolic  collectors.  As  part  of  its  technological 
enhancements  plans,  Ram  plans  to  ultimately  combine  the  solar  plants  with  the  geothermal  plants, 
offering a unique package of both base load and peak power supply to the utilities. Ram is seeking 
separate funding for its solar thermal development.
Based  on  the  Company’s  current  development  plan,  Ram  anticipates  completing  and  operating 
upwards of 200 MW of geothermal power projects by 2014.
2. Overall performance
During  the  period  ended  December  31,  2008,  the  Company  recorded  a  net  loss  of  $1,253,270  or 
$0.24  per  share.  The  Company’s  financial  results  are  discussed  in  further  detail  under  “Results  of 
operations” below.
As at December 31, 2008, the Company has total assets of $11,538,726, including $5,907,055 in cash 
and cash equivalents and $5,256,222 in Geothermal properties, as further described below.
During  the  period  ended  December  31,  2008,  the  Company  secured  approximately  $12.6 million  in 
corporate  financing,  net  of  share  issuance  costs.  The  Company  issued  5,350,000  common  shares, 
including 4,375,000 shares at a price of $0.0001 per share and 975,000 shares at a price of $0.001 
per share, for total gross proceeds of $1,475 and 5,277,777 Series A preferred shares at a price of 
$2.40 per share for total gross proceeds of $12,666,667. These proceeds will provide sufficient funds 
for the Company to acquire geothermal properties in North America to start exploration work on these 
properties and to meet its working capital requirements, including administrative and corporate costs 
through  the  2009  fiscal  year.  As  part  of  a  business  combination  of  Ram  with  other  geothermal 
developers and the equity funding as further detailed in Section 9 below, upon successful completion 
of  the  business  combination,  Ram  expects  to  have  access  to  additional  capital  to  carry  out  its 
anticipated exploration and development activities over the next year.
During the period ended December 31, 2008, through to the date of this MD&A, the Company carried 
out the following significant business development activities:
a. Geothermal properties
The  Company  has  entered  into  several  leaseholds  covering  approximately  24,330  acres  of  land  in 
Nevada  through  the  United  States  Department  of  the  Interior  Bureau  of  Land  Management  (“BLM”) 
public  auction  in  August  2008.  Subsequently,  in  July  2009,  the  Company acquired  additional 
ϰ
leaseholds  covering  approximately  32,670  acres  in  Nevada  and  California  through  the  BLM  auction 
process.  In August 2009, Ram acquired an additional approximately 4,609 acres in Nevada from a 
third party through a BLM lease assignment. Since late 2008 Ram has been conducting negotiations to 
secure  geothermal  leases  on  private  lands  in  the  Imperial  Valley  of  California.  To  date  this  has 
resulted in approximately 4,000 acres of executed leases for the Orita and New River projects.
The Company performed geological studies on private lands in the Imperial Valley of California and on 
BLM lands in Nevada.
Clayton Valley, Nevada
At the BLM auction on August 4, 2008 Ram acquired the 6,518 acre Pearl Hot Springs prospect and 
the 7,626 acre Weepah prospect. At the BLM auction in 2009, Ram acquired the 9,581 acre Weepah 
North prospect, the 10,201 acre Montezuma prospect, and the 10,118 acre Alkali prospect. These five 
lease blocks, totalling approximately 44,044 acres are all located in Esmeralda County Nevada, which 
is near highway U.S. 95 south 15 miles out of Tonopah.
In  the  area  of  the  Clayton  Valley  prospects  some  14  gradient  holes  have  been  drilled  and 
temperatures  of  247ºF  have  been  measured  at  300  ft  depth.    The  size  of  the  block  as  well  as  the 
geothermal potential indicates a reservoir that may support about 30 MW development at each of the 
five resource prospects for a total Clayton Valley potential of up to 150 MW.
Located  in  the  northeast  corner  of  Clayton  Valley,  Pearl  Hot  Springs  is  one  of  several  geothermal 
prospects within the greater Clayton Valley complex of thermal systems.  Large commercial deposits 
of lithium derived from geothermal systems and currently extracted from Clayton Valley attest to the 
long lived geothermal activity in the valley. Pearl Hot Springs are low flow and are part of a multi-
square  mile  thermal  plume  defined  by  shallow  drilling  within  this  corner  of  the  playa.  The  thermal 
plume includes shallow temperatures of 247ºF in a 300ft gradient hole. Geo-thermometers applied to 
the  Pearl  Hot  Spring  waters  show  loss  of  silica  consistent  with  some  distance  of  transport  from  the 
reservoir at depth with the geo-thermometers indicating 420ºF to 445ºF reservoir temperatures.  
The Weepah prospects are within the Weepah uplands some four miles to the northeast of the Pearl 
Hot Spring lease block.  Gradient drilling has been limited within this lease block but published data 
adjacent to the block document thermal fluids near boiling in drill holes and geo-thermometers predict 
a 302ºF to 445ºF source for the fluids.
The Montezuma lease block is in the southern end of Clayton Valley and is characterized by a zone of 
north-northeast  trending  fault  systems  that  show  associated  hot  spring-related  mineral  deposits. 
There  are  no  identified  modern  hot  springs  that  have  been  reported  but  the  faults  are  geologically 
young and it is likely that a heat source is present at depth. This thermal system has structural control 
similar to that found at Pearl Hot Springs. No significant exploration work has been conducted at this 
location.
The Alkali Hot Springs lease block is centered on the named hot springs which issue at a temperature 
of 140ºF (the highest temperature thermal water found in the area). The springs are associated with a 
zone of hot spring deposits similar in nature to the Montezuma lease block. No exploration has been 
conducted on this leasehold.
The Pearl Hot Springs and Weepah blocks are located in proximity to existing NV Energy transmission 
lines.
The geothermal leases are subject to certain royalties whereby, the Company is required to pay BLM 
different  percentages  of  gross  revenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity,  by  products  derived  from 
geothermal resource production and geothermal resources. Annual lease commitments are disclosed 
under the heading “Contractual obligations and commitments” below.
The Company plans to offer the five Clayton Valley leaseholds as one geothermal complex to support a 
series of one to five power purchase agreements (“PPA”) for a total potential of up to 150 MW for sale. 
ϱ
Commercial operation of the first power plant facility of the complex is planned to commence in 2013. 
Permitting  on  all  the  Clayton  Valley  leaseholds  is  scheduled  to  commence  in  early  2010.  It  is 
estimated that the permitting and subsequent geophysical studies and exploration drilling activities in 
late 2010 and early 2011 will require a cumulative budget of approximately $10 million.
Delcer Butte Project, Nevada, United States of America
The  Company  acquired  the  leases  for  the  10,186  acre  Delcer  Butte  prospect  at  the  2008  BLM 
geothermal  lease  auction.    Subsequently,  the  Company  acquired  an  additional  4,609  acres  from  a 
third  party  through  a  BLM  lease  assignment.  The  site  is  located  50  miles  south  of  Wells,  Nevada. 
Gradient hole drilling covering a portion of the lease show gradients at two of five sites in excess of 
10ºF/100  ft.  The  prospect  requires  additional  gradient  and  deep  well  drilling  to  fully  evaluate  its 
productivity. It is assumed that the resource can support a 30 MW net power plant.
Delcer Buttes is a green field project that was discovered as a potential “blind” geothermal resource as 
a result of reconnaissance shallow drilling conducted in 1984 by a major operator. Five gradient holes 
showed  temperature  increase  above  background  values  with  the  highest  gradient  near  13ºF/100  ft. 
Conceptual  models  discuss  silica  flooding  and  epithermal  mineralization  (consistent  with  geothermal 
activity)  but  these  zones  are  not  indicated  on  exploration  maps.  A  shallow  two  meter  temperature 
survey  conducted  in  2008  confirms  a  heat  flow  anomaly  within  the  leasehold  and  suggests  a 
northeast- southwest structural control model. It is believed that this prospect, based on its size and 
similarity  to  other  Nevada  geothermal  areas,  can  potentially  support  a  30  MW  power  project 
development.
The geothermal leases are subject to certain royalties whereby, the Company is required to pay BLM 
different  percentages  of  gross  revenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity,  by  products  derived  from 
geothermal resource production and geothermal resources. Annual lease commitments are disclosed 
under the heading “Contractual obligations and commitments” below.
The  Company  plans  to  apply  for  exploration  permits  for  Delcer  Buttes  in  2010  and  to  commence 
surface geophysical exploration in 2011. The total estimated amount to be spent on these activities is 
approximately $1 million. Based on the results of the 2011 exploration a decision will be made as to 
whether exploration drilling will be conducted subsequently.
Orita, California, United States of America
During  2009  Ram  acquired  approximately  3,552  acres  of  geothermal  leases on  private  lands  in  the 
Imperial Valley of California for its Orita project.
The  Orita  leasehold  is  located  in  the  East  Brawley  Known  Geothermal  Resource  Area  (“KGRA”). 
Concurrent  with  KGRA  designation  in  1981,  a  total  of  eight  deep  exploration  wells  were drilled  by 
Unocal,  Occidental  and  Phillips  Petroleum  in  the  area.  These  wells  were  completed  at  depths  from 
8,500 ft to 13,500 ft and all encountered high temperature geothermal resources with temperatures 
as high as 575ºF.  Testing of one well confirmed flow rates in excess of 500,000 lbs per hour at a well 
head  pressure  of  560  psig,  demonstrating  six  MW  capacity  from  the  seven  inch  diameter  well 
completion.  In addition, operators drilled shallow gradient and slim-hole wells that confirm the extent 
of  the  thermal  system  and  bore  hole  geophysics  and  mud  logs  are  available  to  quantify  and 
characterize  all  sandstone  units  that  may  be  potential  production  horizons.    Commercial  diameter 
wells  are  expected  to  produce  at  levels  of  12  MW  or  greater  in  this  resource.    The  flow  tests 
demonstrate that a deep high salinity reservoir is present and wells also show evidence of low salinity 
fluids  produced  from  shallower  depths.    The  temperature  profiles  within  the  15  square  mile  area 
tested by the existing deep drilling are similar and all demonstrate temperatures of 400ºF at a depth 
of  7,000  ft.    These  shallower  “stacked”  reservoirs  are  contained  in  sand  units  at  these  depths  and 
show  dissolved  solids  content  in  the  range  of  9,000  to  50,000  ppm  consistent  with  other  pumped 
ϲ
resources found in the Salton Trough. Ram estimates that the reservoir can support three 49.9 MW 
power plants within the current leasehold of about 5.5 square miles.  Additional leasing in the project 
area could increase potential up to 300 MW.
The  leases  are  subject  to  certain  royalties  whereby,  the  Company  is  required  to  pay  the  private 
landowners certain percentage of gross revenue from the sale of electricity, by products derived from 
geothermal resource production and geothermal resources. Annual lease commitments are disclosed 
under the heading “Contractual obligations and commitments” below.
In July 2009 the Company entered into a PPA with Southern California Edison Company (“SCE”) for 40 
to 100 MW for sale from the Orita project with a planned commercial operation date of December 31, 
2012. The Company may at its sole discretion exercise two expansion options, each of the same size. 
Each of the Orita expansion projects is planned to be developed at one year intervals after the first 
project. In conjunction with the PPA the Company applied for 200 MW of transmission capacity from 
the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) for the delivery to SCE. The Company plans to apply for drilling 
permits  on  the  Orita  leasehold  in  second  half  of  2009  with  drilling  expected  to  commence  in  early 
2010.  Total  expenditures  through  the  end  of  2010,  including  permitting,  geophysics,  drilling, 
engineering and legal expenses, are expected to be approximately $40 million. An application for a US 
DOE loan guarantee is to be filed in 2009 to support the project financing in 2010.
New River, California, United States of America
During  2009  Ram  acquired  approximately  475  acres  of  geothermal  leases  on  private  lands  in  the 
Imperial Valley of California for its New River project.
The New River leasehold is located in the South Brawley resource area, adjacent to the Mesquite Lake 
basin which is defined as a local zone of subsidence within the Salton Trough.  Resource delineation 
consists of a range of data including 40 shallow gradient holes and intermediate depth holes drilled up 
to  2,000  ft  and  deep  tests  within  the  Mesquite  Lake  basin  drilled  to  12,910  ft.  A  thermal  anomaly 
defines an area of shallow resource which covers an area of 12 square miles.  The intermediate depth 
temperature profiles within this anomaly measure +200ºF at 2000 ft and predict +400ºF at 6,000 ft.  
As in other locations in the Imperial Valley, the deep hyper-saline resource is overlain by lower salinity 
fluids  contained  in  shallower  sand  units.    Initial  development  at  New  River  will  target  the  400ºF 
resource  beneath  the  shallow  thermal  anomaly  at  depths  near  6,000  ft.    Based  on  the  size  of  the 
shallow  heat  anomaly  a  49.9  MW  development  is  planned  for  this  area  with  additional  leases  to  be 
acquired.
The  leases are  subject  to  certain  royalties  whereby,  the  Company  is  required  to  pay  the  private 
landowners certain percentage of gross revenue from the sale of electricity, by products derived from 
geothermal resource production and geothermal resources. Annual lease commitments are disclosed 
under the heading “Contractual obligations and commitments” below.
The  Company  plans  to  complete  its  leasing  process  for  the  New  River  project  during 2010  and 
subsequently commence permitting and exploration activities on the site. The Company estimates that 
its budget for these activities in 2010 will be approximately $5 million with up to an additional $30 
million planned in 2011 for production well drilling and other development activities.
Geothermal database
The  Company  developed  a  GIS  based  geothermal  database  for  the  Imperial  Valley,  California.  The 
database includes both proprietary and public data for over 950 shallow and intermediate depth wells 
that provide temperature profiles and thermal gradients within the Imperial Valley.  The database is
ϳ
able to produce temperature gradient maps and depth slices for evaluation of geothermal potential of 
properties  throughout  the  region.    In  addition,  well  data  from  exploration  and  production  drilling 
records are incorporated to correlate deep drilling data with shallow temperature interpretations.

The  Company  applied  for  a  US  and  European  patent  for  its  STIC  technology.    The  STIC  technology 
combines  advantageous  attributes  of  both  the  steam  cycle  and  the  organic  Rankine  cycle  that 
improves  plant  economics  by  using  heat  supplied  at  different  temperature  levels and eliminates the 
need for large quantities of cooling water. The patent will provide the Company with exclusive access 
to the STIC technology. The Company estimates that the patent will be issued to the Company in late 
2010. The Company estimates that it will have to spend an additional $20,000, mainly in legal fees, to 
process the patent application.
c. Electricity contracts
The Company submitted a proposal to SCE for supply of 49.9 MW flash technology geothermal power 
from the Orita project area in the Imperial Valley of California. Subsequently, on July 31, 2009 Ram 
entered into a PPA with SCE for supply of 49.9 MW, which Ram may at its option expand to up to 300 
MW.
The  Company  submitted  several  other  proposals  to  supply  power  from  its  projects  in  Nevada  and 
California  to  a  number  of  public  utilities.  Some  of  these  proposals  were  shortlisted  by  the  public 
utilities for further discussions. The Company expects that these discussions may result in one or more 
PPAs for the Company in 2010.
3. Results of operations
The Company’s financial data is presented based on Canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”).
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  Company’s  financial  results  of  its  operations  should  be 
read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the period ended December 
31, 2008 and related notes for the same period.
Upon successful completion of the business combination and equity funding as discussed in Section 9 
below, the Company believes it will have funds to finance its operating, development and exploration 
expenditures over the year. Longer term, the Company may pursue opportunities to raise additional 
capital  through  equity  and/or  debt  markets  as  it  progresses  towards  and  reaches  commercial 
production. Management is of the opinion that additional financing is available and may be sourced in
ϴ
time  to  allow  the  Company  to  continue  its  planned  activities  in  the  normal  course.  There  can, 
however, be no assurance it will be able to raise funds in the future.
a. Revenues for the period January 4, 2008 to December 31, 2008
The Company is in the exploration stage on all of its properties and has not yet started generating 
power. Revenues of $131,029 during the period arose from consulting services provided.
The net loss for the period ended December 31, 2008 was $1,253,270.  This loss is attributed to the 
Company’s  overall  expenses  including  salaries  and  benefits,  professional  fees  and  general  and 
administrative  costs.  Current  period  net  loss  also  includes  $50,354  of  interest  income  from  surplus 
funds  on  hand  invested  in  certificates  of  deposits  and  money  market  deposits  and  amortization  of 
$18,794 on equipment.
The net loss per share for 2008 was $0.24.
b. Expenses
For  the  period  ended  December  31,  2008,  expenses  totalled  $1,420,538  and  are  summarized  as 
follows:
Expenses
Salaries and benefits
Professional fees
General and administrative        
Amortization
$
$748,070 
471,033

Salaries and benefits were paid to employees at both the U.S. office and the Israel office. Professional 
fees included mostly legal services of $284,315. General and administrative expenses included office 
rent of $49,291 and travel expenses of $62,871.
Management spent a significant amount of its time during this first fiscal period setting up the legal 
structure  of the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries,  securing  the  services  of  a  management  team  and 
directors  that  have  extensive  proven  project  development  experience  in  the  renewable  energy 
industry, and setting up office space and required equipment for a good working environment.
4. Liquidity and capital resources
As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $5,907,055 in cash and cash equivalents, current assets 
of $5,937,845, total current liabilities of $186,245 and a working capital of $5,751,600. The current 
liabilities consist of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Negative  cash  flows  of  $1,073,397  were  recorded  from  operating  activities  in  the  period  ended 
December 31, 2008. The additional use of cash was mainly attributable to the loss for the period offset 
by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the period from January 4, 2008 (date of incorporation) to 
December  31,  2008  was  $12,601,027.  Financing  activities  during  the  Company’s  first  fiscal  period 
included the following:
(a)
On January 25, 2008, the Company issued 5,000,000 Common shares at a price of 
$0.0001 per share to the founder of the Company, Hezy Ram for proceeds of $500.
ϵ

$7,666,667. Share issue costs totalled $40,268.
Net cash of $5,619,675 was used for investing activity during the period from January 4, 2008 (date 
of incorporation) to December 31, 2008. The change in capital expenditures included increases in the 
costs  of  equipment  of  $108,826,  the  acquisition  of  geothermal  properties  of  $5,256,222,  and 
reclamation  deposits  and  bonds  of  $254,627.  Reclamation  deposits  and  bonds  are  maintained  to 
satisfy  the  Company’s  obligation  for  future  reclamation  expenditures  at  its  various  exploration 
properties. In the event that the Company does not pay its obligations with respect to any reclamation 
expenditures, the bonds will be released to the security holders.
5. Capital structure and disclosure of outstanding share data
Ram is authorized to issue 25,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Ram is 
also authorized to issue 10,416,666 of preferred shares, with a par value of $0.0001 per share.

a) The Company has entered into operating leases for office premises and is responsible for minimum
annual lease payments expiring in 2011.
b) In  order  to  ensure  the  Company’s  geothermal  property  leases  are  in  good  standing  certain 
exploration  and  development  leases,  licenses  and  permits  must  be  maintained  and  paid  for 
annually. These obligations may be varied from time to time, subject to approval, and are expected 
to be fulfilled in the normal course of operations of the Company. The lease commitments above 
are minimum annual lease payments based on those properties in which the Company presently 
has an interest and may increase if new applications are granted in the future.
7. Off-balance sheet arrangement
As  of  the  date  of  this  MD&A,  the  Company  does  not  have  any  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  that 
have,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  have,  a  current  or  future  effect  on  the  results  of  operations  or 
financial condition of the Company including, without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and 
capital resources that have not previously been discussed.
8. Related party transaction
The following transaction was made in the normal course of business and has been recorded at the 
exchange amount, being the amount agreed upon by the related parties.
On  September  1,  2008,  the  Company  executed  a  consulting  agreement  with  Engeocon  LLC,  a 
company owned by a relative of Stuart D. Johnson, an officer and shareholder of the Company, for the 
total  amount  of  $100,000  to  develop  a  geothermal  database  for  Ram,  as  detailed  above.  For  the 
period ended December 31, 2008, the amount paid or accrued under this agreement was $75,000. As

transaction.
9. Proposed transactions
a) Proposed sale
On June 30, 2009, the Company entered into a letter of intent with GTO Resources Inc. (“GTO”) 
whereby  GTO  agreed  to  acquire  all  the  issued  and  outstanding  securities  of  Ram  (the  “Proposed 
Sale”) from each of the security holders, such that Ram will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
GTO upon completion of the Proposed Sale.
One of the conditions to closing the Proposed Sale was that an equity financing be completed. The 
equity  financing  is  discussed  in  further  detail  under  Section  9(f)  “Equity  Financing”  below.  The 
proceeds of the equity financing will be utilized to develop key projects.
Completion of the Proposed Sale is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including, 
but not limited to, acceptance by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Other necessary conditions to the 
closing of the Proposed Sale, include obtaining all other necessary director, shareholder, regulatory 
and third-party approvals and authorizations, the completion of a definitive agreement setting forth 
the terms and conditions set out in the Letter of Intent and the completion of due diligence. There 
can be no assurance that the Proposed Sale will be completed as proposed or at all.
ϭϭ
On September 8, 2009 GTO and Ram entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which 
GTO agreed to acquire 99.9%  of the issued and outstanding securities of Ram.
b) Proposed business combination
On July 15, 2009 GTO, Polaris Geothermal Inc. (“Polaris”), Western GeoPower Corp. (“Western”) 
and  Ram  announced  that  they  had  entered  into  a  letter  of  intent  (the  “LOI”)  with  respect  to  a 
proposed business combination to create a new, publicly-traded geothermal power company  (the 
“Business Combination”) and together raise C$100 million in equity financing.
Shareholders of Polaris, which has geothermal projects in Latin America, are planned to own the 
majority  share  of  the  new  company,  with  approximately  a  35.7%  stake.  Western,  active  in 
California and Canada, is planned to own approximately 13.3%, with Ram owning approximately 
7.0% and GTO owning approximately 0.6%.
Completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions and approvals which 
include completion of the equity financing on acceptable terms; the satisfactory completion of due 
diligence  investigations;  the  completion  of  a  definitive  agreement  setting  forth  the  terms  and 
conditions set out in the LOI; approval of securityholders of GTO, Polaris and Western at a special 
meeting  of  such  securityholders;  approval  of  shareholders  of  Ram;  approval  of  holders  of 
debentures of Polaris; approval of certain lenders of Western; court approval; and the approval of 
all relevant regulatory authorities and third parties.  There can be no assurance that the Business 
Combination or the equity financing will be completed as proposed or at all. The LOI provides for 
termination  rights,  including  in  the  event  the  Business  Combination  is  not  completed  by  October 
30, 2009.
On September 8, 2009, GTO, Polaris, Western and Ram entered into an arrangement agreement, 
whereby GTO agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Polaris and Western 
by way of a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
c) Acquisition of BLM leases
On  July  14,  2009,  the  Company  acquired  through  the  BLM  auction  process,  32,672  acres  of 
geothermal leases in Nevada and California for a total amount of $265,590.
d) Signing of a power purchase agreement
On  July  31,  2009,  the  Company  executed  an  agreement  with  SCE  for  the  supply  of  up  to  300 
megawatts  of  geothermal  power  from  its  Orita  geothermal  project.  Under  the  agreement,  the 
Company has to post a development security in favor of SCE in the amount of approximately US $1 
million, 50% of which was due and paid by August 30, 2009 and the remaining 50% is due upon 
an approval of the agreement by California Public Utilities Commission.
e) Acquisition of geothermal property
On August 3, 2009, Ram entered into two geothermal and one surface use lease agreements with 
private landowners for a total of 3,352 acres for its Orita geothermal project.
f) Equity Financing
On August 6, 2009 GTO announced that it will increase the size of its proposed equity financing 
(the  “Financing”)  of  subscription  receipts  (“Subscription  Receipts”)  to  C$156  million  from  C$100 
million. An aggregate of 52 million Subscription Receipts will be offered at an anticipated price of 
ϭϮ
C$3 per Subscription Receipt, each exercisable into one common share of GTO (after giving effect 
to a 10 for 1 consolidation). In addition, GTO agreed to grant its agents an over-allotment option, 
exercisable in whole or in part prior to the closing of the Private Placement, to offer for sale up to 
an additional 7.8 million subscription receipts for additional proceeds of C$23.4 million.
Subsequently,  on  August  20,  2009,  GTO  announced  that  it  successfully  completed  the  Financing 
with  a  syndicate  of  agents  led  by  Cormark  Securities  Inc.  and  including  Raymond  James  Ltd., 
Ambrian  Partners  Limited,  Canaccord  Capital  Corporation,  Dundee  Securities  Corporation  and 
Wellington  West  Capital  Markets  (collectively,  the  “Agents”).  Pursuant  to  the  Financing,  an 
aggregate  of  59.8  million  Subscription  Receipts  were  issued  (including  7.8  million  Subscription 
Receipts  issued  pursuant  to  the  exercise  in  full  by  the  Agents  of  an  over-allotment  option)  at  a 
price  of  C$3per  Subscription  Receipt  for  aggregate  gross  proceeds  of  C$179.4  million.  The 
Subscription  Receipts  issued  pursuant  to  the  Financing  are  subject  to  a  hold  period  under 
applicable securities laws expiring on December 21, 2009.
The  proceeds  of  the  Financing,  less  the  Agents’  expenses,  will  be  held  in  escrow  pending  the 
completion  of  the  Business  Combination,  as  disclosed  in  9(b)  above.  Each  Subscription  Receipt 
purchased under the Financing will entitle the holder to receive, for no additional consideration, one 
common share in the combined entity following completion of the Business Combination.
The  proceeds  of  the  Financing  will  be  used  to  develop  key  projects  of  the  combined  businesses 
upon  completion  of  the  Business  Combination,  debt  repayment  of  the  combined  entity  and  for 
working capital and general corporate purposes
10. Risks and uncertainties
Ram  Power,  Inc.  is  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  due  to,  among  other  things,  the  nature  of  the 
business. The following factors should be considered:
Lack of cash flow and additional capital requirements
Ram  currently  has  a  negative  operating  cash  flow  and  may  continue  to  do  so  for  the  foreseeable 
future. Ram’s failure to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows could have a material 
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
In  order  to  proceed  with  the  development  of  the  geothermal  properties,  additional  funds  will  be 
required.  Failure  to  obtain  sufficient  financing  may  result  in  the  development  of  the  properties  not 
being accomplished. There can be no assurance that the additional capital or other types of financing 
will  be  available  when  needed  or  that,  if  available,  the  terms  of  such  financing  will  be  on  terms 
favourable to Ram. The principal source of future funds presently available to Ram is through the sale 
of equity and provision of bank debt.
In  the  event  that  the  financing  is not  available  the  Company  would  have  to  look  to  strategic 
alternatives which may include joint venturing its project with other companies, the sale of assets or 
the postponement of the project.
Seasonal considerations
The  geothermal  resource  as  a  fuel  supply  does  not  have  seasonal  variations  and  the  type  of 
geothermal  projects  which  Ram  expects  to  construct  will  not  be  dependent  on  weather  conditions. 
However,  the  various  power  plant  technologies  perform  with  somewhat  higher  efficiency  when  the 
ambient temperatures are lower. This is particularly the case for the binary power plant technology 
which  may  be  utilized  for  geothermal  resources  below  350ºF,  as  typically  found  in  Nevada.  For  the 
higher temperature resources, such as at the Orita and New River project areas, which may utilize the
ϭϯ
flash based steam turbine technology, this seasonal effect may be nominal. The major seasonal issue 
is  the  fact  that  the  California  investor  owned  utilities  generally  have  a  “time  of  use”  payment 
arrangement  whereby  electricity  supplied  by  a  geothermal  project  during  summer  on- peak  periods 
(during the hottest portion of the day) is paid for at a rate that may be two or three times the price 
per kilowatt hour that is paid for electricity supply during winter off- peak periods (night time). Though 
this  seasonality  is  accounted  for  in  scheduling  maintenance,  the  effect  of  unscheduled  repairs  or 
equipment  failure  during  peak  seasonal  payment  periods  may  have  a  severe  impact  on  operating 
revenues if corrective action is not taken promptly.
Reliance on senior management team and outside contractors
The success of the operations and activities of Ram is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts 
and  abilities  of  its  management  and  outside  contractors.  Investors  must  be  willing  to  rely  to  a 
significant extent on management's discretion and judgment, as well as the expertise and competence 
of outside contractors. The loss of one or more of these key employees or contractors, if not replaced, 
could adversely affect Ram's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Resource risks
The ability to extract sufficient geothermal fluid of usable quality from the resource, in a cost-effective 
manner, is typically the greatest uncertainty in a geothermal power development. This encompasses a 
number  of  risks  including:  (i)  whether  the  stored  heat  capacity  of  the  resource  is  sufficient  for  the 
proposed power output, (ii) whether the well targeting, design and drilling and prevailing geological 
conditions  permit  ready  extraction  of  the  fluid  and  (iii)  whether  the  production  fluid  composition 
facilitates convenient and economical handling and utilization. 
The Company has performed geological studies on the geological properties acquired to help reduce 
this risk from that which is normal for projects of this type; however, there are risks as to whether the 
geothermal reserves are economically recoverable.
Limited operating history
Ram has a very limited history of operations. It is subject to many of the risks common to start up 
enterprises,  including  under-capitalization,  cash  shortages,  limitations  with  respect  to  personnel, 
financial, and other resources and lack of revenues. There is no assurance that Ram will be successful 
in achieving a return on shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in 
light of Ram’s early stage of operations.
From  its  inception  Ram  has  incurred  net  losses.  As  a  result  of  its  planned  exploration  and  plant 
expansion projects, over the near term management expects to continue to incur net losses until Ram 
is  able  to  generate  significant  revenues.  Ram’s  ability  to  generate  significant  revenues  and  become 
profitable will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
successfully complete its planned exploration and expansion programs;
acquire  interests  in  producing  geothermal  power  companies  or  producing  geothermal  power 
plants that contribute to profitability;
acquire additional prospective exploration and development properties;
advance planned and future exploration programs on exploration properties;
verify  geothermal  resources  on  exploration  properties  that  that  are  sufficient  to  generate  a 
favourable economic return from electricity sales;
acquire  electrical  transmission  and  interconnection  rights  for  our  geothermal  power  plant 
development projects;
enter  into  power  purchase  agreements  for  the  sale  of  electricity  from  its  geothermal  power 
plant development projects at prices that support its operating and financing costs;
finance  and  complete  the  development  and  construction  of  geothermal  power  plants  on  its 
properties;
operate producing geothermal power plants on a profitable basis;
ϭϰ
•
•
secure  adequate  capital  to  support  our  expansion,  exploration  and  development  programs; 
and
attract and retain qualified personnel.
State and federal legislative or regulatory developments
Ram’s  activities  are  subject  to  various  laws  governing  development,  production,  taxes,  labour 
standards and occupational health, safety, toxic substances, resource exploitation and other matters. 
No assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules 
and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. 
Amendments  to  current  laws  and  regulations  governing  Ram’s  operations  and  activities  or  more 
stringent implementation thereof could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company.
Environmental matters
Geothermal operations can produce significant quantities of brine and scale, which builds up on metal 
surfaces in any equipment with which the brine comes into contact. These waste materials, some of 
which  are  currently  reinjected  into  the  subsurface,  can  contain  materials  (such  as  arsenic,  lead  and 
naturally  occurring  radioactive  materials)  in  concentrations  that  exceed  regulatory  limits  used  to 
define hazardous waste. Various substances are used, including isopentane, and industrial lubricants, 
that could become potential contaminants and are generally flammable. Hazardous materials are also 
used and generated in connection with equipment manufacturing operations. As a result, all projects 
are  subject  to  numerous  domestic  and  foreign  federal,  state  and  local  statutory  and  regulatory 
standards relating to the use, storage, fugitive emissions and disposal of hazardous substances. The 
cost  of  any  investigation,  remediation  and/or  cleanup  activities  in  connection  with  a  spill  or  other 
release  of  such  contaminants  could  be  significant.  Any  disposal  or  release  of  these  materials  onto 
project  sites,  other  than  by  means  of  permitted  injection  wells,  could  lead  to  contamination  of  the 
environment  and  result  in  material  cleanup  requirements  or  other  responsive  obligations  under 
applicable environmental laws. As of the date hereof the environmental permits and approvals
necessary for the development of Ram’s current projects have not been applied for.
Economic conditions
Once production starts, Ram’s business will be dependent on the sale of electricity and by products 
derived from geothermal resource production and geothermal resources and its operating results will 
be  sensitive  to  prevailing  economic  conditions,  including  changes  in  local,  regional  and  national 
economic  conditions,  particularly  as  they  may  affect  demand  for  energy.  Ram’s  operating  results  in 
individual markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns, which could 
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of the Company.
Competitive conditions
The competition for Ram within the green power industry is currently characterized by often intense 
competition from other renewable power developers, as well as from the electric utilities that purchase 
green power but wish to own renewable generation facilities. However some 34 states have instituted 
mandates  known  as    Renewable  Portfolio  Standards,  (“RPS”)  which  require  load  serving  utilities  to 
include  an  ever  growing  percentage  of  renewable  energy  in  their  electric  supply.  Among  the  most 
ambitious is Nevada’s 20% by 2015 and California’s 33% by 2030. These state (and planned federal) 
mandates have created a demand for renewable projects, which need to be successfully executed by 
experienced teams with adequate capital. The net effect is that favourable market conditions currently 
exist  for  the  green  power  industry  and  the  number  of  new  renewable  energy  companies  (especially 
wind developers) who have become entrants into the competitive bidding process, (which utilities are 
increasingly  using  to  acquire  renewable  energy),  may  create  pressure  to  lower  renewable  energy 
prices.  However  the  upside  is  that  geothermal  as  a  reliable  base  load  technology,  which  makes 
efficient use of transmission capacity, also competes well with other renewable technologies on price. 
Therefore, for the near term, despite the lower natural gas prices, the RPS mandates are expected
ϭϱ
to  continue  to  spur  the  market  for  geothermal  power  and  the  load  serving  utilities  are  expected  to 
continue  to  execute  long  term  power  purchase  agreements  for  geothermal  electricity  at  price  levels 
which support attractive levels of profitability for Ram.
11. Critical accounting policies and estimates
The  Company’s  significant  accounting  policies  are  presented  in  Note  2  of  the  audited  consolidated 
financial  statements  for  the  period from  date  of  incorporation,  January  4,  2008,  to  December  31, 
2008.  The  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP  requires 
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities  and  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements, 
and  the  reported  amounts  of  income  and  expenses  during  the  reported  period.  These  estimates 
include:
•
•
•
•
the carrying values of geothermal property costs;
the carrying values of equipment;
the rates of amortization of equipment; and
the valuation allowances and estimates for future income tax obligations.
Management  believes  the  estimates  used  are  reasonable;  however,  actual  results  could  differ 
materially from those estimates and, if so, would impact future results of operations and cash flows. 
Factors that could potentially affect these estimates include risks inherent in geothermal exploration 
and development, prices and markets for electricity and changes in government policy.  The Company 
is  engaged  in  an  industry  that  is  dependent  on  a  number  of  factors  that  may  be  beyond  the 
Company’s control including environmental and legal risks, the existence of economically recoverable 
resources  and  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  obtain  necessary  financing  to  construct  plant  and 
transmission facilities. Management has assessed the carrying value of its assets and does not believe 
that the assets have suffered any impairment. The Company is in the development stage and defers 
all  expenditures  related  to  its  geothermal  properties  until  such  time  as  the  properties  are  put  into 
production,  sold,  or  abandoned.  Management  will  assess  the  exploration  results  on  its  geothermal 
projects  and  determine  whether  these  results  warrant  further  exploration.  If  results  do  not  indicate 
potential  for  an  economic  geothermal  property,  the  deferred  exploration  costs  will  be  written  off. 
Under this method, all amounts shown as geothermal properties represent costs incurred to date less 
amounts,  if  any,  amortized  and/or  written  off  and  do  not  necessarily  represent  present  or  future 
values.
12. Changes in accounting policies
Goodwill and intangible assets
In February 2008, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (the “CICA”) issued Section 3064, 
Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets  which  provides  guidance  on  the  recognition,  measurement, 
presentation  and  disclosure  for  goodwill  and  intangible  assets,  other  than  the  initial  recognition  of 
goodwill  or  intangible  assets  acquired  in  a  business  combination.  The  standard  is  effective  for  fiscal 
years  beginning  on  or  after  October  1,  2008,  and  requires  retroactive  application  to  prior  period 
financial  statements.  The  Company  is  evaluating  the  impact  of  this  new  standard  for  adoption  on 
January 1, 2009 and does not expect any significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations/Consolidated Financial Statements/Non-Controlling Interests
In  January  2009,  the  CICA  adopted  Sections  1582,  “Business  Combinations”,  1601,  “Consolidated 
Financial Statements”, and 1602, “Non-Controlling Interests” which superseded current sections 1581, 
“Business  Combinations”  and  1600,  “Consolidated  Financial  Statements”.  Section  1582  applies  to 
business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2011, however, earlier adoption 
ϭϲ
is  permitted. Sections 1601 and 1602  apply  to  interim  and  annual  consolidated  financial  statements 
with fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning 
of  a  fiscal  year. If an entity applies these sections before January 1, 2011, it is required to disclose 
that  fact  and  apply  each  of  the  new  sections  concurrently.  These  new  sections  were  created  to 
converge Canadian GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
In  January  2009,  the  CICA  issued  EIC-173,  Credit  Risk  and  the  Fair  Value  of  Financial  Assets  and 
Financial Liabilities which requires an entity to account for its credit risk and counterparty credit risk in 
the measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.
13. Financial instruments
Under  GAAP,  all  financial  instruments  must  be  classified  into  a  defined  category,  namely,  held-to-
maturity,  available  for  sale,  loans  and  receivables,  held-for-trading  financial  assets  or  financial 
liabilities and other financial liabilities.
The  carrying  values  of  the  Company’s  financial  instruments  as  at  December  31,  2008  are  classified 
into the following categories:
Category
Held for trading assets (liabilities) (a)
Loans and receivables (b)
Other financial liabilities (c)
$
5,907,055
254,627 
190,969
(a) Cash and cash equivalents measured at fair value.
(b) Reclamation deposits and bonds measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
(c) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long term liabilities measured at amortized cost.
Fair value
Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant 
information  about  financial  markets  and  specific  financial  instruments.  As  these  estimates  are 
subjective  in  nature,  involving  uncertainties  and  matters  of  significant  judgement,  they  cannot  be 
determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair values.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate 
their carrying values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Company’s interest bearing  financial  assets  comprise  short  term  investments,  where  the  money 
market deposits bear interest at a variable rate. As a result of the relatively low interest rates earned 
on the variable interest money market deposits, management has determined the overall interest rate 
risk is low, and the estimated effect of a 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a 
material  effect  on  the  Company’s  results  of  operations.  Further,  the  Company  has  also  determined 
that a 100 basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value 
of the short term investment when compared to its carrying value.
ϭϳ
Currency risk
The  Company’s  functional  and  reporting  currency  is  the  United  States  dollar.  The  Company  incurs 
foreign  currency  risk  on  purchases  that  are  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional 
currency of the Company, which will have an impact on the profitability of the Company and may also 
affect the value of the Company’s assets and the amount of shareholders’ equity. The Company’s main 
risks are associated with fluctuations in the US dollar (“USD”). The Company does not enter into any 
foreign  exchange  contracts.  As  at  December  31,  2008,  the  Company  had  no  significant  financial 
instrument stated in a foreign currency.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of 
cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable  and  reclamation  deposits  and  bonds.  The  Company 
has  deposited  the  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short  term  investments  with  reputable  financial 
institutions,  from  which  management  believes  the  risk  of  loss  to  be  remote. Management  considers 
the credit risk associated with reclamation deposits and bonds to be low as these deposits are held in 
Certificates  of  Deposit  with  reputable  financial  institutions.  The  carrying  value  of  these  instruments 
represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity Risk
The Company actively manages its liquidity through cash and equity management strategies.  Such 
strategies include continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows from operating, financing 
and  investing  activities,  available  credit  under  existing  banking  arrangements  and  opportunities  to 
issue additional Company shares.
14. Outlook
The  Company  will  continue  its  effort  towards  building  a  geothermal  portfolio  and  proceed  with  the 
development  and  operation  of  these  geothermal  properties,  as  well  as  consider  future  project 
acquisitions to create sustainable growth to Ram’s asset base.

The following information is presented on a post-Arrangement, post-Ram Acquisition and post-Financing basis and 
is reflective of the projected business, financial and share capital position of New GTO after giving effect to the 
Arrangement, the Ram Acquisition and the Financing.
Name and Incorporation
CORPORATE STRUCTURE
On completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, New GTO will continue to be a corporation governed 
by the BCBCA and will carry on business under the name “Ram Power, Corp.”.
It is expected that the principal executive office of New GTO will be located at 691 Sierra Rose Drive, Suite B, 
Reno, Nevada  86511. The registered office of New GTO will continue to be the current registered office of GTO, 
located at 1200 Waterfront Centre, 200 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia  V6C 3L6.
Intercorporate Relationships
The following chart illustrates New GTO’s corporate structure, assuming completion of the Arrangement and the 
Ram Acquisition.
O-2
General
BUSINESS OF NEW GTO
Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition,  New  GTO  will  be  engaged  in  the  business  of 
acquiring, exploring, developing and operating geothermal properties and projects through its subsidiaries, Polaris, 
Western  and  Ram.  New  GTO,  through  its  subsidiaries,  will  have  an  interest  in  geothermal  projects  in  British 
Columbia (through its holdings in Western), California (through its holdings in Ram and Western), Nevada (through 
its holdings in Ram) and Nicaragua (through its holdings in Polaris).
Polaris currently owns and operates, through its subsidiary Polaris Energy Nicaragua S.A., the San Jacinto-Tizate 
geothermal power project (the “San Jacinto Project”) located near the City of Leon, Nicaragua. Polaris also holds 
interests in another geothermal concession known as the CSC concession which is located to the northwest of the 
San Jacinto Project (the “CSC Project”).  For a more detailed description of the business and operations of Polaris, 
please see “Appendix L – Information Concerning Polaris” and the documents incorporated by reference therein.
Western is developing the Western GeoPower Unit 1 geothermal power plant at the Geysers Geothermal Field in 
Sonoma County, California (the “Geysers Project”) and has additional geothermal projects under development in 
California and British Columbia. For a more detailed description of the business and operations of Western, please 
see “Appendix M – Information Concerning Western” and the documents incorporated by reference therein.
Ram has several geothermal projects under development in California and Nevada.  For a more detailed description 
of the business and operations of Ram, please see “Appendix N – Information Concerning Ram”.
Business Strategy and Objectives
The  business  strategy  of  New  GTO  is  to  increase  shareholder  value  by  acquiring,  exploring,  developing  and 
operating geothermal projects in the United States, Canada and internationally to enable it to profit from the growing 
demand  for  green  energy  around  the  world  and  to  become  a  leading  global  renewable  power  project  developer, 
owner and operator.
By  combining  smaller,  often  one  project  companies  that  have  more  limited  management  with  geothermal 
development and operation experience, a platform will be created to support growth and attract investment capital 
and  project  financing.  It  is  anticipated  that  New  GTO  will  be  able  to  successfully  execute  the  development  and 
operation of the identified portfolio of projects as well as execute future project acquisitions to create sustainable 
growth to New GTO’s asset base.
In order to achieve its objectives, New GTO has identified the following short term, medium term and long-term 
goals:
Short-Term Goals
(cid:120) Raise Necessary Capital for Construction-Ready Projects: New GTO intends to use a portion of the 
proceeds of the Financing, together with third-party project financing, to complete the construction, final 
permitting and testing of the San Jacinto Project Phase 1 – Unit 3 (24 MW) and the Geysers Project (35 
MW). It is anticipated that this would add an additional 59 MW to New GTO’s operating capacity, for a 
total  operating  capacity  of  69MW,  and  would  provide  significant  cash  flow  for  re-investment  in  other 
geothermal projects. See “Use of Proceeds”.
(cid:120) Advance  Contracted  and  Development-Stage  Projects:  New  GTO  intends  to  apply  a  portion  of  the 
proceeds  of  the  Financing  to  the  advancement  of  its  development  portfolio,  particularly  the  Orita,  San 
Jacinto  Phase  2  and  CSC  projects,  and  including  permitting,  exploration,  resource  delineation  and 
production well drilling to confirm project feasibilities. See “Use of Proceeds”.
O-3
(cid:120)
Secure Additional Long Term PPAs: New GTO intends to secure additional PPAs with utility off takers 
for 50 MW to 100 MW of capacity within the next 12 months.
Medium-Term and Long-Term Goals
(cid:120) Advance Contracted Properties to the Project Finance Stage: New GTO is targeting the advancement 
of 150 MW to 300 MW of contracted capacity to the project-finance stage. This is expected to include well 
field  development,  attaining  necessary  permitting  and 
to  establish  utility 
interconnections.  Activities would be funded by a portion of the proceeds of the Financing and cash flow 
from operating projects.
investments
initial
(cid:120)
Pursue Project Financing for Contracted Development Properties: New GTO intends to pursue project 
financing to leverage its equity investments by applying its experience in utilizing all incentives available 
for U.S. projects, such as PTC, DOE loan guarantees and ITC grants.  Such funding would support the 
construction of applicable projects through to commercial operations and through operational periods.
(cid:120) Grow  Operating  and  Development  Portfolio:  New  GTO  intends  to  continue  its  growth  strategy  of 
building  and  owning  geothermal  power  facilities  by  acquiring  additional  properties,  projects  and/or 
companies and partnering with geothermal development partners when desirable.

USE OF PROCEEDS OF FINANCING
On  August  20,  2009,  GTO  completed  the  Financing  pursuant  to  which  an  aggregate  of  59,800,000  Subscription 
Receipts were issued at a price of $3.00 per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of $179,400,000. The 
Escrowed Proceeds are being held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Subscription Receipt Agreement. 
The Escrowed Proceeds, less the Agents’ Fee, will be released to GTO, or as otherwise directed by GTO, together 
with interest thereon, if, on or before 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Release Deadline, the Release Certificate is 
delivered to the Subscription Receipt Agent stating that the Release Event has occurred. In the event the Release 
Event does not occur prior to the Release Deadline, the Subscription Receiptholder’s Funds, plus a pro rata share of 
any Earnings, less applicable withholding taxes if any, shall be returned to the Subscription Receiptholders and the 
Subscription Receipts shall be deemed cancelled.
The net proceeds to New GTO are estimated to be $168,015,500, after deducting the Agents’ Fee of $10,764,000 
and the estimated expenses of the Financing of $620,500. The net proceeds of the Financing are intended to be used 
to develop key projects of New GTO upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, the repayment 
of long term debt of New GTO and for general working capital purposes, as set forth in the table below.

New GTO intends to use approximately $25,000,000, together with third-party project financing, to complete the 
construction,  final  permitting  and  testing  of  Phase  1  of  the  San  Jacinto  Project  and  the  Geysers  Project. 
Approximately $80,000,000 is expected to be used by New GTO to advance the development of the Orita 1 and 2 
projects  such  that  these  projects  will  qualify  for  project  financing.  Activities  are  expected  to  primarily  involve 
permitting,  exploration,  resource  development  and  the  drilling  of  production  and  injection  wells.  Approximately, 
$35,000,000 is intended to be used by New GTO to explore Phase 2 of the San Jacinto Project and the CSC Project 
and activities are expected to include permitting, exploration and resource delineation. New GTO intends to apply 
$23,350,000 to repay the Western Loans in accordance with the terms of such loans. For a more detailed description 
of the Western Loans, see the Information Circular under the heading “Interests of Persons or Companies in the 
Arrangement – Western – Loan Arrangements”. Approximately $4,800,000 will be used by New GTO for working 
capital and general corporate purposes.
The use of the net proceeds of the Financing is consistent with New GTO’s stated business objectives and strategic 
goals in respect of the acquisition, exploration, development and operation of geothermal projects. Although New 
GTO intends to expend the net proceeds from the Financing as described above, the actual allocation of net proceeds 
may vary from that set out above, depending, in part, on future operations of New GTO’s projects and the results 
thereof and unforeseen events.
DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL OF NEW GTO
The authorized capital of New GTO will be the same as the current capital structure of GTO. In connection with the 
Arrangement, the Consolidation will be effected and the GTO Pre-Consolidation Shares will be consolidated into 
GTO  Shares  on  the  basis  of  one  (1)  GTO  Share  for  every  ten  (10)  GTO  Pre-Consolidation  Shares  issued  and 
outstanding. Upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, the authorized capital of New GTO 
will consist of an unlimited number of GTO Shares which will have identical terms as the GTO Pre-Consolidation 
Shares.  After giving effect to the Arrangement, the Ram Acquisition and the Financing, it is anticipated that there 
will be 138,992,793 GTO Shares issued and outstanding. See “Fully Diluted Share Capital of New GTO”.
DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS
Since  incorporation, none of  GTO,  Polaris, Western  or  Ram  have  paid dividends on  the GTO  Pre-Consolidation 
Shares, Polaris Shares, Western Shares or Ram Shares, respectively. The payment of dividends by New GTO in the 
future will be dependent on New GTO’s earnings, financial condition and such other factors as the board of directors
O-6
of New GTO (the “New GTO Board”) considers appropriate. New GTO currently does not anticipate paying any 
dividends in the foreseeable future.
ESCROWED SECURITIES AND SECURITIES SUBJECT TO
CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
Following completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition, none of the securities of New GTO will be held 
in escrow or subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, other than as disclosed in the table below.

Assumes 138,992,793 GTO Shares issued and outstanding upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition. 
The information as to GTO Shares to be beneficially owned, or over which control or direction is exercised, directly or indirectly, is 
based upon information furnished by the respective proposed directors and executive officers. 
Proposed member of the Audit Committee. 
Includes 180,000 GTO Shares issued on the automatic exercise of Subscription Receipts pursuant to the Arrangement. 
Includes 10,000 GTO Shares issued on the automatic exercise of Subscription Receipts pursuant to the Arrangement. 
The registered holder will be Tarma Investments Inc., a Bahamian corporation of which Mr. Ogryzlo is one of the beneficial owners.
Includes 8,000 GTO Shares issued on the automatic exercise of Subscription Receipts pursuant to the Arrangement.
The term of office of the directors will expire on the date of the first annual meeting of the shareholders of New 
GTO or until their successor is duly elected, unless their office is earlier vacated in accordance with the Articles of 
New GTO or pursuant to the provisions of the BCBCA.
Following  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition,  it  is  expected  that  the  directors  and 
executive officers of New GTO, as a group, will beneficially own, or exercise control or direction over, directly or 
indirectly,  an  aggregate  of  6,837,736  GTO  Shares,  representing  4.9%  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  New  GTO 
Shares, calculated on a basic, undiluted basis.
Corporate Cease Trade Orders
Other than as disclosed in this Information Circular, no proposed director or executive officer of New GTO is, as at 
the date of this Information Circular, or was within 10 years before the date of this Information Circular, a director, 
chief executive officer or chief financial officer of any company, that was:
(i)
subject  to  a  cease  trade  or  similar  order  or  an  order  that  denied  the  relevant  company  access  to  any 
exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that 
was issued while the director or executive officer was acting in the capacity as director, chief executive 
officer or chief financial officer; or
O-9
(ii)
was subject to a cease trade or similar order or an order that denied the relevant company access to any 
exemption under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that 
was issued after the director or executive officer ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief 
financial  officer  and  which  resulted  from  an  event  that  occurred  while  that  person  was  acting  in  the 
capacity as director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer.
A. Murray Sinclair was a director of Katanga Mining Limited (formerly Balloch Resources Ltd. and New Inca Gold 
Ltd.) from May 1, 1998 to July 10, 2006. On February 25, 2002, the BCSC, the ASC and the OSC issued the Cease 
Trade Orders against New Inca for failure to file financial statements within the prescribed period of time and failing 
to  pay  the  required  filing  fees.  New  Inca  subsequently  filed  the  financial  statements  and  paid  the  filing  fees  as 
required. The Cease Trade Orders issued by the ASC and the BCSC were rescinded in October 2003 and the Cease 
Trade Order issued by the OSC was issued in March 2003.
A. Murray Sinclair was a director of PetroFalcon from November 28, 2001 to June 4, 2003. On February 27, 2002, 
the BCSC issued an order regarding a private placement of PetroFalcon to Quest Ventures, a private company in 
which  Mr.  Sinclair  was  also  a  director.  The  BCSC  considered  it  to  be  in  the  public  interest  to  remove  the 
applicability of certain exemptions from the prospectus and registration requirements of the Securities Act (British 
Columbia) for PetroFalcon until a shareholders meeting of PetroFalcon was held. In addition, the BCSC removed 
the applicability of the same exemptions for Quest Ventures in respect of the common shares received pursuant to 
the private placement. Approval of the shareholders was received on May 23, 2002 and the BCSC reinstated the 
applicability  of  the  exemptions  from  the  prospectus  and  registration  requirements  for  both  companies  shortly 
thereafter.
Bankruptcies
Other than as disclosed in this Information Circular, no proposed director or executive officer of New GTO, or a 
shareholder holding a sufficient number of securities of New GTO to affect materially the control of New GTO:
(i)
(ii)
is,  as  at  the  date  of  this  Information  Circular,  or  has  been  within  the  10  years  before  the  date  of  this 
Information Circular, a director or executive officer of any company that, while that person was acting in 
that  capacity,  or  within  a  year  of  that  person  ceasing  to  act  in  that  capacity,  became  bankrupt,  made  a 
proposal  under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  or  was  subject  to  or  instituted  any 
proceedings,  arrangement  or  compromise  with  creditors  or  had  a  receiver,  receiver  manager  or  trustee 
appointed to hold its assets; or
has, within the 10 years before the date of this Information Circular, become bankrupt, made a proposal 
under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency,  or  become  subject  to  or  instituted  any 
proceedings,  arrangement  or  compromise  with  creditors,  or  had  a  receiver,  receiver  manager  or  trustee 
appointed to hold the assets of the director, executive officer or shareholder.
Penalties or Sanctions
Other than as disclosed in this Information Circular, no proposed director or executive officer of New GTO, or a 
shareholder holding a sufficient number of securities of New GTO to affect materially the control of New GTO, has 
been subject to:
(i)
(ii)
any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities regulatory 
authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities regulatory authority; or
any  other  penalties  or  sanctions  imposed  by  a  court or  regulatory  body  that  would  likely  be  considered 
important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision.

PROPOSED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the  Ram  Acquisition,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  New  GTO  Board  will 
formulate  and  administer  an  executive  compensation  program.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  executive  compensation 
program will be comprised of two principal elements including base salaries and incentive stock options, which are 
designed to provide a combination of cash and equity–based compensation to effectively compensate, attract, retain 
and motivate the directors and executive officers of New GTO and to closely align the personal interests of such 
persons to those of the shareholders of New GTO.
It is also anticipated that the New GTO Board will recommend how much, if any, cash compensation will be paid to 
directors  for  services  rendered  by  directors,  in  such  capacity,  to  New  GTO,  however,  it  is  not  anticipated  that 
directors  who  are  otherwise  employed  by  or  engaged  to  provide  services  to  New  GTO,  will  be  paid  any  cash 
compensation for their services as directors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is anticipated that all directors will be 
primarily compensated for their services as directors through the granting of stock options in such amounts and upon 
such terms as may be approved by the New GTO Board from time to time.
Base Salaries
It is anticipated that base salaries for executive officers of New GTO will be reviewed annually in view of corporate 
and personal performance objectives, based on individual levels of responsibility.  Presently it is not anticipated that 
salaries  of  the  executive  officers  of  New  GTO  will  be  determined  based  on  benchmarks  or  a  specific  formula, 
however, benchmarks, performance goals and other specific criteria may be developed as New GTO matures.
Option Based Awards
At the Meetings, the GTO Shareholders, the Polaris Securityholders and the Western Securityholders will be asked 
to consider and, if thought appropriate, approve the New GTO Option Plan. See “Matters to be Approved at the 
Meetings”. The New GTO Option Plan provides that the New GTO Board may from time to time, in its discretion, 
and  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  TSX,  grant  to  its  directors,  officers,  employees  and  consultants, 
non-transferable options to purchase GTO Shares, provided that the number of GTO Shares reserved for issuance 
does not exceed 10% of the issued and outstanding GTO Shares.  For a description of the New GTO Option Plan, 
see “Options to Purchase Securities”.
It is anticipated that the process for determining option based awards for executive officers and directors of New 
GTO will be solely based on discussions by the members of the New GTO Board and the executive team, without 
any formal objectives, criteria and analysis.
Other Components
New GTO does not anticipate providing any pension or retirement benefits to its executive officers.
Anticipated Pension Plan Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans Table
It is anticipated that New GTO will not implement a pension or retirement plan in the foreseeable future.
Deferred Compensation Plans
It is anticipated that New GTO will not implement a deferred compensation plan in the foreseeable future.
Compensation of Named Executive Officers
It is anticipated that the “Named Executive Officers” of New GTO upon completion of the Business Combination 
will be Yeheskel (Hezy) Ram, the proposed President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Zavesov, the proposed Vice 
President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  Daniel  N.  Schochet,  the  proposed  Executive  Vice  President,  Stuart  D.
O-11
Johnson, the proposed Vice President, Geothermal Resources and C. Thomas Ogryzlo, the proposed Senior Vice 
President, Latin American Operations (collectively, the “New GTO Named Executive Officers”). For information 
regarding  the  compensation  of  the  New  GTO  Named  Executive  Officers,  excluding  Mr.  Ogryzlo,  please  see 
“Appendix  N  –  Information  Concerning  Ram  –  Statement  of  Executive  Compensation”.  As  of  the  date  of  this 
Information Circular, the terms of Mr. Ogryzlo’s employment are being negotiated.
PROPOSED STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
Board of Directors of New GTO
Independence of Directors
An  “independent  director”  generally  is  one  who  has  no  direct  or  indirect  material  relationship  with  an  issuer  as 
defined  in  National  Instrument  52-110  –  Audit  Committees  (“NI  52-110”)  and  National  Instrument  58-101  – 
Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices (“NI 58-101”).  A “material relationship” is a relationship which 
could, in the view of the board of directors of an issuer, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of a 
director’s independent judgement.
The  New GTO  Board will  be  responsible for  determining whether or  not  each  director  is  “independent”  or  “not 
independent”.  To carry out this determination, all relationships with New GTO will be reviewed.
It is currently proposed that the New GTO Board will be comprised of five (5) directors, the majority (4) of whom 
are expected to be “independent” under NI 58-101, namely Chris Thompson, Walter Higgins, A. Murray Sinclair 
and  Daryl  S.  Clark.  Yeheskel  (Hezy)  Ram,  the  proposed  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  will  not  be 
independent within the meaning of NI 58-101 by virtue of the fact that he is expected to be an executive officer of 
New GTO.
In order to facilitate the exercise of the independent directors’ judgment, it is currently intended that following the 
completion of the Business Combination, the independent members of the New GTO Board will hold meetings at 
which the non-independent directors and members of management are not in attendance. In addition, it is expected 
that the New GTO Board will hold “in camera” sessions for independent members during each New GTO Board 
meeting  to  facilitate  open  and  candid  discussion  amongst  the  independent  directors.  In  addition,  the independent 
directors  may  schedule  meetings  as  they  see  fit  without  members  of  management  and  non-independent  directors 
present.
Chair of the Board
The proposed Chairman of the New GTO Board, Chris Thompson, will be considered an independent director. The 
role of the Chairman will be to provide leadership to the New GTO Board, manage the affairs of the New GTO 
Board and ensure that the New GTO Board is organized properly, functions effectively and meets its obligations and 
responsibilities.  The  Chairman  is  expected  to  preside  at  each  meeting  of  the  New  GTO  Board  and  will  be 
responsible for coordinating with management to ensure that documents are delivered to the directors in sufficient 
time in advance of board meetings for a thorough review, that matters are properly presented for the New GTO 
Board’s consideration at meetings and that the New GTO Board has an appropriate opportunity to discuss issues at 
each  meeting,  such  that  the  New  GTO  Board  is  able  to  carry  out  its  duties  to  oversee  the  management  of  the 
business and affairs of New GTO. The Chairman will be responsible for communicating with each New GTO Board 
member, ensuring that each director has the opportunity to be heard, that each director is accountable to the New 
GTO Board and that the New GTO Board and each committee is discharging its duties. The Chairman will also be 
responsible  for  organizing  the  New  GTO  Board  to  function  independently  of  management  and  arranging  for  the 
independent directors to meet without non-independent directors and management present.
Other Directorships
The other directorships which the proposed directors of New GTO hold in other reporting issuers, or the equivalent 
in foreign jurisdictions, is set out below.

Position Descriptions
It is currently expected that the New GTO Board will develop written position descriptions for the Chairman of the 
New GTO Board, any New GTO Board committee established by the board and the Chief Executive Officer of New 
GTO following completion of the Business Combination.
Orientation and Continuing Education
Following  completion  of  the  Business  Combination,  it  is  expected  that  the  New  GTO  Board  will  consider 
implementing a formal orientation and continuing education program whereby all directors will receive a New GTO 
Board manual which may contain, among other things, any board mandate or terms of reference adopted by the New 
GTO Board and its committees
Ethical Business Conduct
In  addition  to  applicable  laws  that  will  apply  to  the  New  GTO  Board  generally,  the  New  GTO  Board’s 
responsibilities will be governed by the BCBCA, New GTO’s Articles and any mandates or terms of reference for 
any committee of the New GTO Board. Following completion of the Business Combination, the New GTO Board 
may consider adopting a code of ethical business conduct for New GTO.
Nomination of Directors
Following completion of the Business Combination, it is currently intended that the New GTO Board as a whole 
will be responsible for periodically reviewing the composition and the criteria regarding the composition of the New 
GTO Board and any committees.
Board Committees
Following completion of the Business Combination, it is currently intended that the New GTO Board will establish 
the  Audit  Committee.  The  proposed  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  Daryl  S.  Clark  (Chairman),  Chris 
Thompson and Walter Higgins, each of whom is considered to be “independent” and “financially literate” within the 
meaning of NI 52-110. The charter of the Audit Committee of GTO, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2 to 
“Appendix K – Information Concerning GTO”, will continue to be the charter of the Audit Committee of New GTO 
with such amendments as the Audit Committee of New GTO feels appropriate.
O-13
The New GTO Board may establish such other committees as the board feels are necessary to help govern New 
GTO effectively.
Assessments
The New GTO Board as a whole will be responsible for conducting evaluations and assessments of the performance, 
contribution and effectiveness of individual directors, any committees of the New GTO Board and the New GTO 
Board as a whole. Assessments may include a board questionnaire.
The New GTO Option Plan
OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES
In connection with completion of the Business Combination, New GTO intends to adopt the New GTO Option Plan, 
to become effective, subject to receipt of securityholder approval and all requisite regulatory approvals, upon the 
closing  of  the  Business  Combination.  The  New  GTO  Option  Plan,  which  has  been  drafted  to  comply  with  the 
policies of the TSX, will replace the GTO Option Plan. A copy of the New GTO Option Plan is attached to the 
Information Circular as Appendix S.
The purpose of the New GTO Option Plan is to provide an incentive to the officers, employees, directors and certain 
consultants of New GTO or any of its subsidiaries to achieve the longer term objective of New GTO, to give suitable 
recognition of the ability and industry of such persons who contribute materially to the success of New GTO and to 
attract and retain persons of experience and ability, by providing them with the opportunity to acquire an increased 
proprietary interest in New GTO. Stock options are expected to be provided upon commencement of employment 
with New GTO. Additional grants are expected to be made periodically to recognize exemplary performance of, or 
special contributions by, eligible participants.
The New GTO Option Plan permits the granting of options to purchase GTO Shares to officers, directors, employees 
and certain consultants of New GTO and its subsidiaries. The maximum number of GTO Shares issuable on exercise 
of options outstanding at any time shall be limited to 10% of the issued and outstanding GTO Shares from time to 
time.
Options granted pursuant to the New GTO Option Plan will have a term not to exceed five years and vest in such 
manner as determined by the board of directors of New GTO at the time of the grant and may not be granted having 
an exercise price less than the closing price of the GTO Shares on the TSX (or other stock exchange on which the 
GTO Shares may be listed) on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant. Options granted under the 
New  GTO  Option  Plan  are  generally  not  assignable  except  to  certain  permitted  assigns  listed  in  the  New  GTO 
Option Plan. The number of GTO Shares issuable pursuant to options granted under the New GTO Option Plan or 
any other stock compensation arrangements of New GTO: (i) which may be issued to insiders may not exceed 10% 
of the outstanding GTO Shares; and (ii) which may be issued to insiders within a one year period may not exceed 
10% of the outstanding GTO Shares.
In case of death of an optionholder, the right to exercise an option shall extend to the earlier of: (i) one year after the 
date of death; or (ii) the expiry date of the option to the extent that such option was exercisable by the optionholder 
on the date of death of the optionholder. In the case of termination or cessation of employment of an optionholder 
(who is not a consultant) for any reason (other than death) or, in the case of a consultant, upon cessation of the 
services agreement, the right to exercise an option shall be limited to and shall expire on the earlier of sixty (60) 
days after the date of termination or cessation (in the case of an optionholder who is not a consultant) and from the 
last  date  from  which  a  consultant  provides  services  to  New  GTO  (in  the  case  of  an  optionholder  who  is  a 
consultant), or the expiry date of the option, to the extent such option was exercisable by the optionholder on the 
date of termination of such employment or the date of final services by a consultant, as the case may be.
In  the  event  of  the  disposition  of  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  New  GTO,  or  the  dissolution,  merger, 
amalgamation or consolidation of New GTO with or into any other corporation or change of control or takeover, the
O-14
board of directors of New GTO may amend any outstanding options to permit the exercise of any or all vested and 
unvested outstanding options prior to the completion of any such transaction.
The New GTO Option Plan contains standard anti-dilution adjustment provisions in respect of the exercise price and 
the  number  of  GTO  Shares  for  which  outstanding  options  are  exercisable  in  the  event  of  certain  capital 
reorganizations and distributions of securities or assets. In addition, the board of directors of New GTO may, at any 
time amend, suspend, terminate or discontinue the New GTO Option Plan and may amend the terms and conditions 
of  options  granted  pursuant  to  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan,  subject  to  any  required  approval  of  any  regulatory 
authority or stock exchange. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the board of directors of New GTO 
may  alter,  amend  or  vary  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan  without  the  approval  of  shareholders  of  New  GTO  if  the 
alteration, amendment or variance:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
is for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, error or omission in the New GTO Option Plan or to 
correct or supplement any provision of the New GTO Option Plan that is inconsistent with any 
other provision of the New GTO Option Plan;
is necessary to comply with applicable law or the requirements of any stock exchange on which 
the GTO Shares are listed;
is  an  amendment  to  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan  respecting  administration  and  eligibility  for 
participation under the New GTO Option Plan;
changes  the  terms  and  conditions  on  which  options  may  be  granted  pursuant  to  the  New  GTO 
Option Plan including the provisions relating to exercise price, vesting provisions and the term of 
the options (which cannot be later than five (5) years after the grant of the option);
changes the termination provisions of a option to the New GTO Option Plan which does not entail 
an extension beyond the original expiry date; or
(f)
is an amendment to the New GTO Option Plan of a “housekeeping nature”;
provided that in the case of any alteration, amendment or variance referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), the 
alteration, amendment or variance does not;
(g)
(h)
(i)
(j)
amend the number of GTO Shares issuable under the New GTO Option Plan;
add any form of financial assistance by New GTO for the exercise of any option;
result  in  a  material  or  unreasonable  dilution  in  the  number  of  outstanding  GTO  Shares  or  any 
material benefit to an optionholder; or
change  the  class  of  eligible  participants  to  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan  which  would  have  the 
potential of broadening or increasing participation by insiders of New GTO.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to any required regulatory approval or any regulatory 
authority or stock exchange, the board of directors of New GTO may amend the exercise price, the term of an option 
(which  in no  event  shall  exceed  five  (5) years  from  the  date  of grant) and  the  termination provisions of  options 
granted pursuant the New GTO Option Plan, without shareholder approval, provided that if the board of directors of 
New GTO proposes to reduce the exercise price or extend the term of options granted to insiders of New GTO, such 
amendments will require shareholder approval.
The  policies  of  the  TSX  require  that  all  unallocated  option  entitlements  under  the  New  GTO  Option  Plan  be 
approved every three years by the holders of the GTO Shares.

RISK FACTORS
The following are certain risk factors related to the business of New GTO assuming completion of the Arrangement 
and the Ram Acquisition which should be carefully considered, in addition to the risk factors set forth elsewhere in 
this Information Circular.
Risks Relating to the Business and Industry of New GTO
Geothermal  exploration  and  development  programs  are  highly  speculative,  are  characterized  by  significant 
inherent risk and costs and may not be successful
New  GTO’s  future  performance  depends  on  its  ability  to  discover  and  establish  economically  recoverable  and 
sustainable  geothermal  resources  on  New  GTO’s  properties  through  its  exploration  and  development  programs. 
Geothermal exploration and development involves a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are
O-17
ultimately  developed  into  generating  power  plants.  There  is  no  assurance  that  New  GTO’s  exploration  and 
development programs will be successful. Despite historical exploration work, New GTO’s properties, other than 
the San Jacinto Project and the Geysers Project, are without a known geothermal resource. Substantial exploration 
and development work is required in order to determine if any economically recoverable and sustainable geothermal 
resources are located on these exploration properties. Successfully discovering geothermal resources is dependent on 
a number of factors, including the technical skill of exploration personnel involved. Even in the event commercial 
quantities of geothermal resources are discovered, it may not be commercially feasible to bring power generation 
facilities  into  a  state  of  commercial  production  from  such  geothermal  resources.  The  commercial  viability  of  a 
geothermal resource once discovered is dependent on a number of factors, some of which are particular attributes of 
the  resource,  such  as  heat  content  (the  relevant  composition  of  temperature  and  flow  rate/pressure),  useful  life, 
operational  factors  relating  to  the  extraction  of  fluids  from  the  geothermal  resource,  proximity  to  infrastructure, 
capital  costs  to  construct  a  power  plant  and  related  infrastructure  and  energy  prices.  Many  of  these  factors  are 
beyond New GTO’s control.
Geothermal exploration and development costs are high and are not fixed. A geothermal resource cannot be relied 
upon until substantial development, including drilling and testing, has taken place. The costs of development drilling 
are  subject  to  numerous  variables  such  as  unforeseen  geologic  conditions  underground  that  could  result  in 
substantial  cost  overruns.  Drilling  at  New  GTO’s  properties  may  involve  unprofitable  efforts,  not  only  from  dry 
wells, but from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, 
operating and other costs.
New  GTO’s  drilling  operations  may  be  curtailed,  delayed  or  cancelled  as  a  result  of  numerous  factors,  many  of 
which  are  beyond  New  GTO’s  control,  including  economic  conditions,  mechanical  problems,  title  problems, 
weather conditions, compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays of equipment and services. 
If  New  GTO’s  drilling  activities  are  not  successful,  it  could  materially  adversely  affect  its  business,  financial 
condition, future results and cashflow.
New GTO has a limited operating history
New GTO has a very limited history of operations and will be subject to  many of the risks common to start up 
enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other 
resources and lack of revenues. There is no assurance that New GTO will be successful in achieving a return on 
shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of its early stage of operations.
As a result of New GTO’s planned exploration and plant expansion projects, over the near term New GTO does not 
expect that its operating revenues will be sufficient to cover its expenses. New GTO’s ability to generate greater 
revenues and become profitable will depend on a number of factors, including its ability to:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
successfully  complete  its  planned  expansion  programs  for  its  San  Jacinto  Project  and/or 
commissioning of its Geyser Project;
advance  planned  and  future  development  programs  on  New  GTO’s  properties  to  commercial 
operation;
acquire interests in producing geothermal power companies or producing geothermal power plants 
that contribute to New GTO’s profitability;
verify geothermal resources on New GTO’s properties that are sufficient to generate a favourable 
economic return from electricity sales;
acquire electrical transmission and interconnection rights for New GTO’s geothermal power plant 
development projects;
enter  into  power  purchase  agreements  for  the  sale  of  electricity  from  New  GTO’s  geothermal 
power plant development projects at prices that support its operating and financing costs;
O-18
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
finance  and  complete  the  development  and  construction  of  geothermal  power  plants  on  New 
GTO’s properties;
operate producing geothermal power plants on a profitable basis;
secure adequate capital to support New GTO’s expansion, exploration and development programs 
and finance its acquisitions;
attract and retain qualified personnel; and
arrange project financing on reasonable terms.
New  GTO’s  financial  performance  depends  on  its  successful  operation  of  geothermal  power  plants,  which  is 
subject to various operational risks
New GTO’s financial performance depends on its successful operation of geothermal power plants. At present, New 
GTO  operates  a  single  power  plant  at  its  San  Jacinto  operation.  The  cost  of  operation  and  maintenance  and  the 
operating  performance  of  a  geothermal  power  plant  may  be adversely  affected by  a  variety  of  factors,  including 
some that are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors and the following:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
regular and unexpected maintenance and replacement expenditures;
shutdowns  due  to  the  breakdown  or  failure  of  the  plant’s  equipment  or  the  equipment  of  the 
transmission serving utility;
labour disputes;
catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes, landslides, floods, releases of hazardous 
materials,  severe  storms  or  similar  occurrences  affecting  a  power  plant,  any  of  the  power 
purchasers from a power plant or third parties providing services to a power plant; and
the aging of power plants, which may reduce their operating performance and increase the cost of 
their maintenance.
Any  of  these  events  could  significantly  increase  the  expenses  incurred  by  a  power  plant  or  reduce  the  overall 
generating capacity of a power plant and could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the revenues generated by a 
power  plant,  which  in  turn  would  reduce  New  GTO’s  net  income  and  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  its 
business, financial condition, future results and cashflow.
New GTO’s geothermal resources may decline over time and may not remain adequate to support the life of its 
power plants
The operation of geothermal power plants depends on the continued availability of adequate geothermal resources. 
Although New GTO believes its geothermal resources will be fully renewable if managed properly, it cannot be 
certain that any geothermal resource will remain adequate for the life of a geothermal power plant.
Any geothermal resource may suffer an unexpected decline in capacity to generate electricity. A number of events 
could cause such a decline or shorten the operational duration of a geothermal resource. These events include:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
failure to recycle all of the geothermal fluids used in connection with the applicable geothermal 
resource; and
failure to properly maintain the hydrological balance of the applicable geothermal resource.
O-19
If the geothermal resources available to a power plant developed by New GTO become inadequate, New GTO may 
be unable to perform under the power purchase agreement for the affected power plant, which in turn could reduce 
its revenues and materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. If New 
GTO suffers a decline in its geothermal resources, it may have an adverse impact on the covenants in the related 
projected  financing  documents  and  may  impair  its  ability  to  repay  its  debt  and  provide  for  the  anticipated  tax 
benefits.
Uncertainty in the calculation of geothermal resources and probabilistic estimates of gross MW capacity
There is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of geothermal resources and probabilistic estimates of 
gross MW capacity. Until a geothermal resource is actually accessed and tested by production and injection wells, 
the temperature and composition of underground fluids must be considered estimates only. In addition, estimates as 
to  the  percentage  of  the  heat  that  can  be  expected  to  be  recovered  at  the  surface  is  subject  to  a  number  of 
assumptions  including,  but  not  limited  to,  resource  base  temperature,  areal  extent  of  the  geothermal  reservoir, 
thickness of the geothermal reservoir, percentage of resource recovery and the expected lifetime of the geothermal 
reservoir. If any of these assumptions prove to be materially incorrect, it may affect the gross MW capacity of a 
property.
Geological occurrences beyond New GTO’s control may compromise its operations and their capacity to generate 
power
In  addition  to  the  substantial  risk  that  production  wells  that  are  drilled  will  not  be  productive  or  may  decline  in 
productivity  after  commencement  of  production,  hazards  such  as  unusual  or  unexpected  geologic  formations, 
downhole  conditions,  mechanical  failures,  blowouts,  cratering,  localized  ground  subsidence,  localized  ground 
inflation, explosions, uncontrollable releases or flows of well fluids, pollution and other physical and environmental 
risks are inherent in geothermal exploration and production. These hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
due  to  injury  and  loss  of  life,  severe  damage  to  and  destruction  of  property  and  equipment,  pollution  and  other 
environmental damage, failure to find a proper injection zone and suspension of operations.
Additionally, active geothermal areas, such as the areas in which New GTO’s operations and properties are located, 
are subject to frequent low-level seismic disturbances. Serious seismic disturbances are possible and could result in 
damage to its projects or equipment or degrade the quality of its geothermal resources to such an extent that New 
GTO could not perform under the power purchase agreement for the affected project, which in turn could reduce its 
net income and materially and adversely affect New GTO’s business, financial condition, future results and cash 
flow. If New GTO suffers a serious seismic disturbance, its business interruption and property damage insurance 
may  not  be  adequate  to  cover  all  losses  sustained  as  a  result  thereof.  In  addition,  insurance  coverage  may  not 
continue to be available in the future in amounts adequate to insure against such seismic disturbances.
New GTO may be unable to obtain the financing it needs to pursue its growth strategy
When New GTO identifies a geothermal property that it may seek to acquire or to develop, a substantial capital 
investment  often  will  be  required.  New  GTO’s  continued  access  to  capital,  through  project  financing  or  through 
credit facilities or other arrangements with acceptable terms is necessary for the success of its growth strategy. New 
GTO’s  attempts  to  secure  the  necessary  capital  may  not  be  on  favourable  terms,  or  successful  at  all.  Market 
conditions and other factors may not permit future project and acquisition financings on terms favourable to New 
GTO.  New  GTO’s  ability  to  arrange  for  financing  on  favourable  terms,  and  the  costs  of  such  financing,  are 
dependent on numerous factors, including general economic and capital market conditions, investor confidence, the 
continued success of current projects, the credit quality of the project being financed, the political situation in the 
jurisdiction in which the project is located and the continued existence of tax laws which are conducive to raising 
capital.  If  New  GTO  is  unable  to  secure  capital  through  credit  facilities  or  other  arrangements,  it  may  have  to 
finance its projects using equity financing which will have a dilutive effect on the GTO Shares. Also, in the absence 
of favourable financing or other capital raising options, New GTO may decide not to build new plants or acquire 
properties from third parties. Any of these alternatives could have a material adverse effect on New GTO’s growth 
prospects and financial condition.
O-20
It is very costly to place geothermal resources into commercial production
Before the sale of any power can occur, it will be necessary to construct a gathering and disposal system, a power 
plant, and a transmission line, and considerable administrative costs will be incurred, together with the drilling of 
production and injection wells. Future development and expansion of power production at New GTO’s properties 
may  result  in  significantly  increased  capital  costs  related  to  increased  production  and  injection  well  drilling  and 
higher  costs  for  labour  and  materials.  To  fund  expenditures  of  this  magnitude,  New  GTO  may  have  to  seek 
additional financing and sources of capital. There can be no assurance that additional capital can be found and, if 
found, it may result in New GTO having to substantially reduce its interest in the project.
New GTO may continue to incur negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future
Revenues  from  New  GTO’s  San  Jacinto  operation  are  not  sufficient  to  fund  all  of  New  GTO’s  anticipated 
expansion, development and exploration programs and general and administrative expenses. New GTO currently has 
a negative operating cash flow and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. New GTO’s failure to achieve 
profitability and positive operating cash flows could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and 
results of operations.
Energy prices are subject to dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations
The market price of energy is volatile and cannot be controlled. If the price of electricity should drop significantly, 
the economic prospects of the properties that New GTO has an interest in, the power from which is not contracted 
for,  could  be  significantly  reduced  or  rendered  uneconomic.  There  is  no  assurance  that,  even  if  commercial 
quantities of geothermal resources are discovered, a profitable market may exist for the sale of geothermal energy. 
Factors beyond New GTO’s control may affect the marketability of any geothermal resources discovered. Prices 
have  fluctuated  widely,  particularly  in  recent  years.  The  marketability  of  geothermal  energy  is  also  affected  by 
numerous  other  factors  beyond  New  GTO’s  control,  including  government  regulations  relating  to  royalties, 
allowable production and exporting of energy sources, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted.
Dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations in the market price for energy may affect the ability of New GTO to enter 
into new power purchase agreements on favourable terms to it, or at all, which would have a negative impact on the 
revenues of New GTO and its decisions regarding development of additional properties.
Industry competition may impede New GTO’s ability to access suitable geothermal resources
Significant and increasing competition exists for the limited number of quality geothermal opportunities available. 
As a result of this competition, some of which is with large established companies with substantial capabilities and 
greater  financial  and  technical  resources  than  New  GTO,  it  may  be  unable  to  acquire  additional  geothermal 
operations or properties on terms it considers acceptable. There can be no assurance that New GTO’s acquisition 
programs will yield new geothermal operations or properties.
New GTO may be unable to enter into power purchase agreements on terms favourable to New GTO, or at all
The electrical power generation industry, of which geothermal power is a sub-component, is highly competitive and 
New GTO may not be able to compete successfully or grow its business. The industry is complex as it is composed 
of public utility districts, cooperatives and investor-owned power companies. Many of the participants produce and 
distribute  electricity.  Their  willingness  to  purchase  electricity  from  an  independent  producer  may  be  based  on  a 
number of factors and not solely on pricing and surety of supply. If New GTO cannot enter into power purchase 
agreements on favourable terms to it, or at all, it would negatively impact New GTO’s revenue and its decisions 
regarding development of additional properties.
O-21
The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and New GTO will encounter competition 
from  electric  utilities,  other  power  producers,  and  power  marketers  that  could  materially  and  adversely  the 
business, financial condition, future results and cash flow of New GTO
The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition from electric utilities, other power producers 
and power marketers. In recent years, there has been increasing competition in the sale of electricity, in part due to 
excess capacity in a number of U.S. markets and an emphasis on short-term or “spot” markets, and competition has 
contributed to a reduction in electricity prices. For the most part, New GTO expects that power purchasers interested 
in  long-term  arrangements  will  engage  in  “competitive  bid”  solicitations  to  satisfy  new  capacity  demands.  This 
competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain power purchase agreements and the price paid for electricity 
by the relevant power purchasers. There is also increasing competition between electric utilities. This competition 
has put pressure on electric utilities to lower their costs, including the cost of purchased electricity, and increasing 
competition in the future will put further pressure on power purchasers to reduce the prices at which they purchase 
electricity from New GTO.
The cancellation or expiry of government initiatives to support renewable energy generation may adversely affect 
New GTO’s business
Numerous  government  initiatives  are  currently  in  place,  or  have  been  or  may  be  proposed,  to  support  the 
development of renewable energy generation to meet increasing electricity demand. In the United States, current 
initiatives  include:  incentives  within  the  United  States  Internal  Revenue  Code,  such  as  the  ITC  and  accelerated 
depreciation  allowances;  provisions  of  the  Recovery  Act  extending  the  availability  of  the  PTC  for  geothermal 
projects placed in service before 2014, increasing the ITC from 10% to 30% of eligible costs, and creating a new 
grant program for geothermal projects that are placed in service in by the end of 2013, or for which construction 
begins in, 2009 or 2010; RPS requirements or goals established in 33 states and the District of Columbia; and the 
U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s  Loan  Guarantee  Program.  The  cancellation  or  expiry  of  any  one  or  more  of  these 
government initiatives, or the failure of federal or state governments to adopt similar initiatives in the future, may 
adversely affect New GTO’s business by increasing the costs for financing or development of geothermal power 
plants and related transmission facilities, reducing demand for geothermal electricity or lowering energy prices.
Environmental and other regulatory requirements may add costs and uncertainty
New  GTO’s  current  and  future  operations,  including  exploration  and  development  activities  and  electricity 
generation  from  power  plants,  require  licences  and  permits  from  various  governmental  authorities  and  such 
operations  are  and  will  be  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  governing  exploration  and  development,  geothermal 
resources, production, exports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land 
use,  environmental  protection,  project  safety  and  other  matters.  Companies  can  experience  increased  costs,  and 
delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations, licences 
and permits. There is no assurance that all approvals or required licences and permits will be obtained. Additional 
permits,  licences  and  studies,  which  may  include  environmental  impact  studies  conducted  before  licences  and 
permits can be obtained, may be necessary prior to the exploration or development of properties, or the operation of 
power plants, in which New GTO has an interest, and there can be no assurance that New GTO will be able to 
obtain  or  maintain  all  necessary  licences  or  permits  that  may  be  required  on  terms  that  enable  operations  to  be 
conducted  at  economically  justifiable  costs.  Failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws,  regulations,  licensing  or 
permitting  requirements  may  result  in  enforcement  actions  thereunder,  including  orders  issued  by  regulatory  or 
judicial  authorities  causing  operations  to  cease  or  be  curtailed,  and  may  include  corrective  measures  requiring 
capital  expenditures,  installation  of  additional  equipment,  or  remedial  actions.  New  GTO  may  be  required  to 
compensate  those  suffering  loss  or  damage  by  reason  of  its  activities,  and  may  have  civil  or  criminal  fines  or 
penalties imposed upon it for violations of applicable laws or regulations.
Applicable laws and regulations, including environmental requirements and licensing and permitting processes, may 
require public disclosure and consultation. It is possible that a legal protest could be triggered through one of these 
requirements or processes that could delay, or require the suspension of, an exploration or development program or 
the  operation of  a power  plant  and  increase  New GTO’s  costs.  Because  of  these  requirements,  New  GTO  could 
incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil or water, 
including  responsibility  for  remediation  costs.  New  GTO  could  potentially  discharge  such  materials  into  the
O-22
environment: from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site; leakage of fluids or airborne pollutants from gathering 
systems,  pipelines,  power  plants  or  storage  tanks;  damage  to  geothermal  wells  resulting  from  accidents  during 
normal operations; and blowouts, cratering and explosions.
No assurance can be given that new laws and regulations will not be enacted or that existing laws and regulations 
will not be applied in a manner that could limit or curtail New GTO’s exploration and development programs or its 
operation of power plants. Amendments to current laws, regulations, licences and permits governing operations and 
activities of geothermal companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact 
on New GTO and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs, or reduction in levels of production, or 
abandonment, or delays in development of the business.
The success of New GTO’s business relies on attracting and retaining key personnel
New GTO is dependent upon the services of its senior management team. The loss of any of their services could 
have a material adverse effect upon New GTO.
New GTO’s officers and directors may have conflicts of interests arising out of their relationships with other 
companies
Several  of  New  GTO’s  directors  and  officers  serve  (or  may  agree  to  serve)  as  directors  or  officers  of  other 
companies  or  have  significant  shareholdings  in  other  companies.  To  the  extent  that  such  other  companies  may 
participate in ventures in which New GTO participates, the directors may have a conflict of interest in negotiating 
and  concluding  terms  respecting  the  extent  of  such  participation.  From  time  to  time  several  companies  may 
participate in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties thereby allowing for their 
participation  in  larger programs,  permitting  involvement in  a  greater number  of programs  and reducing financial 
exposure in respect of any one program. It may also occur that a particular company will assign all or a portion of its 
interest in a particular program to another of these companies due to the financial position of the company making 
the assignment.
New GTO may face adverse claims to title
Although  New  GTO  has  taken  reasonable  precautions  to  ensure  that  legal  title  to  its  properties  is  properly 
documented, there can be no assurance of title to any of its property interests, or that such title will ultimately be 
secured. New GTO’s property interests may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers or other land 
claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects and adverse laws and regulations.
BLM leases may be terminated if New GTO fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam 
Act of 1970 or if New GTO fails to comply with the terms or stipulations of such leases
Pursuant to the terms of the BLM leases, New GTO is required to conduct its operations on BLM-leased land in a 
workmanlike  manner  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  BLM  directives  and  to  take  all  mitigating 
actions  required  by  the  BLM  to  protect  the  surface  of  and  the  environment  surrounding  the  relevant  land. 
Additionally,  certain  BLM  leases  contain  additional  requirements,  some  of  which  relate  to  the  mitigation  or 
avoidance  of  disturbance  of  any  antiquities,  cultural  values  or  threatened  or  endangered  plants  or  animals,  the 
payment of royalties for timber and the imposition of certain restrictions on residential development on the leased 
land. In the event of a default under any BLM lease, or the failure to comply with such requirements, or any non-
compliance with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 or regulations issued thereunder, the 
BLM  may,  30  days  after  notice  of  default  is  provided  to  New  GTO’s  relevant  project  subsidiary,  suspend  its 
operations until the requested action is taken or terminate the lease, either of which could materially and adversely 
affect New GTO’s business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.
Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may affect New GTO’s financial results
New  GTO  maintains  accounts  in  Canadian  and  U.S.  dollars.  New  GTO’s  operations  in  the  United  States  and 
Nicaragua make it subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations are material to the extent 
that fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollar and/or U.S. dollar balances are material. New GTO does not
O-23
at present, nor does it plan in the future, to engage in foreign currency transactions to hedge exchange rate risks but 
it does convert Canadian funds to U.S. dollars anticipating U.S. expenditures.
New GTO may not be able to successfully integrate businesses or projects that it acquires in the future
New  GTO’s  business  strategy  is  to  expand  in  the  future,  including  through  acquisitions.  Integrating  acquisition 
targets is often costly, and New GTO may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies with its existing 
operations  without  substantial  costs,  delays  or  other  adverse  operational  or  financial  consequences.  Integrating 
acquired  companies  involves  a  number  of  risks  that  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  New  GTO’s  business, 
including:

(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
the failure of the acquired companies to achieve expected results;
inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;
risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and
difficulties associated with establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures 
and policies, including accounting and other financial controls and procedures.
New GTO’s insurance policies may be insufficient to cover losses
As protection against operating hazards, New GTO intends to maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, 
potential losses. New GTO may not fully insure against all risks associated with its business either because such 
insurance is not available or because the cost of such coverage is considered prohibitive. The occurrence of an event 
that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance could have a material adverse effect on New GTO’s financial 
condition and results of operations.
New GTO’s projects may not be eligible for Qualifying Facility status under PURPA
PURPA  largely  exempts  “Qualifying  Facilities”  from  the  FPA  and  certain  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations 
regarding rates and financial and organizational requirements for the electric power generation industry.
If any of New GTO’s U.S. projects were to lose their existing Qualifying Facility status or new projects failed to 
obtain Qualifying Facility status, such project could become subject to the full scope of the FPA and applicable state 
regulation.  The application of the FPA and other applicable state regulation could require New GTO’s operations to 
comply  with  an  increasingly  complex  regulatory  regime  that  may  be  costly  and  greatly  reduce  operational 
flexibility.
In addition, pursuant to the FPA, the FERC has exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity 
and transmission of public utilities in interstate commerce. These rates may be based on a cost of service approach 
or may be determined on a market basis through competitive bidding or negotiation.  If a U.S. project were to lose or 
be ineligible for Qualifying Facility status, it would become a public utility under the FPA, and the rates charged by 
such project pursuant to its power purchase agreements would be subject to the review and approval of the FERC.  
A material and adverse change to the rates made by the FERC would likely result in a decrease in future revenues or 
in an obligation to disgorge revenues previously received from the relevant project, either of which would have an 
adverse effect on the revenues of New GTO.
Moreover, a loss of Qualifying Facility status also could permit the power purchaser, pursuant to the terms of the 
particular  power  purchase  agreement,  to  cease  taking  and  paying  for  electricity  from  the  relevant  project  or, 
consistent with FERC precedent, to seek refunds of past amounts paid.  This could cause the loss of some or all of 
New GTO’s revenues payable pursuant to the related power purchase agreements, result in significant liability for 
refunds of past amounts paid, or otherwise impair the value of our projects.
Pursuant  to  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  FERC  was  also  given  authority  to  prospectively  lift  the  mandatory 
obligation of a utility under PURPA to offer to purchase electricity from a Qualifying Facility if the utility operates
O-24
in a workably competitive market. If the utilities in the regions in which New GTO’s projects operate were to be 
relieved of the mandatory purchase obligation, they would not be required to purchase energy from the project in the 
region  under  Federal  law  upon  termination  of  the  existing  power  purchase  agreement  or  with  respect  to  new 
projects, which could have a material and adverse affect on New GTO’s business, financial condition, future results 
and cash flow.
Urbanizing activities related developments may limit geothermal activities in the areas of New GTO projects
Current  and  future  urbanizing  activities  and  related  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  development  may 
encroach  on  or  limit  geothermal  activities  in  the  areas  of  our  projects,  thereby  affecting  New  GTO’s  ability  to 
utilize, access, inject, and/or transport geothermal resources on or underneath the affected surface areas.
Risks Relating to the Political and Economic Climates of Countries in which New GTO Operates
There are risks associated with inter-regional transmission grids
The electrical power generated by New GTO’s operations may be used by consumers in the jurisdiction where such 
operations  are  located,  such  as  Nicaragua  in  the  case  of  the  San  Jacinto  Project,  or  sold  to  other  neighbouring 
jurisdictions  through  an  inter-regional  transmission  grid.  Applicable  laws,  inter-regional  agreements  and  the 
structure and functioning of the power markets between a host state and its neighbouring states are all critical to the 
success of New GTO’s geothermal projects.
Host country economic, social and political conditions can negatively affect New GTO’s operations
Some  of  New  GTO’s properties  are  located  in Nicaragua.  As New  GTO  conducts  exploration, development  and 
commercial operations in these foreign countries, it is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:

(cid:120)
(cid:120)

terrorism and hostage taking;
military repression;
expropriation or nationalization without adequate compensation;
difficulties  enforcing  judgments  obtained  in  Canadian  or  United  States  courts  against  assets 
located outside of those jurisdictions;
labour unrest;
high rates of inflation;
changes to royalty and tax regimes;
extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
volatile local political and economic developments;
difficulty with understanding and complying with the regulatory and legal framework respecting 
the ownership and maintenance of geothermal properties and power plants; and
difficulty obtaining key equipment and components for equipment.
Host  country  economic,  social  and  political  uncertainty  can  arise  as  a  result  of  lack  of  support  for  New  GTO’s 
activities  in  local  communities  in  the  vicinity  of  its  properties.  Such  uncertainties  also  arise  as  a  result  of  the 
relatively new and evolving promotion of private-sector power development. Though the effects of competition will 
increase  the  likelihood  of  market  efficiencies  and  benefit  New  GTO’s  properties,  elimination  of  energy  cost
O-25
subsidies  may  increase  the  inability  of  end-use  consumers  to  pay  for  power  and  lead  to  political  opposition  to 
privatization initiatives and have an adverse impact on its properties and operations.
Risks Relating to the GTO Shares and Trading Market
If the GTO Share price fluctuates, investors could lose a significant part of their investment.
In recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a 
significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating 
performance of these companies. The market price of GTO Shares could similarly be subject to wide fluctuations in 
response to a number of factors, most of which New GTO cannot control, including:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
changes  in  securities  analysts’  recommendations  and  their  estimates  of  New  GTO’s  financial 
performance;
the  public’s  reaction  to  New  GTO’s  press  releases,  announcements  and  filings  with  securities 
regulatory authorities and those if its competitors;
changes in market valuations of similar companies;
investor perception of New GTO’s industry or prospects;
additions or departures of key personnel;
commencement of or involvement in litigation;
changes in environmental and other governmental regulations;
announcements by New GTO or its competitors of strategic alliances, significant contracts, new 
technologies,
acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
variations in New GTO’s quarterly results of operations or cash flows or those of other companies;
revenues and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in 
particular quarter;
future issuances and sales of GTO Shares; and
changes in general conditions in the domestic and worldwide economies, financial markets or the 
mining industry.
The impact of any of these risks and other factors beyond New GTO’s control could cause the market price of GTO 
Shares to decline significantly. In particular, the market price for GTO Shares may be influenced by variations in 
electricity prices. This may cause the GTO Share price to fluctuate with these underlying commodity prices, which 
are highly volatile.
Under U.S. federal tax rules, New GTO may be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC"), 
which would result in special and generally unfavorable U.S. federal tax consequences to our U.S. shareholders
As a non-U.S. corporation, New GTO may be a PFIC depending on the percentage of New GTO’s gross income which is 
“passive”, within the meaning of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the percentage of New GTO’s assets that produce or 
are held to produce passive income. New GTO may be a PFIC in 2009 and in some or all subsequent taxable years. If 
New GTO is a PFIC for any taxable year during a U.S. shareholder's holding period in our common shares, such U.S.
O-26
shareholder may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liability on the sale of GTO Shares or on the receipt of 
dividends. The PFIC rules are complex and may be unfamiliar to U.S. shareholders. Accordingly, U.S. shareholders are 
urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to their GTO Shares.
A limited discussion of certain material anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders 
resulting from an Exchange and the acquisition, ownership and disposition of GTO Shares received pursuant to the 
Arrangement  is  included  under  the  heading  “Certain  United  States  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations”  in  the 
Information  Circular,  and  the  foregoing  is  qualified  in  full  by  the  information  in  that  section.    U.S.  Holders  are 
strongly urged to read that section in its entirety.
New GTO has no dividend payment policy and does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
New  GTO  has  not  declared  or  paid  any  dividends  on  GTO  Shares  and  does  not  currently  have  a  policy  on  the 
payment of dividends. For the foreseeable future, New GTO anticipates that it will retain future earnings and other 
cash resources for the operation and developments of its business. The payment of any future dividends will depend 
upon earnings and New GTO’s financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs and such other factors as its 
board of directors considers appropriate.
The issuance of additional equity securities may negatively impact the trading price of GTO Shares
New  GTO  may  issue  equity  securities  to  finance  its  activities  in  the  future.  In  addition,  outstanding  options  to 
purchase  GTO  Shares  may  be  exercised,  resulting  in  the  issuance  of  additional  GTO  Shares.  The  issuance  of 
additional equity securities or a perception that such an issuance may occur could have a negative impact on the 
trading price of GTO Shares.
Discretion in the use of proceeds
Management will have discretion concerning the use of the proceeds of the Financing as well as the timing of their 
expenditures.  As  a  result,  an  investor  will  be  relying  on  the  judgment  of  management  for  the  application  of  the 
proceeds of the Financing. Management may use the net proceeds of the Financing in ways that an investor may not 
consider desirable. The results and the effectiveness of the application of the proceeds are uncertain. If the proceeds 
are not applied effectively, New GTO’s results of operations may suffer.
Current global financial conditions have been subject to increased volatility
Current global financial conditions have been subject to increased volatility and numerous financial institutions have 
either gone into bankruptcy or have had to be rescued by governmental authorities. Access to public financing has 
been  negatively  impacted  by  both  sub-prime  mortgages  and  the  liquidity  crisis  affecting  the  asset-backed 
commercial paper market. These factors may impact New GTO’s ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the 
future and, if obtained, on terms favourable to it. If these increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, 
New  GTO’s  operations  could  be  adversely  impacted  and  the  trading  price  of  GTO  Shares  could  be  adversely 
affected.
AUDITORS, TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR
Deloitte & Touche LLP, Chartered Accountants, 1 City Centre Drive, Suite 500, Mississauga, Ontario  L5B 1M2, is 
expected to be the auditor of New GTO upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram Acquisition.
CIBC  Mellon  Trust  Company,  1600  –  1066  West  Hastings  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia  V6E  3X1,  is 
expected to be the transfer agent and registrar of the GTO Shares upon completion of the Arrangement and the Ram 
Acquisition.

All options granted pursuant to this Plan shall be subject to rules and policies of any stock exchange or exchanges on 
which  the  common  shares  of  the  Corporation  are  then  listed  and  any  other  regulatory  body  having  jurisdiction 
hereinafter (hereinafter collectively referred to as, the “Exchange”). 
4.
Subject  to  adjustment  as  provided  in  Section  15  hereof,  the  Shares  to  be  offered  under  the  Plan  shall  consist  of 
common  shares  of  the  Corporation's  authorized  but  unissued  common  shares.  The  aggregate  number  of  Shares 
issuable upon the exercise of all options granted under the Plan shall not exceed 10% of the issued and outstanding 
common shares of the Corporation from time to time. If any option granted hereunder shall expire or terminate for 
any reason in accordance with the terms of the Plan without being exercised, the unpurchased Shares subject thereto 
shall again be available for the purpose of this Plan. 
5.
The Corporation shall at all times during the term of the Plan reserve and keep available such numbers of Shares as 
will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. 
6.
Directors, officers, consultants, and employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries, and employees of a person or 
company  which  provides  management  services  to  the  Corporation  or  its  subsidiaries  (“Management  Company 
Employees”) shall be eligible for selection to participate in the Plan (such persons hereinafter collectively referred 
to as “Participants”). Subject to compliance with applicable requirements of the Exchange, Participants may elect

S-1
to hold options granted to them in an incorporated entity wholly owned by them and such entity shall be bound by 
the Plan in the same manner as if the options were held by the Participant. 
Subject to the terms hereof, the Board shall determine to whom options shall be granted, the terms and provisions of 
the  respective  option  agreements,  the  time  or  times  at  which  such  options  shall  be  granted  and  vested,  and  the 
number  of  Shares  to  be  subject  to  each  option.  In  the  case  of  employees  or  consultants  of  the  Corporation  or 
Management Company Employees, the option agreements to which they are party must contain a representation of 
the Corporation that such employee, consultant or Management Company Employee, as the case may be, is a bona 
fide employee, consultant or Management Company Employee of the Corporation or its subsidiaries. 
A Participant who has been granted an option may, if such Participant is otherwise eligible, and if permitted under 
the policies of the Exchange, be granted an additional option or options if the Board shall so determine. 
7.
Exercise Price
(e)
(f)
The exercise price of the Shares subject to each option shall be determined by the Board, 
subject to applicable Exchange approval, at the time any option is granted. In no event 
shall such exercise price be lower than the exercise price permitted by the Exchange. 
Once the exercise price has been determined by the Board, accepted by the Exchange and 
the option has been granted, the exercise price of an option may be reduced upon receipt 
of  Board  approval,  provided  that  in  the  case  of  options  held  by  insiders  of  the 
Corporation (as defined in the policies of the Exchange), the exercise price of an option 
may be reduced only if disinterested shareholder approval is obtained.
8.
Number of Optioned Shares
(g)
The number of Shares subject to an option granted to any one Participant shall be determined by 
the Board, but no one Participant shall be granted an option which exceeds the maximum 
number permitted by the Exchange. 
No single Participant may be granted options to purchase a number of Shares equalling 
more  than  5%  of  the  issued  common  shares  of  the  Corporation  in  any  twelve-month 
period unless the Corporation has obtained disinterested shareholder approval in respect 
of such grant and meets applicable Exchange requirements. 
Options shall not be granted if the exercise thereof would result in the issuance of more 
than 2% of the issued common shares of the Corporation in any twelve-month period to 
any one consultant of the Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries). 
Options shall not be granted if the exercise thereof would result in the issuance of more 
than 2% of the issued common shares of the Corporation in any twelve month period to 
persons employed to provide investor relation activities. Options granted to Consultants 
performing investor relations activities will contain vesting provisions such that vesting 
occurs over at least 12 months with no more than ¼ of the options vesting in any 3 month 
period.
(h)
(i)
Duration of Option
9.
Each option and all rights thereunder shall be expressed to expire on the date set out in the option agreement and 
shall be subject to earlier termination as provided in Sections 11 and 12, provided that in no circumstances shall the 
duration of an option exceed the maximum term permitted by the Exchange. For greater certainty, if the Corporation 
is  listed  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  (“TSX  Venture  ”),  the  maximum  term  may  not  exceed  10  years  if  the 
Corporation is classified as a “Tier 1” issuer by the TSX Venture, and the maximum term may not exceed 5 years if 
the Corporation is classified as a “Tier 2” issuer by the TSX Venture. 
10.
Option Period, Consideration and Payment
The option period shall be a period of time fixed by the Board not to exceed the maximum term 
permitted by the Exchange, provided that the option period shall be reduced with respect 
to any option as provided in Sections 11 and 12 covering cessation as a director, officer,
S-2
(j)
(k)
(l)
(m)
consultant,  employee  or  Management  Company  Employee  of  the  Corporation  or  its 
subsidiaries, or death of the Participant. 
Subject to any vesting restrictions imposed by the Exchange, the Board may, in its sole 
discretion, determine the time during which options shall vest and the method of vesting, 
or that no vesting restriction shall exist. 
Subject  to  any  vesting  restrictions  imposed by  the  Board, options  may  be  exercised  in 
whole or in part at any time and from time to time during the option period. To the extent 
required by the Exchange, no options may be exercised under this Plan until this Plan has 
been approved by a resolution duly passed by the shareholders of the Corporation. 
Except  as  set  forth  in  Sections  11  and  12,  no  option  may  be  exercised  unless  the 
Participant is at the time of such exercise a director, officer, consultant, or employee of 
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or a Management Company Employee of the 
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. 
The exercise of any option will be contingent upon receipt by the Corporation at its head 
office  of  a  written  notice  of  exercise,  specifying  the  number  of  Shares  with  respect  to 
which the option is being exercised, accompanied by cash payment, certified cheque or 
bank draft for the full purchase price of such Shares with respect to which the option is 
exercised. No Participant or his legal representatives, legatees or distributees will be, or 
will be deemed to be, a holder of any common shares of the Corporation unless and until 
the certificates for Shares issuable pursuant to options under the Plan are issued to him or 
them under the terms of the Plan.
Ceasing To Be a Director, Officer, Consultant or Employee
11.
If a Participant shall cease to be a director, officer, consultant, employee of the Corporation, or its subsidiaries, or 
ceases to be a Management Company Employee, for any reason (other than death), such Participant may exercise his 
option to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise it at the date of such cessation, provided that such 
exercise must occur within 90 days after the Participant ceases to be a director, officer, consultant, employee or a 
Management Company Employee, unless such Participant was engaged in investor relations activities, in which case 
such exercise must occur within 30 days after the cessation of the Participant's services to the Corporation.   
Nothing  contained  in  the  Plan,  nor  in  any  option  granted  pursuant  to  the  Plan,  shall  as  such  confer  upon  any 
Participant  any  right  with  respect  to  continuance  as  a  director,  officer,  consultant,  employee  or  Management 
Company Employee of the Corporation or of any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. 
12.
Notwithstanding section 11, in the event of the death of a Participant, the option previously granted to him shall be 
exercisable only within the one (1) year after such death and then only:
Death of Participant
by  the  person  or  persons  to  whom  the  Participant's  rights  under  the  option  shall  pass  by  the
Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution; and 
if and to the extent that such Participant was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of 
his death.
(n)
Rights of Optionee
13.
No  person  entitled  to  exercise  any  option  granted  under  the  Plan  shall  have  any  of  the  rights  or  privileges  of  a 
shareholder  of  the  Corporation  in  respect  of  any  Shares  issuable  upon  exercise  of  such  option  until  certificates 
representing such Shares shall have been issued and delivered. 
14.
The proceeds from the sale of Shares issued upon the exercise of options shall be added to the general funds of the 
Corporation and shall thereafter be used from time to time for such corporate purposes as the Board may determine.

If  the  outstanding  common  shares  of  the  Corporation  are  increased,  decreased,  changed  into  or  exchanged  for  a 
different  number  or  kind  of  shares  or  securities  of  the  Corporation  or  another  corporation  or  entity  through  re-
organization,  merger,  re-capitalization,  re-classification,  stock  dividend,  subdivision  or  consolidation,  any 
adjustments relating to the Shares optioned or issued on exercise of options and the exercise price per Share as set 
forth in the respective stock option agreements shall be made in accordance to the terms of such agreements.  
Adjustments under this Section shall be made by the Board whose determination as to what adjustments shall be 
made,  and  the  extent  thereof,  shall  be  final,  binding  and conclusive.  No  fractional  Share  shall  be  required  to  be 
issued under the Plan on any such adjustment. 
16.
All benefits, rights and options accruing to any Participant in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan 
shall  not  be  transferable  or  assignable  unless  specifically  provided  herein  or  the  extent,  if  any,  permitted  by  the 
Exchange.  During  the  lifetime  of  a  Participant  any  benefits,  rights  and  options  may  only  be  exercised  by  the 
Participant. 
17.
Subject to applicable approval of the Exchange, the Board may, at any time, suspend or terminate the Plan. Subject 
to  applicable  approval  of  the  Exchange,  the  Board  may  also  at  any  time  amend  or  revise  the  terms  of  the  Plan; 
provided that no such amendment or revision shall result in a material adverse change to the terms of any options 
theretofore granted under the Plan, unless shareholder approval, or disinterested shareholder approval, as the case 
may be, is obtained for such amendment or revision. 
18.
The ability of a Participant to exercise options and the obligation of the Corporation to issue and deliver Shares in 
accordance with the Plan is subject to any approvals, which may be required from shareholders of the Corporation 
and  any  regulatory  authority  or  stock  exchange having jurisdiction over  the  securities  of  the  Corporation.  If  any 
Shares  cannot  be  issued  to  any  Participant  for  whatever  reason,  the  obligation  of  the  Corporation  to  issue  such 
Shares shall terminate and any option exercise price paid to the Corporation will be returned to the Participant. 
19.
The  Plan  has  been  adopted  by  the  Board  of  the  Corporation  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Exchange  and,  if  so 
approved,  subject  to  the  discretion  of  the  Board,  the  Plan  shall  become  effective  upon  such  approvals  being 
obtained.

The Plan will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia.

Subject to Paragraph 8 hereof, an Optionee shall be entitled to exercise an Option granted 
to  an  Optionee  at  any  time  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  Option  Period,  subject  to  vesting 
limitations which may be imposed by the Board of Directors at the time such Option is 
granted.
In the event the expiration date for an Option occurs during a Blackout Period applicable

Blackout  Period  applicable  to  the  relevant  Optionee,  then  the  expiration  date  for  that 
Option  shall  be  the  date  that  is  the  10th  business  day  after  the  expiry  of  the  Blackout 
Period.
The Exercise Price of an Option granted under the 2009 Plan shall be as determined by 
the Board of Directors when such Option is granted subject to any limitations imposed by 
any relevant stock exchange or regulatory authority, and shall not be less than an amount 
equal to the Market Value of the Common Shares.  If Options are granted at the time of or

issuance of such options is in place in which case the binding agreement shall prevail.

Unless specifically amended or otherwise dealt with in a Stock Option Agreement:
(a)
(b)
in the case of death of an Optionee, the right to exercise an Option shall extend to the 
earlier of (i) one year after the date of death or (ii) the expiry date of the Option set forth 
in the Stock Option Agreement, to the extent such Option was exercisable by Optionee 
on the date of death of the Optionee; and 
in  the  case  of  termination  or  cessation  of  employment  of  an  Optionee  (who  is  not  a 
Consultant)  for  any  reason  (other  than  death)  or,  in  the  case  of  a  Consultant,  upon 
cessation of the services agreement the right to exercise an Option shall be limited to and 
shall expire on the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination or cessation (in the case 
of an Optionee who is not a Consultant) and from the Final Service Date (in the case of 
an Optionee who is a Consultant), or the expiry date of the Option set forth in the Stock 
Option Agreement, to the extent such Option was exercisable by Optionee on the date of 
termination of such employment or Final Service Date, as the case may be. For greater 
certainty,  any  reference  to  a  cessation  of  employment  of  the  Optionee  with  the 
Corporation for any reason or Final Service Date, as the case may be, other than death, is 
a reference to the occurrence of such fact howsoever that arises, and if any Optionee is 
entitled to reasonable notice of termination of employment or contract or compensation in 
lieu thereof, or is entitled to a specific period of notice or compensation in lieu thereof, 
then the Optionee is not entitled to claim any right to further unvested Common Shares 
which may be available pursuant to an Option or further time to exercise vested Common 
Shares available pursuant to an Option during the said reasonable notice period or during 
the  said  specific  notice  period,  or  to  compensation  in  lieu  thereof  by  way  of  general 
damages, or special damages, whether in contract, in tort or otherwise.

TAKEOVER OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The Board of Directors shall have the power, in the event of:
(a)
(b)

any  disposition  of  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  the  Corporation,  or  the  dissolution, 
merger,  amalgamation  or  consolidation  of  the  Corporation,  with  or  into  any  other 
corporation, or the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any other corporation into 
the Corporation, 
any change in control of the Corporation, or 
an offer is made generally to the holders of the Corporation’s voting securities to purchase 
those securities and which is a “takeover bid” as defined in the Securities Act;
to  amend  outstanding  Stock  Option  Agreements  to  permit  the  exercise  of  any  or  all  of  the  remaining 
Options  prior  to  the  completion  of  any  such  transaction.  If  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  exercise  such 
power, the Options shall be deemed to have been amended to permit the exercise thereof in whole or in 
part by the Optionee at any time or from time to time as determined by the Board of Directors prior to the 
completion of such transaction. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of the Corporation 
shall  occur  if  there  becomes  a  Control  Person  (as  defined  in  the  Securities  Act)  with  respect  to  the 
securities of the Corporation, who is not a Control Person as at the effective date of this 2009 Plan.
11.
ADJUSTMENTS
The  Exercise  Price,  and  the  number  of  shares  available  to  the  Optionee,  shall  be  subject  to
11.1 
adjustment from time to time as follows:
(a)
if the Corporation shall:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
subdivide,  re-divide  or  change  its  outstanding  Common  Shares  into  a  greater 
number  of  shares,  the  Corporation  shall  deliver,  at  the  time  of  any  exercise 
thereafter  of  the  Options,  such  additional  number  of  shares  as  would  have 
resulted  from  such  subdivision,  redivision  or  change  if  the  exercise  of  the 
Options  had  been  made  prior  to  the  date  of  such  subdivision,  redivision  or 
change;
reduce,  combine  or  consolidate  its  outstanding  Common  Shares  into  a  smaller 
number of shares, the number of  shares deliverable by the Corporation on any 
exercise thereafter of the Options shall be reduced to such number of shares as 
would  have  resulted  from  such  consolidation  or  change  if  the  exercise  of  the 
Options had been made prior to the date of such consolidation or change; or
issue Common Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common 
Shares)  to  the  holders  of  any  of  its  outstanding  Common  Shares  by  way  of  a 
stock  dividend  (other  than  an  issue  of Common  Shares  to  holders  of  Common 
Shares  who  exercise  an  option  to  receive  stock  dividends  in  lieu  of  cash 
dividends), the Corporation shall deliver, at the time of any exercise thereafter of 
the Options, such additional number of shares as would have resulted from such 
stock dividend if the exercise of the Options been made prior to the date of such 
stock dividend; and,
in addition, the Exercise Price, in effect immediately after such subdivision, re-division, 
change,  reduction,  combination  or  consolidation  or  such  issue  of  Common  Shares  (or 
securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) by way of a stock dividend
T-6
(b)
becomes effective or is paid, as the case may be, shall, in the case of the events referred 
to in (i) and (iii), be decreased in the same proportion to the increase in the number of 
outstanding  Common  Shares  resulting  from  such  subdivision,  re-division  or  change  or 
such dividend (including, in the case where securities convertible or exchangeable into 
Common  Shares  are  issued,  as  a  stock  dividend  the  number  of  Common  Shares  that 
would  have  been  outstanding  had  such  securities  been  converted  or  exchanged  into 
Common  Shares  on  such  date  of  issuance  thereof),  or,  in  the  case  of  (ii),  shall  be 
increased in the same proportion to the decrease in the number of outstanding Common 
Shares  resulting  from  such  reduction,  combination  or  consolidation;  such  adjustment 
shall be made successively whenever any event referred to in this subparagraph 11.1(a) 
shall occur, any such issue of Common Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable 
into Common Shares) by way of stock dividend referred to in (iii) above shall be deemed 
to have been made on the date the stock dividend is paid for the purpose of calculating 
the number of outstanding Common Shares under this paragraph 11.1, and to the extent 
that  any  such  securities  convertible  or  exchangeable  into  Common  Shares  are  not 
converted into Common Shares prior to the expiration of the conversion right contained 
in such securities, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted, effective as of the date of such 
expiration, to the Exercise Price, which would then be in effect based upon the number of 
Common Shares actually issued on the exercise of such conversion right;
if the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights or options to all or 
substantially all of the holders of its outstanding Common Shares entitling them, for  a 
period expiring not more than 45 days after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase 
Common  Shares  (or  securities  convertible  or  exchangeable  into  Common  Shares)  at  a 
price per share (or having a conversion or exchange price per share) less than 90% of the 
Market  Value  on  such  record  date,  then  subject  to  paragraph  11.2,  the  Exercise  Price 
shall  be  adjusted  immediately  after  such  record  date  so  that  it  shall  equal  a  price 
determined by multiplying the Exercise Price, in effect immediately before such record 
date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the sum of: (i) the total number of 
Common Shares outstanding on such record date; plus (ii) a number of Common Shares 
equal to the number arrived at by dividing (A) the aggregate price of the total number of 
additional  Common  Shares  offered  for  subscription  or  purchase  (or  the  aggregate 
conversion or exchange price of the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered) by 
(B)  the  Market  Value,  and  of  which  the  denominator  shall  be  the  total  number  of 
Common Shares outstanding on such record date or date of entering into such agreement 
plus the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase 
(or  into  which  the  convertible  or  exchangeable  securities  so  offered  are  convertible  or 
exchangeable); it being understood and agreed that (iii) any Common Shares owned by or 
held  for  the  account  of  the  Corporation  shall  be  deemed  not  to  be  outstanding  for  the 
purpose  of  any  such  computation;  (iv)  such  adjustment  shall  be  made  successively 
whenever  such  record  date  is  fixed  or  agreement  entered  into;  (v)  if  all  such  rights  or 
options or rights to acquire Common Shares or convertible or exchangeable securities are 
not exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Exercise Price, as the case may be, shall 
be  readjusted,  effective  as  of  the  date  of  such  expiration,  to  the  Exercise  Price,  which 
would  then  be  in  effect  based  upon  the  number  of  Common  Shares  (or  securities 
convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually delivered upon the exercise 
of such rights, options, Options or rights as the case may be;
(c)
if  the  Corporation  shall  fix  a  record  date  for  the  making  of  a  distribution  to  all  or 
substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares of:
(i)
shares of any class other than Common Shares;
T-7
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
rights or options (excluding those referred to in subparagraph 11.1(b) and rights 
or options to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or securities convertible 
or  exchangeable  into  Common  Shares)  for  a  period  of  not  more  than  45  days 
after such record date at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion or 
exchange  price  per  Common  Share)  not  less  than  90%  of  the  Current  Market 
Price on such record date);
evidences of its indebtedness; or
assets (excluding assets distributed as Dividends Paid in the Ordinary Course);
then in each such case, subject to paragraph 11.2, the Exercise Price, shall be adjusted 
immediately  after  such  record  date  so  that  it  shall  equal  the  price  determined  by 
multiplying the Exercise Price, in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the 
numerator shall be the: (A) total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record 
date multiplied by the Market Value on such record date; less (B) the fair market value 
(as determined by the Board of Directors) of such shares or rights or options or evidences 
of indebtedness or assets so distributed, and of which the denominator shall be the total 
number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by such Market 
Value; it being understood and agreed that (v) any Common Shares owned by or held for 
the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of 
any such computation; (vi) such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a 
record  date  is  fixed;  (vii)  to  the  extent  that  such  distribution  of  shares,  evidences  of 
indebtedness  or  assets  is  not  so  made  or  to  the  extent  that  any  rights  or  options  so 
distributed are not exercised, the Exercise Price, shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price, 
as the case may be, which would then be in effect based upon such shares, evidences of 
indebtedness or assets actually distributed or based upon the number of Common Shares 
(or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually delivered upon 
the exercise of such rights or options, as the case may be.
In  the  event  the  Corporation  contemplates  making  any  distribution  referred  to  in  this 
subparagraph  11.1(c),  the  Corporation  shall  give  written  notice  of  such  event  to  all 
Optionees.    The  Corporation  shall  not  make  a  distribution  under  this  subparagraph 
11.1(c)  where  the  fair  market  value  (as  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors),  of  the 
shares or rights, options or Options or evidences of indebtedness or assets so distributed 
exceeds  the  product  of  the  Market  Value  on  the  record  date  for  such  distribution 
multiplied by the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date unless 
the holders are permitted and such holders have elected, or have waived in writing or are 
deemed to have waived their right, to participate in such distribution as though and to the 
same  extent  as  if  they  had  converted  their  Options  into  Common  Shares  immediately 
prior to such distribution even though in fact they have not converted their Options. An 
Optionee  shall  be  deemed  to  have  waived  its  right  to  so  participate  under  this 
subparagraph  11.1(c)  where  such  Optionee  has  not  elected  in  writing  to  participate  by 
delivery  of  such  election  to  the  Corporation  within  fourteen  (14)  days  of  the  date  on 
which notice of the event was given by the Corporation.
11.2  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Exercise Price of the Options shall 
not  be  reduced  in  such  a  manner  that  the  difference  between  the  Exercise  Price  and  the  fair 
market value of the Common Shares (the “In the Money Value of the Options”) immediately 
after the transaction or event described in subparagraphs 11.1(b) or (c) is greater than the In the 
Money  Value  of  the  Options  immediately  before  the  transaction  or  event  described  in 
subparagraphs 11.1(b) or (c).
T-8
11.3
Subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (when the Common shares are listed on 
such exchange), no adjustments of the Exercise Price, shall be made pursuant to subparagraphs 
(b) or (c) of paragraph 11.1 if the Optionees of the Options participated or such Optionees have 
elected or have waived or are deemed to have waived their right to participate in the issue of such 
rights,  options  or  Options or  such  distribution,  as  the  case  may  be,  as  though and  to  the  same 
extent  as  if  they  had  converted  their  Options  into  Common  Shares  prior  to  the  issue  of  such 
rights, options or Options or such distribution, as the case may be.
11.4  Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, no adjustment of the Exercise Price, shall 
be made in any case in which the resulting increase or decrease in the Exercise Price would be, 
less than 1% of the then Exercise Price, but in such case any adjustment that would otherwise 
have been required then to be made shall be carried forward and made at the time of, and together 
with, the next subsequent adjustment to the Exercise Price, which (either directly or indirectly by 
setting aside the rights, options or other assets to be made available on exercise of the Options) 
together  with  any  and  all  such  adjustments  so  carried  forward,  shall  result  in  an  increase  or 
decrease in the Exercise Price, by not less than 1%.
11.5  When  any  action  is  taken  which  requires  an  increase  or  decrease  of  the  Exercise  Price,  under 
paragraph  11.1,  the  Corporation  shall  forthwith  deliver  a  copy  to  each  registered  Optionee  of 
Options, a certificate signed by any officer or director of the Corporation setting forth the details 
of the action taken and, as the case may be, the increased or decreased Exercise Price, and the 
details of the computation of the adjusted Exercise Price.
11.6  Upon the surrender of any Options for conversion, the number of full Common Shares issuable 
upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of such Options 
to  be  converted  and,  in  any  case  where  a  fraction  of  a  Common  Share  is  involved,  the 
Corporation shall adjust such fractional interest rounded to the nearest whole number of Common 
Shares.
11.7
In case of any reclassification or change (other than a change referred in subparagraph 11.1(a)) of 
the  Common  Shares  or  capital  reorganization  of  the  Corporation  other  than  as  referred  to  in 
paragraph 11.1, or in the case of any amalgamation, consolidation or merger of the Corporation 
with or into any other corporation, trust, partnership or other entity, or in the case of any sale of 
the  properties  and  assets  of  the  Corporation  as,  or  substantially  as,  an  entirety  to  any  other 
corporation,  trust,  partnership  or  other  entity,  each  Option  shall,  after  such  reclassification, 
change,  amalgamation,  consolidation,  merger  or  sale,  be  convertible  (but  not  unless  and  until 
convertible) into the number of shares or other securities or property of the Corporation, or such 
continuing, successor or purchasing corporation, trust, partnership or other entity, as the case may 
be, to which an Optionee of the number of Common Shares as would have been issued if such 
Options  had  been  converted  immediately  prior  to  such  reclassification,  change,  amalgamation, 
consolidation,  merger  or  sale  would  have  been  entitled  upon  such  reclassification,  change, 
amalgamation,  consolidation,  merger  or  sale.  Any  such  determination  shall  be  conclusive  and 
binding  on  the  Corporation  and  the  holders  of  the  Options.  No  such  reclassification,  change, 
amalgamation, consolidation, merger or sale shall be carried into effect unless, in the opinion of 
the Board of Directors, all necessary steps shall have been taken to ensure that the Optionees shall 
thereafter  be  entitled  to  receive  such  number  of  shares  or  other  securities  or  property  of  the 
Corporation, or such continuing, successor or purchasing corporation, trust, partnership or entity, 
as  the  case  may  be,  subject  to  adjustment  thereafter  in  accordance  with  provisions  similar,  as 
nearly as may be, to those contained in this Section 11.
11.8
So long as any Options remain outstanding and if the provisions of paragraph 11.1 are applicable 
to a proposed dividend, repayment of capital or other distribution the Corporation shall give to the 
Optionees at least fourteen (14) days' prior notice of the record date for such payment of any cash
T-9
dividend, stock dividend or other distribution on its Common Shares and shall give at least thirty 
(30) days' prior notice before making any above described repayment of capital on its Common 
Shares. The accidental failure or omission to give the notice required by this paragraph 11.8 or 
any  defect  therein  shall  not  affect  the  legality  or  validity  of  any  such  payment,  distribution  or 
issue.
11.9
11.10
11.11
The Corporation covenants and agrees that it shall not, during the periods of notice as aforesaid, 
close its share transfer book, other than after normal business hours, or take any other corporate 
action which might deprive an Optionee of Options from the opportunity of exercising any rights 
herein provided.
If  in  the  opinion  of  the  Board  of  Directors  the  provisions  of  this  Section  11  are  not  strictly 
applicable, or if strictly applicable would not fairly protect the rights of the Optionees, and other 
securities  of  the  Corporation  in  accordance  with  the  intent  and  purposes  hereof,  the  Board  of 
Directors  shall  make  any  adjustment  in  such  provisions  as  the  Board  of  Directors  deems 
appropriate.
In the event of any question arising with respect to the adjustments provided for in this Section 
11, such question shall be conclusively determined by such advisor selected by the Board, acting 
in  good  faith,  who  shall  have  access  to  all  necessary  records  of  the  Corporation,  and  such 
determination  shall  be  binding  upon  the  Corporation  and  the  Optionees  and  all  other  persons 
interested therein, in the event that such determination is made, the Corporation shall deliver a 
certificate to the Optionees describing the effect of such determination.
