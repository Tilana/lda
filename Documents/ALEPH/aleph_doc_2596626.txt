Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Membership Interest Purchase Agreement
On August 8, 2016, SM Energy Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into a Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Rock Oil Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the “Holdings”), pursuant to which the Company will purchase from Holdings all of the outstanding
membership interests in JPM EOC Opal, LLC (“JPM EOC Opal”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Holdings (“Rock Oil” and such membership interests, the “Rock Oil Equity”). The transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are referred to herein as the “Transactions”. The board of directors of the
Company has approved the Purchase Agreement and the Transactions.
Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase the Rock Oil Equity for $980.0 million, subject to
certain purchase price adjustments, including adjustments for certain title defects and certain environmental defects
asserted prior to September 22, 2016. Except for its remedy of a breach by Holdings of certain limited representations
and interim period covenants, the Company’s exclusive remedy for title matters and environmental matters, with
certain exceptions, will be handled through a title or environmental defect mechanism.  Following the execution of the
Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to deposit $49.0 million (the “Deposit”) into an escrow account as a
deposit to be applied against the purchase price at the closing.
Conditions to the Closing of the Transactions and Termination Rights
The completion of the Transactions is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including,
among others: (a) the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Transactions; (b) the absence
of any litigation related to the Transactions; (c) the material accuracy of the parties’ representations and warranties as
of the closing; and (d) aggregate adjustments to the purchase price due to title and environmental defects shall not
exceed 15% of the unadjusted purchase price.
The Purchase Agreement may be terminated (a) by mutual agreement of the parties; or (b) by Holdings or the
Company if the conditions to closing have not been satisfied or waived by November 11, 2016.
If the Purchase Agreement is permitted to be terminated by Holdings for any reason other than the existence of
litigation or the existence of aggregate adjustments to the purchase price in excess of 15% of the unadjusted
purchase price (an “at fault cause”), then Holdings shall be entitled to the Deposit as liquidated damages or to seek
specific performance of the Purchase Agreement.
If the Purchase Agreement is permitted to be terminated by the Company for any reason other than at fault cause,
then the Company shall be entitled to either (a) seek specific performance or (b) release and return of the Deposit and
seek damages in an amount up to the amount of the Deposit. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated for any other
reason, the Deposit will be returned to the Company.
No Talk/No Shop
Holdings has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or negotiate any proposal from any third party
2
relating to the acquisition of all or substantially all, or any meaningful portion of, Rock Oil’s assets or the Rock Oil
Equity, whether directly or indirectly, through purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise.
Other Terms of the Purchase Agreement
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this
nature. The Purchase Agreement also contains customary mutual pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of
Holdings to cause Rock Oil to own and operate the assets it owns in the regular course of business and to refrain
from taking certain actions. In addition, Holdings has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain losses, including
those related to a breach of Holdings’ representations or warranties.
The foregoing summary of the Purchase Agreement and the Transactions does not purport to be complete and is
subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Purchase Agreement, which is filed as
Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Purchase Agreement has been included to provide investors with
information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any financial or other factual information about the
Company. In particular, the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement (a) were
made only for purposes of the Purchase Agreement and as of specific dates, (b) were solely for the benefit of the
parties to the Purchase Agreement, (c) may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being
qualified by confidential disclosures, (d) were made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties
to the Purchase Agreement instead of establishing matters subject to representations and warranties as facts, and
(e) may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to
investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may
change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in
public disclosures by the Company. Accordingly, investors should read the representations and warranties in the
Agreement not in isolation but only in conjunction with the other information about the Company that is included in
reports, statements and other filings it makes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On August 3, 2016, the Company announced a company-wide reorganization effort (the “Plan”) that includes
(i) relocating certain employees in the Company’s Billings, Montana regional office to the Company’s corporate office
in Denver, Colorado or other Company offices; (ii) closing the Company’s Billings, Montana regional office; and
(iii) reducing the Company’s workforce by 47 employees. The reduction in workforce was communicated to employees
on August 3, 2016, and was generally effective immediately.  The Company expects the relocation of its employees
and the closing of its Billings, Montana regional office to be completed by November 1, 2016.
The Company adopted the Plan in an effort to reduce future costs and better position the Company for efficient growth
in response to prolonged commodity price weakness.  In connection with the Plan, the Company estimates that it will
incur an aggregate of approximately $10 million of one-time charges in the second half of 2016, comprised of
compensation, outplacement services, insurance, and relocation related expenses.  In addition to such expenses,
there is a non-cancelable lease relating to the Company’s Billings, Montana regional office space that expires in
August 2023.  Following the expected closing date of the Billings, Montana regional office, the Company expects to
be obligated to make approximately $7 million of cash lease payments through the expiration of the lease.  Although
the Company is exploring its options with respect to the remaining term of the lease, including identifying a sub-
lessee, there can be no guarantee the Company will recoup or reduce the non-cancelable future lease payments.

Item 8.01                                           Other Events
The Company discovered an error in its standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows included in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company inadvertently reported an
incorrect amount for the decrease in discounted income taxes from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015,
resulting in an approximate net $78.4 million effect to the Company’s standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows as of December 31, 2015.  This amount represents approximately 4% of the total for that disclosure.  This
error impacts the unaudited footnotes to the Company’s previously issued financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and
Exhibit 99.1 to its Form 8-K filed on February 24, 2016.
The Company assessed the impact of this error and concluded that the amount is not material to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows disclosure as of December 31, 2015, and had no impact to
5
the audited financial statements.  The corrections associated with the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows as of December 31, 2015, are reflected below and will be reflected in future filings.
