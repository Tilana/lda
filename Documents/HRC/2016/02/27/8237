<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present study, undertaken pursuant to Hunan Rights Council resolution 16/27, 
the Advisory Committee focuses on the rights of the most vulnerable people working in 
rural areas, in particular on those of smallholder farmers, landless workers, fisher-folk, 
hunters and gatherers. The Committee recommends that the Human Rights Council create a 
new special procedure to improve the promotion and protection of the rights of peasants 
and other people working in rural areas, and develop a new international human rights 
instrument on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas. The 
declaration on the rights of peasants adopted by the Advisory Committee, annexed to the 
present study, could serve as a model.

<p> <b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Hunger, like poverty, is still predominantly a rural problem, and in the rural 
population, it is those who produce food who suffer disproportionately. In a world in which 
more than enough is produced to feed the entire world population, more than 700 million 
people living in rural areas continue to suffer from hunger. Describing this situation in its 
final study on discrimination in the context of the right to food (A/HRC/16/40), the 
Advisory Committee identified peasant farmers, small landholders, landless workers, 
fisher-folk, hunters and gatherers as among the most discriminated-against and vulnerable 
groups.  
</p>
<p>2. Responding to this evidence, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 13/4, 
mandated the Advisory Committee to undertake a preliminary study on ways and means to 
further advance the rights of people working in rural areas, including women, in particular 
smallholders engaged in the production of food and/or other agricultural products, 
including from directly working the land, traditional fishing, hunting and herding activities, 
and to report thereon to the Council at its sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>3. The preliminary study was prepared by the drafting group on the right to food, 
established by the Advisory Committee at its first session and comprising Jos&#233; Bengoa 
Cabello, Chinsung Chung, Latif H&#252;seynov, Jean Ziegler and Mona Zulficar. It was adopted 
by the Advisory Committee at its sixth session and submitted to the Human Rights Council 
at its sixteenth session (A/HRC/16/63). 
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 16/27, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to collect the views and 
comments of all Member States and other stakeholders on the preliminary study so that the 
Advisory Committee may take them into account in the preparation of the final study, to be 
presented to the Council at its nineteenth session. A note verbale was sent by OHCHR on 6 
April 2011 to all permanent missions to the United Nations Office at Geneva and to other 
stakeholders. Ecuador, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and CETIM sent their 
views and comments on the preliminary study. 
</p>
<p>5. Other States, including South Africa, Ghana, Indonesia and Cuba, as well as the 
European Union and the African Group, and other stakeholders, including the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, La Via Campesina, FIAN 
International, the Foundation Danielle Miterrand France Libert&#233;s, the Mouvement contre le 
Racisme et pour l&#8217;Amiti&#233; entre les Peuples (MRAP) and the Centre for Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Peace Advocacy, gave their views and comments during the sixteenth session of the Human 
Rights Council, when the work of the Advisory Committee was presented on 15 March 
2011, or at the side event on &#8220;The need of increased protection of human rights of peasants&#8221; 
held on 9 March 2011. 
</p>
<p>6. During the seventh session of the Advisory Committee, Jean Ziegler, on behalf of 
the working group on the right to food, presented an update on the preliminary study in 
which the views and comments of States and other stakeholders where presented, together 
with the last developments on the issue and proposals to be included in the final study 
(A/HRC/AC/7/CRP.1). This gave States and other stakeholders another opportunity to give 
their views and comments on the preliminary study. </p>


<p>7. These views and comments were all taken into account in the drafting of this final 
study.1 The great majority of them supported the main conclusions and recommendations of 
the preliminary study of the Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p>8. At its eighth session, the Advisory Committee considered and approved the present 
study, to be submitted to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Identification of vulnerable groups working in rural areas 
that are subject to discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of the situation of peasants and other people working in rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas 
</b></p>
<p>9. The United Nations Millennium Development Project Task Force on Hunger has 
shown that 80 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry live in rural areas.2 Of the 1 billion people 
who suffer from extreme poverty in the world, 75 per cent live and work in rural areas.3<b> 
</b>This situation was compounded by the global food crisis of 2008 and 2009. Today, 50 per 
cent of the world&#8217;s hungry are smallholder farmers who depend mainly or partly on 
</p>
<p>agriculture for their livelihoods. Some 20 per cent of those suffering from hunger are 
landless families who survive as tenant farmers or poorly paid agricultural labourers who 
often have to migrate from one insecure, informal job to another. And 10 per cent of the 
world&#8217;s hungry live from traditional fishing, hunting and herding activities in rural 
communities. As much as 70 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry are women and a great 
majority of them work in agriculture. 
</p>
<p>10. In the present study, the Advisory Committee focuses on the rights of the most 
vulnerable people working in rural areas, in particular on those of smallholder farmers, 
landless workers, fisher-folk, hunters and gatherers. The Committee does not focus on the 
rights of other people working in rural areas, such as those working in the business industry 
or public administration. In other studies requested by the Human Rights Council in its  
resolution 16/27, the Advisory Committee will look at the rights of rural women and the 
urban poor. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Smallholder farmers 
</b></p>
<p>11. Around 50 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry live on small plots of land and produce 
crops for subsistence and/or sale on local markets. Most of them cannot produce enough to 
feed themselves, essentially because they do not have sufficient access to productive 
resources such as land, water and seeds. Two thirds of smallholder farmers live on remote 
and marginal lands in environmentally difficult conditions, such as in mountainous areas or 
areas threatened by drought and other natural disasters, while good, fertile land tends to be 
concentrated in the hands of wealthier landowners. 
</p>

<p>12. In Guatemala, for example, most of the fertile lands of central Guatemala are part of 
huge plantations, while the majority of smallholder farmers and indigenous people are left 
to cultivate the steep slopes of the country&#8217;s mountainous regions.4 Hunger and 
malnutrition levels in Guatemala have been found to be closely linked to the quantity of 
land held; children of families possessing less than two <i>manzanas</i>5 of land being 3.2 times 
more likely to be malnourished than families possessing more than five <i>manzanas</i>.6 Poor 
subsistence farmers lack access to sufficient, good-quality land and survive on <i>microfincas</i> 
(smallholdings) of less than one hectare of unproductive land, although they really need 25 
hectares of fertile land to feed their families adequately. As a consequence of extreme 
inequality in access to land, indigenous people and poor peasant farmers or agricultural 
workers living in rural areas account for the large majority of the hungry and malnourished 
(A/HRC/13/33/Add.4, para. 11). 
</p>
<p>13. The situation is similar in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (A/HRC/7/5/Add.2, para. 
14). In the west, the poor and hungry are mostly indigenous people, living in rural areas and 
struggling to survive from small-scale and subsistence farming on the cold, windy plateau 
of the <i>altiplano</i>. Most people have very small landholdings, barely large enough for 
subsistence. Most agricultural work is done by hand with little access to machinery even to 
plough the fields, and there has been little investment in irrigation and other infrastructure 
that would allow increased production. This has resulted in very high levels of malnutrition, 
especially micronutrient malnutrition, among <i>altiplano</i> families because their diet is 
inadequate.7 
</p>
<p>14. In Ethiopia, chronic food insecurity persists in the country, which is predominantly 
agrarian, and poverty is significantly higher in rural areas than in urban areas.8 Agriculture 
is still predominantly rain-dependent and only 3 per cent of irrigable land is irrigated, 
contributing to a high vulnerability to drought.9 Many Ethiopian farmers do not produce 
enough even for their own subsistence. Two thirds of households farm on less than 0.5 
hectares, insufficient to support a family, and these holdings are becoming smaller and 
smaller owing to the fast rate of population growth.10 The poorest and most destitute are 
now mainly dependent on wage labour in other people&#8217;s fields. With few opportunities for 
</p>
<p>wage labour or opportunities for off-farm employment to earn income, many people simply 
do not get enough to eat. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Landless people working as tenant farmers or agricultural labourers 
</b></p>
<p>15. Approximately 20 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry are landless. Most work as tenant 
farmers or agricultural labourers. Tenant farmers usually have to pay high rents and have 
little security of possession from season to season. Agricultural labourers usually work for 
extremely low wages that are insufficient to feed their families, and often have to migrate 
from one insecure, informal job to another.11

<p>16. In Bangladesh, for example, more than two thirds of rural people are now landless12 
(owning less than 0.2 hectares) and landlessness is increasing rapidly owing to demography 
and inheritance laws that divide holdings into ever smaller plots, but also to land-grabbing 
by powerful people.13 Many of the landless work as agricultural labourers, often for pitiful 
wages, and the rest are sharecroppers who work the land of absentee landlords in 
exploitative relationships in which 50 per cent of the crop must be passed back to the 
landlord. Seasonal crises of hunger are still experienced in the northern, more arid regions 
of Bangladesh, particularly during the <i>monga</i>, the lean season between crops, when no 
agricultural work is available for landless labourers. Increasing landlessness is contributing 
to migration to urban areas in search of work, forcing many people to live in the terrible 
conditions of the slums of Dhaka. 
</p>
<p>17. In India, the hungry and malnourished are primarily children, women and men living 
in rural areas and dependent on agriculture, working as casual workers but also as 
sharecroppers and tenant or marginal farmers with less than one hectare of land.14 
Agricultural wages are very low and increasingly precarious, the payment of minimum 
wages is always enforced, and many people lack work during the agricultural lean season. 
In some States, feudalistic patterns of land ownership persist, despite legal abolition and the 
official Land Ceilings Act that aimed to limit land concentration.15 Scheduled castes and 
tribes suffer most from hunger and malnutrition in India; they make up 25 per cent of the 
rural population but 42 per cent of the poor.16 This is largely due to discrimination, as many 
are expected to work as agricultural labourers without being paid, and many are held in 
debt bondage by their higher-caste employers.  
</p>
<p><b> D. People living from traditional fishing, hunting and herding activities 
</b></p>
<p>18. Around 10 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry subsist through fishing, hunting and 
herding activities. In many countries, the traditional way of life of these people and their 
means of livelihood are threatened by competition over productive resources, leading to 
increasing hunger and malnutrition.  
</p>
<p>19. There are two types of fish production: fish captured in the wild from the sea or 
inland waters (capture fisheries) and fish farmed in the sea or inland waters (aquaculture). 
Both types are driven to industrialization, privatization and export orientation, which end 
up depriving local people of their traditional rights of access to fishing resources.17 In 
agreements with Argentina and Senegal for example, the European Union managed to 
obtain fishing rights for endangered or locally used species, thereby threatening the food 
security of thousands of local fishing communities.18 Fish farming is mostly located in 
developing countries (84 per cent of global production is in low-income food deficit

<p>countries), particularly in China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, and it is frequently 
promoted on the promise that it will relieve pressure on wild fish stocks, improve food 
security and provide livelihoods for the poor. Fish farming does not, however, 
automatically relieve exploitation of marine stocks, given that many farmed fish are, 
paradoxically, fed with marine fish.19 Indeed, in most cases, fish farming has a negative 
impact on access to food for traditional fishing communities.20 
</p>
<p>20. In many parts of the world, people subsisting on hunting activities in forest and hill 
areas are also increasingly marginalized. Many have lost their access to traditional forest 
livelihoods and food resources following the creation of forest reserves or because of 
development projects such as dams, power plants, coalmines and mineral industries. Many 
remain without access to food or to Government services. In India, for example, where non-
governmental organizations and academics estimate that dam projects alone have displaced 
up to 30 million people in the last decades,21 between 40 and 50 per cent of the displaced 
are tribal people, most of them living from hunting activities in forest and hill areas, even 
though they make up only 8 per cent of the population. 
</p>
<p>21. In many countries, conflicts are also increasing between pastoralists and crop 
farmers, since farmers tend their own small animals and are less eager to allow pastoralists 
to graze their herds in the fields after harvest. In Ethiopia, for example, pastoral livelihoods 
are becoming increasingly vulnerable; pastoralists are affected by the lack of water, land 
degradation and competition with agriculturalists, and poverty has been compounded by the 
collapse of the export market for livestock to Arab nations following an outbreak of Rift 
Valley fever. In the Niger, these issues are addressed in the <i>code rural</i>, which set out clear 
rules for access to resources and sets up clearly marked corridors and areas of pasture in 
order to minimize conflict.22 The means to implement the <i>code rural</i> are, however, sorely 
lacking and criticism of the bias towards agriculture in it has given rise to calls for a new 
<i>code pastoral</i> that focuses more attention on the different and very specific problems of 
nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists.23  
</p>
<p><b> E. Peasant women 
</b></p>
<p>22. Women play a crucial role in the food security of households, producing between 60 
and 80 per cent of food crops in developing countries and earning incomes to feed their 
families.24 In sub-Saharan Africa, women are estimated to contribute up to 80 per cent of 
labour for food production; Asian women produce 50 per cent of food products. South 
Asian women play a decisive role in rice production, mostly in informal labour schemes. 
Although agricultural production in Latin America has recently declined, women continue 
to contribute to approximately 40 per cent of the internal market's agricultural supply.

<p>Women, however, account for 70 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry and are disproportionately 
affected by malnutrition, poverty and food insecurity. Globally, women cultivate more than 
50 per cent of all food grown, yet they rarely receive any recognition for their work. Indeed, 
many are not even paid. 
</p>
<p>23. Peasant women in particular often face discrimination in gaining secure access to 
and control over other productive resources, such as land, water and credit, because they are 
often not recognized as producers or juridical equals. In understanding the problems faced 
by peasants and the discrimination they suffer, it is especially important to note the special 
situation faced by women peasants. While the proportion of women heads of rural 
household continues to grow (more than 30 per cent in some developing countries), less 
than 2 per cent of all land is owned by women.25 Customs and traditions in many parts of 
the world limit women&#8217;s equal access to productive resources. In some countries, 
</p>
<p>discrimination is still codified in national laws; in others, it is part of customary law (see 
part III.B. below). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Causes of discrimination and vulnerability of peasants and 
other people working in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>24. The main causes of discrimination and vulnerability of peasants and other people 
working in rural areas are closely linked to human rights violations: (a) expropriation of 
land, forced evictions and displacement; (b) gender discrimination; (c) the absence of 
agrarian reform and rural development policies; (d) the lack of minimum wages and social 
protection; and (e) the criminalization of movements defending the rights of people 
working in rural areas. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Expropriation of land, forced evictions and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>25. From 1995 to 2005, Foodfirst Information and Action Network International worked 
on more than 100 cases of violations of the right to food, and concluded that the majority of 
them were related to expropriation of land, forced evictions and displacements.26 Most 
urgent appeals made by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food are also based on 
allegations of expropriation of land, forced evictions and forced displacements.27 The recent 
phenomenon of global &#8220;land-grab&#8221; has added another dimension to these concerns as 
Governments and companies seek to buy and lease large tracts of productive land in other 
countries, for food to be exported back to their countries or to grow biofuels to fill the 
petrol tanks of those in the global North (see A/HRC/13/33/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>26.  In June 2011, the Oakland Institute released a collection of new reports examining 
the consequences of the &#8220;land grab&#8221; on rural communities in several African countries, 
including Ethiopia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania and 
South Sudan.28 Among others, the Oakland Institute describes the land deals of the Addax

to make room for export commodities, including biofuels and cut flowers&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>27. The phenomenon of the global &#8220;land grab&#8221; and its consequences were among the 
main issues discussed at the World Social Forum in Dakar in February 2011. During the 
World Social Forum, La Via Campesina and the West African Network of Peasants and 
Agricultural Producers (ROPPA), with the support of other organizations, including FIAN 
International, facilitated the adoption of the Dakar Appeal Against the Land Grab.30 By 
signing the Dakar Appeal between February and June 2011, more than 500 civil society 
organizations have recalled that &#8220;recent massive land grabs targeting tens of millions of 
acres for the benefit of private interests or third States &#8211; whether for reasons of food, 
energy, mining, environment, tourism, speculation or geopolitics &#8211; violate human rights by 
depriving local, indigenous, peasant, pastoralist and fisher communities of their livelihoods, 
by restricting their access to natural resources or by removing their freedom to produce as 
they wish, and exacerbate the inequalities of women in access and control of land&#8221;. They 
have also called on Governments to immediately cease all massive land grabs, current or 
future, and return the plundered land, and they have asked &#8220;states, regional organizations 
and international institutions (to) guarantee people's right to land and support family 
farming and agro-ecology&#8221;.31 
</p>
<p>28. The Dakar Appeal Against the Land Grab was sent to the participants of the meeting 
of G-20 Agricultural Ministers, which took place in Paris on 23 June 2011. But the appeal 
of civil society organizations was not heard. In response to the positions taken by the G-20 
Ministers of Agriculture at this meeting, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier 
De Schutter, regretted that the G-20 Ministers of Agriculture took no decision to stop 
incentives and subsidies for biofuels production and found &#8220;troubling that biofuels are 
</p>
<p>mentioned as a source of rural development, when in practice, up to now at least, the 
production of biofuels primarily benefits large agro-export companies and use the natural 
resources from the South to feed the thirst for renewable energies in the North&#8221;.32 
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>29. Women living and working in rural areas often face discrimination in their access to 
and control over other productive resources, such as land, water and credit. In many 
countries, they suffer multiple discrimination: because they are women, poor, rural 
residents and indigenous, and rarely own land or other assets. De jure discrimination 
against women remains for example institutionalized in Guatemala, where article 139 of the 
Labour Code describes rural women as &#8220;helpers&#8221; of male agricultural workers rather than

<p>as workers entitled to receive their own salary. As a consequence, it is reported that many 
landowners do not even pay women for their work, since they are considered &#8220;helpers&#8221; of 
their husbands.33 
</p>
<p>30. Family law (which restricts a married women's capacity to inherit equally) and 
succession law (which has been shown to restrict women's inheritance rights) have been 
regarded as the two sets of laws with practices that have discriminatory effects in excluding 
women from claiming land rights. In many countries, discrimination persists in customary 
laws, despite strong constitutional and legislative frameworks. In Bangladesh, for example, 
women are guaranteed equality by the law, but existing social values, reinforced by 
religion, permit discrimination against them. Under Islamic law, a daughter has the right to 
only half the land inheritance to which her brother is entitled, while the brother is obliged to 
financially maintain his sister (although this obligation is often not observed). The Hindu 
tradition accords no land to women in inheritance custom. As a result of discrimination, 
malnutrition levels show a marked gender disparity, with women most profoundly affected 
in rural areas.34 
</p>
<p><b> C. Absence of agrarian reform and rural development policies, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>irrigation and seeds 
</b></p>
<p>31. To protect the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, more 
attention needs to be paid to agrarian reforms that benefit landless peasants and small-scale 
land holders and promote security of tenure and access to land.35 Agrarian reforms are 
successful when land reform radically reduces inequalities in land distribution and is 
accompanied by sufficient access to other inputs, including water, credit, transport, 
extension services and other infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>32. While the &#8220;death&#8221; of agrarian reform was proclaimed in the 1970s, and few efforts 
were made to conduct land reform programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s, land reform 
returned to the international agenda in 1996. In the Rome Declaration on World Food 
Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, land reform was a key part of States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>commitments.36 In the Declaration of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and 
Rural Development, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO) and the Government of Brazil in March 2006, 95 States recognized the 
importance of establishing appropriate land reform to secure access to land for 
marginalized and vulnerable groups, and of adopting adequate legal frameworks and 
policies to promote traditional and family agriculture.37 
</p>
<p>33. Land reforms in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China, China and 
Cuba have had a significant impact on reducing poverty and hunger and increasing 
economic growth. In India, the states with the steepest declines in poverty from 1958 to 
1992 were those that implemented land reform.38 More recently, the move towards

<p>transformative and redistributive agrarian reform has been successfully chosen by the 
Government of Bolivia (Plurinational State of). 
</p>
<p>34. Well-formulated rural development policies are also essential to fulfil the rights of 
people working in rural areas. In the past three decades, however, support for agriculture 
has dramatically decreased. Many indebted developing countries have been forced to 
reduce their support for small farmers and liberalize their agriculture, under strong pressure 
from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the same time, between 
1980 and 2004, the percentage of official development aid directed to agriculture dropped 
from 13 per cent to 3.4 per cent, or from $2.63 billion to $1.9 billion.39<b> </b>This situation 
resulted in the unprecedented neglect of State policies in favour of small-scale agriculture, 
with detrimental effects on peasants in almost all developing countries, and led to the world 
food crisis of 2008.40 
</p>
<p>35. The failure of States to harness water resources for both irrigation and drinking 
water (for people and livestock) is another key factor explaining the vulnerability of people 
working in rural areas. In Ethiopia and the Niger, for instance, 3 and 10 per cent of 
agricultural cultivation is irrigated, respectively. Although water resources are available in 
these countries, these have been little exploited, owing to the severe shortage of financial 
resources to invest in irrigation, which has high costs, particularly for works on a large 
scale. There have been some impressive although limited efforts at promoting small-scale 
irrigation and providing wells in some villages. 
</p>
<p>36. Together with land and water, peasants need seeds to secure their work and ensure 
food security. According to the International Convention for the Protection of New 
Varieties of Plants, they are free to use their traditional seeds for replanting, selling or 
exchange. At the second World Seed Conference hosted by FAO in September 2009, 
participants stressed the importance of protecting access to seeds in agriculture. However, 
this freedom is now threatened by a few transnational corporations that control the seed 
market and their patents on improved or genetically modified seeds.41 A third of the entire 
global seed market is in the hands of just 10 corporations, including Aventis, Monsanto, 
Pioneer and Syngenta. Monsanto alone controls 90 per cent of the global market in 
genetically modified seeds. 
</p>
<p>37. Every year, thousands of peasants commit suicide because they can no longer afford 
the seeds that they need to feed their families. In India alone, it is estimated that 200,000 
peasants have committed suicide since 1997, largely because they had become dependant 
on seeds supplied by transnational corporations and had amassed debts that they could not 
repay.42 
</p>
<p><b> D. Lack of a minimum wage and social protection 
</b></p>
<p>38. As discussed above, landless people who work in rural areas are significantly 
affected by the lack of social protection nets and of policies stipulating a minimum wage.

<p>Agricultural labourers work for extremely low wages, which are insufficient to feed their 
families. Moreover, these wages have no long-term security and labourers are forced to 
migrate from one insecure and informal job to another.43 
</p>
<p>39. In Guatemala, for example, permanent workers on the <i>fincas</i>, often tied into a 
<i>colono</i> system (under which landowners provide subsistence plots in exchange for labour), 
work for extremely low wages (A/HRC/13/33/Add.4, paras. 27&#8211;30). Landowners often 
avoid paying legal entitlements by dismissing workers repeatedly to keep them on non-
permanent contract status,44 and often dismiss workers who negotiate for better 
conditions.45 Church organizations, such as that led by &#193;lvaro Ramazzini, Bishop of San 
Marcos, help families to survive by providing food donations and help workers to bring 
cases to local courts, although workers rarely win, and even when they do, legal orders are 
reportedly rarely enforced. 
</p>
<p>40. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, despite impressive efforts by the new 
Government, many agricultural workers on large estates still work in feudal conditions of 
semi-slavery or debt-bondage. Forced labour, including situations of debt bondage, is still 
practised by the private sector, including the sugar cane industry, the Brazil nut industry 
and on private ranches (<i>haciendas</i>) in the region of the Chaco.46 Of particular concern is the 
situation of forced labour that the Guaran&#237; people have to endure on some private ranches in 
the provinces of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca and Tarija, in the Chaco region. Since they are 
paid extremely low wages that do not cover their basic living costs, they are forced to rely 
on credit from their employers. In addition, women and children are expected to work, but 
are not paid at all. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Repression and criminalization of movements protecting the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people working in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>41. People working in rural areas, and in particular peasants, have always organized 
themselves to fight discrimination and exploitation, beginning at the local level and 
growing to form national movements. In Canada, for example, provincial farmers&#8217; unions 
long worked in their respective provinces to protect family farming against the 
industrialization of agriculture, until they merged in 1969 to create the National Farmers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Union. In Brazil, the Landless Worker&#8217;s Movement emerged in 1984 out of frustration at 
the extreme concentration of land in the hands of rich landowners (<i>latifundios</i>), the practice 
of <i>grillagem </i>(land-grabbing) and the ongoing modernization and liberalization of 
agriculture. Hundred of organizations did the same, until, in 1993, they created the 
international movement of peasants, La Via Campesina, to protect their rights and promote 
agricultural policies and land reforms in favour of small farmers.47 
</p>
<p>42. Since 2001, when La Via Campesina began to monitor the human rights situation of 
peasants worldwide, it became obvious that, in many countries, when peasants organize

<p>themselves to claim their rights, they are often treated as criminals, arbitrarily arrested or 
detained, or become the victims of torture or summary executions by the State or private 
police forces.48 In 2007, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human 
rights defenders concluded that peasant group leaders were often criminalized, and that the 
second most vulnerable group when it came to the danger of being killed for their activities 
in the defence of human rights were defenders working on land rights and natural resources 
(A/HRC/4/37, paras. 45&#8211;47). In the Philippines, for example, three peasant leaders were 
murdered between November 2008 and June 2009: Vicente Paglinawan, Vice President of 
the National Coordination of peasant groups for the island of Mindanao; Eliezer Billanes, 
secretary-general of a peasants&#8217; union; and Renato Penas, Vice President of the National 
Coalition of Peasant Organizations.49 On 17 April each year, La Via Campesina 
commemorates the 1996 massacre of 19 landless peasants at Eldorado do Carajas (Brazil). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Protection of the rights of peasants and other people working 
in rural areas under international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>43. The rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas are not subject to any 
specific protection under international law. Like all human beings, however, these people 
benefit from the protection of the international human rights instruments.50 In particular, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights offer significant protection to the rights of peasants 
and other people working in rural areas. Women living in rural areas and indigenous people 
also benefit from the protection granted by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> A. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>44. Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights protecting (a) the right to food, (b) the right to adequate housing, (c) the 
right to health, (d) the rights to water and sanitation and (e) the right to education are the 
most relevant with regard to the protection they offer for the rights of peasants and other 
people working in rural areas. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Right to food  
</b></p>
<p>45. The right to food was proclaimed in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and enshrined in article 11 of the Covenant. It has been interpreted as the 
right of all people to &#8220;be able to feed themselves, by their own means, with dignity&#8221;. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its general comment No. 12 (1999), 
stated that the right to adequate food is realized when every man, woman and child, alone 
or in community with others, has physical and economic access at all times to adequate 
food or means for its procurement (para. 6).

Peasants&#8221; in A. Paasch and S. Murphy, <i>The Global Food Challenge. Towards a Human Rights 
Approach to Trade and Investment Policies</i>, 2009, pp. 102&#8211;111.  </p>


<p>46. According to the Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food, adopted unanimously 
by the States Members of FAO in November 2004, the right to food protects the right of 
people working in rural areas to have access to productive resources or the means of 
production, including land, water, seeds, microcredit, forests, fish and livestock (Guideline 
8). According to the same guidelines, States should pursue inclusive, non-discriminatory 
and sound economic, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, land use and, as appropriate, land 
reform policies, all of which would permit farmers, fishers, foresters and other food 
producers, particularly women, to earn a fair return from their labour, capital and 
management, and encourage conservation and sustainable management of natural 
resources, including in marginal areas (Guideline 2.5). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>47. The right to adequate housing was proclaimed in article 25 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and enshrined in article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. According to the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, it should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense that equates 
it with, for example, the shelter provided by merely having a roof over one's head; rather, it 
should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity.51 The right to 
adequate housing has been defined as the right of every woman, man, youth and child to 
gain and sustain a secure home and community in which to live in peace and dignity.52 
</p>
<p>48. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, every person, 
including those working in rural areas, has a right to housing, which guarantees at all times 
the minimum conditions of legal security of tenure, including protection against forced 
eviction; availability of essential services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation; affordability, including for the poorest, 
through housing subsidies, protection against unreasonable rent levels or rent increases; 
habitability, including protection from cold, damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to 
health; accessibility for disadvantaged groups, including the elderly, children, the 
physically disabled and victims of natural disasters; and a suitable location, far from 
sources of pollution while close to schools and health-care services.53  
</p>
<p>49. The Committee also emphasized that States parties are under an obligation to put an 
end to forced evictions, defined as &#8220;the permanent or temporary removal against their will 
</p>
<p>of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, 
without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection&#8221;.54 
These forced evictions are prima facie incompatible with the States&#8217; obligations under the 
Covenant; notwithstanding the type of tenure, all persons should possess a degree of 
security of tenure that guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and 
other threats.77  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p>50. The right to health was proclaimed in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and recognized in article 12 of the Covenant, where it is defined as the right 
to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health conducive to living a life in dignity. The 
right to health includes the provision of adequate health care, but also the underlying

<p>determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an 
adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and 
environmental conditions, and access to health-related education and information, including 
on sexual and reproductive health.55 
</p>
<p>51. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, States parties 
to the Covenant must ensure that medical services and the underlying determinants of 
health are available to all, including people working in rural areas. Furthermore, States have 
a minimum core obligation to ensure, as a minimum and at all times, the right of access to 
health facilities, goods and services on a non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable 
or marginalized groups; access to the minimum essential food that is nutritionally adequate 
and safe to ensure freedom from hunger to everyone; and access to basic shelter, housing 
and sanitation, and an adequate supply of safe drinking water.56 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Rights to water and sanitation  
</b></p>
<p>52. The human rights to water and sanitation have witnessed a remarkable development 
in the past years.57 The recognition by States that the rights have a self-standing legal 
meaning is explained by their centrality for enjoying a dignified life; they are also a 
precondition for the realization of most other human rights of the two Covenants.58 The 
rights to water and sanitation contain freedoms and entitlements, including the right to be 
free from arbitrary disconnections or contamination of water supplies, and the right to a 
system of water supply and to sanitation facilities that are available, of good quality, 
affordable and physically accessible, non-discriminatory and culturally and gender 
acceptable.59  
</p>
<p>53. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Special Rapporteur on the human 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation have stressed that States have the obligation to 
progressively extend access to water and safe sanitation services with priority to vulnerable 
groups from rural and deprived urban areas with a particular focus on the needs of women 
and children. 60 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>54. Stipulated in article 26 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the right to 
education is equally guaranteed under article 13 of the Covenant. Primary education shall 
be compulsory and free for all, secondary and higher education (the latter on basis of 
capacity) shall be made accessible to all by the progressive introduction of free education. 
The right to receive education is underpinned by the best interests of the student as primary 
consideration and a number of substantive feature: educational institutions and programmes 
have to be available in sufficient number in urban, as well as rural areas; they have to be 
physically and economically accessible without discrimination; the form and substance of

<p>education have to be acceptable in terms of relevance, cultural appropriateness and of good 
quality; and adaptable and responsive to the needs of changing societies and communities.61 
</p>
<p>55. As the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasizes, in addition 
to being a human right, &#8220;education is the primary vehicle by which economically and 
socially marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty and obtain the 
means to participate fully in their communities&#8221;.62 As an empowerment right thus, the right 
to education is of major relevance for marginalized and discriminated people working in the 
rural area. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>56. The human rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights offer protection to peasants and other people working in rural areas. Of these, the 
most important are the right to life, the right to be free from arbitrary detention, the right to 
a fair trial and the freedoms of expression and association.  
</p>
<p>57. The Human Rights Committee underlined the fundamental importance of the right to 
life in its general comment No. 6, in which it stated that the protection against arbitrary 
deprivation of life, which is explicitly required by the third sentence of article 6 (1), is of 
paramount importance. The Committee considered that States parties should take measures 
not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal acts, but also to prevent 
arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of life by the authorities of 
the State is a matter of the utmost gravity.  
</p>
<p>58. Under the Covenant, peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right 
to be free from arbitrary detention and to a fair trial (arts. 9 and 14). Anyone deprived of his 
or her liberty has the right to be treated humanely (art. 10) and everyone has the right to 
free expression and association, the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of 
his or her interests and the right to peaceful assembly (arts. 19, 21 and 22). Arbitrary arrests 
and detentions and extrajudicial executions of peasant leaders are serious violations of the 
Covenant, as are infringements on their freedoms of expression and association and on the 
right to peaceful assembly by peasant movements.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Rights of women living in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>59. One of the main aims of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women is to put an end to discrimination against women living in 
rural areas. Article 14 of the Convention specifically protects the rights of women living in 
rural areas against discrimination in access to productive resources, including land, and in 
their access to work, adequate housing and programmes for social security, health, training 
and education. It also stipulates that States parties should take appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination against women in rural areas and to ensure their rights to organize 
self-help groups and cooperatives in order to obtain equal access to economic opportunities 
through employment or self-employment, to have access to agricultural credit and loans, 
marketing facilities, appropriate technology and equal treatment in land and agrarian 
reform, as well as in land resettlement schemes, and to enjoy adequate living conditions, 
particularly in relation to housing, sanitation, electricity and water supply, transport and 
communications.

 62 Ibid, para 1.  </p>


<p>60. In several of its concluding comments, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women has stated that women in rural areas should be given 
priority in development programmes and that the State parties should protect women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>access to land against the activities of private business and against forced evictions. For 
example, in its concluding comments on India in 2007, it urged the State party to study the 
impact of mega-projects on tribal and rural women and to institute safeguards against their 
displacement and violation of their human rights. It also urged it to ensure that surplus land 
given to displaced rural and tribal women was cultivable, and recommended that efforts 
should be made to ensure that tribal and rural women have individual rights to inherit and 
own land and property.63 
</p>
<p><b> D. Rights of indigenous people 
</b></p>
<p>61. The main international Convention protecting the rights of indigenous people is the 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), ratified by 20 States. The Convention protects a large number of rights 
for indigenous people working in rural areas. In particular, articles 13 to 17 recognize the 
rights of indigenous people to their land and territories and their right to participate in the 
use, management and conservation of those resources. It also enshrines the right of 
indigenous peoples to participation and consultation regarding all uses of resources on their 
lands, and the prohibition of their eviction from their lands and territories.  
</p>
<p>62. To complement ILO Convention No. 169, the General Assembly adopted the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in December 2008. The 
Declaration recognizes that indigenous people, both individually and collectively, have the 
right to the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental liberties recognized in the 
Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in 
international human rights law. It then goes beyond the ILO Convention in recognizing that 
indigenous people also have the rights to self-determination, land and territory. It refers to 
the injustices endured as a result of colonialism and highlights the threat that globalization 
currently poses. It also recognizes the importance of traditional knowledge, biodiversity and 
the safeguarding of genetic resources. It limits the activities that third parties can carry out 
on the lands belonging to indigenous communities. The fact that the Declaration has 
already been incorporated into domestic law in some countries, such as the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia and Ecuador, represents a step forward.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Ways and means to advance the rights of peasants and other 
people working in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>63. Despite the existing human rights framework, peasants and other people working in 
rural areas are victims of multiple human rights violations that lead to their extreme 
vulnerability to hunger and poverty. To overcome this situation and further advance their 
rights, there is a need (a) to better implement existing international norms, (b) to address the 
normative gaps under international human rights law, and (c) to elaborate a new legal 
instrument on the rights of people working in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>  
 63 CEDAW/C/IND/CO/3, para. 47.  </p>


<p><b> A. Implementation of existing international norms  
</b></p>
<p>64. States should improve the protection of the rights of peasants and other people 
working in rural areas by implementing existing international norms at the domestic level, 
preferably through their recognition in national Constitutions. They should also adopt new 
laws to advance the protection of these rights, with the full participation of the most 
vulnerable and discriminated groups working in rural areas. In adopting these laws, States 
should follow the recommendation of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, which stated in paragraph 8 of its general comment No. 20 that the elimination of 
discrimination in practice requires paying sufficient attention to groups of individuals that 
suffer historical or persistent prejudice instead of merely comparing the formal treatment of 
individuals in similar situations. States parties must therefore immediately take the 
necessary measures to prevent, diminish and eliminate the conditions and attitudes that 
cause or perpetuate substantive or de facto discrimination. 
</p>
<p>65. In the event of human rights violations, victims could make better use of existing 
national, regional and international monitoring mechanisms, possibly with the support of 
national and international non-governmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions. Regional and national monitoring mechanisms have already proven to be very 
useful for the implementation of the rights of people working in rural areas.64 New 
international instruments, such as the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the General Assembly in December 2008, 
will offer new possibilities for access to justice at the international level. And the Human 
Rights Council should consider creating a new special procedure to improve the promotion 
and protection of the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>66. Better use should also be made of soft-law instruments that improve the visibility of 
existing human rights norms protecting the rights of peasants and other people living in 
rural areas. In 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
discrimination in this context, developed a set of basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement to fill in operational gaps in relation to 
forced evictions (A/HRC/4/18, annex I). The objective of the principles and guidelines was 
to offer a step-by-step approach that States could follow to ensure that the necessary 
displacements and evictions due to development are conducted in compliance with existing 
human rights law. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food developed a set of 
core principles and measures to address the human rights challenge to set criteria to be 
followed by States and companies in order to respect existing human rights law when 
buying or leasing land in other countries (A/HRC/13/33/Add.2, annex). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Addressing normative gaps under international human rights law  
</b></p>
<p>67. Existing international human rights instruments, even if they were better 
implemented, remain insufficient to protect fully the rights of peasants and other people 
working in rural areas. These groups have suffered historic and persistent discrimination in 
many countries around the globe, and the existing protection of their rights is insufficient to 
overcome this situation. It is therefore necessary to go beyond existing norms and address 
the normative gaps under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>  
 64 Christophe Golay, <i>The Right to Food and Access to Justice: Examples at the national, regional and 
</i></p>
<p><i>international levels</i> (Rome, FAO, 2009).  </p>


<p>68. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council in 2007, the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to adequate housing recommended that the Council should recognize the right 
to land in international human rights law (A/HRC/4/18, para. 33 (e)). The Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food, in his report presented to the General Assembly in October 
2010, recommended that international human rights bodies should consolidate the right to 
land (A/65/281, para. 43 (d)). The current process of elaborating voluntary guidelines on 
responsible governance of tenure of land and other natural resources at FAO is also 
intended to address the same gap. These recommendations and initiatives should be 
supported. 
</p>
<p><b> C. New legal instrument on the rights of peasants and other people 
</b></p>
<p><b>working in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>69. The above measures represent important ways and means to further advance the 
rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas. But they will not be sufficient. 
The fact that the great majority of peasants and other people working in rural areas are 
engaged in the informal sector, and are therefore not covered by ILO Conventions, is of 
particular concern, as is the fact that their need to have a secured access to productive 
resources, including land, seeds, small-scale irrigation, fishing grounds or forests, is not 
recognized explicitly in any international human rights instruments. There is therefore a 
need for a new international instrument on the rights of peasants and other people working 
in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>70. At the side-event on &#8220;The need of increased protection of human rights of peasants&#8221; 
organized on 9 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food identified four 
main reasons for adopting a new international human rights instrument on the rights of 
peasants and other people working in rural areas: it is needed in international law; it will 
improve the fight against hunger; it is a means of protecting small-scale, family-owned 
farms from the pressure of large, agro-industrial farms; and it will increase access to the 
means of production in rural areas. The Special Rapporteur also underlined that the 
adoption of a declaration on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas 
would increase visibility on the rights that are already recognized in international law, and 
help to recognize new rights, such as the rights to land, to seeds and to compensation for the 
losses due to food subsidies given to farmers in other countries. 
</p>
<p>71. In June 2008, after more than seven years of consultation with the organizations of 
its members, La Via Campesina adopted its Declaration of the Rights of Peasants &#8211; Men 
and Women (A/HRC/13/32, annex). It presented the Declaration as a response to the world 
food crisis at the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly in 2009.65 The 
Declaration offers an interesting basis for the recognition of the rights of peasants and other 
people working in rural areas, elaborated by an organization that brings together 148 
organizations in 69 countries and is estimated to represent more than 200 millions peasants, 
smallholder farmers, agricultural workers, indigenous people, peasant women and landless 
people worldwide. Fisher communities have expressed the same vision in seminars in 
different continents in 2010.66 The different groups working in rural areas, and in particular 
peasant farmers, small landholders, landless workers, fisher-folk, hunters and gatherers, are

<p>coming together to defend greater recognition of their rights in international human rights 
law. 
</p>
<p>72. The Advisory Committee is convinced the best way to further advance the 
protection of the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas is to adopt a new 
instrument &#8211; initially, a declaration &#8211; to better promote and protect these rights. In the 
annex to the present study, it therefore proposes a declaration on the rights of peasants and 
other People Working in Rural Areas. The Declaration adopted by the Advisory Committee 
could serve as a model for a new instrument to be developed by the Human Rights Council. 
Its structure follows that of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. In article 1, it gives a definition of a peasant and other people working in rural 
areas, which includes small-scale farmers, landless peasants and non-agricultural 
households in rural areas, whose members are engaged in fishing, making crafts for the 
local market or providing services, and other rural households of pastoralists, nomads, 
peasants practising shifting cultivation, hunters and gatherers, and people with similar 
livelihoods. It reaffirms their rights to life and to an adequate standard of living (art. 3); 
their right to freedoms of association, opinion and expression (art. 12) and their right to 
have access to justice (art. 13). In addition, it recognizes new rights that could reinforce 
their protection against discrimination. These include the right to land and territory (art. 4); 
the right to seeds and traditional agricultural knowledge and practice (art. 5); the right to 
means of agricultural production (art. 6); the right to information and agricultural 
technology (art. 7); the freedom to determine prices and markets for agricultural production 
(art. 8); the right to the protection of local agricultural values (art. 9); the right to biological 
diversity (art. 10); and the right to preserve the environment (art. 11). 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Smallholder farmers, landless people, tenant farmers, agricultural labourers 
and people living from traditional fishing, hunting and herding activities are among 
</b></p>
<p><b>the most discriminated and vulnerable people in many parts of the world. Every year, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thousands of peasant farmers are the victims of expropriation of land, forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and displacements - a situation that is reaching an unprecedented level owing to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>new phenomenon of the </b>global &#8220;land grab&#8221;. At the same time, traditional fishing 
</p>
<p><b>communities are increasingly threatened by the industrialization of fishing activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>people living from hunting activities, by the creation of development projects; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>pastoralists, by conflicts with farmers over land and water resources. All together, 
</b></p>
<p>these people constitute 80 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry. Women alone represent 70 
</p>
<p>per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry; peasant women are particularly affected by hunger 
</p>
<p><b>and poverty, largely as a result of discrimination in access to and control over 
</b></p>
<p><b>productive resources, such as land, water and credit. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>To overcome this situation, the Advisory Committee makes the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) More attention should be given to agrarian reforms that benefit small-
</b></p>
<p><b>scale land holders and promote security of tenure and access to land, in particular for 
</b></p>
<p><b>women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Government policies should be sufficiently well formulated in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the needs of the most vulnerable people working in rural areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Human rights instruments protecting the rights of peasants and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>people working in rural areas, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and </b></p>


<p><b>the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, should be better 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Human Rights Council should create a new special procedure to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve the promotion and protection of the rights of peasants and other people 
</b></p>
<p><b>working in rural areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The right to land should be recognized in international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) A new international human rights instrument on the rights of peasants 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other people working in rural areas should be developed and adopted by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council. The declaration on the rights of peasants adopted by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Advisory Committee (see annex) could serve as a model. The new instrument to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed by the Human Rights Council should recognize the rights enshrined in 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing international instruments, to increase coherence and visibility. It should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognize new rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, such as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to land, seeds and the means of production. The elaboration of this instrument 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Human Rights Council, with the full participation of peasant farmers, small 
</b></p>
<p><b>landholders, landless workers, fisher-folk, hunters and gatherers and all other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, represents one of the best ways to overcome centuries of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>against the most vulnerable groups working in rural areas. </b></p>

<p><b>  Declaration on the rights of peasants and other people 
working in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p><b>   </b><i>The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that peasants are equal to all other people and, in the exercise of their 
rights, should be free from any form of discrimination, including discrimination based on 
race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, wealth, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, as well as the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action, affirm the 
universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights, civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, States have undertaken to take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of the right 
to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, and the fundamental right to be 
free from hunger, notably through the development and reform of agrarian systems, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that according to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, indigenous peoples, including indigenous peasants, have the right to 
self-determination and that by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status 
and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development, having the right to 
autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, as well 
as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that many peasants all over the world have fought throughout history for 
the recognition of their rights and for just and free societies, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that the current development of agriculture, speculation on food 
products and large-scale land acquisitions and leases in many parts of the world threaten the 
lives of millions of peasants, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> the increasing concentration of the food systems in the world in the 
hands of a small number of transnational corporations, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that small-scale peasant agriculture, fishing and livestock rearing 
can contribute to secure a sustainable food production for all, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that peasants constitute a specific social group which is so vulnerable 
that the protection of their rights require special measures to make sure that States respect, 
protect and fulfil their human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Believing</i> that this Declaration is an essential step towards the recognition, 
promotion and protection of the rights of peasants, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> and reaffirming that peasants are entitled without discrimination to all 
human rights recognized in international law, 
</p>
<p> Solemnly adopts the following Declaration on the Rights of Peasants: </p>


<p><b>  Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Definition of peasants 
</b></p>
<p>1. A peasant is a man or woman of the land, who has a direct and special relationship 
with the land and nature through the production of food or other agricultural products. 
Peasants work the land themselves and rely above all on family labour and other small-
scale forms of organizing labour. Peasants are traditionally embedded in their local 
communities and they take care of local landscapes and of agro-ecological systems. 
</p>
<p>2. The term peasant can apply to any person engaged in agriculture, cattle-raising, 
pastoralism, handicrafts-related to agriculture or a related occupation in a rural area. This 
includes indigenous people working on the land.  
</p>
<p>3. The term peasant also applies to landless. According to the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization definition, the following categories of people are considered to be 
landless and are likely to face difficulties in ensuring their livelihood: 1. Agricultural labour 
households with little or no land; 2. Non-agricultural households in rural areas, with little or 
no land, whose members are engaged in various activities such as fishing, making crafts for 
the local market, or providing services; 3. Other rural households of pastoralists, nomads, 
peasants practising shifting cultivation, hunters and gatherers, and people with similar 
livelihoods.
