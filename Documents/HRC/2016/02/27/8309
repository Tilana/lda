<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 
to 14 October 2011. The review of Trinidad and Tobago was held at the 5th meeting on 5 
October 2011. The delegation of Trinidad and Tobago was headed by Dennis Francis, 
Permanent Representative<b>, </b>Permanent Mission of Trinidad and Tobago to the United 
Nations Offices at Geneva. At its 9th meeting held on 7 October 2011, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Trinidad and Tobago.  
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Trinidad and Tobago: the Philippines, United 
States of America and Peru.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Trinidad and Tobago: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TTO/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TTO/2 and Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TTO/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Trinidad and Tobago 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Trinidad and Tobago stated that it views the review process as a welcome 
opportunity to share with the international community and the Council its progress in 
human rights and to receive the Council&#8217;s views on how best any gaps might be filled. It 
</p>
<p>was added that, since 31 August 1962, when Trinidad and Tobago became a sovereign, 
democratic State, it has adopted policies and practices to recognize and protect the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens. These rights are enshrined in its 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>6. Trinidad and Tobago explained that in preparing for the review it had undertaken a 
thorough consultation process involving all the relevant stakeholders, including 
Government ministries and departments and civil society organizations. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. Trinidad and Tobago also indicated that the Government had given priority to the 
protection of women and children, poverty reduction and reducing the incidence of violent 
crime in Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, it is committed to raising the standard of living 
of persons by enhancing the educational system, providing a higher level of accessibility 
and support to differently abled persons and improving the welfare of those living with 
HIV/AIDS. </p>


<p>8. It was explained that, in an effort to stimulate public awareness and stem problems 
related to stigma and discrimination of those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in the 
workplace, the Government had adopted a National Workplace Policy on HIV/AIDS and 
established an Advocacy and Sustainability Centre for its implementation. Additionally, the 
Equal Opportunity Amendment Bill, 2011, had been drafted to include among the various 
classifications of discrimination &#8220;HIV/AIDS&#8221; and &#8220;age&#8221; as categories under which 
protection should exist. 
</p>
<p>9. Trinidad and Tobago explained that, in a small society with very conservative values 
and deep religious traditions, effecting change to personal attitudes and community values 
was no easy task. This notwithstanding, it was noteworthy that, in recent debates on the 
Statutory Authorities (Amendment) Bill, the need to have definitive deliberations to resolve 
issues related to the treatment of same sex couples was raised in the Parliament.  
</p>
<p>10. Trinidad and Tobago stated that the Government had made the reduction of violent 
crime a top priority. It had therefore taken drastic steps with the enactment of various 
pieces of legislation such as the Anti-Gang Act, 2011 and the Trafficking in Persons Act, 
</p><p>2011.  
</p>
<p>11. It was added in that regard that, on 21 August  2011, Prime Minister Persad-
Bissessar had announced that the Government had agreed to impose a State of Emergency 
to deal with escalating crime. In explaining the Government&#8217;s rationale for the state of 
emergency, the Prime Minister linked the recent surge in violent criminal activity to the 
success of the police in the seizure of large drug hauls and described the current situation in 
Trinidad and Tobago with the imposition of the State of Emergency as &#8220;a war on crime&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>The duration of the state of emergency was initially declared for 15 days, but was 
subsequently extended for three months.  
</p>
<p>12. Trinidad and Tobago noted that it was mindful of the potential for the state of 
emergency to impact on the civil liberties of the citizenry and had therefore put in place 
mechanisms to minimize intrusions, including the requirement that security forces avoid 
abuse to the population. It was added that the Government had repeatedly stated in public 
that it had no intention of curtailing the constitutional freedoms and rights of the people of 
Trinidad and Tobago for a minute longer than was adjudged to be absolutely necessary. 
</p>
<p>13. Trinidad and Tobago indicated further that the Government had also established the 
Financial Intelligence Unit to focus specifically on transnational crime<b> </b>and had moved 
swiftly to make the country compliant with international standards through the enactment 
of the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act, 2010, and the Interception of Communication 
Act, 2010, which criminalized the financing of terrorist activities.  
</p>
<p>14. Moreover, the Government had taken steps to protect its citizens from technology 
related crimes through the passage of the following laws: the Computer Misuse Act, 2000, 
the Electronic Transfer of Funds Crime Act, 2000 and the Data Protection Act, 2011, to 
afford protection to electronically stored personal data.  
</p>
<p>15. It was highlighted that the Government was vigorously addressing the bottlenecks 
that existed in the judicial system particularly in relation to pretrial detention. The Ministry 
of Justice is in the process of reviewing the Indictable Offences (Preliminary Enquiry) Act, 
1917, with the goal, in principle, that once charged, accused persons should be brought 
before the Courts in one year. 
</p>
<p>16. Trinidad and Tobago noted that the Government had created a mechanism allowing 
members of the public to lodge complaints against police officers and to curb the use of 
unnecessary force by the police service. Additionally, the Police Service had recently 
implemented the &#8220;Policing for People Initiative&#8221; to provide officers with the training 
required to improve the overall quality of policing. It had also been the practice in recent </p>


<p>years for middle-rank officers of the Police Service to participate in regional training 
programmes on the relationship between human rights and policing. 
</p>
<p>17. Trinidad and Tobago then recalled that section 4 (a) of the Constitution recognized 
the right of the individual to life, liberty and the security of the person and the right not to 
be deprived thereof except by due process of law. It added that Trinidad and Tobago, which 
retained the death penalty as part of its domestic legal system, was of the view that the 
application of the death penalty was a matter of criminal justice. 
</p>
<p>18. It was noted further that implementation of the death penalty had been in abeyance 
since 1999. The Government was currently reviewing its laws with respect to the death 
penalty and recently piloted the Constitutional (Amendment) (Capital Offences) Bill, 2011, 
to create three categories of murder limiting the death penalty to the most heinous crimes 
with life imprisonment as an alternative punishment. That legislation was defeated in the 
Parliament. 
</p>
<p>19. Trinidad and Tobago stated that the Government was mindful that support existed 
for the retention of the death penalty and that, given the alarming murder statistics, the 
timing was not optimal for its repeal. It was further noted that the Government was also 
obliged to take into account the ruling of the Privy Council in the judgment of <i>Charles 
Mathew v. The State 2004</i>, which determined that the sentence of death for murder in 
Trinidad and Tobago was mandatory and not discretionary. It was indicated that a vibrant 
debate persisted within the national community on the issue to which Government must be 
sensitive. 
</p>
<p>20. Trinidad and Tobago explained that various policy mechanisms were in place to 
protect and promote the rights of prisoners. The Penal Reform and Transformation Unit 
was established in 2002 to review the penal system. Since then, further reforms towards a 
system of restorative justice had been implemented. It was also noted that the treatment of 
prisoners was based on the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. 
Moreover, initiatives were under way to update these standards. Strategies had also been 
adopted to meet the needs of incarcerated parents in order to ensure that relationships with 
their children were maintained. 
</p>
<p>21. Trinidad and Tobago then indicated that, with a view to protecting the human rights 
of victims of human trafficking, illegal immigrants, undocumented workers, asylum-
seekers and refugee claimants, the State had established in November 2009 the Immigration 
Detention Centre. 
</p>
<p>22. Trinidad and Tobago addressed the social aspect of human rights promotion and 
protection. Regarding poverty reduction as it related to women, the Ministry of Gender, 
Youth and Child Development had developed the &#8220;Women in Harmony&#8221; and the &#8220;Non-
traditional Skills Training&#8221; programmes to improve the status of unskilled women who 
</p>
<p>headed households as single parents.  
</p>
<p>23. It was added that the State recognized that more needed to be done to achieve gender 
equality and sensitivity throughout the society. Trinidad and Tobago highlighted that the 
coming to office of the Honourable Kamla Persad-Bissessar as the first female Prime 
Minister of Trinidad and Tobago telescoped important messages to the society about the 
multivariate contribution that women can make to the development of Trinidad and 
Tobago. The Prime Minister recently announced the adoption of a gender-sensitive formula 
for the allocation of financial resources in the budget for fiscal 2011/12. 
</p>
<p>24. Moreover, the Gender Equity Institute had also been established with responsibility 
for the implementation of programmes and projects to advance gender equity and promote 
the elimination of discrimination. </p>


<p>25. It was also stated that the Government recognized that, as in any society, women fell 
victim to domestic violence, sexual harassment and other forms of emotional and verbal 
abuse. Accordingly, in addition to specific legislation covering many of these offences, 
women were also protected under the Sexual Offences Act, 1986. 
</p>
<p>26. Trinidad and Tobago had adopted and strengthened its policies to promote the better 
integration of differently abled persons into society while preserving their independence 
and dignity. A Disability Affairs Unit and a National Coordinating Committee on Disability 
were established and functioning. Moreover, a Draft National Policy on Persons with 
Disabilities and a Draft Disabilities Bill are under consideration. 
</p>
<p>27. Trinidad and Tobago also referred to the Government&#8217;s initiative to improve the 
standard of living of the differently abled, the availability of fully-funded home care and 
assistance from health care professionals. Additionally, special provision had been made for 
the integration of children living with disabilities into the educational system. 
</p>
<p>28. Trinidad and Tobago stated that the Government regarded the protection of the 
human rights of its children as an extremely serious matter and strongly believed that 
children were not mini-human beings with mini-human rights. Thus, along with various 
programmes, grants and activities geared towards child development, the Children&#8217;s Life 
</p>
<p>Fund with the accompanying legislation, the Children&#8217;s Life Fund Act, 2010, have been 
established. 
</p>
<p>29. Trinidad and Tobago noted that, while the defence of the rights of children was an 
ongoing national concern, society in the country had traditionally practised corporal 
punishment as a legitimate form of discipline for youngsters. It was added that this was of 
concern to the Government and that practical steps had been taken to reverse it. The 
Ministry of Education, in its National School Code of Conduct, May 2009, specifically 
forbade the use of corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>30. Moreover it was indicated that currently, the Children&#8217;s Bill 2011 was being 
considered by the Cabinet as a preparatory step to having it laid in Parliament.  This Bill 
would address the sale of children, child pornography, and child prostitution. Additionally, 
under the Trafficking in Persons Act, 2011, child pornography was a form of criminal 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>31. Trinidad and Tobago noted that, as a small island developing State, it was cognizant 
of the distinct link between global climate change and human rights.  Thus, with financial 
assistance from the European Union, the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management 
had produced a National Response Framework related to the management of natural 
disasters compatible with the Hyogo Framework for Action. 
</p>
<p>32. Trinidad and Tobago further indicated that the Ministry of the Attorney General in 
conjunction with the Equal Opportunities Commission was in the process of developing a 
nationwide human rights awareness campaign. A feasibility study was conducted to 
determine the most effective mechanism to reach the widest demographic by the 
International Law and Human Rights Unit of the Ministry. 
</p>
<p>33. It was highlighted that two specific Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
towards which Trinidad and Tobago had made significant progress were the reduction of 
extreme poverty and surpassing the target for universal primary education, with citizens 
now benefiting from free preschool, primary, secondary and tertiary education. Trinidad 
and Tobago declared nevertheless that it is conscious of the challenges that remain. It must 
be borne in mind that national capacity to fully implement certain human rights obligations 
were constrained by increased pressure on available national resources. The Government of 
Trinidad and Tobago therefore wished to express its appreciation to its international 
partners for their support for national development initiatives. </p>


<p>34. Trinidad and Tobago noted that its national report detailed the country&#8217;s 
commitments, priorities, achievements and challenges. It welcomed an engaging dialogue 
with the Council, and stated that it was keen to hear recommendations as it looked forward 
to a fruitful discourse. The State&#8217;s commitment to continuing to work purposively on 
human rights issues and maintaining a high level of ambition accordingly was underscored. 
</p>
<p>35. Trinidad and Tobago recognized, however, that ensuring respect for international 
human rights and meeting its obligations under various international treaties was a 
continuous and complex process.  Trinidad and Tobago was prepared to undertake an 
objective evaluation of the comments and recommendations of members of the Council 
with a view to assisting in further strengthening the national framework for the promotion 
and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>36. In closing, Trinidad and Tobago restated the Government&#8217;s full commitment to 
furthering its efforts to address any identifiable gaps in implementation. It was recalled that, 
as proudly declared in Trinidad and Tobago&#8217;s National Anthem, every creed and race, must 
</p>
<p>find an equal place in Trinidad and Tobago. It was added that, while not explicitly stated in 
those words, in modern Trinidad and Tobago, the Government was resolute in its belief that 
so too must gender. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>37. During the interactive dialogue, 38 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in chapter II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>38. Algeria noted the engagement of Trinidad and Tobago with human rights manifested 
in its programmes, notably the Programme of Financial Aid for needy patients and those 
suffering chronic diseases. It noted the &#8220;eConnect and Learn&#8221; programme and its 
considerable advances in the fight against discrimination. It noted that the situation of 
women remained a challenge. It made recommendations. 
</p>

socioeconomic development. It noted that Trinidad and Tobago made progress towards 
meeting the MDG goals. Malaysia also noted that Trinidad and Tobago had implemented 
new measures to safeguard and protect the security of its citizens from criminal activity and 
inquired how such legislation could mitigate the impact of criminal activity. Malaysia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Cuba noted the progress of Trinidad and Tobago in the fields of health and 
education, despite the challenges that persisted in the Caribbean country. It noted the 
country had achieved universal primary and secondary education and achieved goal 3 of the 
third Millennium Development Goal by eliminating disparities between sexes in primary 
and secondary education. It also highlighted the &#8220;eConnect and Learn&#8221; programme and the </p>


<p>creation of the Fund for Life of Children and programmes for the treatment of non-
communicable diseases, cancer and antiretroviral drugs. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. United Kingdom welcomed the Government&#8217;s ongoing review of the death penalty. 
It hoped that the adoption of a multitiered classification for murder would hand presiding 
judges the power to make a decision on sentencing, and preclude the mandatory imposition 
of the death penalty. It recognized the work undertaken to address discrimination against 
women. It asked when existing legislation on sexual harassment and violence against 
women would be implemented and when specialized rape and sexual offences units would 
become operational within police stations. It noted that measures concerning a State of 
Emergency should be fully justified and used only in exceptional circumstances. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. France noted that Trinidad and Tobago was party to a number of international and 
regional human rights instruments and that its Constitution recognized fundamental rights 
and freedoms. It noted that, even if the last execution in the country was in 1999, the death 
penalty was still in force. It welcomed the establishment of an independent and impartial 
entity to deal with police complaint, noting however its mandate remained undefined.  
France also noted that certain provisions of the Criminal Code criminalized sexual relations 
between consenting adults of the same sex. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Slovenia commended the Government for the establishment of the national steering 
committee for the prevention and elimination of child labour and encouraged it to continue 
its efforts on this field. Slovenia noted that it was not a party of some core universal human 
rights treaties, such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and some others. Slovenia regretted that the 
Government had decided to withdraw from the First Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Nicaragua noted the progress of Trinidad and Tobago in the construction of a solid 
legislative and institutional framework. It noted that, despite the current global economic 
and financial crisis, Trinidad and Tobago had kept its priorities and congratulated it for its 
social programmes. It highlighted health and education programmes and financial 
assistance to the most vulnerable. It also highlighted the country&#8217;s achievements in security 
</p>
<p>for citizens through weapons control, fight against drug trafficking, terrorism and human 
trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Australia<b> </b>welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to better protecting the rights of 
women, children, the elderly and the disabled, and advancing the economic and social 
rights of its citizens. Australia continued to be concerned by reports of excessive use of 
police force and by reports on the treatment of detainees. Australia encouraged Trinidad 
and Tobago to thoroughly investigate claims by members of the public of extrajudicial 
killings by police and urged it to make the findings of those investigations public. It urged 
Trinidad and Tobago to establish a moratorium on the death penalty as an interim measure 
towards full abolition. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Canada commended the establishment of the Victim Support Units within the Police 
Service, but raised its concern over the issue of violence against women and children. It 
regretted that death sentences continued to be handed down by courts and was concerned 
by the bill aimed at reforming the Constitution regarding the death penalty. It was also 
concerned about reports of problems related to the police force and the persistence of 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. New Zealand<b> </b>noted that successive Governments had repudiated the use of torture 
and acknowledged the need to make improvements in prison conditions. It also noted that </p>


<p>the Government was currently considering a draft national policy on persons with 
disabilities and a draft disabilities bill. Additionally, it highlighted that girl children 
deserved protection from early marriage and noted that violence against women remained a 
problem. It suggested that prevention of HIV/AIDS infection became easier when sexual 
relations between same sex adults were legal. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Brazil commended Trinidad and Tobago for its progress in achieving MDGs, such 
as the elimination of gender disparity in education. It noted that, in 2010, it had elected its 
first female Prime Minister and commended the introduction of strategies to increase the 
number of women in decision-making bodies. It expressed concern over the high incidence 
of violence against women and praised the establishment of the Victim Support Units. It 
also commended the country&#8217;s HIV/AIDS policy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Ghana applauded Trinidad and Tobago for its provision of free education from 
primary to tertiary levels. It also commended the wide array of social intervention schemes 
and legal frameworks, including the domestication of international conventions, in support 
of the weak in society. It noted the incidence of violent crime in the country. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Regarding questions and observations on the death penalty, Trinidad and Tobago 
drew attention to the fact that, although no declaratory statement had been made by the 
Government on a moratorium on the death penalty, in fact, since 1999 there had been a 
functional moratorium on such penalties, none of which had been implemented since that 
year. It was added that a rich debate within the Government and society regarding the issue 
was continuing. Trinidad and Tobago noted that in a situation where violent crime was 
widespread it was a great challenge for a Government to risk giving the impression that it 
was not adequately combating crime. 
</p>
<p>53. Trinidad and Tobago acknowledged that violence against women remained an area 
of concern and that the Government was committed to dealing with the issue. Nevertheless, 
there were resource constraints, particularly regarding the ability to fund the mechanisms 
and facilities that afforded protection to women in such situations. Therefore, the gap 
tended to be filled by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with the support of the 
Government. It clarified that some victim support units had been established within police 
service. Moreover, awareness exits of the importance of sensitizing the police establishment 
on that issue. 
</p>
<p>54. Germany noted that Trinidad and Tobago had imposed a state of emergency in 
August 2011 in response to violent crime. It understood the country&#8217;s preoccupation with 
the high crime rate but noted concerns over unjustified violence during arrests. It asked how 
the country plans to step up efforts to ensure the observance of human rights standards by 
security forces. It noted an initiative for constitutional reform in order to render the death 
penalty legally feasible again and expressed concern over the criminalization consensual 
same-sex relations between adults. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Uruguay noted the efforts of Trinidad and Tobago to achieve MDGs, especially its 
advances in the reduction of extreme poverty, free education, and the elimination of gender 
disparity in education. It expressed concern over stereotypes regarding men and women in 
society and family, and the presence of gender violence. It noted that the death penalty in 
the country was only applied in cases of homicide and treason and had been suspended 
since 1999. It noted the revision of the law that forbade corporal punishment. Uruguay 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Slovakia commended Trinidad and Tobago for the establishment of the National 
Steering Committee for the Prevention and Elimination of Child Labour. It also took note 
of the support rendered by the Government towards the organization of the regional 
workshop on establishing national human rights institutions in compliance with the </p>


<p>principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles), in cooperation with OHCHR, in 2011. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. South Africa commended the attention afforded by Trinidad and Tobago to the 
advancement of economic, social and cultural rights. It noted concerns expressed by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child related to education such as inadequate infrastructure, 
material shortages in schools and reports of classroom violence and asked for further 
information on the steps taken in this regard. South Africa welcomed the priority given to 
the health sector. It inquired about steps taken to address the high rate of infant and 
maternal mortality and efforts undertaken to strengthen prenatal and postnatal care. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Turkey commended efforts by Trinidad and Tobago to achieve millennium 
development goals 2 and 3. It also noted that Trinidad and Tobago was the first country in 
the world to adopt legislation for the recording and economic valuation of the 
unremunerated work by women. Turkey welcomed the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism 
Act, the Interception of Communications Act and the Financial Intelligence Unit. Turkey 
appreciated the ongoing public debate and Government consideration regarding the 
limitation of the death penalty only to certain types of crime. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>59. Argentina welcomed the significant progress of Trinidad and Tobago in 2011 in the 
approval of legislation to prevent human trafficking and for the achievements seen in 
political participation of women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Hungary<b> </b>expressed appreciation of recent efforts to combat criminal activity through 
the implementation of various measures, including the adoption of the 2011 Anti-Gang Act 
and the 2011 Trafficking in Persons Act. Hungary was concerned about widespread 
allegations of excessive use of force by law enforcement and prison officers, including 
alleged unlawful killings and ill-treatment cases. It applauded efforts to address child abuse 
and negligence, although it regretted that the Children&#8217;s Authority Act had not been fully 
implemented. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Spain welcomed the country&#8217;s progress in the democratization of its institutions and 
encouraged it to continue achieving better levels of well-being for its citizens. It noted in 
particular efforts to offer universal access to primary and secondary education. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. China recognized achievements in protecting human rights, noting particularly 
progress in gender equality, promoting education and development, protecting the rights of 
the child and protecting victims of domestic violence. China was conscious of the 
numerous difficulties facing Trinidad and Tobago as a developing country. It appealed to 
the international community to provide constructive support to Trinidad and Tobago. China 
suggested that Trinidad and Tobago would remain committed to reducing poverty, 
removing the gap between the rich and poor, and providing better social security to people 
in poverty. 
</p>
<p>63. Maldives<b> </b>inquired on measures being considered to strengthen safeguards for young 
women in relation to the prevention of teen pregnancies. Additionally it inquired how 
OHCHR could help in current efforts to eliminate violence against women. It also asked for 
the Government&#8217;s view on how working with national and international NGOs and the 
treaty body mechanism could strengthen its custodial and penitentiary system to prevent 
torture. Finally, it asked for elaboration on how the adverse effects of climate change 
affected the enjoyment of human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Ecuador congratulated Trinidad and Tobago for its efforts, underpinned by political 
stability and economic growth. It highlighted advances in the achievement of the </p>


<p>Millennium Development Goals; the ratification of a good part of international human 
rights conventions; approval of legislation to allow for better access to justice; 
implementation of social programmes, especially those related to vulnerable peoples; and 
initiatives to achieve gender equality and end racial discrimination. It welcomed the 
election of the country&#8217;s first female Prime Minister. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Romania noted that Trinidad and Tobago is a vibrant democracy and welcomed the
