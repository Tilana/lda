1.   Nature, Basis of Presentation and Continuance of Operations
First Colombia Gold Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada, U.S.A. under the name “Gondwana Energy, Ltd.” On 5 September 1997. On 23 January
2007, the Company changed its name to “Finmetal Mining Ltd.”. On 27 November 2006, the
Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Finmetal Mining OY (“Finmetal
OY”), a company incorporated under the laws of Finland. During the fiscal year ended 31
December 2006, the Company changed its operational focus from development of oil and gas
properties, to acquisition of, exploration for and development of mineral properties in Finland.
On 22 May 2008, the Company changed its name to “Amazon Goldsands Ltd.” And on 18
September 2008, the Company entered into a Mineral Rights Option Agreement and concurrently
re-focused on the acquisition of, exploration for and development of mineral properties located in
Peru. On 29 November 2010, the Company changed its name to “First Colombia Gold Corp.”.
The Company changed its name pursuant to a parent/subsidiary merger between the Company
(as Amazon Goldsands Ltd.) and its wholly-owned non-operating subsidiary, First Colombia
Gold Corp., which was established for the purpose of giving effect to this name change. In 2011
the Company expanded geographic focus to include North America, acquiring two mineral
property interests while terminating its agreements related to the mineral property located in Peru
in September 2011.
The business of mining and exploring for minerals involves a high degree of risk and there can
be no assurance that current exploration programs will result in profitable mining operations. The
recoverability of the carrying value of exploration properties and the Company’s continued
existence are dependent upon the preservation of its interest in the underlying properties, the
discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the achievement of profitable operations, or the
ability of the Company to raise alternative financing, if necessary, or alternatively upon the
Company’s ability to dispose of its interests on an advantageous basis. Changes in future
conditions could require material write downs of the carrying values.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify the title to the properties on which it is
conducting exploration and in which it has an interest, in accordance with industry standards for
the current stage of exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the
Company’s title. Property title may be subject to unregistered prior agreements and non-
compliance with regulatory requirements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) applicable to exploration stage enterprises, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The
Company’s fiscal year end is 31 December.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2014 and the three and
six months then ended have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business.
The Company had a net loss of $897,812 for the six months ended 30 September 2014 (2013–
Net loss of $358,811) and has a working capital deficit of $828,101 at 30 September 2014 (31
December 2013 – $963,353), but management cannot provide assurance that the Company will
ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt
and/or equity capital. The Company’s solvency, ability to meet its liabilities as they become due,
and to continue its operations, has been dependent on funding provided by Asher Enterprises,
Inc. (“Asher”), and in the quarter ending September 30,2014 the Company secured advances and
loans from a third party, and a company controlled by an officer. If these parties are unwilling to
provide ongoing funding to the Company and/or if the Company is unable to raise additional
capital in the immediate future, the Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets,
seek additional capital on less favorable terms and/or pursue other remedial measures or cease
operations. This material uncertainty may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern including adjustments related to employee severance pay and other costs
related to ceasing operations.

2.
Significant Accounting Policies
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these
condensed consolidated financial statements.
Principles of consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Finmetal OY, a company incorporated under the laws
of Finland, since its date of acquisition on 27 November 2006 and the results of Beardmore
Holdings, Inc. (“Beardmore”), a company incorporated under the laws of Panama, to the date of
disposal on 21 September 2011. All inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated in these condensed consolidated financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the
time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As at 30 September 2014 and as at 31 December 2013,
the Company had $49,643 and $0 in cash and cash equivalents.
Property and equipment
Furniture, computer equipment, office equipment and computer software are carried at cost and
are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to five years at rates as follows:
Furniture, computer and
office equipment
 
Computer software
Five years
Three Years
The property and equipment is written down to its net realizable value if it is determined that its
carrying value exceeds estimated future benefits to the Company.
Mineral property costs
Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as tangible assets when purchased. At
the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment. If proven
and probable reserves are established for a property and it has been determined that a mineral
property can be economically developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production
method over the estimated life of the probable reserve.

September, 2014
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable, are provided over the life
of proven reserves on a units-of-production basis. Costs, which include production equipment
removal and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management based on
current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards. Any
charge is included in exploration expense or the provision for depletion and depreciation during
the period and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision
amounts as incurred.
As of the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has not
established any proven or probable reserves on its mineral properties and incurred only
acquisition and exploration costs.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an
interest, according to the usual industry standards for the stage of exploration of such properties,
these procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title. Such properties may be subject to prior
agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects.
Environmental costs
Environmental expenditures that are related to current operations are charged to operations or
capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are charged to
operations. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are
probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals
coincides with the earlier of completion of a feasibility study or the Company’s commitments to a
plan of action based on the then known facts.
Stock-based compensation
Effective 1 January 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718, “ Compensation –
Stock Compensation ”, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for
employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as
an expense over the employees’ requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the
equity grant).
Basic and diluted loss per share
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, “ Earnings per Share ”.
ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face
of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common
stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator)
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-
converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in
determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or
warrants. Diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares if their effect was anti-dilutive.
Financial instruments
The carrying value of amounts receivable, bank indebtedness, accounts payable and convertible
promissory notes approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The Company’s financial risk is the risk that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative
instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk.

Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense
reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance
with ASC 740, “ Income Taxes ”, which requires the use of the asset/liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and credit carry-
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.
Long-lived assets impairment
Long-term assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, pursuant to
guidance established in ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” .
Management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the future projected
cash flows from related operations (undiscounted and without interest charges). If impairment is
deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value. Fair value is generally determined
using a discounted cash flow analysis. The company recorded an impairment loss of $0 and $0
for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Asset retirement obligations
The Company has adopted ASC 410, “Assets Retirement and Environmental Obligations” ,
which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in
the period in which it is incurred. ASC 410 requires the Company to record a liability for the
present value of the estimated site restoration costs with a corresponding increase to the carrying
amount of the related long-lived assets. The liability will be accreted and the asset will be
depreciated over the life of the related assets. Adjustments for changes resulting from the
passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate
underlying the obligation will be made. As at 30 September 2014 and 31 December 2013, the
Company did not have any asset retirement obligations.
Convertible debt
The Company has adopted ASC 470-20, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” and applies
this guidance retrospectively to all periods presented upon those fiscal years. The Company
records a beneficial conversion feature related to the issuance of convertible debts that have
conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates. The beneficial conversion feature for the
convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds as
an increase in additional paid-in capital and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the
convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features. The beneficial
conversion feature will be accreted by recording additional non-cash interest expense over the
expected life of the convertible notes.
As of January 1, 2013, it was determined that the conversion features in the convertible debt
were derivative liabilities. Accordingly, we have separately measured and accounted for these
derivative liabilities, in accordance with ASC 815-15.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, “Development Stage Entities (Topic
915):  Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to
Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation”. The guidance eliminates the
definition of a development stage entity thereby removing the incremental financial reporting
requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities, primarily presentation of inception
to date financial information. The provisions of the amendments are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and the interim periods therein. However, early
adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the Company has adopted this standard as of June 30, 2014.
 
The Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to
have a material impact on its financial statements.

Mineral Property Interests
Boulder Hill Project
On December 16, 2011, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“Purchase
Agreement”) with Boulder Hill Mines Inc., an Idaho corporation (“Boulder Hill”) relating to the
purchase from Boulder Hill of three unpatented mining claims situated in Lincoln County,
Montana (the “Boulder Hill Claims”).
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Company decided to cancel the portion of the
Boulder Hill project involving the state lease, and is in the process of re-staking unpatented
mining claims. During the six month period ended 30 June 2014 the Company spent $1,250 in
consulting fees related to preparation for the re-staking ($0 exploration costs during six month
period ended 30 June 2013).
South Idaho Silver Project
On 7 December 2011 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement (the “CCS Assignment”) with Castle Creek Silver Inc. (“Castle Creek”),
an Idaho corporation, and Robert Ebisch (“Robert E”) to acquire by way of assignment from
Castle Creek all of its rights, responsibilities and obligations under an Option to Purchase and
Royalty Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated 15 July 2011, by and between Castle
Creek and Robert E. Castle Creek, under the Purchase Agreement, had the option to acquire an
undivided 100% of the right, title and interest of Robert E in the unpatented mining claims owned
and situated in Owyhee County, Idaho (the “South Idaho Property”).
Pursuant to the terms of the CCS Assignment, Castle Creek transferred and assigned the
Company all of its right, title and interest, in, to and under the Purchase Agreement and the
Company assumed the assignment of the Purchase Agreement agreeing to be bound, the same
extent as Castle Creek, to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement.
The Company is currently in default with regards to certain obligations related to the South Idaho
Property and is in the process of renegotiating the terms with Castle Creek, or determining to re-
stake the mining claims. During 2013, the Company recorded a provision for write-down of
mineral property interests of in the amount of $36,650 related to the South Idaho Property. During
the six month period ended 30 September 2014, the Company paid $1,250 for a review and
update of its database in preparation of re-staking (no exploration costs were incurred during the
six month period ended 30 June 2013).

The Company is committed to making repayments related to the convertible promissory notes

9.         Fair Value of Financial Instruments
A fair value hierarchy was established that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
measurements).
The fair values of the financial instruments were determined using the following input levels and
valuation techniques:
Level 1:
Level 2:
Level 3:
classification is applied to any asset or liability that has a readily available quoted
market price from an active market where there is significant transparency in the
executed/quoted price.
classification is applied to assets and liabilities that have evaluated prices where
the data inputs to these valuations are observable either directly or indirectly, but
do not represent quoted market prices from an active market.
classification is applied to assets and liabilities when prices are not derived from
existing market data and requires us to develop our own assumptions about how
market participants would price the asset or liability.
Our financial assets and (liabilities) carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of
September 30, 2014, consisted of the following:

financial instruments.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises primarily from the Company’s cash and cash
equivalents. The Company manages its credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents by
dealing only with highly-rated United States financial institutions. As a result, credit risk is
considered insignificant.
Currency Risk
The majority of the Company’s cash flows and financial assets and liabilities are denominated in
US dollars, which is the Company’s functional and reporting currency. Foreign currency risk is
limited to the portion of the Company’s business transactions denominated in currencies other
than the US dollar.
The Company monitors and forecasts the values of net foreign currency cash flow and balance
sheet exposures and from time to time could authorize the use of derivative financial instruments
such as forward foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of foreign currency
fluctuations. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure
to foreign currency risk.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they
fall due. The Company manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected
cash flows and matching the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities. The Company had
a working capital deficit of $963,353 at 31 December 2013, and $828,101 at 30 September 2014,
but management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable
operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital.
Other Risks
Unless otherwise noted, the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk and
commodity price risk.
10. Other receivable
As of 31 December 2013, the Company has recorded other receivable for loan proceeds, where
the debt instrument was finalized, but proceeds were not received until after period end.
11. Subsequent Events
The Company appointed Jason Castenir as the new CEO on October 15, 2014
The Company issued 150,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to its CEO on October 19,
2014, for services provided.

As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company”, and “First Colombia”
mean First Colombia Gold Corp. and our subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated.
Corporate History
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Gondwana Energy, Ltd. on
September 5, 1997, and previously operated under the name Finmetal Mining Ltd. and Amazon
Goldsands Ltd. Our operations have historically focused on the acquisition and development of
mineral property interests in varying locations, including Finland and Peru. The current focus of
our business and operations is on the development of our mineral and oil property interests on
properties located in the western United States and we are evaluating mineral and oil property
interests and seeking opportunities in other geographical areas.
We no longer have any interest in any properties located in northeastern Peru. For reasons
which include our inability to secure sufficient financing to be able to cure our default on notes we
used to finance our acquisition of the property interests in Peru, we reached an agreement to
relinquish our entire interest in the property interests in Peru in exchange for the cancellation of
such notes and related outstanding obligations.
In 2011, we reviewed potential properties for acquisition in Colombia, and expanded our focus to
North America which resulted in our acquiring certain mineral property interests in Montana and
Idaho in late 2011. Company personnel and consultants are planning our exploration plans,
conducting site visits, and reviewing several projects for potential acquisition, and in 2012 we
added to our mineral property position through the acquisition of the Skip claims in Montana. We
also in 2011 entered into agreements to acquire mineral property interest in the South Idaho
Silver and Boulder Hill projects, conducting active due diligence and acquisition work in Croatia,
and in 2013 signed a memorandum of understanding on the Nile Mine project in Montana.
In 2014 the Company elected to operate through both a Mining and through an Energy division.
The Company announced a Letter of Intent for a Purchase and Sale Agreement which was
entered into on July 15, 2014, and subsequently amended on August 27, 2014. This resulted in
the Company acquiring various personal property including transportation and drilling
equipment, land and buildings, and other assets including interests in oil wells and leases. The
Company has established a divisional office in Albany, Kentucky for its energy division in
September 2014. The Company’s current activities are primarily focused on initiating and
expanding oil production.
The Company is in a process of reviewing its mining division strategy and business plan to re-
focus on projects with a shorter time frame for development or securing joint-venture partners.
The Company has hired several operations personnel and is expecting more significant
production to begin in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The Company’s short term
objective is to reach a target monthly production of 1,000 to 2,500 barrels of oil per month, which
is subject to working capital availability and the risk factors described herein.
Overview
 
We  are  in  the  business  of  precious  minerals  exploration  and  oil  and  gas  exploration  and
production, operating through a Mining Division and an Energy Division. The Company aims to
build  assets,  cash  flow  and  revenue  through  the  acquisition,  development,  leasing  and
production  from  assets,  mineral  or  oil  and  gas  interests.  We  face  significant  challenges  form
competition, financing availability, regulatory issues and world commodity prices that effect our
ability to successfully implement our business plan.
Our  strategy  is  to  identify  undervalued  assets,  acquire  or  gain  an  interest  in,  and  add  value
through  exploration,  development,  leasing  or  joint-ventures,  and  where  feasible  go  into
production.  Our  plan  to  implement  this  strategy  building  multiple  revenue  streams  from
production,  acquiring  royalties  and  net  working  interests,  leasing  or  join-venturing  projects
acquired, and providing oil field services using equipment we have acquired.
Our  current  focus  is  integrating  the  assets  acquired  in  Kentucky  during  the  quarter,  and
establishing  and  building  production  through  providing  management,  working  capital  and
implementing enhanced recovery techniques to the assets and oil interests acquired.

Nile Mine Project
Memorandum of Understanding to Earn-Interest in the Nile Mine Project
On May 1, 2013, the Company with GMRV, a branch of 4uX, LLC, a private Montana company
(“GMRV”) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to enter into a Definitive
Agreement within 180 days for the Company to earn a fifty percent interest in the Nile Mine
project. The Company has not entered into a final and definitive agreement at this time.  In May
2014 GMRV waived 2013 cash payments in exchange for an agreed upon payments by June
and September 30 of 2014, respectively, and provided additional time for preparation and
implementation of a definitive agreement.  The Company made a payment of the $5,000 due by
June 2014 in the form of cash and restricted common shares. The Company is discussing
modification and further extensions of the MOU and/or entering into a final definitive agreement,
but did not make the required payments as of September 30, 2014. The Memorandum of
Understanding therefore is in default.
Land Status
The project is owned/controlled by GMRV and private interests. The Company signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) on the project effective May 1, 2013 containing the
following terms and conditions for the Company to earn a 50% interest in the project,
subsequently amended in May 2014:
Paying within 180 days of the signing of this MOU $2,500 which will be payable in cash or the
issuance of restricted shares of the Company at the market bid price, or the equivalent in
restricted preferred shares of the Company, subject to an subscription agreement signed by
GMRV acceptable to the Company. The Company has agreed to an initial work commitment of
$5,000 in 2013, and upon mutual agreement of an exploration plan for 2014, an increased work
commitment of at least $10,000 for 2014.As described above this understanding has been
extended eliminating cash payments during the extension period and instead the Company may
make cash payments or in restricted common stock. The Company during the quarter met the
$5,000 commitment through the issuance of restricted stock and prior cash payments.
The Company agreed that work commitment will include the consulting services that will be
provided by GMRV. The parties in good faith agree to enter into a definitive agreement with
duration of 10 years, with a work commitment for this period of $250,000 and annual minimum
advance royalty payments of $5,000 per year in cash, common shares, or preferred shares, at
First Colombia’s option, for First Colombia to earn a 50% interest in the project. Should a
mutually agreed upon definitive agreement not be agreed on and implemented within the
effective date of this agreement, the payment referred to above shall be non-refundable. As
above this requirement is temporarily waived.
On the effective Date: May 1, 2013, The Company was responsible for all property maintenance
fees, estimated not to exceed $500 annually at the current BLM Maintenance Fee rate.
 
The foregoing description of the MOU does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the MOU, previously filed on the Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by
reference.
Description of Property
Location
The project is located in Marysville Mining District in the Marysville area, and is comprised of the
Nile Mine and nearby Springer II Placer mining claim, comprising approximately fifty-five acres.
The Nile Mine Project consists of two unpatented lode claims covering the over 1,000 feet of the
unpatented section of Nile and South Nile Veins and the Nile Cross-Cut located in Section 4,
T11N, R6W.
- 7 -
Table of Contents
The Springer II Placer consists of one unpatented placer claim covering three tailing ponds and
nearly 0.3 miles of old dredge piles in Section 32, T12N, R6W. The mill tailings are from the
Empire Mill located further up the drainage.

Table of Contents
 
 
 
 
History
The placer property contains evidence of production from a former gold-silver mill. Prior sampling
identified about 13,000 cubic yards of mill tailings containing gold, silver, and copper values. The
Company has not verified prior sampling results. The lead-silver-gold mine reported intermittent
production from 1890's through 1940's.
 
Regional Geology
The Company is currently reviewing regional and project geology.
Project Infrastructure, Access and Power
There is evidence and historical information that indicates some level of production from the Nile
Mine but the Company hasn’t completed a thorough review of this data.
Reserves
There are no established reserves on the project.
Permitting
In Montana an Exploration License or POO (Plan of Operation) may be required depending on
the extent of planned surface disturbance or water discharge form exploration and development
activities, and such permits can typically require bonding.
Exploration Plans
We have been in discussions with GMRV for an initial exploration plan involving surface
sampling, road building and other rehabilitation work to improve underground access, and
possible bulk sampling. We estimate this plan would cost between $5,000 to $25,000, and
provided funding is available, we plan to embark on this plan in the period between January and
June 2015... During the quarter surface samples were taken of the property and are awaiting
assay. The Company incurred $5,000 related to the implementation of the MOU agreement, in
the period ending September 30, 2014. The Company however is in default to the original MOU,
thus would need to negotiate a revised agreement to proceed for which there is no assurance a
revision could be negotiate under terms the company considers acceptable.
Skip Claims
Land Status
The Skip unpatented mining claims comprise approximately forty acres and are considered a
potential silver prospect.
Reserves
There are no established reserves on the property.
 
 Exploration History
The Company has no documented information on prior exploration history. The Company has
noticed evidence of trenching on the property.
Exploration Plans
The Company’s next step would be to prepare basic mapping, geologic mapping and taking
surface samples. The Company believes that seeking a joint-venture partner would be the
preferable approach to advancing the project.
 
Other Exploration Areas
Our strategy is to advance projects we own, lease or option, and seek joint-venture partners
where possible, and to acquire additional projects in different geographical areas though our
concentration currently is in Montana and Idaho. There is no assurance this will result in
additional projects for the Company, or if they do the Company will meet regulatory and financial
requirements to acquire any projects identified.
We are also considering further geographic locations for exploration projects including Mexico
and Europe. This activity consists primarily of reviewing historical data to determine potential
areas of interest, to be followed by a determination for requirements and potential for acquiring
mineral property interest. These activities may not lead to future acquisitions absent future
financing under terms deemed acceptable to, if any such financing is available, and determining
properties that management believes are properties of merit to add to our portfolio of mineral
interests. The Company has retained consulting assistance in south Eastern Europe, and we
forecast consulting expenditures of $5,000 to $15,000 in the upcoming six months...

The Company during the quarter appointed a CEO and Director with experience in the energy
sector, and began due diligence on acquiring oil assets in Kentucky with an objective of building
assets and cash flow in this sector providing suitable acquisitions are both identified and feasible
for the Company to acquire. On July 15, 2014 a Purchase and Sales Agreement was signed,
subsequently amended on August 27, 2014, to acquire certain oil interests including equipment,
land and buildings (further described below).
The Company’s strategy is to build assets and cash flow through acquiring undervalued energy
assets and build value through:
·  Building economies of scale in exploration , development , production and distribution
·  Adding reserves and increasing production by providing capital for exploration, equipment and
well enhancement
·  Conducting  exploration  on  properties  and  oil  interests  acquired  which  prior  owners  were
unable to do due to financial or other constraints
·  Seek  to  be  vertically  integrated  by  building  our  own  oil  field  services  capability  for  drilling,
maintenance and development wherever this is more cost effective
The Company expects this business plan to implement our strategy will result in a business
model providing three revenue streams:
·  A revenue, profit or royalty interest in certain oil wells and leases
·  As a contractor providing oil well services ranging from drilling to operating to maintaining
·  Exploring and producing from wells and leases we own outright, which are subject to third-party
royalties or working interests
General Oil and Gas Industry Overview
Our energy division is principally focused on “upstream” activities which include (a) acquiring
mineral rights (b)
exploring for oil (c) drilling wells and installing production equipment (d)lifting the oil to surface
(e) storing and preparing for transport.
Oil prices are volatile depending on various factors: competing energy sources (coal, natural gas,
nuclear, solar, wind, hydroelectric, and others) ; political turmoil in areas of significant production
or reserves; general economic trends, and other actors.
The Company in the third quarter acquired interests in oil wells in Kentucky from a private
company. The Company efforts are focused on maintaining production, expanding production
and targeted drilling in areas the Company believes are most prospective for new or increased
production. We acquired at the same time land, building, and oil field service equipment to
support this effort, and hired a local general manger with long experience in the oil industry and
Kentucky in particular. We received our first revenue payment during the quarter, and in
accordance with our business plan are focused on increasing revenue and cash flow from the oil
interests acquired.
Competition
 
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Our competitors and potential competitors include
major oil companies and independent producers of varying sizes which are engaged in the
acquisition of producing properties and the exploration and development of prospects. Most of
our competitors have greater financial, personnel and other resources than we do and therefore
have greater leverage in acquiring prospects, hiring personnel and marketing oil and gas.
 
Government Regulations
 
The  production  and  sale  of  oil  and  gas  is  subject  to  regulation  by  state,  federal  and  local
authorities.  In  most  areas  there  are  statutory  provisions  regulating  the  production  of  oil  and
natural  gas  under  which  administrative  agencies  may  set  allowable  rates  of  production  and
promulgate rules in connection with the operation and production of such wells, ascertain and
determine the reasonable market demand of oil and gas, and adjust allowable rates with respect
thereto.
 
The sale of liquid hydrocarbons was subject to federal regulation under the Energy Policy and
Conservation  Act  of  1975  which  amended  various  acts,  including  the  Emergency  Petroleum
Allocation Act of 1973. These regulations and controls included mandatory restrictions upon the
prices at which most domestic and crude oil and various petroleum products could be sold. All
price controls and restrictions on the sale of crude oil at the wellhead have been withdrawn. It is
possible, however, that such controls may be re-imposed in the future but when, if ever, such re-
imposition might occur and the effect thereof is unknown.

The sale of certain categories of natural gas in interstate commerce is subject to regulation under
the  Natural  Gas  Act  and  the  Natural  Gas  Policy  Act  of  1978  (“NGPA”).  Under  the  NGPA,  a
comprehensive set of statutory ceiling prices applies to all first sales of natural gas unless the
gas specifically exempt from regulation (i.e., unless the gas is deregulated). Administration and
enforcement  of  the  NGPA  ceiling  prices  are  delegated  to  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission  (“FERC”).  In  June  1986  the  FERC  issued  Order  No.  451,  which  in  general  is
designed to provide a higher NGPA ceiling price for certain vintages of old gas. It is possible,
though unlikely, that we may in the future acquire significant amounts of natural gas subject to
NGPA price regulations and/or FERC Order No. 451.
Our  operations  are  subject  to  extensive  and  continually  changing  regulation  because  of
legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment and
expansion. Many departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to
issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its
individual participants. The failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in large
penalties.  The  regulatory  burden  on  this  industry  increases  our  cost  of  doing  business  and,
therefore,  affects  our  profitability.  However,  we  do  not  believe  that  we  are  affected  in  a
significantly different way by these regulations than our competitors are affected.
 
Transportation and Production
 
Transportation  and  Sale  of  Oil  and  Natural  Gas.  We  can  make  sales  of  oil,  natural  gas  and
condensate at market prices which are not subject to price controls at this time. The price that we
receive  from  the  sale  of  these  products  is  affected  by  our  ability  to  transport  and  the  cost  of
transporting these products to market. Under applicable laws, FERC regulates:
 
● the construction of natural gas pipeline facilities, and
● the rates for transportation of these products in interstate commerce.
 
Our possible future sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline
transportation.  The  price  and  terms  for  access  to  pipeline  transportation  remain  subject  to
extensive 
federal  and  state  regulation.  Several  major  regulatory  changes  have  been
implemented  by  Congress  and  FERC  from  1985  to  the  present.  These  changes  affect  the
economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, FERC is continually
proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting these segments of the natural
gas industry that remain subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. The most notable of these are natural gas
transmission companies.
FERC’s more recent proposals may affect the availability of interruptible transportation service on
interstate pipelines. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas in some
cases. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among
the  various  sectors  of  the  natural  gas  industry.  These  initiatives  generally  reflect  more  light-
handed  regulation  of  the  natural  gas  industry.  The  ultimate  impact  of  the  complex  rules  and
regulations issued by FERC since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, some aspects of these
regulatory  developments  have  not  become  final  but  are  still  pending  judicial  and  FERC  final
decisions. We cannot predict what further action FERC will take on these matters. However, we
do not believe that any action taken will affect us much differently than it will affect other natural
gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we might compete.
 
Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system
for transportation rates for oil. These regulations could increase the cost of transporting oil to the
purchaser. We do not believe that these regulations will affect us any differently than other oil
producers and marketers with which we compete.
 
Regulation  of  Drilling  and  Production.  Our  proposed  drilling  and  production  operations  are
subject  to  regulation  under  a  wide  range  of  state  and  federal  statutes,  rules,  orders  and
regulations. Among other matters, these statutes and regulations govern:
●  the  amounts  and  types  of  substances  and  materials  that  may  be  released  into  the
environment,
●  the discharge and disposition of waste materials,
●  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites, and
●  the remediation of contaminated sites,
- 12 -
Table of Contents
 
 
and require:
●  permits for drilling operations,
●  drilling bonds, and
●  reports concerning operations.
Environmental Regulations
 
General. Our operations are affected by the various state, local and federal environmental laws
and regulations, including the:
●  Clean Air Act,
●  Oil Pollution Act of 1990,
●  Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
●  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”),
●  Toxic Substances Control Act, and
●  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”).
These laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment or the
disposal of waste materials, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. In particular,
the following activities are subject to stringent environmental regulations:
●  drilling,
●  development and production operations,
●  activities  in  connection  with  storage  and  transportation  of  oil  and  other  liquid
hydrocarbons, and
●  use of facilities for treating, processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and wastes.
Violations are subject to reporting requirements, civil penalties and criminal sanctions. As with
the  industry  generally,  compliance  with  existing  regulations  increases  our  overall  cost  of
business. The increased costs cannot be easily determined. Such areas affected include:
●  unit production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions
and the disposal of produced water,
●  capital costs to drill exploration and development wells resulting from expenses primarily
related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and other oil and natural gas
exploration wastes, and
●  capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities and remediate,
plug and abandon inactive well sites and pits.

Environmental  regulations  historically  have  been  subject  to  frequent  change  by  regulatory
authorities. Therefore, we are unable to predict the ongoing cost of compliance with these laws
and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations. However, we do not
believe  that  changes  to  these  regulations  will  have  a  significant  negative  effect  on  our
operations.
 
A discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could subject us to
substantial expense, including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations pertaining to
the  cleanup  of  releases  of  hazardous  substances  into  the  environment  and  claims  by
neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage. We do
not maintain insurance for protection against certain types of environmental liabilities.
 
The Clean Air Act requires or will require most industrial operations in the United States to incur
capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the EPA and
state environmental agencies. Although no assurances can be given, we believe the Clean Air
Act requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.
 
RCRA is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous
wastes.  RCRA  imposes  stringent  operating  requirements,  and  liability  for  failure  to  meet  such
requirements, on a person who is either:
●  a “generator” or “transporter” of hazardous waste, or
●  an “owner” or “operator” of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility.
At present, RCRA includes a statutory exemption that allows oil and natural gas exploration and
production wastes to be classified as non-hazardous waste. As a result, we will not be subject to
many of RCRA’s requirements because our operations will probably generate minimal quantities
of hazardous wastes.
 
CERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of
the  original  act,  on  certain  classes  of  persons  that  contributed  to  the  release  of  a  “hazardous
substance” into the environment. These persons include:
●  the “owner” or “operator” of the site where hazardous substances have been released,
and
●  companies  that  disposed  or  arranged  for  the  disposal  of  the  hazardous  substances
found at the site.
CERCLA  also  authorizes  the  EPA  and,  in  some  instances,  third  parties  to  act  in  response  to
threats  to  the  public  health  or  the  environment  and  to  seek  to  recover  from  the  responsible
classes  of  persons  the  costs  they  incur.  In  the  course  of  our  ordinary  operations,  we  could
generate waste that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance.” As a result,
we  may  be  liable  under  CERCLA  or  under  analogous  state  laws  for  all  or  part  of  the  costs
required to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed.
 
Under such law we could be required to:
●  remove  or  remediate  previously  disposed  wastes,  including  wastes  disposed  of  or
released by prior owners or operators,
●  clean up contaminated property, including contaminated groundwater, or
●  perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination.
We could also be subject to other damage claims by governmental authorities or third parties
related to such contamination.

We believe that we are in compliance with all regulations, but it is possible that we are subject to
an unknown regulation, and that this might have a material impact on our operations.
 
Market for oil and gas production
 
The market for oil and gas production is regulated by both the state and federal governments.
The overall market is mature and with the exception of gas, all producers in a producing region
will receive the same price. The major oil companies will purchase all crude oil offered for sale at
posted  field  prices.  There  are  price  adjustments  for  quality  differences  from  the  Benchmark.
Benchmark  is  Saudi  Arabian  light  crude  oil  employed  as  the  standard  on  which  OPEC  price
changes  have  been  based.  Quality  variances  from  Benchmark  crude  results  in  lower  prices
being paid for the variant oil. Oil sales are normally contracted with a purchaser or gatherer as it
is known in the industry who will pick up the oil at the well site. In some instances there may be
deductions for transportation from the well head to the sales point. At this time the majority of
crude oil purchasers do not charge transportation fees unless the well is outside their service
area. The service area is a geographical area in which the purchaser of crude oil will not charge
a fee for picking upon the oil. The purchaser or oil gatherer as it is called within the oil industry,
will  usually  handle  all  check  disbursements  to  both  the  working  interest  and  royalty  owners.
Royalty owners and overriding royalty owners often receive a percentage of gross oil production
for the particular lease and are not obligated in any manner whatsoever to pay for the costs of
operating the lease.
Kentucky Oil and Gas Region
In 2011 the Kentucky Geological survey reported 24,364 oil wells in production in Kentucky
which produced 790 million barrels of oil form 61 counties. The leading production zones are in
Cambrian to Pennsylvanian rocks from more than 1,500 pools; oil is produced from Missippian
limestones and sandstone in Eastern and Western Kentucky. Our plan is to acquire properties
and oil interests where we believe that are underexplored, or wells that we believe that modern
enhanced recovery techniques could initiate or improve oil production.
Oil Leases and Wells
The Company acquired during the quarter ending September 30, 2014 ownership interests of
certain oil wells, leases and working interests in the counties of Cumberland (KY), Monroe (KY),
Overton (TN) and Clinton (KY). This totaled reportedly 113 wells, (our 8k filing is incorporated by
reference and an exhibit to this report). We currently have interests in 96 wells with a gross
acreage of 4,302 acres.
 
Reserves
 
             As of the end of the 2013 fiscal year, the Company had no proven reserves.
 
             As of September 30, 2014 the Company has not completed reserve studies on oil and
gas assets acquired in the quarter. The prior operator has reported reserves existing on certain of
the wells for which the Company will review as part of its plan to conduct new reserve studies.
 
Production, Production Prices and Production Costs
 
             Sales of oil during the quarter ending September 30, 2014 amounted to $1,738.99, for
232.31 barrels at an average price of $87.58 per barrel and at an average production cost per
barrel of $116.25. All of our oil production has occurred in the United States.  The Company had
no sales of oil and gas prior to the current quarter.
 
The Company owns a net retained interest (“NRI”) and net working interest (“NWI”) in 87 oil wells
and oil leases, generally ranging from an NRI of 7.8% to 19.5%. This percentage interest is
based on initial documentation received as part of the purchase of this interest. Revenue from
this interest in the quarter was $1,738.99. The oil and gas operations in which the Company has
this interest produced were reported to be 232.31 barrels of oil for a gross revenue of $2,230.46,
with revenue costs reported at $26,514.45, for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.
Past and Present Development Activities
 
             We did not drill any exploratory or development wells in the quarter ending September 30,
2014, but have started mobilization of resources for a drilling plan, subject to financing, of over 40
wells in the final quarter of the current fiscal year. It is estimated than an additional $200,000 in
working capital will be required expand our current drilling plans.  During the 2013 fiscal year we
did not drill any exploratory wells in the United States. We did not drill any development wells
during the 2013 fiscal year.
 
             Delivery Commitments
 
             As of December 31, 2013, we had no delivery commitments for oil or natural gas under
existing contracts or agreements.

Oil Field Services and Transportation
The Company in the quarter acquired transportation and oil field service equipment, office
furniture and equipment, land and buildings located in Kentucky, and the Company established
an operating division in Albany, Kentucky. The Company reported the assets acquired in our 8k
filings.
The Company plans to utilize these assets to explore, develop and produce form its own
interests in leases and oil wells, and to provide contracting services to local oil field companies
including the operator of certain leases and wells in which the company has a revenue interest in
as described above. The Company may bill for the use of its equipment or personnel at a fixed
fee or at cost plus percentage basis. We expect that up to $150,000 in working capital may be
required for providing such services in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The Company expects initial revenue to occur in the fourth quarter, and the equipment acquired
can also be used in its internal operations thus reducing reliance and cost on outside contractors.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013
Revenues
We have not generated any revenues from our operations since our inception through August
2014.  In September due to our recent acquisition of oil interests we received revenue of
$2,230.46.
Operating Expenses
We reported operating expenses in the amount of $4,396,269 for the three months from June 30,
2014 to September 30, 2014, compared to operating expenses of $118,273 for the three months
ended September 30, 2013. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2014, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013, was primarily
a result of an increase in management compensation.
Other Income/Expense
We incurred interest of $929,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2014, as compared
to $0.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase is mainly due to an
increase in origination interest associated with the initial recording of derivative liabilities.
The Company recorded gain on derivative liabilities of $245,851 for the three months ended
June 30,2014 compared to a loss on derivative liabilities of $248,869 for the corresponding
period ending June 30,2013. The derivative liability is remeasured quarterly.
Net Income (Loss)
As a result of the above, for the three months ended September 30, 2014, we reported a net loss
of $5,388,096. For the three months ended September 30, 2013, we reported a net loss of
$112,900.
Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013
Revenues
We have not generated any revenues from our operations since our inception through August
2014.  In September we recorded revenue of $1,739 from oil interests.
Operating Expenses
We reported operating expenses in the amount of $5,371,600 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014, compared to operating expenses of $303,858 for the nine months ended
June 30, 2013.  The increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2014, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was primarily a result of an
increase in management compensation.

Other Items
We incurred interest of $1,369,861 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, as compared
to $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.  The increase is mainly due to an increase
in origination interest associated with the initial recording of derivative liabilities.
The Company recorded gain on derivative liabilities of $_________ for the nine months
ended September 30,2014 compared  to a loss on derivative liabilities of $66,533 for the
corresponding period ending September 30,2013. The derivative liability is remeasured
quarterly.
Net Income (Loss)
As a result of the above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we reported a net loss
of $897,812.  For the nine months ended Nine 30, 2013, we reported a net loss of $358,811.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $49,643, compared to $0 at
December 31, 2013.
Our present capital resources are insufficient to commence and sustain all planned acquisition,
development and exploration activity. The company elected to re-focus its mining division on
exploration in its existing areas of focus to determine acquisitions of more advanced properties,
and retain its Skip claims for initial exploration. We estimate that for the next twelve months our
mining division will require up to $100,000 in working capital for these plans. For our energy
division we estimate that our oil field services division will require up to $200,000 in working
capital, and our oil and gas operations require a minimum of $200,000 up to $400,000 for our
activities which are geared to steadily establishing and increasing production from existing wells.
 
In addition to any expenditures related to any exploration activity, our business plan provides for
spending of approximately $20,000 in ongoing general and administrative expenses per month
for the next twelve months, for a total anticipated expenditure for general and administrative
expenses of $240,000 over the next twelve months. The general and administrative expenses for
the year will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to our
regulatory filings throughout the year, as well as transfer agent fees and general office expenses.
Management compensation is forecast at approximately $144,000 for the next 12 months.
We have only recently generated our first revenue and while we are planning to increase our
revenue quarterly there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so, or that any such
revenue would be sufficient to meet our working capital needs.
 
Accordingly, we must obtain additional financing in order to continue our plan of operations
during and beyond the next twelve months, which would include being able to sustain any
exploration, development and production activity. We believe that traditional debt financing may
not be an alternative for funding additional phases of exploration, development or production
activities in the current lending environment, but over time if we are successful in our business
plan revenue increases may improve our borrowing capability. We anticipate that additional
funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock and the issuance
of convertible notes. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise
sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our implement our current business
plan, or any acquisition of additional property interests. Any issuance of common stock would
dilute the interests of our existing stockholders. In the absence of such financing, we will not be
able to pursue our business plan and may not be able to maintain our property interests in good
standing. If we are unable to raise additional capital in the near future, we will experience
liquidity problems and we would need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek additional
capital on less favorable terms and/or pursue other remedial measures.
We may consider entering into a joint venture arrangement to provide the required funding to
explore and develop the properties underlying our interests. We have not undertaken any efforts
to locate a joint venture participant. Even if we determine to pursue a joint venture participant,
there is no assurance that any third party would enter into a joint venture agreement with us in
order to fund exploration of the properties underlying our mineral property interests. If we enter
into a joint venture arrangement, we would likely have to assign a percentage of our interest in
property interests to the joint venture participant.
The company has been dependent on convertible note financing which can be highly dilutive to
existing shareholders, and there is no assurance the company can continue to receive such
financing.
Cash Used in Operating Activities
Operating cash flows for the period ending September 30, 2014 and 2013 respectively were a
negative $137,559 and $55,850. The increase in negative cash flow from operations is due to
increases in debt discount amortization, origination interest, and stock issued for services, offset
by gain on derivative liabilities.

Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the nine months ended September 30 2014, we used $0 in investing activities, as compared
to $4,150 used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013.The
Company during the nine month period ending September 30, 2014 acquired oil and gas
interests for $261,000, in a non-cash transaction, and certain real property (building, land,
transportation equipment, office equipment) for $261,000, in a non-cash transaction.
Cash from Financing Activities
As we have had no revenues since inception until September 2014, we have financed our
operations primarily by using existing capital reserves, notes payable and through private
placements of our stock. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2014 was $852,700. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $60,000, which consisted entirely of proceeds of
convertible notes issued to a private party. in 2013.
Commitments
Cash Payments and Exploration Expenditures
Our plans to make cash payments for expenses and liabilities, and incur exploration and
development expenditures in connection with our mining and energy divisions are described
above in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We are required to make certain payments
as required by regulation for permitting and remediation efforts that at present cannot be
quantified for future quarters.. We describe in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the
expenditures forecast for the fourth quarter, which include expenditures required to maintain the
assets acquired.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements,
obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated
entities or other persons that may have material current or future effects on financial conditions,
changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital
resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.
Going Concern
The continuity of our future operations is dependent on our ability to obtain financing and upon
future acquisition, exploration and development of profitable operations from our mineral
properties. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. For
a full discussion of our accounting policies as required by GAAP, refer to our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. We consider certain accounting policies to be
critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application
requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The specific risks related to these critical accounting policies are unchanged at the date of this
report and are described in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company during the quarter began a second operating division which will operate in the
energy field, the Company expects additional critical accounting policies in relation to oil and gas
production will be in place during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The Company has
adopted “full cost” accounting for its oil and gas activities as further described in notes to our
financial statements, which include cost ceiling test analysis and a revision to our asset
retirement obligation calculations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2014.  In making this assessment, management used the
criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission,  or  COSO.  The  COSO  framework
summarizes  each  of  the  components  of  a  company’s  internal  control  system,  including  (i)  the
control  environment,  (ii)  risk  assessment,  (iii)  control  activities,  (iv) 
information  and
communication, and (v) monitoring. In management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control  over  financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rule  13a-15(f))  as  required  by
Exchange  Act  Rule  13a-15(c),  our  management  concluded  as  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that our internal control over financial reporting
has  not  been  effective.  The  company  intends,  prior  to  the  next  fiscal  year  as  the  company's
finances improve, to hire additional accounting staff and implement additional controls.
 
As defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, “An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
that  is  Integrated  with  an  Audit  of  Financial  Statements  and  Related  Independence  Rule  and
Conforming  Amendments,”  established  by  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board
("PCAOB"), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results more
than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements
will  not  be  prevented  or  detected.  In  connection  with  the  assessment  described  above,
management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as
of September 30, 2014:
i)  Lack of segregation of duties.  At this time, our resources and size prevent us from being
able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have adequate segregation of duties
within  our  internal  control  system.    Management  will  periodically  reevaluate  this
situation.
ii)  Lack  of  an  independent  audit  committee.  Although  the  Board  of  Directors  serves  an
audit committee it is not comprised solely of independent directors. We may establish an
audit  committee  comprised  solely  of  independent  directors  when  we  have  sufficient
capital resources and working capital to attract qualified independent directors and to
maintain such a committee.
iii)  Insufficient number of independent directors. At the present time, our Board of Directors
does  not  consist  of  a  majority  of  independent  directors,  a  factor  that  is  counter  to
corporate governance practices as set forth by the rules of various stock exchanges.
Our management determined that these deficiencies constituted material weaknesses.  Due to a
lack of financial resources, we are not able to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action
to remediate these material weaknesses. We will not be able to do so until we acquire sufficient
financing to do so.  We will implement further controls as circumstances, cash flow, and working
capital permit.  Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there
were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements
fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered
thereby in all material respects.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
our objectives and our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the
internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter
ended September 30, 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect such controls.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
We are not currently a party to any pending legal proceeding as of September 30, 2014, we were
not aware of any pending legal proceeding to which any of our officers, directors, or any
beneficial holders of five percent or more of our voting securities are adverse to us or have a
material interest adverse to us. The legal agreement reached with a former convertible note
holder is described below.
The Company on August 7, 2014 entered into an agreement with a convertible note holder, with
a Settlement Agreement and Release being filed in court, that the Company will on August
13,2014 pay the sum of $110,000 to satisfy all notes to this note holder issued prior to April 30,
2014, and that the Company can prepay all notes issued since that date, which total $74,500
without premium by September 12, 2014 or if after that date, the principal of the $74,500 may be
fully satisfied through the issuance of common stock as outlined in the original convertible notes.
The Company entered into this agreement primarily to reduce the debt and the dilutive effect of
conversions at a discount to the market price of the company’s stock. The Company believes this
settlement was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to reduce the amount of
convertible notes outstanding. The Company made the respective payments of $110,000 and
$74,500 in accordance with the agreement.
