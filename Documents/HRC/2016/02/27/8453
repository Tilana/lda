<p><i>Summary 
</i> In this report, the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related 
international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights, presents the main findings from his visits 
to Australia (7-11 February 2011) and Solomon Islands (14-18 February 2011).  
</p>
<p> In Australia, the Independent Expert&#8217;s primary focus was on the country&#8217;s 
development assistance programme and its impact on the realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights and the right to development, as well as the attainment of the 
Millennium Development Goals in Pacific Island countries receiving Australian 
development assistance. In Solomon Islands, he assessed the effectiveness of bilateral and 
multilateral aid in supporting the realization of human rights and achievement of the Goals. 
The visits were linked in order to consider the issues from the perspective of provider and 
recipient of development assistance.

<p> The Independent Expert commends the Government of Australia for its commitment 
to scale up its overseas development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 
2015-2016, but notes that this still falls short of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 of 
gross national income. He also notes with concern the lack of a human rights-based 
approach to Australia&#8217;s development programme and the over-reliance on technical 
assistance and private contractors to deliver the aid programme. 
</p>
<p> Foreign aid (including that provided by Australia as the largest contributor to the 
country&#8217;s development assistance budget) has helped Solomon Islands make important 
progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those on 
health and education, and has contributed to the restoration of law and order as well as 
fiscal and economic stability following the end of the &#8220;tensions&#8221; in 2003. However, a 
number of challenges remain, including ensuring sustainable capacity-building, aligning 
donor priorities with the Government&#8217;s development agenda, ensuring transparency and 
accountability in the use and management of public resources, ensuring equitable 
distribution of the country&#8217;s resources, particularly for the majority of the population who 
live in the rural areas, and reducing aid dependency. The Independent Expert notes the lack 
of a human rights framework that informs both the Government&#8217;s and donors&#8217; 
development&#8217;s strategies and that enables citizens to hold the Government and donors 
accountable for their policies and actions. 
</p>
<p> The report concludes with some recommendations addressed to the Governments of 
Australia and Solomon Islands, and to other development partners of Solomon Islands.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In this report, the Independent Expert presents the findings of his official visits to 
Australia, from 7 to 11 February 2011, and to Solomon Islands, from 14 to 18 February 
</p><p>2011. The key purpose of his visit to Australia was to assess the impact of Australian 
development assistance on the realization of human rights and the right to development, as 
well as on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in recipient countries in 
the Pacific region. He also examined the role of human rights within Australia&#8217;s foreign aid 
policy and explored the human rights implications of Australia&#8217;s trade negotiations and 
development partnerships with the Pacific Island countries. In Solomon Islands, the 
Independent Expert assessed the effectiveness of foreign aid in supporting the realization of 
human rights in the country. He also explored the impact of foreign debt, terms of trade and 
the global recession on the enjoyment of human rights and the achievement of the Goals. 
The visits were connected in order to allow for consideration of the issues from the 
perspective of provider and recipient of development assistance. 
</p>
<p>2. In Australia, the Independent Expert met with senior officials from the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development 
(AusAID), the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the 
Development Effectiveness Steering Committee (comprising representatives of the 
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury, the Department of Finance 
and Deregulation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Office of Development 
Effectiveness and AusAID) and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). He 
also met with the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, the Solomon Islands 
High Commissioner to Australia, World Bank officials, civil society organizations, 
academics and private contractors involved in the management of Australian aid projects. 
The Independent Expert also delivered a public lecture on &#8220;vulture funds&#8221; at Monash 
University. 
</p>
<p>3. In Solomon Islands, the Independent Expert met with senior officials from the 
Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External 
Trade, the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination, the Ministry of 
Finance and Treasury, the Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs, the Ministry of Health and 
Medical Services, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, the Ministry of Rural 
Development, and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, as well as members of the 
Parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Bills 
and Legislation Committee. He also had consultations with representatives of the 
Australian High Commission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands 
(RAMSI), United Nations agencies, the World Bank and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert is grateful to the Governments of Australia and Solomon 
Islands for their invitations and cooperation during his missions. He also takes this 
opportunity to express his gratitude to the United Nations Information Centre in Australia, 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Country Office in Solomon Islands 
and the Regional Representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights for their support.  
</p>
<p>5. He regrets that one of the key stakeholders, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 
was uncooperative during his visits to both countries. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1

</p>
<p><b> II. Australia&#8217;s international development assistance programme 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Policy and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. The objective of the Australian aid programme is to &#8220;assist developing countries 
reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development, in line with Australia&#8217;s national 
interest&#8221;.1 Australia&#8217;s aid policy aims to speed up progress towards the Millennium 
Development Goals and focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for over 60 per 
cent of official development assistance (ODA), although the geographical reach of the aid 
programme has more recently been extended to include Asia and the Middle East, Africa, 
and Latin America and the Caribbean. Priority areas include education, health and HIV, 
environmental sustainability, economic growth, governance, equitable development 
(including gender equality and people with disabilities), human security and stability, and 
strengthening the effectiveness of the aid programme.2  
</p>
<p>7. In 2009-2010, total ODA was A$ 3.8 billion. For the period 2010-2011 it is 
estimated at A$ 4.3 billion, representing 0.33 per cent of gross national income (GNI). The 
Government has committed to scaling up its ODA to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-2016. 
The Independent Expert welcomes this commitment but notes that it falls short of the 
internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNI.  
</p>
<p>8. AusAID is the main Government agency responsible for managing Australia&#8217;s aid 
programme, although other Government agencies provide smaller amounts of aid in areas 
such as defence, policing and trade. In 2010-2011, AusAID will be responsible for 
managing A$ 3.8 billion of the total ODA budget.  
</p>
<p>9. The AusAID programme is ordered around four interlinked themes: accelerating 
economic growth; fostering functioning and effective States; investing in people; and 
promoting regional stability and cooperation.3 
</p>
<p>10. Australia is signatory to the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness: 
Ownership, Harmonisation, Alignment, Results and Mutual Accountability, and the 2008 
Accra Agenda for Action, under which it has committed to use partner country systems to 
deliver aid, base its support on partner countries&#8217; national development strategies, reduce 
aid fragmentation, increase transparency, share responsibility and accountability with 
country partners for development results, and increase predictability of aid flows by 
supporting budget planning of partner governments.4  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights and the aid programme 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Independent Expert notes that some AusAID programme sectors directly or 
indirectly address human rights. A number of the Agency&#8217;s activities aim at increasing

<p>gender equality,5 supporting disadvantaged or vulnerable groups (particularly people with 
disabilities6) and promoting good governance in local institutions. In 1996, AusAID 
established a human rights grants scheme to support small organizations based or operating 
in developing countries in activities aimed at promoting and protecting human rights. In 
2010-2011 this scheme had a budget allocation of A$ 3.5 million but it remains a very 
small component of Australia&#8217;s ODA. AusAID has also provided significant funding to the 
Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions since its establishment in 1996.7 
Australia has committed A$ 2.6 million for the period 2010-2014. It is also notable that 
AusAID has acknowledged the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of 
development and human rights.8 Nevertheless, AusAID does not have an overarching 
human rights-based approach guiding its policies and programmes. Rather, certain human 
rights issues are addressed in an ad hoc manner. 
</p>
<p>12. An independent review of aid effectiveness is currently being undertaken to assess 
whether the current systems, policies and procedures for the aid programme maximize 
effectiveness and efficiency. Numerous public submissions to the review have underlined 
that the review proffers an invaluable important opportunity for the Government to ensure 
that human rights become an overarching objective of Australian development work, and 
that this work is underpinned by a rights-based approach. The Independent Expert fully 
supports the calls for the development assistance programme to be anchored in a human 
rights-based framework. As noted by the Australian Human Rights Commission in its 
submission to the review, a rights-based approach would enhance the sustainability and 
effectiveness of the aid programme principally because it focuses on addressing the 
underlying causes of poverty and disadvantage and it contributes to better accountability.9  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The role of technical assistance in the aid programme 
</b></p>
<p>13. Technical assistance represents a major component of Australia&#8217;s aid programme.10 
In general, this entails the recruitment of large numbers of advisers to work in partner 
government institutions.11 According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), the use of technical assistance increased from 37 per cent of 
Australian ODA in 1999 to 46 per cent in 2003. A 2008 AusAID survey on technical

<p>and training to build the capacity of partner government staff and institutions and to deliver technical 
services in areas such as engineering, health or financial management. See Tony Land, Volker Hauck, 
Heather Baser, &#8220;Aid effectiveness and the provision of TA personnel: improving practice&#8221;, <i>Policy 
Management Brief, </i>No. 20 (European Centre for Development Policy Management, November 2007). 
</p>
<p> 11 See AusAID, <i>Annual Review of Development Effectiveness 2009: Improving Basic Services for the 
Poor</i> (Canberra, 2010), pp. 48-49. This is attributed to the fact that the Australian aid programme 
focuses on fragile States and conflict-affected countries where Government systems and capacity are 
weak and relevant expertise is unavailable. See also www.ausaid.gov.au/makediff/adviser-
review.cfm. </p>

</p>
<p>assistance expenditure indicates that the use of technical assistance remained at a similar 
level.12  
</p>
<p>14. Information provided by the Government indicates that efforts to decrease the 
reliance on advisers as a primary mechanism for providing technical assistance have 
recently resulted in a reduction in Australia&#8217;s expenditure on technical assistance from an 
average of 42 per cent of annual Australian ODA for the period 1996 to 2007, to an average 
of 35 per cent since 2008.  
</p>
<p>15. In 2007, AusAID committed to reduce its dependence on &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; aid projects 
that are implemented by private contractors and through the use of technical assistance, and 
to increase the use of &#8220;sector programs of support that work through recipient country 
development strategies and financial systems, together with other donors&#8221;.13 However, it 
has been reported that, while increasing, AusAID&#8217;s use of partner government systems to 
deliver aid remains &#8220;well-short of internationally agreed targets and behind progress of 
other donors&#8221;.14 According to OECD, only 41 per cent of Australia&#8217;s aid is delivered 
through partner countries&#8217; financial management systems and 24 per cent is subject to 
partner countries&#8217; procurement systems; falling short of the OECD Development 
Assistance Committee&#8217;s average of 47 and 44 per cent, respectively. In addition, only 30 
per cent of Australia&#8217;s aid flows are aligned to national priorities.15 Overall, Australian 
technical assistance spending does not yet fully comply with the recommendations 
contained in the international aid effectiveness agenda, which requires greater use of 
partner government systems to deliver aid.  
</p>
<p>16. The focus on technical assistance appears to be based on the view that poor 
governance underpinned by the lack of institutional capacity; inefficient administrative 
systems; lack of qualified personnel; and weak implementation are key obstacles to 
economic growth and reduction of poverty. Nevertheless, the use of technical assistance has 
been subject to criticism for failing to transfer skills and build local capacity, obstructing a 
sense of ownership by recipient countries and relying excessively on foreign rather than 
local advisers. In its <i>2009 Annual Review of Development Effectiveness</i>, the Office of 
Development Effectiveness observed that continued use of high levels of technical 
assistance in Australia&#8217;s aid programme was &#8220;likely to inhibit capacity development&#8221;.16 
</p>
<p>17. In the light of criticisms concerning the effectiveness of technical assistance, 
AusAID has recently undertaken a number of reforms, such as a joint AusAID/partner 
governments review of all adviser positions funded by AusAID; the development of a 
standardized remuneration framework for all advisers that includes performance 
assessments to ensure advisers are cost-effective; and the development of an operational 
policy on the use of advisers in the aid programme, which defines minimum standards for 
adviser planning, selection and performance management.17

 17 In February 2011, it was reported that the Government would, within two years, reduce by 27 per cent 
</p>
<p>the number of advisers employed by AusAID in 20 countries and that the tax-free salaries of the 
highest paid technical advisers (A$ 500,000) would be reduced by 25 per cent to ensure that AusAID 
did not pay above-market value for technical advisers. See Rowan Callick, &#8220;Rudd derails the aid 
gravy train,&#8221; <i>The Australian</i>, 15 February 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>18. The heavy AusAID reliance on for-profit contractors poses an additional challenge 
to aid effectiveness, inasmuch as it may create perverse incentives for consultancy firms to 
foster aid dependency instead of medium- to long-term sustainability and re-appropriation 
(of the development process) strategies by partner countries. The Independent Expert notes 
that AusAID has recently indicated its intention to move away from its reliance on 
contractors as its dominant model of aid delivery, and to focus on increasingly on working 
through programme-based approaches.18 
</p>
<p>19. Further, there is a tendency to focus aid efforts on government, rather than civil 
society.19 This undermines the role of local civil society organizations in delivering basic 
services and ensuring transparency and accountability, thus weakening the sustainability of 
the development effort as a whole. 
</p>
<p>20. The AusAID <i>Annual Review of Development Effectiveness 2009</i> has underlined the 
absence of a strong policy dialogue between Australia and its development partners and 
Australia&#8217;s struggle to agree with partner countries on how best to support their strategic 
priorities and use the available resources as a key limitation to the effectiveness of its aid 
programme.20 The review also noted the lack of a whole-of-government strategy and 
performance assessment framework for Australia&#8217;s engagement at the country level, which 
hinders Australia&#8217;s agreement with partner countries on development objectives and the 
best ways to achieve them.21 In addition, the support for monitoring and evaluation 
procedures of partner countries has been insignificant. In this regard, AusAID reported that 
the 2010 Country Strategy Development policy places a stronger emphasis on the role of 
policy dialogue in achieving shared development outcomes with partner countries. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Debt relief 
</b></p>
<p>21. Australia has provided debt relief within the Paris Club framework and contributed 
to multilateral debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. For 
the period 2010-2011, its contribution to the HIPC Initiative is estimated at 
A$ 22.6 million.22  
</p>
<p>22. In recent years, Australia has provided debt relief through a debt-for-development 
scheme in terms of which a portion of the debt owed to it is cancelled in exchange for 
investments by the debtor country in development programmes.23 Provided they are not 
overshadowed by new loans and they are executed in a manner that reveals the nature of the 
loans to be cancelled, these debt swaps may be an effective way to address the negative 
effects of debt in poor countries.  
</p>
<p>23. The Independent Expert commends Australia for its contribution to multilateral debt 
relief initiatives and urges the Government to use its influence to ensure that the provision 
of debt relief is not conditional on the implementation of harmful reforms. Despite their 
limitations, these schemes have afforded some heavily indebted poor countries fiscal space 
to increase spending on basic social services such as health and education. However, as the 
Independent Expert underlined in his 2009 report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/11/10, para. 31), the voluntary nature of these schemes has enabled some

been confined to the courts in &#8220;creditor-friendly&#8221; jurisdictions such as the United States of 
America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and various tax 
havens, recent events suggest that vulture funds will sue in other jurisdictions where the 
target debtor countries have assets. In November 2010, for example, the New South Wales 
Supreme Court gave judgement against the Democratic Republic of the Congo for a total of 
US$ 30.2 million plus 9 per cent interest and the costs of arbitration at the suit of a United 
States-based vulture fund, FG Hemisphere Associates, LLC seeking to recover a loan 
extended to the Mobutu regime in the 1980s.24 Based on the International Arbitration Act 
1974 (Cth), the judgment enforced two arbitral awards by the International Chamber of 
Commerce in 2003 in favour of Energoinvest, the interests in which the company later sold 
to FG Hemisphere Associates. The judgement effectively paves the way for the sale of 
shares held by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in an Australian mining company.   
</p>
<p>24. To safeguard the gains from multilateral debt initiatives to which countries such as 
Australia contribute and to prevent inequitable burden sharing among creditors, it is 
important that all States enact legislation to curb the predatory activities of vulture funds. 
Consequently, the Independent Expert urges the Government of Australia to enact 
legislation that would limit the ability of vulture funds to use Australian courts to recover 
extortionate amounts from poor countries, a process which erodes the gains from 
international debt relief efforts to which Australian taxpayers and others have contributed. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Australia&#8217;s foreign trade policy  
</b></p>
<p>25. The objective of Australia&#8217;s trade policy, as stated by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade, is to &#8220;open new markets, reduce barriers to trade and improve access for 
Australian goods and services&#8221;. This policy is implemented through bilateral agreements 
and multilateral engagement, including through membership of the World Trade 
Organization and regional trade arrangements.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Regional and free trade agreements 
</b></p>
<p>26. Australia has concluded a number of free trade agreements with other countries 
aimed at liberalizing trade in goods and services, as well as investments. In 2001, Australia 
and other member States of the Pacific Islands Forum25 signed the Pacific Agreement on 
Closer Economic Relations (PACER). Negotiations are currently under way to extend the 
agreement into a reciprocal free trade agreement known as PACER Plus. 
</p>
<p>27. During the Independent Expert&#8217;s consultations with Australian civil society 
organizations, concerns were raised about the potential impact of PACER Plus on a range 
of human rights such as the rights to health, education, work, food, development and an 
adequate standard of living. The Independent Expert underlines that States are obliged to 
ensure that international agreements that they enter into do not adversely affect the 
realization of human rights &#8211; either for people under their jurisdiction or for people in other 
</p>
<p>  
 24 <i>FG Hemisphere Associates LLC v Democratic Republic of [the] Congo</i> [2010] NSWSC 1394. 
 25 The member States of the Pacific Islands Forum include Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated 
</p>
<p>States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua 
New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>countries that are party to the agreement.26 Consequently, he urges the negotiating parties to 
consider undertaking ex ante and ex post human rights impact assessments of PACER Plus, 
including an analysis of its impact on gender equality.27 As Oxfam Australia has argued, 
such assessments would, inter alia, also provide the negotiating States with policy 
recommendations from which to develop effective and coherent trade policies that are 
consistent with their human rights and development commitments and priorities. 
</p>
<p>28. During his visit, the Independent Expert was informed that Australia has committed 
more than A$ 5.8 million to assist Pacific Island countries, through training, assistance and 
advice, to prepare for trade negotiations (including for PACER Plus). It has also provided 
A$ 65,000 for each Pacific Island country to undertake a study on, inter alia, the social 
impacts of PACER Plus. The Independent Expert is concerned, however, that procurement 
of services appears to be restricted to consultants selected by the Government of Australia. 
This raises issues about potential conflict of interest given that Australia is an interested 
party. It is important that any human rights impact assessment is undertaken by an 
independent and credible institution with the full and informed participation of 
communities in all negotiating countries.  
</p>
<p>29. A number of organizations also expressed concern that Australian development 
assistance might be used to induce Pacific Island countries to enter into potentially harmful 
free trade agreements and to implement detrimental macroeconomic and public sector 
reforms, thereby advancing Australia&#8217;s own economic interests rather than the development 
needs of its weaker regional neighbours.  
</p>
<p>30. Further, the Independent Expert was informed by representatives of AusAID that 
during the period 2008&#8211;2010, Australia funded training courses on trade negotiations at the 
Institute for International Trade at the University of Adelaide that were aimed at enhancing 
the trade policy knowledge and negotiation capacity of officials from Forum Island 
Countries.  
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert considers that perceptions of self-interested capacity-
building or consultancy services linked to PACER Plus may undermine the legitimacy of 
any regional agreement that may be concluded. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Export credit 
</b></p>
<p>32. Export credit has played an important role in Australia&#8217;s development assistance 
agenda. Like most developed countries, Australia has an export credit agency28 &#8211; the Export 
</p>
<p>  
 26 This obligation is underscored in Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations.  
 27 A human rights impact assessment would aim to evaluate how provisions of a new trade agreement 
</p>
<p>are likely to impact on the realisation of defined human rights. In August 2010, a number of Pacific 
Island civil society organizations called for the PACER-Plus negotiations to be put on hold, partly 
because there had been no assessment of the risks posed by the agreement to human rights such as the 
right to health and the right to food. See the 2010 Civil Society Statement to Pacific Island Forum 
Leaders regarding PACER-Plus negotiations, available at 
www.pang.org.fj/doc/Pacific_CSO_PACER_Plus_Moratorium_Statement.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 28 An export credit agency is a public agency that aims to promote creditor country exports by providing 
insurance, guarantees or loans for the export of goods and services. See International Monetary Fund, 
<i>External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users</i> (2003), appendix III, p. 256, available at 
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/eds/eng/guide/file6.pdf. A significant portion of financial support from 
export credit agencies targets large extractive industries which can pose a range of threats to 
environments and populations in developing countries (see Jubilee Australia, <i>Risky Business: Shining 
a Spotlight on Australia&#8217;s Export Credit Agency</i> (Sydney, 2009), pp. 15-18). Further, export credit 
and insurance often becomes sovereign debt in that importer Governments are frequently required to

<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), a Commonwealth statutory corporation &#8211; the 
mandate of which is to expand Australia&#8217;s international export trading capacity and 
facilitate export opportunities for Australian businesses.29 EFIC provides &#8220;finance and 
insurance solutions to assist Australian exporters overcome financial barriers when growing 
their business overseas&#8221;.30     
</p>
<p>33. EFIC operates two accounts: (a) a Commercial Account, with minimal Government 
involvement, that underwrites risk and operates at a profit; and (b) a National Interest 
Account, which covers transactions which are considered to be in the &#8220;national interest&#8221; 
and are undertaken under the direction of the Minister for Trade.  
</p>
<p>34. Australian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working on aid and 
development issues have expressed disquiet over the lack of transparency and 
accountability demonstrated by EFIC. Particular concerns relating to lack of due diligence, 
negative environmental and social impacts, human rights, and lack of consultation with 
affected communities have been raised over two EFIC-supported projects: the Gold Ridge 
Mine in Solomon Islands and the liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea.31 Civil 
society organizations have also expressed their concern that some of the debt emanating 
from EFIC transactions with neighbouring developing countries (particularly those incurred 
under the Development Import Finance Facility, which was a mixed credit-aid programme 
operating until 1996) may be odious or illegitimate and should therefore be cancelled.  
</p>
<p>35. Despite all these concerns, EFIC continues to resist calls to disclose details of its 
transactions, including those conducted under the National Interest Account. During his 
consultations with EFIC and advisers to the Minister for Trade, the Independent Expert was 
informed that EFIC was exempt from disclosing certain information because of commercial 
and international sensitivity.32 Nonetheless, the Independent Expert fully supports the view 
that the absence of transparency requirements raises serious questions about the agency&#8217;s 
accountability to Australian taxpayers and to citizens of the developing countries where it 
supports projects. Loans underwritten by the Government of Australia or guaranteed by the 
Governments of the countries where EFIC-supported projects are being implemented are 
matters of public concern. Consequently, he is of the view that EFIC should be required to 
publicly disclose information concerning its activities, including project assessment, 
decision-making and implementation and to undertake assessments of the human rights 
impact of its financing decisions (in addition to its environmental and social impact 
assessments). In particular, the Government of Australia should ensure that the activities of 
EFIC are fully compliant with Australia&#8217;s international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>  
provide counter-guarantees, and in the event of default by either domestic exporter or foreign 
importer, export credit agencies settle the claim or lose the value of loan repayments and the subject 
amount becomes debt owed by the importing country Government.

<p><b> IV. Solomon Islands: political and economic context  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>36. Solomon Islands is an archipelagic country consisting of over 900 islands and 
covering a land area of about 28,400 square kilometres. About 85 per cent of its estimated 
population of 530,000 live in rural areas. Subsistence agriculture is the main source of 
livelihoods while the formal economy remains small.  
</p>
<p>37. In 1998, ethnic tensions erupted over the distribution of resources and led to the 
breakdown of law and order. The situation continued to be precarious until the Regional 
Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) intervened in July 2003 to restore 
stability and begin the reconstruction of the country&#8217;s institutions and infrastructure. Since 
then, peace has been restored and considerable progress has been made in reconstruction 
and reform. Nevertheless, Solomon Islands remains vulnerable to conflict because many of 
the issues underlying the conflict remain unresolved.  
</p>
<p>38. During the period of civil unrest, income per capita decreased by 31.9 per cent and 
the economy was reduced to 31.6 per cent of its previous size. Only in 2009 did the per 
capita income equal its previous peak level of 1997.33 However, social indicators in the 
country remain among the worst in the region, with high poverty rates, high levels of urban 
unemployment and gender imbalances.  
</p>
<p>39. Natural conditions, such as the remoteness and geographic fragmentation of the 
country and vulnerability to climate change, pose a major obstacle to the country&#8217;s 
economic development. The country relies heavily on natural forest log exports for 
Government revenue, exports and employment. Manufacturing and other services are 
limited. Most of the food, energy, capital goods and consumer goods are imported, largely 
affecting the country&#8217;s balance of payments. In this context, foreign assistance provides 
much of the budget revenue and funds for capital spending, sustaining a large portion of the 
country&#8217;s economy.  
</p>
<p>40. The country was highly exposed to the impacts of the global recession due to its 
deteriorating growth prospects and high levels of poverty. Reduced demand for export 
commodities had an impact on logging output, resulting in a sharp drop in Government 
revenues. 
</p>
<p>41. The National Coalition for Reform and Advancement Government, which came into 
power in August 2010 and consists of members of several political parties, has committed 
to a comprehensive constitutional, social and economic reform programme over a four-year 
period.34 Given the fragility of Solomon Islands Governments, however, it is unclear 
whether the Government will be able to implement this programme. During the 
Independent Expert&#8217;s visit to the country the Government appeared to be on the brink of 
collapse with the resignation of some members.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. External debt and debt sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>42. In the years following the end of the tensions, the country&#8217;s external debt 
represented almost half of its gross domestic product (GDP). In October 2005, the 
Government met with representatives of Australia, the European Commission, the 
European Investment Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development in 
Honiara to discuss a debt relief proposal. The outcome of the discussions &#8211; the Honiara 
Club Agreement &#8211; sets out a debt payment moratorium and a reduction of debt stock 
subject to a number of conditions, including restructuring of domestic debt and adoption of 
a comprehensive debt management plan; a freeze on further borrowing or sovereign 
guarantees until the country reaches the &#8220;green light&#8221; status under the International 
Development Association&#8217;s debt distress rating system; and settlement of debts in 
accordance with debt restructuring agreements. Other conditions committed the 
Government to ensure macroeconomic stability, improve the performance of State-owned 
enterprises (including through privatization), improve infrastructure and streamline 
business regulation (including a new foreign investment law and tax reforms).35 
</p>
<p>43. The total external debt of the country (including arrears) as at 31 December 2010 
was SI$ 1 billion, representing 24 per cent of its GDP. This amount excluded other debt 
obligations (contingent liabilities) which were estimated at SI$ 65 million. The World Bank 
estimates that by 2011, the country&#8217;s debt will have decreased to 18 per cent of its GDP. 
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank recently assigned the country 
&#8220;yellow light&#8221; status, indicating a reduction in the risk of debt distress. Thus, Solomon 
Islands is expected to resume limited concessional borrowing from multilateral donors over 
the coming years.36 
</p>
<p>44. Despite the halt in borrowing in place since 2003, the reduction of its debt in terms 
of GDP and improvements in debt management, Solomon Islands remains vulnerable to 
debt distress. Although inflation has remained below 2 per cent throughout 2010, and 
foreign reserves have continued to increase due to donor and investment inflows and 
currency revaluation, it is expected that the exhaustion of natural forest logging resources 
will greatly affect Government revenue, the current account and foreign reserves in the 
medium term.37 
</p>
<p>45. Solomon Islands faces numerous difficulties in its attempts to achieve economic 
growth, self-sustaining development and freedom from the burden of unsustainable debt. 
The limitations imposed by unfavourable terms of trade, a challenging geography, a small 
economy that is heavily dependent on imports and exports from unsustainable natural forest 
logging, insufficient Government revenue and an underdeveloped productive sector make 
the country highly susceptible to external shocks as well as profoundly dependent on 
foreign aid to foster development and the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals. Despite these challenges and its poor records in poverty reduction and realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights, the country is not eligible for debt relief under the 
HIPC Initiative because its debt burden is below the applicable threshold.

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Debt situation and impact on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>46. The debt burden does not appear to have a negative impact on the realization of 
human rights in the country. Indeed, the reduced debt burden (as a result of implementation 
of commitments under the Honiara Club Agreement) and significant aid flows have 
provided the Government with some fiscal space for increased spending on human rights-
related basic social services. Rather, the weak institutional capacity of the Government 
(including the lack of appropriate national human rights and accountability mechanisms) 
continues to undermine the realization of human rights.  
</p>
<p>47. Structural reform remains a priority for creditors and the donor community, as 
stressed in the Honiara Club Agreement. The Government has adopted a number of 
economic reform measures to respond to macroeconomic stability and fiscal management 
requirements. In June 2010, the Government and IMF reached agreement on a 
US$ 18 million arrangement under the Standby Credit Facility, in support of the economic 
reform programme. However, there is widespread concern that a recent freeze on public 
sector spending (including a halt in recruitments and wage spending) may be linked to 
fiscal requirements of this programme and that such policy may undermine the efforts of 
development partners to build the human resources capacity of the Government. The 
implications of a freeze on recruitment and wage spending in a country where the public 
service represents an important source of employment can be pervasive, affecting not only 
development but also access to basic social services and the enjoyment of economic social 
and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>48. In November 2009, Taiwan Province of China approved a project that provides 
funds to enable the Government pay a loan provided by Exim Bank. Although this funding 
aims to alleviate the Government&#8217;s debt burden, it redirects aid from the achievement of 
immediate development goals (including the Millennium Development Goals) to objectives 
of macroeconomic stability and debt servicing. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Legal and accountability framework of Solomon Islands 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>49. Chapter II of the Constitution of Solomon Islands sets out the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of the individual. These are complemented by international standards in the 
core human rights treaties that the country has ratified.38  
</p>
<p>50. The Penal Code does not criminalize international offences such as torture and 
enforced disappearances. Other rights enshrined in the international human rights treaties to 
which the country is party have not yet been codified in national legislation. However, the 
Government is currently considering draft legislation on the rights of people with 
disabilities, on child protection and on discrimination against women. The Independent 
Expert welcomes these initiatives and urges the Government to expedite the enactment of 
this legislation. 
</p>
<p>  
 38 It is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It 
has signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has not ratified the main 
International Labour Organization conventions. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>51. Government institutions are fragile and insufficiently developed. There is an 
insufficient number of skilled personnel, while practices, norms and procedures lack 
formalization, transparency and harmonization. Much of the aid provided to the country 
since the end of the tensions has been directed to address these challenges and to enhance 
governance. 
</p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert is concerned about the insufficient monitoring of public 
affairs in Solomon Islands. There is no effective independent and autonomous mechanism 
to monitor the use and management of public funds and the performance of Government 
agencies, privatized companies and aid programmes. Although there is an Auditor General, 
this office is not financially independent and it depends on the Ministry of Public Service 
for its human resources requirements. In addition, it has many foreign technical advisers 
among its staff, including in senior positions. In these circumstances, the office cannot 
adequately and independently audit public expenditure and performance of donor 
programmes.39  
</p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert is also concerned about the lack of an independent national 
mechanism to monitor the implementation of human rights obligations and the lack of a 
national human rights action plan to inform Government policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Solomon Islands&#8217; national development policy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Priority areas  
</b></p>
<p>54. The Government&#8217;s Medium Term Development Strategy 2008-2010 identifies six 
priority areas: reconciliation and rehabilitation, national security and foreign relations, 
infrastructure development, social services sector, economic/productive sector, and civic 
affairs. The Government aims to strengthen development through a bottom-up and holistic 
approach that encompasses: the empowerment of the people through rural advancement 
strategies, the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals, the revitalization of the 
economy, improvement in law and order, provision of effective service delivery, and 
improvement of the devolution of powers and decision-making authority to people.40 
</p>
<p><b> B. Trade 
</b></p>
<p>55. Solomon Islands is a party to the Pacific Islands Country Trade Agreement, the 
Melanesian Spearhead Group Free Trade Area and PACER. It is also involved in the 
negotiations concerning PACER Plus and an economic partnership agreement with the 
European Union, as part of the Pacific Island States. 
</p>
<p>56. As a small developing country, Solomon Islands trade negotiations sometimes 
include non-reciprocal preferential access to industrialized economies, such as Australia 
and New Zealand, under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation 
Agreement, and to the European Union, under the Everything but Arms initiative for least 
developed countries.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>57. Despite these initiatives, Solomon Islands still faces enormous challenges in the 
trade sector that will require a profound commitment on the part of the Government and its 
development partners to ensure that new trade arrangements do not worsen the nation&#8217;s 
fragile economic and social situation.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>58. Solomon Islands receives a substantial amount of international aid per capita. ODA 
to the country has increased significantly following the end of the tensions in 2003, rising 
from US$ 21 million in 2000 to US$ 200 million in 2009. According to OECD, aid 
represented the equivalent of 67.3 per cent of GNI in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Australian development assistance 
</b></p>
<p>59. Australia is the largest donor in the Solomon Islands, accounting for nearly 60 per 
cent of the Government&#8217;s development budget.41 Its assistance is provided within the 
framework of the Australia-Solomon Islands Partnership for Development signed in 2009 
which sets out four priority areas for funding: (a) improved service delivery; (b) improved 
economic livelihoods; (c) improved economic infrastructure; and (d) addressing economic 
and fiscal challenges. Total ODA committed for the period 2010-2011 is A$ 227.7 million. 
Australia also funds 96 per cent of the costs of RAMSI.42 About 80 per cent of Australian 
ODA is delivered in the form of technical assistance, while operational costs and equipment 
account for 14 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. 
</p>
<p>60. Australian aid mostly funds long-term projects addressing institutional and 
legislative reform, but it also provides some project funding. AusAID plays a vital role in 
the health sector, providing capacity-building and direct budget support to the Ministry of 
Health and Medical Services, including through a sector-wide approach.  
</p>
<p>61. As stated earlier in the present report, Australian technical assistance typically 
involves deploying large numbers of advisers to work in partner government institutions. In 
Solomon Islands, the majority of technical advisers are Australian (see below). Most of the 
AusAID assistance focusing on the restoration of law and order has been implemented 
through the work of officials of the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Finance 
and Deregulation, and the Treasury. These officials have taken up line positions in the 
relevant Solomon Islands Government departments.43 Australian advisers have also been 
deployed in the ministries of health, infrastructure, agriculture and livestock, and rural 
development.44

<p><b> B. Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands 
</b></p>
<p>62. The mandate of RAMSI, which consists of police, military and civilian personnel 
and the Participating Police Force, is contained in the RAMSI Treaty,45 the Government of 
Australia&#8217;s 2003 Framework for Strengthened Assistance for Solomon Islands: Proposed 
Scope and Requirements, and the Solomon Islands&#8217; Facilitation of International Assistance 
Act 2003.46 
</p>
<p>63. In 2009, the Solomon Islands Government and RAMSI agreed a Partnership 
Framework that has three pillars: law and justice, economic governance and machinery of 
government.47 It is however debatable whether, as a weak, heavily aid-dependent State, 
Solomon Islands has the capacity to engage on an equal basis with RAMSI to reflect a 
genuine partnership arrangement.  
</p>
<p>64. It is evident that RAMSI has successfully achieved its key initial objective of 
restoring law and order and preserving security in the country and that many Solomon 
Islanders value this role.48 However, there is a perception among some that RAMSI is 
running a parallel government in the country and effectively undermining the country&#8217;s 
sovereignty.49 To compound matters, there is no set time frame for the withdrawal of 
RAMSI.50 In its 2009 report, the National Parliament&#8217;s Foreign Relations Committee 
observed that although sovereignty issues have been justifiably raised, these have largely 
been addressed by the development of new mechanisms for enhancing dialogue between 
the Government, RAMSI and the Pacific Islands Forum and notably through the 
Partnership Framework.51 
</p>
<p>65. Following the achievement of its priority objectives upon arrival in Solomon 
Islands, RAMSI has turned its attention to longer term aspects of its mandate, including 
economic growth and machinery of government. This has entailed the deployment of large 
numbers of personnel and advisers, the majority of whom are Australians and New 
Zealanders (despite the fact that RAMSI is supposed to be a regional mission) in key 
Government institutions. According to information available to the Independent Expert, as 
of November 2010, there were 150 civilian personnel working for RAMSI, including those 
in the Office of the Special Coordinator, civilian programme support and management staff 
and advisers in ministries of the Government of Solomon Islands.52 This number comprised 
118 Australians, 10 New Zealanders, 9 Fijians, 5 Papua New Guineans, 2 Canadians, 2

deployed to Solomon Islands to assist in the restoration of law and order and security. Article 2 of the 
Treaty provides that the visiting contingent is to assist in the maintenance of law and order in the 
Solomon Islands. 
</p>
<p> 46 The long title of the Act states that it is an Act &#8220;to make provisions for the requesting of international 
assistance for the restoration of law and order in Solomon Islands, and for matters connected 
therewith or incidental thereto&#8221;.

reduced slightly to 131, made up of 100 Australians, 10 New Zealanders, 10 Fijians, 3 
Papua New Guineans, 2 Canadians, 2 British, 1 Indian, 1 Tongan, 1 Nigerian and 1

</p>
<p>66. There is a concern that this approach to capacity-building may hamper, rather than 
promote, the empowerment of local professionals, both in Government and civil society. A 
better balance therefore needs to be struck between the need for effective and efficient 
administration in the short term and the strengthening of local capacity in the longer term. 
Failure to appropriately and satisfactorily build capacity will exacerbate dependency, 
especially in view of the fact that more than seven years after the RAMSI intervention, 
Government structures remain largely aid-dependent, with insufficiently developed local 
human resources and no self-sustaining local institutions. Although the Partnership 
Framework establishes condition-based timelines to reduce the RAMSI engagement in 
specific programme areas as the Government&#8217;s capacity grows, it does not set any specific 
time frame for RAMSI to exit the country. The Independent Expert calls upon the 
Government and its development partners to develop a clear strategy for the exit of 
RAMSI.  
</p>
<p>67. Some Government officials expressed the concern that some of the foreign technical 
advisers were not sufficiently qualified for the positions to which they were recruited and 
for which they received higher remuneration packages compared to their local 
counterparts.54  
</p>
<p>68. There are also concerns about violations of human rights and international labour 
standards by private companies contracted to provide services to RAMSI as well as 
allegations of heavy-handedness by some members of the PPF. One of the most widely 
publicised cases is that of Patrick Defence Logistics (PDL), an Australian private company 
contracted to provide catering and logistical support to RAMSI in 2003. PDL engaged a 
number of local workers. In 2005, the workers made allegations against the company 
concerning ill-treatment including racial and physical abuse, unilateral changes of terms of 
employment, and poor working conditions. These allegations remain unresolved.55 
According to information received by the Independent Expert, PDL has made the dubious 
claim that it is immune from legal proceedings in terms of the Facilitation of International 
Assistance Act which provides RAMSI with immunity from legal proceedings in Solomon 
Islands.56 The Independent Expert is seriously concerned about reports of threats of 
physical harm allegedly made by representatives of RAMSI and PDL against an individual 
who has actively supported the local workers in their quest for justice. Such incidents may 
undermine the positive contributions made by RAMSI. It is therefore important that these 
incidents are addressed in a transparent manner by both RAMSI and the Government of 
Solomon Islands. In addition, the Independent Expert considers that the countries of 
</p>
<p>  
 53 An AusAID survey on the use of technical assistance in selected Pacific countries found that Solomon 
</p>
<p>Islands had the highest technical assistance expenditure. AusAID, &#8220;Mapping technical assistance 
inputs and costs across Australia&#8217;s overseas aid program,&#8221; 2008 (draft), cited in ANAO, <i>AusAID&#8217;s 
Management</i>, p. 87.  
</p>
<p> 54 Others have expressed similar sentiments, arguing that RAMSI is an opportunity for young Australian 
bureaucrats to gain experience working in Pacific island States. See Oxfam Australia and Oxfam New 
Zealand, <i>Bridging the Gap between State and Society: New directions for the Solomon Islands</i> (2006), 
p. 21. See also CDA, <i>Field Visit Report,</i> pp. 13-15.

<p>nationality of the visiting contingent and private contractors have a responsibility to ensure 
that the activities of their nationals do not violate the human rights of Solomon Islanders.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of other development partners 
</b></p>
<p>69. Other development partners are involved in a broad range of programmes across 
different sectors in Solomon Islands. The New Zealand Agency for International 
Development (NZAID) provides direct budget support to the education sector and has 
programmes in a number of other areas. It also provides funding to RAMSI. Japan provides 
significant tied grant aid and has a long-standing volunteer programme. Taiwan Province of 
China funds a number of different sectors but focuses on the Rural Constituency 
Development Fund, which provides grants directly to Members of Parliament to support 
their constituencies. It also supports short-term projects responding to different Government 
needs, such as construction and infrastructure development, education and training, rural 
activities and tourism.  
</p>
<p>70. Multilateral donors include the European Union, ADB, the World Bank and UNDP. 
About 59 per cent of European Union funds are devoted to the education sector while the 
rest are directed towards areas such as rural advancement, energy, forestry, fisheries, water 
facilities and transport, support for non-State actors, human rights and community 
development. Of all development aid from the European Union, 61 per cent is delivered in 
the form of operating expenses, 26 per cent as technical assistance and 13 per cent for 
equipment. ADB provides grant aid focusing on two areas: (a) transport infrastructure and 
(b) economic restructuring through &#8220;technical assistance on state-owned-enterprise reform 
and private sector promotion through reform of corporate and business laws and 
regulations&#8221;.57 The World Bank provides assistance under an Interim Strategy Note which 
identifies three priority areas: (a) addressing surmountable barriers to growth (including 
promoting greater macroeconomic and fiscal stability); (b) enhancing the benefits of 
regional and global engagement (including attracting investment); and (c) supporting 
improved public administration and management (including promoting an effective public 
administration and improving management of public resources).58  
</p>
<p>71. The Country Programme Action Plan (2008-2012) agreed between the Government 
and UNDP outlines the areas of support for United Nations agencies in the country. These 
are equitable economic growth and the Millennium Development Goals, good governance 
and human rights, crisis prevention and recovery, and sustainable environmental 
management.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Role of civil society  
</b></p>
<p>72. There are a number of local and international NGOs operating in the country. Many 
of the international NGOs are Australian while some of the local NGOs have Australian or 
New Zealand partner organizations. The main donors to the NGO sector are Australia and 
New Zealand. However, some local NGOs with which the Independent Expert had 
discussions indicated that they received no support from the donor community. For this 
reason, they are not as robust as their international counterparts. This is regrettable since 
local NGOs can play a critical accountability and aid-delivery role in a cultural 
environment that may not be fully appreciated by their international counterparts. 
Development partners in Solomon Islands need to recognize local civil society as an

</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>important driver of sustainable human development and accordingly enhance their support 
to local organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>73. Solomon Islands relies heavily on foreign assistance to sustain its economy and for 
budgetary revenue, and has one of the highest levels of aid per capita in the world and as a 
percentage of GDP. There are two main challenges arising from this. First, due to its weak 
absorptive capacity, the Government of Solomon Islands is overwhelmed by the massive 
inflows of aid resources. Second, its aid dependency may render the Government more 
accountable to donors for its actions, rather than to its population.   
</p>
<p>74. There appears to be a lack of clear alignment of donor strategies with the 
Government&#8217;s development priorities, which undermines the Government development 
agenda. An example in this regard is the Rural Development Program. While the 
Government implements its Rural Advancement Policy through the Ministry of Rural 
Development, which it maintains is the appropriate ministry, donors are funding a separate 
rural development programme through the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid 
Coordination and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.   
</p>
<p>75. The Government has also expressed its disquiet about the fact that most donor funds 
are off-budget and do not use the country system, and that local capacity-building, where 
skills and knowledge are effectively transferred to locals through foreign technical 
assistance, remains largely unachieved. A related problem is the lack of knowledge by 
Government officials of the standards concerning the aid effectiveness agenda, which 
renders them easily amenable to donor preferences as to how aid is to be delivered in line 
ministries. 
</p>
<p>76. There are widespread concerns, particularly among civil society organizations in 
Solomon Islands and Australia, that donors may be advocating reforms, such as reduction 
of public sector spending, privatization, trade liberalization and financial liberalization.59 In 
2010, for example, the Government received donor budget support linked to the 
implementation of a number of reforms to improve management of public expenditure. 
There is evidence that these reforms often have an adverse impact on the enjoyment of 
human rights, especially by the poorest and most vulnerable. It is therefore important that 
the effect that these reforms may have on poverty, inequality and the potential for conflict 
in the country is carefully considered before they are implemented. 
</p>
<p>77. Similar concerns were expressed regarding the reforms that are designed to attract 
foreign investment, especially in the extractive industries sector. The Independent Expert 
underscores that the benefits of investments must accrue to the people, especially the 
poorest, rather than one-sidedly enrich foreign investors, and that the country&#8217;s resources 
must be used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. 
</p>
<p>78. Solomon Islands remains vulnerable to conflict, as many of the underlying causes of 
the tensions remain. Notable among these are land tenure, poor access to basic services and 
public resources, a narrow economic base and inequitable distribution of economic 
resources. 
</p>
<p>  
 59 For example, the Government of Australia has proposed changes in the country&#8217;s economic policy, 
</p>
<p>involving privatization, public sector reform, fiscal and budgetary reform and provision of more 
efficient infrastructure. See Oxfam,<i> Bridging the Gap</i>, p. 19. ADB is also actively promoting reform 
of State-owned enterprises and investment reform. See ADB, &#8220;Solomon Islands: Interim Country 
Partnership Strategy 2009-2011&#8221;, August 2009, pp. 9-10. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Coordination and monitoring of development assistance 
</b></p>
<p>79. It was evident during the Independent Expert&#8217;s visit that there is inadequate 
oversight of the aid projects being implemented in the country. The Government does not 
have a mechanism to monitor and evaluate the impact of foreign assistance &#8211; it relies on 
donor mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>80. Although the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid Coordination is mandated 
to coordinate all donor programmes in the country, it has yet to develop a strategy for 
executing this mandate.60 Among bilateral donors, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the 
Republic of Korea liaise with the Ministry in deciding on what and how to disburse their 
aid, while Taiwan Province of China works with the Office of the Prime Minister and 
Cabinet. Similarly, the European Union and United Nations agencies coordinate with the 
Ministry, while the World Bank and ADB use the Ministry of Finance and Treasury as their 
focal point. 
</p>
<p>81. Such lack of harmonization may undermine the ability of the Government to 
adequately oversee the disbursement of funds, monitor the implementation of development 
programmes, and assess their impact on the ground. Moreover, it may impede the clear 
alignment of national and donor development strategies and, thus, the effectiveness of aid 
and the achievement of sustainable results. The large amount of aid being disbursed in 
Solomon Islands imposes a number of responsibilities on the part of the Government and its 
development partners. Both must coordinate their actions and put in place effective 
monitoring mechanisms to allow the most transparent, accountable, efficient and effective 
use of development assistance funds. 
</p>
<p>82. In March 2009, the Government and six development partners (ADB, AusAID, the 
European Union, NZAID, RAMSI and the World Bank) established a forum for policy 
dialogue, known as the Core Economic Working Group. However, this forum excludes 
other key development partners in the country, including the United Nations Country Team. 
The exclusion of the United Nations Country Team, in particular, is inopportune since it is 
in the best position to pool resources from many donors, which offers advantages of scale 
and lower transaction costs for the aid-recipient country, and to bring donors together to 
better coordinate aid and maximize its impact. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Impact of foreign aid on human rights and the Millennium 
Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Government of Solomon Islands has included the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals as a priority its National Development Plan. In addition, 
much of the aid delivered by development partners has focused on the achievement of these 
goals, and the Government and its development partners have tried to align their strategies 
in support of the realization of these goals.  
</p>
<p>84. The country has made important progress with respect to the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals on health and education, as these sectors have received 
</p>
<p>  
 60 According to the World Bank, in 2009, there were a total of 126 programmes across 26 Government 
</p>
<p>agencies. This presents a challenge for coordination. See World Bank, &#8220;Interim strategy note&#8221;, p. 7. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>greater support from development partners such as Australia and New Zealand.61 The 
country is likely to achieve universal primary education by 2015. It has made important 
progress in reducing child and maternal mortality, and is on track to meeting these goals by 
2015.62 However, progress has been inconsistent with respect to Goal 6 on combating 
HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. The incidence of malaria has considerably 
decreased and the rate for curing tuberculosis has risen. Progress is not as clear with respect 
to the combating of HIV/AIDS, as it is estimated that the number of people with the disease 
is likely to be underrepresented, due to lack of reporting and testing. 
</p>
<p>85. There has been mixed progress concerning the eradication of extreme poverty and 
hunger, without large proportions of people living in extreme poverty, but with many &#8220;cash 
poor&#8221; or people living just above the poverty line. Mixed progress has also been seen with 
regards to gender equality and empowerment of women, with improvements in female 
representation in primary education and less advancement in secondary education and 
employment in the informal sector.  
</p>
<p>86. Environmental sustainability has shown insufficient progress, with deforestation and 
logging not being adequately addressed. In addition, the goal of a global partnership for 
development is not likely to be achieved by 2015.63 Finally, much donor and Government 
attention has been devoted to improving accountability and representation in public affairs 
and better governance. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to attain international 
standards in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights-based approach to development assistance 
</b></p>
<p>87. The need for a human rights framework to guide the design, implementation and 
monitoring of development strategies has not been addressed by any of the relevant actors 
in the country. Human rights are an essential part of any sustainable development strategy; 
they enhance the effectiveness of aid programmes and contribute to achieving sustainable 
results, while ensuring that development challenges are adequately and equitably addressed 
and that the fundamental rights of the people are fully respected in the process.   
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Development partners have made a significant contribution to rebuilding 
Solomon Islands after years of conflict between 1998 and 2003. The substantial aid 
(including development assistance from Australia) provided within the framework of 
international assistance and cooperation has helped Solomon Islands make important 
progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals on health and 
education. It is also widely accepted that RAMSI has helped restore law and order as 
well as basic fiscal and economic management in the Solomon Islands. Nevertheless, a 
number of challenges remain. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 61 In 2009, 24 per cent of all education expenditure was funded by development partners, while 35 per 
</p>
<p>cent of all health spending was funded by development partners See World Bank, &#8220;Interim strategy 
note&#8221;, p. 7. 
</p>
<p> 62 According to the World Bank, however, Solomon Islands is unlikely to achieve several of the Goals, 
including those relating to child mortality, prevalence of disease and school enrolment. See World 
Bank, &#8220;Interim strategy note&#8221;, p. 10.

</p>
<p>89.<b> The Independent Expert acknowledges the numerous challenges faced by 
Solomon Islands in its attempts to achieve economic growth, self-sustaining 
development and freedom from the burden of unsustainable debt. The limitations 
imposed by unfavourable terms of trade, a difficult geography, a small economy 
heavily reliant on imports and unsustainable logging, insufficient Government 
revenues, an underdeveloped productive sector, and high dependency on foreign aid 
make the country highly vulnerable to external shocks. He also acknowledges the 
efforts made by the Government to address these challenges, and the support 
provided by development partners in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Based on his findings as outlined in this report, the Independent Expert makes 
the following recommendations, addressed to the Governments of Australia and 
Solomon Islands as well as to other development partners of Solomon Islands.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government of Australia 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Independent Expert commends the Government of Australia for its 
commitment to increase its ODA to 0.5 per cent of Australian GNI by 2015-2016. 
Nevertheless, he urges the Government to adopt a clear road map for the achievement 
of the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNI.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> He also commends Australia&#8217;s policy decision to use, for the most part, grants, 
rather than loans as development assistance. He calls upon the Government to ensure 
that Australian development assistance and trade programmes do not advocate public 
sector and policy reforms which might have adverse impacts on the enjoyment of 
human rights, especially by the poorest and most vulnerable.  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Independent Expert is concerned about the lack of a human rights-based 
focus in Australia&#8217;s aid programme. In order to adequately and fairly respond to the 
development challenges in recipient countries while promoting the fundamental rights 
of the citizens of these countries, human rights should inform the design and delivery 
of Australian aid. Adopting a human rights-based approach would enhance the 
effectiveness and sustainability of Australia&#8217;s development aid programme. Further, 
such an approach would be critical for achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
because it provides a framework for addressing the root causes of poverty: inequality, 
discrimination, exclusion and disempowerment. The Independent Expert endorses the 
recommendation by the Australian Human Rights Commission concerning the 
establishment of a strategic partnership with AusAID to assist AusAID with 
incorporating human rights in its development assistance programme. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The current review of aid effectiveness is an invaluable opportunity for the 
Government to ensure that human rights become an overarching objective of 
Australian development work, and that the processes and practices of Australian 
agencies engaged in development assistance, particularly AusAID, are anchored in a 
human rights framework based on the international human rights instruments to 
which Australia is party. In addition, Australia&#8217;s development assistance should 
underpin people&#8217;s entitlement to basic standards of living, freedom from 
discrimination and participation, as well as transparency and accountability in public 
affairs.  
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> To ensure that development strategies do not negatively affect the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights and progress towards the Millennium 
Development Goals in recipient countries, AusAID should undertake human rights 
impact assessments to inform the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 
of its development programmes.   </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Australia&#8217;s over-reliance on technical assistance is a matter for concern. 
Without a clear strategy to move away from support through technical assistance to 
partner government&#8217;s institutions, local capacity development will be inhibited and 
never become self-sustainable, thus hindering the effectiveness and sustainability of 
aid programmes. Consideration should also be given to reducing the management of 
aid projects by private contractors.  
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Besides supporting capacity-building for government in recipient countries, 
Australian aid programmes should dedicate more efforts to sustain the work of local 
civil society organizations, as they can play a vital role in ensuring public participation 
and accountability, as well as the sustainability of aid programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> With regard to regional trade negotiations, development assistance should not 
be used as a means of inducing Pacific island countries to enter into trade agreements. 
Further, Australia should support the undertaking of independent and credible 
assessments of the potential human rights impacts &#8211; positive and negative &#8211; of its 
trade agreements with regional partners, such as PACER Plus.   
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Independent Expert is concerned about the lack of transparency in the 
activities undertaken by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), 
particularly in view of the fact that some of the projects it supports may have adverse 
environmental and social impacts in the countries where they are implemented. The 
Government should implement measures to ensure accountability and transparency 
in EFIC operations, particularly those undertaken under its National Interest 
Account.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>While welcoming Australia&#8217;s contributions to multilateral debt relief initiatives, 
the Independent Expert is concerned that the lack of domestic legislation to curb the 
predatory activities of vulture funds is providing opportunities for these funds to use 
Australia&#8217;s courts to recover exorbitant amounts on debts they purchased at deep 
discounts. Ultimately, this undermines Australia&#8217;s contributions to multilateral debt 
relief schemes. Consequently, the Independent Expert calls upon the Government of 
Australia to bolster its commitment to debt relief by urgently enacting legislation to 
limit the ability of vulture funds to use Australian courts at the expense of both 
Australian taxpayers and the citizens of the poor countries for whose benefit it 
contributes to multilateral debt relief. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Government of Solomon Islands 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Solomon Islands lacks an adequate human rights framework underpinning its 
development strategy and ensuring public accountability. The Independent Expert 
urges the Government to adopt a rights-based approach to the design and 
implementation of its national development strategy. In addition, the Government 
should adopt a national human rights action plan as recommended in the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, and establish a national human rights 
institution in full compliance with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). It is 
also very important that the country ratifies the core international human rights and 
International Labour Organization treaties to which it is not yet party, and ensures 
that the Constitution and domestic legislation fully recognize the rights elaborated in 
these instruments. While he urges the Government to avail itself of the technical 
assistance offered in this regard by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Commonwealth Secretariat, the 
Independent Expert urges the country&#8217;s development partners to support these 
initiatives as a matter of priority.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/37/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>102.<b> The Independent Expert noted with concern the insufficient coordination of 
development strategies between the Government and the donor community, as well as 
the lack of a regulatory environment that guarantees a transparent, accountable and 
people-centred delivery of aid. Efforts should be devoted to ensure adequate 
coordination of aid delivery, and to put in place effective and harmonized monitoring 
mechanisms to guarantee efficient and transparent use of funds and to assess the 
impact of development aid. The Government should take full responsibility for the 
direction that aid takes in the country.  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The unsatisfactory monitoring of public affairs in Solomon Islands, including 
the use and management of aid funds and debt management, underscores the need for 
the Government to urgently establish an independent mechanism to monitor the use 
and management of public funds and the performance of Government agencies and 
privatized companies, as well as aid programmes. Such mechanism should be 
financially and institutionally independent and it should report directly and regularly 
to Parliament. Consideration should also be given to including provisions in the 
country&#8217;s Constitution to ensure effective Parliamentary oversight of loan contraction, 
use and management. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Other development partners  
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Independent Expert welcomes the support provided to Solomon Islands by 
its development partners. However, he considers that it is equally important for the 
country&#8217;s development partners to promote self-sustaining economic growth and 
human development and to ensure that the country is able to break the cycle of aid 
dependency. Donor interventions should support the Government&#8217;s development 
strategy without undermining its leadership role. Efforts should also be made to 
design, in partnership with the Government, a medium-term exit strategy for the 
development assistance provided to the country.  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The Independent Expert urges development partners to better coordinate their 
aid activities in the country and to ensure the close and clear alignment of their 
development agenda with the development priorities of the Government of Solomon 
Islands, in order to guarantee national ownership of the development agenda.  
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> Effective capacity-building should promote, rather than hinder, the 
empowerment of local professionals, both in Government and civil society. There is a 
need to reduce the excessively large number of technical advisers deployed in 
Government institutions. Greater effort should be directed towards affording 
Solomon Islanders the opportunity to assume responsibility and there should be a 
clear timetable for the capacity-building endeavour.  
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> Development assistance programmes should avoid prescribing or supporting 
the implementation of policy and structural reforms that may adversely impact on the 
enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, and that 
may expose the country to a risk of renewed conflict.
