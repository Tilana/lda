<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Nineteenth session 
</b>Agenda item 4 
<b>Human rights situation that require the Council&#8217;s attention  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the International Commission of 
Inquiry on Libya</b>*  **  *** 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> In its resolution S-15/1, the Human Rights Council established an international 
commission of inquiry on Libya and gave it the mandate to investigate all alleged 
violations of international human rights law in Libya, to establish the facts and 
circumstances of such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to 
identify those responsible, to make recommendations, in particular, on accountability 
measures, all with a view to ensuring that those individuals responsible are held 
accountable. 
</p>
<p> The Commission of Inquiry conducted its investigations applying the international 
legal regimes dictated by the situation. It concluded that international crimes, specifically 
crimes against humanity and war crimes, had been committed by Qadhafi forces in Libya. 
Acts of murder, enforced disappearance and torture were perpetrated within the context of a 
widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. The Commission found 
additional violations including unlawful killing, individual acts of torture and ill-treatment, 
attacks on civilians, and rape. 
</p>
<p> The Commission also concluded that the anti-Qadhafi forces, the <i>thuwar</i>, had 
committed serious violations, including war crimes and breaches of international human 
rights law, the latter continuing at the time of the present report. It found these violations to 
include unlawful killing, arbitrary arrest, torture, enforced disappearance, indiscriminate 
attacks, and pillage. It found in particular that the <i>thuwar</i> were targeting the Tawergha and 
other communities. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
 ** See also document A/HRC/19/CRP.1. 
 *** On 16 September 2011, pursuant to a request submitted by the National Transitional 
</p>
<p>Council to the Protocol and Liaison Service of the United Nations, the previous official and 
short forms of the State (respectively, the Socialist People&#8217;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) were replaced by the name &#8220;Libya&#8221;.  
</p>

<p> The Commission concluded that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
had conducted a highly precise campaign with a demonstrable determination to avoid 
civilian casualties. On limited occasions, the Commission confirmed civilian casualties and 
found targets that showed no evidence of military utility. It was unable to draw conclusions 
in such instances on the basis of the information provided by NATO, and therefore 
recommends further investigations. 
</p>
<p> The interim Government faces many challenges in overcoming a legacy of more 
than 40 years of serious human rights violations and deterioration of the legislative 
framework, judicial and national institutions. It has nevertheless expressed a commitment 
to human rights and taken positive steps to establish mechanisms for accountability. The 
Government is gradually restoring the judiciary by reopening courts and recalling judges, 
and there has been some progress in the transfer of detainees to central Government 
control. 
</p>
<p> The Commission is nevertheless concerned by the failure to hold the <i>thuwar</i> 
committing serious violations to account. Libyan authorities can break with the Qadhafi 
legacy by enforcing the law equally, investigating all abuses &#8211; irrespective of the 
perpetrator &#8211; and ensuring that amnesty processes comply with the State&#8217;s obligations 
under international law. 
</p>
<p> To give effect to its commitment to improve the human rights situation in Libya, the 
interim Government will need considerable support from the United Nations and the 
international community.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 25 February 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-15/1 on the 
situation of human rights in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in which the Council decided, 
inter alia, to dispatch an independent, international commission of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 March 2011, the President of the Human Rights Council established the 
Commission of Inquiry and appointed its three members: Asma Khader (Jordan), Philippe 
Kirsch (Canada), and M. Cherif Bassiouni (Egypt). The President also designated Mr. 
Bassiouni as Chairperson, a role taken over by Mr. Kirsch in October 2011. The Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights supported the Commission with 
a secretariat. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution S-15/1, the Human Rights Council requested the Commission to 
investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the crimes 
perpetrated and where possible, to identify those responsible, to make recommendations, in 
particular, on accountability measures, all with a view to ensuring that those individuals 
responsible are held accountable. Given the referral of the events in Libya to the 
International Criminal Court by the Security Council, the Commission also considered the 
events in the light of international criminal law. 
</p>
<p>4. On 15 June 2011, the Commission submitted a report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/17/44), in which it set out its findings. In its resolution 17/17, the Council 
extended the mandate of the Commission in the light of the extensive and ongoing 
allegations of abuses, and requested it to present a second report to the Council at its 
nineteenth session.  
</p>
<p>5. In its previous report, the Commission noted that the legal regimes applicable during 
each phase of the conflict differed. International humanitarian law and international human 
rights law applied throughout phase II (armed conflict). With the end of armed conflict 
(phase III), international human rights law became predominant.  6. As in the case of its first report, the Commission took a cautious approach when 
assessing the information gathered. It relied, where possible, on its own observations and 
first-hand accounts. It bore in mind the fact that it was not seeking evidence of a standard to 
support a criminal conviction, but rather making an assessment based on a &#8220;balance of 
probabilities&#8221; to determine whether a violation had occurred.  
</p>
<p>7. The Commission faced a number of significant challenges. Security and 
administrative difficulties prevented a return to the field until October 2011 and no 
substantive investigations were possible before December 2011. There were also logistical 
difficulties in the Commission&#8217;s access to places and individuals. 
</p>
<p>8. Notwithstanding these constraints, the Commission was able to gather substantial 
evidence. The present report is strictly limited in length and allows only for a general 
summary of the findings on some of the most serious allegations investigated.1 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>9.<b> </b>The Commission is grateful to the new Government of Libya, other States, United 
Nations agencies, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other organizations 
who gave assistance to the commission. It is especially appreciative of the valuable 
information provided by victims and witnesses of violations  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A more comprehensive account of the findings of the Commission of Inquiry (A/HRC/19/CRP.1), 
</p>
<p>including examples of significant evidence, is available on the website of the Human Rights Council. </p>


<p><b> II. Background  
</b></p>
<p>10. It is not possible to understand the current conditions in Libya without 
understanding the damage to the fabric of society caused by decades of corruption, serious 
human rights violations and sustained repression of any opposition.2  
</p>
<p>11. In the present report, the Commission focuses on alleged violations committed by all 
parties. Given the shift in power, a significant amount of the present report focuses on 
abuses by those who rose up against the Government of Muammar Qadhafi. While major 
abuses are still occurring, the difference between the past and the present is that those 
responsible for abuses now are not part of a system of brutality sanctioned by the central 
Government. The Commission is cognizant of the challenges facing the new Libyan 
leadership in rebuilding a country left by the Qadhafi Government devoid of independent 
institutions, a civil society, political parties and a judiciary able to provide justice and 
redress. 
</p>
<p>12. Few officials spoken to by the Commission demonstrated any real understanding of 
basic legal and human rights standards. Most existing prisons do not meet basic standards. 
Prison guards and police exhibited little concept of prisoners&#8217; rights. Judges, prosecutors, 
the judicial police and others involved in the administration of justice and detention centres 
require training in human rights standards. Existing Libyan laws will need to be repealed or 
amended. The judicial system is not functioning effectively and suffers from the legacy of 
being used as a tool of repression. The vast majority of detainees are still held outside the 
legal framework, despite efforts to centralize detentions. 
</p>
<p>13. Some senior Government officials expressed their commitment to human rights. 
They failed, however, to publicly condemn violations taking place since the fall of the 
Qadhafi Government. In meetings with the Commission, Government officials emphasized 
the precariousness of the security situation, the weakness of the national police and judicial 
police forces and the inability of the central authorities to enforce the rule of law. The 
Commission acknowledges these difficulties, and welcomes the Government&#8217;s plans to 
disarm militias and to integrate fighters into the national army or the police force. A law on 
transitional justice and a law on amnesty were recently adopted.3 Delays in the 
administration of justice, however, increase the risk of individual victims or their family 
members taking the law into their own hands.  
</p>
<p>14. The Commission gathered information on the military forces and structures of the 
Qadhafi Government and the <i>thuwar</i>.4 In many instances, the Commission was able to 
assign responsibility to specific individuals. In most cases, the commission withheld the 
names of individuals believed to hold responsibility for violations, partly to prevent 
reprisals and partly to avoid prejudicing future fair trials. The Commission will, however, 
provide a list of such individuals to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights.

<p><b> III. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Excessive use of force</b>5<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>15. In its first report, the Commission of Inquiry concluded that Qadhafi forces had used 
excessive force against demonstrators in February 2011. It subsequently conducted more 
than 60 interviews in its investigation of this issue. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>16. The Commission interviewed medical personnel on duty during the protests. 
Testimony, medical records and photographs received show predominantly head and chest 
wounds, consistent, in some cases, with the use of high-calibre weapons. It also received a 
videotape of a purported senior regime figure giving instructions to &#8220;crush&#8221; demonstrators 
in Benghazi, and received a first-hand account of orders given by Colonel Qadhafi to 
suppress demonstrations &#8220;with all means necessary&#8221;. While former Qadhafi officials 
claimed the initial approach was not to fire until fired upon, evidence collected did not 
support this contention. 
</p>
<p>17. Witnesses detailed how, in Benghazi, protesters were shot near the Juliana Bridge. 
On 18 February 2011, after rocks were thrown as a funeral procession passed a military 
base, soldiers fired shots, killing several people. Witnesses reported later finding nine 
burned bodies, with their hands bound and with gunshots to the head, inside the base. 
</p>
<p>18. The Commission determined that Qadhafi forces fired on protesters in Misrata, 
leading to deaths and injuries. A senior military figure indicated that the 32nd brigade gave 
instructions to ground commanders to shoot civilians. 
</p>
<p>19. The Commission received testimony and medical records relating to protesters killed 
in Tripoli. Doctors informed the commission that, on 20 and 21 February 2011, more than 
200 bodies were brought to morgues. Protesters were denied access to medical care, while 
others did not seek medical treatment owing to a (well-founded) fear of being detained. The 
Commission also received reports of protesters being shot outside mosques after Friday 
prayers throughout February and March 2011. Qadhafi forces reportedly seized ambulances 
for use in security patrols and for the arrest of protesters. 
</p>
<p>20. The Commission found local authorities exercised initial restraint when engaging 
protesters in the central square in Al Zawiyah. The Commission determined a violent 
response began after the 32nd Brigade arrived on 23 February 2011 and shot at unarmed 
protesters, killing seven, and prompting an escalation of violence on both sides. 
</p>
<p>21. Following the eruption of protests in Zintan, Qadhafi forces set up checkpoints 
encircling the town, cutting off supplies of fuel and food. The Commission received reports 
that Qadhafi forces had shot at and beaten protesters in the central square. The Commission 
was further informed that Qadhafi forces removed the injured from hospitals and detained 
men at checkpoints. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>22. The Commission found that Qadhafi forces had engaged in excessive use of force 
against demonstrators in the early days of the protests, leading to significant deaths and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5

<p>injuries. The nature of the injuries indicated an intention to kill; the level of violence 
suggests a central policy of violent repression. These actions are in breach of international 
human rights law as an arbitrary deprivation of life. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Unlawful killings</b>6<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>23. In the second phase of its work, the Commission concentrated on the larger-scale 
executions by Qadhafi forces, but was aware that many individual killings also occurred.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>24. On 6 June 2011, 18 detainees died in Al Khums of suffocation from being held by 
Qadhafi forces in poorly ventilated metal containers in rising temperatures. Seventeen 
people died inside the containers, while another subsequently died in hospital. The 
Commission was able to corroborate much of the testimony of survivors through physical 
evidence at the site. It also interviewed one of the guards present at the time. 
</p>
<p>25. In Al Qalaa, a number of detainees were tortured at a boy scouts camp used by 
Qadhafi forces as a military base and detention centre. Following the retreat of Qadhafi 
forces in July 2011, footage reportedly taken with a soldier&#8217;s telephone showed bodies in a 
mass grave behind the base. Witnesses, together with the local prosecutor, uncovered the 
bodies of 34 men and boys, blindfolded and with their hands tied behind their back. Three 
other bodies were lying nearby. The Commission interviewed witnesses who had 
participated in the exhumation and identification of bodies, as well as with former detainees 
at the camp who had been released prior to the executions. The Commission also visited the 
site. Rifle cartridge cases remained at the scene, together with some skeletal remains. 
</p>
<p>26. An informal detention centre was established in a warehouse adjacent to the base of 
the 32nd Brigade in Yarmouk, Tripoli. According to testimony received, torture and ill-
treatment of detainees were routine practices there. On 23 August 2011, as Tripoli fell, 
guards threw grenades into the warehouse and then began to fire through the door, killing 
dozens. As the prisoners were packed tightly, however, some survived and managed to 
escape. Two days later, the guards burned the bodies of those killed. Of the 157 detainees, 
only 51 survivors were confirmed. The Commission interviewed survivors and two of the 
guards, who admitted direct or indirect involvement. The testimony was broadly consistent 
and corroborative. The Commission&#8217;s forensic pathologist identified skeletal remains inside 
the warehouse. Other forensic evidence remaining at the site was considerable and closely 
supported the testimony. Six detainees, including three medical doctors, were shot a day 
earlier in a second warehouse, a few hundred metres away. Three of the six died. 
</p>
<p>27. Gargur, in Tripoli, was the site of another unofficial detention centre. Locals referred 
to the building as the former &#8220;green security building&#8221;. Witnesses and survivors told the 
Commission that, on 23 August 2011, guards opened fire on the detainees. A total of 21 
people were shot and killed. 
</p>
<p>28. Further evidence of executions carried out by Qadhafi forces was found in Bab Al 
Aziziyah. On 23 August 2011, a witness described how he had helped gather 15 bodies, all 
men in civilian clothes and all handcuffed. The Commission interviewed two witnesses 
who had reportedly seen three medical personnel taken from an ambulance and shot. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 See ibid., chap. III, sect. B. </p>


<p>Commission was able to corroborate the testimony with photographs showing decomposing 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>29. The Commission found that other mass executions had occurred in Bani Walid, and 
a significant number of individual killings had been committed elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. <i>Thuwar</i>  
</b></p>
<p>30. In its first report, the Commission found that a number of Chadian nationals had 
been executed by groups of <i>thuwar</i> in Benghazi in late February 2011. The Commission 
confirmed further similar killings during phase II of the conflict. In February 2011, in Al 
Zawiyah, eyewitnesses told the Commission how two captured Qadhafi soldiers had been 
killed by a mob: one beaten to death, the other hanged from a bridge.7  
</p>
<p>31. The Commission received reports of executions by the <i>thuwar</i>. Around 22 and 23 
February 2011, in a village between Al Bayda and Darnah, more than a dozen Qadhafi 
soldiers were reportedly shot in the back of the head by the <i>thuwar</i>. The reports were 
corroborated by mobile telephone footage. Scores of Qadhafi soldiers and alleged loyalists 
(estimates ranging from 65 to 78) were executed by the <i>thuwar</i> in October 2011 at the 
Mahari Hotel in Sirte. The victims had their hands bound behind their backs and were shot. 
Physical evidence and video footage corroborated witness testimony of the killings. Some 
of the dead were captured fighters, while others were believed to have been those 
previously receiving treatment at the Ibn Sina Hospital. Still others were civilians 
reportedly arrested at checkpoints established by the <i>thuwar</i>. The Commission also 
documented 12 cases of men who died in custody in detention facilities controlled by 
<i>thuwar</i>. The cases involve either agents of the Qadhafi security apparatus or Tawerghans, a 
community targeted by the Misrata <i>thuwar</i>.8 Bodies were abandoned in hospitals with 
visible signs of torture. The Commission&#8217;s forensic pathologist concluded that the injuries 
were consistent with torture.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Death of Muammar and Mutassim Qadhafi 
</b>32. Both Muammar and Mutassim Qadhafi were captured separately on 20 October 
2011 outside Sirte by Misrata <i>thuwar</i>. Though wounded, both were alive at capture, and 
subsequently died in <i>thuwar</i> custody.  
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the death of Muammar Qadhafi, the Commission was not given 
access to the autopsy report despite the numerous requests addressed to the authorities. The 
Commission was provided with photographs of the body of Muammar Qadhafi and 
reviewed by its forensic pathologist, who was unable to determine the cause of death 
conclusively from the photographs provided. While the Commission received eyewitness 
testimony from persons with Muammar Qadhafi at the time of capture, it was not able to 
obtain a first-hand account of the circumstances of his death, and received inconsistent 
accounts from secondary sources. Consequently, the Commission was unable to confirm 
that the death of Muammar Qadhafi constituted a case of an unlawful killing, and considers 
that further investigation is required. 
</p>
<p>34. With regard to the death of Mutassim Qadhafi, the Commission reviewed video 
footage showing him alive and in the custody of <i>thuwar</i> post-capture, but was unable to 
obtain any account of the circumstances of his death. Consequently, the Commission was

</p>
<p>8
 See ibid., chap. III, sect. E. </p>


<p>unable to confirm that the death of Mutassim Qadhafi constituted a case of an unlawful 
killing, and considers that further investigation is required. 
</p>
<p><b> 5.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Commission found that Qadhafi forces executed and tortured to death large 
numbers of prisoners in detention centres. The executions tended to be performed 
immediately prior to a retreat. During the armed conflict, such conduct amounts to a war 
crime. Insofar as many of the detainees were part of the civilian population rather than 
captured fighters, the systematic and widespread executions constitute a crime against 
humanity. 
</p>
<p>36. The <i>thuwar</i> executed and tortured to death perceived Qadhafi loyalists and suspected 
mercenaries. These were either hors de combat fighters or members of the civilian 
population. During the armed conflict, such conduct amounts to the war crime of murder. 
Once the conflict ended, it constituted a case of arbitrary deprivation of life.  
</p>
<p>37. The Commission was also deeply concerned that no independent investigations or 
prosecutions appear to have been instigated into the killings committed by the <i>thuwar</i>.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances</b>9<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>38. In its first report, the Commission concluded that Qadhafi forces had arbitrarily 
detained a significant number of people and subjected others to enforced disappearance; 
while it received, however, very little information on violations by the armed opposition.10 
During the second phase of its work, the Commission met with 197 people, who referred to 
such violations by parties to the conflict; 158 of the said persons were either direct victims 
or their immediate family members. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>39. The Commission confirmed its earlier findings with regard to arbitrary arrests by the 
Qadhafi forces, and found that the practice continued until the disintegration of the Qadhafi 
Government. It found evidence of cases of unlawful detention in Tripoli, Al Zawiyah and 
the Nafusa Mountains. A significant number of people were held in unofficial or 
unacknowledged sites. Detainees were not provided with access to counsel, while many 
were not allowed to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. According to credible 
accounts, detainees were tortured. 
</p>
<p>40. As the Qadhafi forces retreated, detainees were either released or, in some instances, 
killed. Others were freed when the <i>thuwar</i> intervened. The Commission confirmed dozens 
of cases of disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. <i>Thuwar</i>  
</b></p>
<p>41. <i>Thuwar</i> involvement in cases of arbitrary arrest and enforced disappearance was 
found to have increased considerably since the first report of the Commission When they 
overran cities, the<i> thuwar</i> arrested en masse former soldiers, police officers, suspected 
mercenaries and others they saw as Qadhafi loyalists. The arrests continued well into 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

<p>9
 See ibid., chap. III, sect. C. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 A/HRC/17/44, para. 110. </p>


<p>January 2012. The detainees were initially held outside the domestic legal framework, often 
in unacknowledged places of detention. A large number of them were tortured. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Commission concluded that Qadhafi forces arbitrarily detained persons it 
suspected were supporting the <i>thuwar</i>. While many detainees may have been fighters, the 
Commission found that family members and peaceful demonstrators had also been 
detained. Detainees were not afforded the requisite legal protections, in violation of the 
State&#8217;s domestic and international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>43. The <i>thuwar</i> were found to have been involved in cases of the arbitrary arrest and 
enforced disappearance of perceived Qadhafi loyalists, security officers and members of the 
former Government. The Commission is concerned that the <i>thuwar</i> applied a presumption 
of guilt to those who fought against them or who are believed to have supported the 
Qadhafi Government. Moreover, many detainees were being held outside the framework of 
the law, thus rendering their continued detention per se arbitrary<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p><b> D. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment</b>11<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Commission received reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
perpetrated on a wide scale by both Qadhafi forces and the <i>thuwar</i>. It visited more than 20 
places of detention, both official and unofficial, under the control of the former 
Government and the <i>thuwar</i>. The Commission interviewed 150 detainees, victims and 
perpetrators. Its investigators examined the wounds of torture victims and reviewed medical 
files. The Commission also met with relatives of victims, prison commanders and non-
governmental organizations. It established that torture had been both widespread and 
systematically perpetrated in Libya throughout phases II and III of the conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>45. The Commission interviewed 35 people who had been tortured by Qadhafi forces. 
The torture methods catalogued included severe beating, including on the soles of the feet 
(<i>falaqa</i>), electric shocks to the genitalia, burning, threatening detainees with dogs, 
suspension over doors, hanging from bars, and detention in small spaces or in solitary 
confinement for extended periods. The Commission verified most claims by examining 
victims&#8217; wounds, scars and medical reports and by visiting sites.  
</p>
<p>46. Cases of torture were reported in official and unofficial detention facilities as 
Qadhafi forces sought information on opposition activities. Torture was also used during 
arrest or searches in houses of suspected members of the <i>thuwar</i>. The most severe forms of 
torture were generally used immediately after arrest and during interrogations on <i>thuwar 
</i>strategy and the location of weapons. The Commission gathered compelling evidence of the 
use of torture on suspected fighters and other opponents in various prisons, including Ein 
Zara, Abu Salim and Jdeida, and in the locations of intelligence agencies.  
</p>
<p>47. Torture was also found to have been rampant in unofficial detention centres, 
including in Yarmouk and Al Khums. The Commission interviewed former detainees of 
such facilities, who reported cases of severe beatings and the use of electric shocks. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 See A/HRC/19/CRP.1, chap. III, sect. D. </p>


<p>Conditions of detention, including the lack of toilet facilities and severe overcrowding, 
constitute ill-treatment of detainees.  
</p>
<p>48. Rape and other types of sexual violence were also used in detention. The 
Commission interviewed several male and female former detainees, who described cases of 
rape and other forms of sexual assault. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. <i>Thuwar</i>  
</b></p>
<p>49. During the second phase of its work, the Commission visited detention facilities in 
Misrata, Tripoli, Al Zawiyah, Tajoura and Zintan, which were run by individual brigades, 
security committees or military councils, or by the interim Government. It interviewed 
more than 100 Libyan and foreign current and former detainees. The Commission 
encountered compelling evidence of torture and ill-treatment. The methods most frequently 
used included beating with objects such as electric wires, rubber hoses, wooden sticks; the 
use of electric shocks; <i>falaqa</i>; and suspension in contorted positions. The purpose of the use 
of torture appeared to be the extraction of information or confessions, and\or punishment 
for alleged crimes.  
</p>
<p>50. At the end of the reporting period, most detained Qadhafi soldiers and alleged 
loyalists were still being held in unofficial centres outside the legal framework.  
</p>
<p>51. The Commission noted that detainees were especially vulnerable to torture upon 
their arrest, during the first days of detention and during interrogations. Many of those 
arrested were tortured in temporary facilities before being transferred to prisons or other 
locations. The Commission documented a pattern of severe torture, which was used in 
particular against Tawerghans by Misratan <i>thuwar</i>, who accuse them of committing rape 
and other crimes in Misrata. Detainees told the Commission that they confessed to serious 
crimes, including rape (which they denied committing), when they could no longer endure 
the torture.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Commission found that Qadhafi forces used torture and ill-treatment in a 
widespread and systematic manner.  
</p>
<p>53. The Commission also found that Qadhafi forces and the <i>thuwar</i> used torture and ill-
treatment. Such acts constitute a violation of international human rights law and, when 
committed during armed conflict, constitute war crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Targeted communities</b>12<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Commission received reports of abuses against particular groups. It interviewed 
111 witnesses in this regard and conducted on-site visits to Misrata, Tawergha, Al Khums, 
Tripoli, Abu Kammesh, Tiji, Awaniya and other towns.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>55. While the Qadhafi Government targeted people for arrest, torture and killing on the 
basis of their opposition to the Government, the Commission did not find evidence that one 
particular group had been targeted more than others. While some towns were historically 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12
 See ibid., chap. III, sect. E. </p>


<p>oppressed by the Government, there was no indication that they were treated during the 
conflict in a worse way as a consequence of this previous discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. <i>Thuwar</i> 
</b></p>
<p>56. Misratans believe Tawerghans to be Qadhafi loyalists and responsible for crimes, 
including rape. When the <i>thuwar</i> captured Tawergha the, most Tawerghans left, fearing 
reprisals. When Tripoli fell to the <i>thuwar</i>, brigades from Misrata entered a Tawergha camp 
for displaced persons in the city and arrested and beat 85 Tawerghan men. In September 
2011, they arrested between 40 and 50 more. According to eyewitnesses, as recently as 6 
February 2012 Misratan <i>thuwar</i> attacked the displaced persons camp in Tripoli and killed 
five Tawerghans, including an elderly man, a woman and three minors.  
</p>
<p>57. The Commission received multiple reports that, in the months that followed the 
capture of Tripoli, there were cases of arbitrary arrest of Tawerghans by Misratan <i>thuwar</i> 
on the streets of Tripoli. The whereabouts of these arrested persons often remain unknown. 
Those who have been released report being beaten. The Commission documented multiple 
incidents of Tawerghans held in detention in Misrata being subjected to torture. The 
Commission examined corroborating injuries on victims. 
58. A similar pattern of arrests, torture, other forms of ill-treatment and killings was 
documented by the Commission in Sirte, Zlitan, Al Jufra, Shawarif, Alut and Benghazi. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Tawergha 
</b></p>
<p>59. In the months after Tawergha was emptied of its population, houses and public 
buildings continued to be looted and destroyed by the Misratan <i>thuwar</i>. The Commission 
found that roads into the town had been blocked. The Commission observed houses being 
set alight. Buildings appeared to have been bulldozed. The Commission observed that the 
name &#8220;Tawergha&#8221; had been scratched off road signs, and that the words &#8220;New Misrata&#8221; had 
been written on them. The Commission notes that the Misratan <i>thuwar</i> were open about 
their views of the Tawerghans. One fighter told the Commission that he thought that the 
Tawerghans deserved &#8220;to be wiped off the face of the planet&#8221;. The language reportedly 
used by the Misratans during the arrests was often of a racist and derogatory nature, for 
example with reference to &#8220;slaves&#8221;, &#8220;blacks&#8221; and &#8220;animals&#8221;. Some were told that they could 
never return.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Targeting of other communities 
</b></p>
<p>60. The <i>thuwar</i> from Zintan targeted Mashashiya towns perceived as loyalist. The 
Commission was able to confirm reports that Mashashiya detainees were tortured, towns 
looted and property burned. Mashashiyans who attempted to return to their homes were 
reportedly beaten. In December 2011, Zintani <i>thuwar</i> reportedly shelled a town where 
Mashashiya internally displaced persons had sought refuge. Although the Military Council 
twice refused to allow the Commission to enter one of the towns, damage was visible. 
Graffiti was written on the town signs, including &#8220;Mashashiya &#8211; Qadhafi&#8217;s dogs&#8221;. 
61. The inhabitants of Tiji and Badr are Arabs in an originally Amazigh region. When 
Nalut <i>thuwar</i> entered Tiji and Badr in August 2011, they reportedly demanded that its 
remaining residents leave, and killed three brothers. The <i>thuwar</i> subsequently shelled Tiji 
in October 2011 with Grad rockets, killing at least three young women. According to 
testimony received, Nalut <i>thuwar</i> had detained a number of adult men, whom they called 
&#8220;Arab dogs&#8221; and told them that &#8220;this is not your land&#8221;. The Commission observed that 
evidence of burning could still be seen in the town.  
</p>
<p>62. The Commission received reports of beatings and looting in Abu Kammesh by 
Zowara <i>thuwar</i>. One interviewee stated that a work colleague had told him &#8220;you&#8217;re an Arab </p>


<p>living on Amazigh land, we&#8217;re going to kick you all out&#8221;. Sub-Saharan Africans were also 
arbitrarily arrested and beaten in detention, and even killed, by various members of the 
<i>thuwar</i>. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Misrata <i>thuwar</i> killed, arbitrarily arrested and tortured Tawerghans across 
Libya. Tawergha was destroyed to render it uninhabitable. The murder, torture, cruel 
treatment and pillaging witnessed during the hostilities constitute a war crime. Where they 
have continued since, they violate international human rights law. The torture and killing by 
Misratan <i>thuwar</i> could, given their widespread and systematic manner, constitute a crime 
against humanity; indeed, the facts indicate that crimes against humanity took place. 
</p>
<p>64. The Commission found that the Zintani <i>thuwar</i> killed, arbitrarily arrested and 
tortured members of the Mashashiyan community; that the Nalut <i>thuwar</i> committed 
unlawful killings and torture in Tiji, as well as looting and destroying property; and that 
Zowara <i>thuwar</i> committed unlawful killings and torture, as well as looting and destruction 
of property in Abu Kammesh. In these cases, while there were clear indications that the 
communities were targeted and the consequences for individuals were severe, the 
Commission did not find the evidence necessary to indicate that the attacks against these 
communities were as widespread or systematic as is the case of the Misratan <i>thuwar</i> and 
Tawergha. Insofar as these acts took place within the context of the armed conflict, 
however, they constitute war crimes; where they have occurred since the end of the armed 
conflict, they constitute a violation of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Sexual violence</b>13<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Commission is aware of numerous media accounts of rape in Libya, and 
endeavoured to investigate the allegations. It interviewed more than 20 male and female 
victims of sexual violence. The Commission met with another 30 witnesses, including 
doctors, attorneys and individuals with direct contact with victims or perpetrators. The 
Commission interviewed five people accused of committing rape, and also reviewed 
relevant reports of non-governmental organizations and other material. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>66. One pattern of sexual violence identified was that of women who were beaten and 
raped by armed men in their homes, or abducted and beaten and raped elsewhere, 
sometimes for days. Some victims were targeted because of their allegiance to the <i>thuwar</i>, 
while others were assaulted for no known reason. Of those targeted, rape appeared to be 
used as a means to punish, terrorize and intimidate those who supported the revolution.  
</p>
<p>67. Another pattern was identified, of sexual violence and torture of males and females 
in detention centres who were <i>thuwar</i> members or supportive of them<i>,</i> to extract 
information, humiliate and punish. Victims were arrested and normally taken to a location 
for interrogation and torture. The allegations reported to the Commission included cases of 
vaginal rape, sodomy and penetration with an instrument, as well as electrocution and 
burning of the genitals. The majority of the allegations came from men detained in Abu 
Salim and several men and women detained in Ein Zara. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 See ibid., chap. III, sect. F. </p>


<p>68. The Commission interviewed five people accused of raping men and women during 
the conflict. While these people did provide some specific details, the Commission believes 
that there is a strong possibility that the confessions were made under torture and were 
therefore not reliable. The Commission received one credible interview from a local 
organization that detailed five different rapes over five nights committed in Misrata by the 
interviewee and his colleagues. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. <i>Thuwar</i> 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Commission received limited evidence of cases of rape and sexual violence 
committed by the <i>thuwar</i>. It interviewed two victims, known to be Qadhafi loyalists, who 
had been sexually tortured by <i>thuwar</i> members in detention centres.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>70. The prevailing<b> </b>culture of silence, the lack of reliable statistics, the evident use of 
torture to extract confessions and its sheer political sensitivity all make this issue the most 
difficult one for the Commission to investigate. The Commission found that sexual violence 
occurred in Libya and played a significant role in provoking fear in various communities. It 
established that sexual torture was used as a means to extract information from and to 
humiliate detainees. It did not find evidence to substantiate claims of a widespread or a 
systematic attack, or any overall policy of sexual violence to be used against the civilian 
population. The information received was, however, sufficient to justify further 
investigation to ascertain the extent of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Attacks on civilians, civilian objects, protected persons and objects</b>14<b> 
 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>71. In its first report, the Commission indicated that, with regard to attacks on civilians, 
civilian objects, protected persons and objects, it did not have access to full information 
allowing it to definitively evaluate allegations of violations of international humanitarian 
law.15 As part of its continuing investigations, the Commission subsequently conducted 
more than 75 interviews on this issue and inspected the destruction in towns across Libya.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Qadhafi forces 
</b>72. The Commission visited a number of areas affected by the fighting, including 
Misrata, Al Zawiyah, Nalut, Yafran, Zintan and Sirte. It found that Qadhafi forces had used 
inherently indiscriminate weapons, as well as weapons prohibited by many nations, 
including landmines and cluster bombs, causing considerable suffering to the civilian 
population and damage to civilian objects. 
73. Misrata endured some of the most protracted fighting during the conflict. The city 
was under siege for more than three months, from March to May 2011, when Qadhafi 
forces retreated from its centre. Indiscriminate shelling of the city continued sporadically 
until August 2011. Unlike other areas where the civilian population was evacuated, 
civilians were trapped inside the city. Its port, which provided the only means of evacuation 
of the war-wounded and civilians, as well as entry of humanitarian aid, was also targeted by 
Qadhafi forces. Senior Qadhafi military officers interviewed by the Commission confirmed 
that several attempts were made, some of them successful, to mine the Misrata port. The

</p>
<p> 
</p>

 A/HRC/17/44, para. 170. </p>


<p>Commission found remains of Chinese-manufactured Type-84 rocket-dispensed scatterable 
anti-tank mines and transport rockets at the port.  
</p>
<p>74. When surveying the damage to the city, the Commission&#8217;s military expert noted that 
the damage to buildings was consistent with the use of small arms (7.62x39mm and other), 
heavy machine guns (12.7mm and 14.5mm), anti-aircraft guns (23mm), tube and rocket 
artillery, large calibre weapons (high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) tank rounds and high-
explosive squash head (HESH) tank rounds), mortars (various from 60 to 120mm), rockets 
(122mm Grad-entry holes were found with the rear of the rockets still protruding from 
ground), rocket-propelled grenades and recoilless rifles. 
</p><p>75. Qadhafi forces launched a military assault on Al Zawiyah after it fell to the 
opposition in late February 2011. Those interviewed by the Commission, including a 
former senior security official, stated that Qadhafi forces fired Grad rockets and mortars 
into Al Zawiyah. They also used tanks, rocket launchers and 14.5mm anti-aircraft guns.  
</p>
<p>76. Opposition-held towns in the Nafusa Mountains also sustained heavy shelling from 
Qadhafi forces. The majority of the civilian population evacuated, with the exception of 
Zintan, where at least 55 civilian casualties, including women and children, were reported. 
The most extensive damage was observed in Yafran, which was occupied by Qadhafi 
forces from 18 April until the first week of June 2011.  
</p>
<p>77. The Commission received numerous allegations of attacks on hospitals, medical 
personnel and ambulances, including in Al Zawiyah, Misrata, Tripoli and Yafran. Medical 
personnel treating members of the <i>thuwar</i> were subject to killing, arbitrary arrest or 
detention accompanied by torture, ill-treatment and harassment. Ambulances were 
reportedly shot at by Qadhafi forces several times during the course of the conflict and were 
used to transport armed soldiers. Hospitals were shelled, medical supplies restricted, and 
wounded demonstrators and members of the <i>thuwar</i> reportedly denied medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>78. The Commission investigated reports of Qadhafi forces deliberately targeting places 
of worship, including the mosque on the central square in Al Zawiyah. The Commission 
found that, in some instances, civilian buildings, including mosques, had been 
inappropriately used for military purposes by the <i>thuwar</i>, and could therefore be considered 
lawful targets. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. <i>Thuwar</i> 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Commission found that the <i>thuwar</i> also used inherently indiscriminate weapons 
in their military offensives against cities perceived as loyalist. Of particular concern was 
their conduct in Sirte. The Commission found that almost every building exhibited some 
form of damage. The most common damage and weapon debris observed was from Grad 
rockets, and heavy machine-gun fire from 14.5mm and 23mm weapons. The structural 
integrity of dozens of buildings was compromised (with many collapsed walls and roofs) 
and therefore uninhabitable. Numerous buildings exhibited impact from shells consistent 
with fire from 106mm recoilless rifles and 107mm rocket artillery, using both high-
explosive anti-tank and squash head rounds. Although some of the buildings were probably 
used by the Qadhafi forces and were therefore legitimate targets for attack, damage was so 
widespread that it was clearly indiscriminate in nature.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Commission found that both the Qadhafi forces and the <i>thuwar</i> launched 
unguided munitions into residential areas, in breach of the fundamental principle of 
distinction.  </p>


<p>81. Qadhafi forces launched sustained shelling on many towns and cities across Libya 
during the conflict. Some of these towns, such as Misrata, were still occupied by civilians. 
The use of unguided weapons in such cases constituted an indiscriminate attack. While the 
attacks damaged and destroyed some apparently civilian objects, such as mosques, the 
<i>thuwar</i> used individual buildings for military purposes, thus voiding their protected status. 
</p>
<p>82. A similar principle applied to the attack by the <i>thuwar</i> on Sirte. The scale of the 
destruction there and the nature of the weaponry employed indicated that the attacks were 
indiscriminate.  
</p>
<p><b> H. North Atlantic Treaty Organization</b>16 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>83. On 17 March 2011, the Security Council adopted resolution 1973 (2011), in which it 
authorized &#8220;all necessary measures&#8221; to &#8220;protect civilians and civilian populated areas under 
threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya&#8221;, while excluding a &#8220;foreign occupation 
force&#8221;. On 19 March, military forces from France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland and the United States of America began attacks. On 31 March, NATO 
assumed command of all offensive operations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>84. NATO aircraft flew a total of 17,939 armed sorties in Libya, employing exclusively 
precision guided munitions. NATO representatives informed the Commission that it had a 
standard of &#8220;zero expectation&#8221; of death or injury to civilians, and that no targets had been 
struck if there was any reason to believe that civilians would be injured or killed. The 
Commission was furthermore informed that the majority of munitions employed had 
delayed fusing to minimize collateral effects, and that NATO had also employed the 
minimum-sized munitions necessary to achieve the objective. NATO also warned the 
population by means of leaflets and radio broadcasts. 
</p>
<p>85. The Commission took into account the claims made by the Qadhafi Government 
with regard to civilian casualties, but subsequent testimony from former regime members 
and others, as well as its own interviews at the sites, confirmed that the Government had 
deliberately misstated the extent of civilian casualties. In one case, the Commission 
received a credible report of Libyan forces moving the bodies of children from a hospital 
morgue and taking them to the site of a NATO airstrike.  
</p>
<p>86. Despite the precautions taken by NATO as described above, the Commission noted 
incidents of civilian deaths and of damage to civilian infrastructure. Of the 20 NATO 
airstrikes investigated, the Commission documented five airstrikes where a total of 60 
civilians had been killed and 55 injured. The Commission also investigated two NATO 
airstrikes that damaged civilian infrastructure and where no military target could be 
identified.  
</p>
<p>87. The single largest case of civilian casualties from a NATO airstrike in Libya was 
witnessed on 8 August 2011 in the town of Majer, where the Commission found that 
NATO bombs had killed 34 civilians and injured 38. After the initial airstrike killed 16 
people, a group of rescuers arrived and was hit by a subsequent attack, killing 18. 
</p>
<p>88. Of the five targets where the Commission identified civilian casualties, four were 
termed command and control (C2) nodes or troop staging areas by NATO. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 See A/HRC/19/CRP.1, chap. III, sect. H. </p>


<p>Commission saw no physical evidence thereof during its site visits. Witnesses also denied 
that the sites had had military utility. NATO informed the Commission that &#8220;the regime 
was using civilian rather than military structures in support of military action&#8221;. Assuming 
this to be the case, the Commission remains concerned about the resulting civilian harm. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Commission found that NATO did not deliberately target civilians in Libya. For 
the few targets struck within population centres, NATO took extensive precautions to 
ensure that civilians were not killed. There was, however, a small number of strikes where 
the information provided by NATO did not allow the Commission to draw a conclusion on 
the rationale for or the circumstances of the attacks. The Commission was unable to 
conclude, barring additional explanation, whether these strikes were consistent with the 
objective of NATO to avoid civilian casualties entirely, or whether NATO had taken all 
necessary precautions to that effect. The characterization by NATO of four of five targets 
where the Commission found civilian casualties as &#8220;command and control nodes&#8221; or &#8220;troop 
staging areas&#8221; was not reflected in evidence at the scene and nor by witness testimony. The 
Commission was unable to determine, owing to a lack of information, whether these strikes 
were based on incorrect or outdated intelligence and, therefore, whether they were 
consistent with the NATO objective of taking all precautions necessary to avoid civilian 
casualties entirely. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Prohibited weapons</b>17<b> 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Commission examined the use of weapons prohibited by treaty and customary 
international law. It is aware that not all weapons discussed in the present report are 
prohibited for all countries involved. Qadhafi forces employed cluster munitions and anti-
personnel and anti-vehicle landmines, including in civilian areas. The Commission found 
considerable evidence of the use of cluster munitions and mines against civilian areas of 
Misrata in April 2011. It also found evidence of the use of landmines in the Nafusa 
Mountains. Minefields were not properly recorded by Qadhafi forces. Many of the mines 
used had a low metal content, complicating detection and removal, further endangering 
civilians. There was some limited use of landmines by individual members of the <i>thuwar</i>. 
There was no evidence of the use of chemical weapons, phosphorous or dum-dum bullets 
by any party to the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Mercenaries</b>18<b> 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Commission established that an organized group of Sudanese fighters were 
brought in by the Qadhafi Government specifically to fight the <i>thuwar</i>. It did not find that 
these fighters were promised or paid material compensation substantially in excess of that 
promised or paid to local Qadhafi forces, a requirement for these individuals or groups to 
fall within the definition of a &#8220;mercenary&#8221; under the International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, financing and Training of Mercenaries or under the Convention for the 
Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa. The Commission also determined that there were 
fighters within the Qadhafi forces who, though of foreign descent, were born in Libya or 
resident there. They would also fall outside the definition of mercenaries. 
</p>

 See ibid., chap. III, sect. J. </p>


<p><b> K. Child soldiers</b>19<b>  
</b></p>
<p>92. The Commission found evidence to suggest that the Qadhafi Government recruited 
and used children under the age of 18 in its armed forces, in breach of the State&#8217;s 
obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict. The Commission interviewed four minors 
detained by the <i>thuwar </i>as a result of their participation in combat. They were held together 
with adults in contravention of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Commission 
was also concerned to receive reports of children involved in fighting alongside the <i>thuwar</i> 
or in providing logistical support at frontlines, but determines that further investigation is 
needed.  
</p>
<p><b> L. Pillaging</b>20<b> 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Commission received reports of theft on a small scale perpetrated by Qadhafi 
forces during the conflict. It established that members of the <i>thuwar</i> and other groups of 
armed men were responsible for widespread pillaging and destruction of public and private 
property across the country during phases II and III of the conflict. The victims included 
entire communities perceived as Qadhafi loyalists and individuals seen as having provided 
support to Qadhafi forces during the conflict, as well as their relatives (sometimes even 
distant ones). Such violations were mostly committed after cities fell under the control of 
the <i>thuwar</i> or during the arrest of perceived loyalists at their homes. In some cases 
documented by the Commission, relatives of the alleged loyalists were driven out of their 
homes or prevented from returning by members of the <i>thuwar</i> who had appropriated their 
homes and other belongings. Evidence of pillage by the <i>thuwar</i> was found in &#8211; but was not 
limited to &#8211; Abu Kammesh, Al Zawiyah, Awaniya, Bani Walid, Garabulli, Tawergha, Tiji, 
Tripoli and Sirte.  
</p>
<p>94. The Commission is concerned that no full, impartial or independent investigations 
appear to have been conducted into any of allegations of pillage and the destruction of 
property. At times, Government officials downplayed the gravity of the violation, noting 
that Qadhafi forces had done the same thing to the opposition and that &#8220;now it is their turn&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Accountability</b>21<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>95. The mandate given to the Commission includes a requirement to identify those 
responsible, to make recommendations, in particular, on accountability measures, all with a 
view to ensuring that those individuals responsible were held accountable&#8221;. The 
Commission therefore strove to identify individuals who might have been responsible for 
violations and crimes either directly or through command responsibility. It decided not to 
include the names of these individuals, apart from senior figures who are publicly known, 
in the present report. 
</p>
<p>96. The Commission also reviewed institutional and legislative issues, and the efforts of 
the interim Government to ensure accountability in the longer term.

<p><b> B. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>97. International human rights law places an obligation on States to ensure that &#8220;any 
person whose rights or freedoms&#8230; are violated shall have an effective remedy&#8221; and that 
&#8220;any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent 
judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority 
provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial 
remedy&#8221;.22  
</p>
<p>98. The rights of the accused to due process and to a fair trial must be guaranteed. Fair 
trial standards cannot be suspended during emergency situations. 
</p>
<p>99. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment requires Libya to investigate all allegations of torture and to prosecute all 
alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>100. A duty to prosecute crimes against humanity and war crimes is part of customary 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Current situation in Libya 
</b></p>
<p>101. Accountability mechanisms in Libya are deficient in a number of respects, many of 
which are the direct consequence of the legacy of the Qadhafi era. 
</p><p>102. The existing Criminal Code does not adequately define international crimes. It 
provides for a statutory limitation of 10 years for crimes, after which there can be no 
prosecution. Although a law that came into effect in 1998 repealed this provision, it has no 
retroactive effect. The Military Penal Code precludes statutory limitations. 
</p>
<p>103. In practice, the current situation shows that the law has not been applied consistently 
or equally. The Commission received information on attacks, including cases of unlawful 
killing, torture and arbitrary arrest by the <i>thuwar</i> of members of the former Government 
and those perceived to be among its supporters. The Commission is not aware of any 
member of the <i>thuwar</i> having been arrested or detained for these crimes 
</p>
<p>104. While the interim Government is making progress in re-establishing courts, the 
absence of a functioning court system prevents perpetrators from being held accountable.  
</p>
<p>105. The Libyan authorities face considerable challenges in dealing with recent and past 
violations. They are likely to have difficulties in processing the approximately 8,000 
detainees currently in custody.  
</p>
<p>106. In February 2012, criminal proceedings commenced before a military court in 
Benghazi against 41 Qadhafi loyalists accused of crimes during the conflict. The 
Commission notes that the case has appropriately been transferred to a civilian court.  
</p>
<p>107. In December 2011, the National Transitional Council issued a law establishing the 
National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights, and appointed the members 
thereto. The body has authority to receive complaints on violations of human rights and to 
file cases in court. 
</p>
<p>108. The National Transitional Council recently adopted a law on transitional justice, 
which created a national fact-finding and reconciliation commission charged with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 2, subparas. 3 (a) and (b). </p>


<p>investigating incidents of human rights violations committed over the past 42 years. The 
law also established a victims&#8217; compensation fund.  
</p>
<p>109. A law on amnesty was also recently adopted by the National Transitional Council. 
The law examined by the Commission allows amnesty for perpetrators of crimes on certain 
conditions. The crimes of murder, causing serious injury, rape, torture and abduction are 
excluded from amnesty. The draft law, however, provides that reconciliation between the 
perpetrator and the victim would lead to the dismissal of criminal charges or the penalty 
imposed. The granting of an amnesty does not preclude the right of victims to restitution 
and compensation.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>110. The Commission gathered information linking individuals to human rights 
violations or crimes, and will hand over a list thereon to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>111. The Commission considers it imperative that appropriate mechanisms be established 
to ensure accountability for such crimes and violations in the long term. 
</p>
<p>112. The Commission is concerned that allegations of violations are not treated on an 
equal basis. Failure to apply criminal law to crimes committed by members of the <i>thuwar</i> 
during and after the end of the conflict creates a climate of impunity. Those detained are 
also unable to challenge their detention or to lodge complaints of torture against the <i>thuwar</i>. 
</p>
<p>113. Such problems are due in part to the current conditions in Libya, but are also in part 
systemic. The courts lack judges and properly trained staff. The State&#8217;s existing legislation 
does not adequately provide for the prosecution of international crimes. Unless repealed, 
the existing statute of limitations will prevent the prosecution of serious Qadhafi-era 
crimes. The absence of a functioning justice system allows violations to go unpunished and 
could lead to a cycle of reprisals.  
</p>
<p>114. The Commission notes the steps taken to address some of the above-mentioned 
issues, including the creation of a national council for civil liberties and human rights and 
the adoption of a law on transitional justice. It is, however, concerned at the lack of an 
independent and impartial process for appointing members to the national fact-finding and 
reconciliation commission.  
</p>
<p>115. The Commission considers it important to ensure that the reconciliation process 
under amnesty law is applied in a manner consistent with the State&#8217;s obligations under 
international law. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Assessment and findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>116. The Commission benefited from a far greater availability of information than was 
the case for its first report, primarily because it was able to spend a significant amount of 
time on the ground and because witnesses were more willing to provide information given 
that the Qadhafi Government was no longer in power. As in the case of the first report, 
however, the quality of the evidence and information obtained by the Commission varied in 
accuracy and reliability. The Commission maintained the cautious approach it adopted for 
its first report, while recalling that its evidentiary standard was less than that required for 
criminal proceedings.  </p>


<p>117. Robust efforts were made to corroborate the information received, through cross-
referencing and testing of witness testimony; interviews with both perpetrators and victims, 
where possible; and site visits to seek physical evidence. While it took into account 
information from media sources and non-governmental organizations, the Commission 
relied primarily on evidence gathered from its own interviews and observations. Alongside 
the substantial additional evidence of the violations committed by Qadhafi forces that the 
Commission was able to gather for the present report, a significant amount of new 
information was also gathered relating to violations by the <i>thuwar</i>. The Commission was 
impartial and its mandate covered all violations, irrespective of the perpetrator.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Qadhafi forces 
</b>118. The Commission concluded that international crimes, specifically crimes against 
humanity and war crimes, were committed by Qadhafi forces in Libya. It confirms its 
finding in its first report, namely that acts of murder, torture, enforced disappearance and 
certain acts of sexual violence were committed by Qadhafi forces within the context of a 
widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population, with knowledge of the 
attack. These acts constitute crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>119. The Commission confirms its finding in its first report that Qadhafi forces 
committed violations of international humanitarian law, which amount to war crimes. The 
violations identified included murder, torture, rape and attacks on civilians and civilian 
objects and protected buildings, medical units and transport. The breaches of international 
human and humanitarian rights law included indiscriminate attacks, arbitrary arrest and the 
recruitment and use of child soldiers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. <i>Thuwar</i> 
</b></p>
<p>120. The Commission has also concluded that war crimes and crimes against humanity 
were committed by the <i>thuwar</i> and that breaches of international human rights law continue 
to occur in a climate of impunity. It found evidence of acts of extrajudicial executions, 
torture, enforced disappearance, indiscriminate attacks and pillage. No investigations have 
been carried out into any violations committed by the <i>thuwar</i>.  
</p>
<p>121. The Commission was unable to reach any conclusion in relation to the death of 
Muammar and Mutassim Qadhafi, and recommends further investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
</b></p>
<p>122. NATO conducted a highly precise campaign with a demonstrable determination to 
avoid civilian casualties. For the most part, they succeeded. In the case of some limited 
occasions, the Commission confirmed civilian casualties and found targets that showed no 
evidence of military utility. The Commission was unable to draw conclusions in such 
instances on the basis of the information provided by NATO, and recommends further 
investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Current situation in Libya 
</b></p>
<p>123. The interim Government has expressed a commitment to human rights and its 
concerns about torture, ill-treatment and other violations, although its implementation of 
that commitment in practice has remained uneven. The interim Government will need </p>


<p>considerable support from the United Nations and the international community to achieve 
this goal. 
</p>
<p>124. The deterioration of the legislative framework and of judicial and national 
institutions generally during the Qadhafi era has resulted in a judiciary that lacks the 
independence to hold security institutions accountable. The interim Government is 
gradually restoring the judiciary by reopening courts and recalling judges, although there is 
still a shortage of trained staff, such as prosecutors, judicial police and forensic 
investigators. There has been some progress in the transfer of detainees to the control and 
authority of the national authorities, but many detainees remain under the control of 
individual brigades outside the framework of the law. Detainees often have limited or no 
access to families and legal counsel and are unable to challenge the legality of their 
detention or to lodge complaints about torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>125. The Commission found that the authorities are failing to hold members of the 
<i>thuwar</i> who have committed serious violations, including unlawful killings and arbitrary 
arrests, to account. That situation is symptomatic of a lack of equal implementation of the 
law and a serious obstacle to the achievement of the objective of full accountability for 
serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>126. The current Government has taken positive steps to establish new mechanisms for 
accountability, including the creation of a national fact-finding and reconciliation 
commission under the Transitional Justice Law and a national council on civil liberties and 
human rights. The Libyan authorities will have to ensure that any future amnesty process 
under the amnesty law is in conformity with the State&#8217;s obligations under international law 
with respect to accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The Commission calls upon the interim Government of Libya:
