Provisions Relating to Voting of Proxies
The shares represented by Proxy in the form provided to shareholders will be voted or

registered  shareholder  appointing  him.    If  there  are  no  instructions  provided  by  the 
registered shareholder, those shares will be voted for all proposals set out in the Proxy
3 | P a g e
and for the election of directors and the appointment of the auditors as set out in this 
Circular.  The Proxy gives the person named in it the discretion to vote as such person 
sees fit on any amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice of Meeting, or 
any other matters which may properly come before the Meeting.  At the time of printing of 
this  Circular,  the  management  of  the  Company  (the  “Management”)  knows  of  no  other 
matters which may come before the Meeting other than those referred to in the Notice of 
Meeting.
Advice to Beneficial Holders of Common Shares
The information set forth in this section is of significant importance to many shareholders, 
as a substantial number of shareholders do not hold common shares in their own name.  
Shareholders who hold their common shares through their brokers, intermediaries, trustees or 
other persons, or who otherwise do not hold their common shares in their own name (referred to 
herein as “Beneficial Shareholders”) should note that only proxies deposited by shareholders 
who  appear  on  the  records  maintained  by  the  Company’s  registrar  and  transfer  agent  as 
registered  holders  of  common  shares  will  be  recognized  and  acted  upon  at  the  Meeting.    If 
common shares are listed in an account statement provided to a Beneficial Shareholder by a 
broker, then those common shares will, in all likelihood, not be registered in the shareholder’s 
name.  Such common shares will more likely be registered under the name of the shareholder’s 
broker or an agent of that broker.  In Canada, the vast majority of such shares are registered 
under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for CDS Clearing and Depository Services 
Inc., which acts as nominee for many Canadian brokerage firms).  In the United States, the vast 
majority of such common shares are registered under the name of Cede & Co., the registration 
name  for  The  Depository  Trust  Company,  which  acts  as  nominee  for  many  United  States 
brokerage firms.  Common shares held by brokers (or their agents or nominees) on behalf of a 
broker’s client can only be voted or withheld at the direction of the Beneficial Shareholder.  Without 
specific instructions, brokers and their agents and nominees are prohibited from voting shares for 
the  broker’s  clients.    Therefore,  each  Beneficial  Shareholder  should  ensure  that  voting 
instructions are communicated to the appropriate person well in advance of the Meeting.
Existing regulatory policy requires brokers and other intermediaries to seek voting instructions 
from Beneficial Shareholders in advance of shareholder meetings.  The various brokers and other 
intermediaries have their  own mailing  procedures and provide their own return instructions to 
clients, which should be carefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their 
common shares are voted at the Meeting.  The form of instrument of proxy supplied to a Beneficial 
Shareholder by its broker (or the agent of the broker) is substantially similar to the instrument of 
proxy  provided  directly  to  registered  shareholders  by  the  Company.    However,  its  purpose  is 
limited to instructing the registered shareholder (i.e., the broker or agent of the broker) how to 
vote  on  behalf  of  the  Beneficial  Shareholder.    The  vast  majority  of  brokers  now  delegate 
responsibility  for  obtaining  instructions  from  clients  to  Broadridge  Financial  Solutions  Inc. 
(“Broadridge”) in Canada.  Broadridge typically prepares a machine-readable voting instruction 
form (“VIF”), mails those forms to Beneficial Shareholders and asks Beneficial Shareholders to 
return the VIFs to Broadridge, or otherwise communicate voting instructions to Broadridge (by 
way  of  the  internet  or  telephone,  for  example).    Broadridge  then  tabulates  the  results  of  all 
instructions received and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be 
represented at the Meeting.  A Beneficial Shareholder who receives a Broadridge VIF cannot 
use that form to vote common shares directly at the Meeting.  The VIFs must be returned 
to Broadridge (or instructions respecting the voting of common shares must otherwise be
4 | P a g e
communicated to Broadridge) well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the common 
shares voted.  If you have any questions respecting the voting of common shares held 
through a broker or other intermediary, please contact that broker or other intermediary 
for assistance.
The  Notice  of  Meeting,  Circular,  Proxy  and  VIF,  as  applicable,  are  being  provided  to  both 
registered  shareholders  and  Beneficial  Shareholders.    Beneficial  Shareholders  fall  into  two 
categories - those who object to their identity being known to the issuers of securities which they 
own (“OBOs”) and those who do not object to their identity being made known to the issuers of 
the securities which they own (“NOBOs”).  Subject to the provisions of National Instrument 54-
101 - Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer (“NI 54-101”), 
issuers  may request  and  obtain  a  list  of  their  NOBOs from  intermediaries  directly  or  via their 
transfer agent and may obtain and use the NOBO list for the distribution of proxy-related materials 
directly (not via Broadridge) to such NOBOs.  For the Meeting, the Company is sending proxy-
related materials directly to NOBOs under NI 54-101.  If you are a Beneficial Shareholder and the 
Company  or  its  agent  has  sent  these  materials  directly  to  you,  your  name,  address  and 
information  about  your  holdings  of  common  shares  have  been  obtained  in  accordance  with 
applicable securities regulatory requirements from the intermediary holding the common shares 
on your behalf.
The Company has distributed copies of the Notice of Meeting, Circular and VIF to intermediaries 
for distribution to OBOs.  The Company does not intend to pay for intermediaries to forward proxy-
related materials to OBOs under NI 54-101, and OBOs will not receive the materials unless the 
OBOs intermediary assumes the cost of delivery.
Although a Beneficial Shareholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes 
of  voting common shares registered in the name of his broker, a Beneficial Shareholder may 
attend the Meeting as proxyholder for the registered shareholder and vote the common shares in 
that  capacity.    NI  54-101  allows  a  Beneficial  Shareholder  who  is  a  NOBO  to  submit  to  the 
Company or an applicable intermediary any document in writing that requests that the NOBO or 
a nominee of the NOBO be appointed as proxyholder.  If such a request is received, the Company 
or an intermediary, as applicable, must arrange, without expenses to the NOBO, to appoint such 
NOBO or its nominee as a proxyholder and to deposit that proxy within the time specified in this 
Circular, provided that the Company or the intermediary receives such written instructions from 
the NOBO at least one business day prior to the time by which proxies are to be submitted at the 
Meeting, with the result that such a written request must be received by 11:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) 
on the day which is at least three business days prior to the Meeting.  A Beneficial Shareholder 
who wishes to attend the Meeting and to vote their common shares as proxyholder for the 
registered shareholder, should enter their own name in the blank space on the VIF or such 
other  document  in writing  that  requests  that  the  NOBO  or  a  nominee  of  the  NOBO  be 
appointed as proxyholder and return the same to their broker (or the broker’s agent) in 
accordance with the instructions provided by such broker.
All references to shareholders in the Notice of Meeting, Circular and the accompanying Proxy are 
to registered shareholders of the Company as set forth on the list of registered shareholders of 
the Company as maintained by the registrar and transfer agent of the Company, Computershare, 
unless specifically stated otherwise.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Named Executive Officers
During  the  financial  year  ended  January  31,  2016,  the  Company  had  two  Named  Executive 
Officers (“NEOs”) being, Marek Kreczmer, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Alec Peck, 
the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Company.
“Named Executive Officer” means: (a) each CEO, (b) each CFO, (c) each of the three most highly 
compensated executive officers of the company, including any of its subsidiaries, or the three 
most highly compensated individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the CEO and CFO, 
at  the  end  of  the  most  recently  completed  financial  year  whose  total  compensation  was, 
individually, more than $150,000; and (d) each individual who would be a NEO under (c) above 
but for the fact that the individual was neither an executive officer of the Company, nor acting in 
a similar capacity, at the end of that financial year.
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The Board of Directors (the “Board”) compensation program is designed to provide competitive 
levels of compensation, a significant portion of which is dependent upon individual and corporate 
performance and contribution to increasing shareholder value.  The Board recognizes the need
6 | P a g e
to  provide  a  total  compensation  package  to  remain  competitive  to  its  peers  in  attracting  and 
retaining qualified and experienced executives as well as align the compensation level of each 
executive  to  that  executive’s  level  of  responsibility.    In  general,  a  NEO’s  compensation  is 
comprised of three components: base salary, incentive bonus plan and stock options.
Incentive bonuses, in the form of cash payments, are designed to add a variable component of 
compensation  based  on  corporate  and  individual  performances  for  executive  officers  and 
employees.  There were no bonuses paid to executive officers or employees during the most 
recently completed financial year.
The Company has no other forms of compensation, although payments may be made from time 
to time to individuals or companies they control for the provision of consulting services.  Such 
consulting services are paid for by the Company at competitive industry rates for work of a similar 
nature by reputable arm’s length service providers.
The Board has not proceeded to a formal evaluation of the implications of the risks associated 
with the Company’s compensation policies and practices.  Risk management is a consideration 
of  the  Board  when  implementing  its  compensation  programme,  and  the  Board  and  the 
Compensation Committee does not believe that the Company’s compensation programme results 
in unnecessary or inappropriate risk taking including risks that are likely to have a material adverse 
effect on the Company.
The Company’s NEOs and directors are not permitted to purchase financial instruments, including 
for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars or units of exchange 
funds that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted 
as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.
Share-Based and Option-Based Awards
The  Company  does  not  grant  share-based  awards.   Stock  options  are granted to  provide  an 
incentive to the directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company to achieve the 
longer-term objectives of the Company, to give suitable recognition to the ability and industry of 
such persons who contribute materially to the success of the Company, and to attract and retain 
persons of experience and ability, by providing them with the opportunity to acquire an increased 
proprietary interest in the Company.  The Company awards stock options to its NEOs based upon 
the recommendation of the Board, which recommendation is based upon the Board’s review of a 
proposal from the Chief Executive Officer.  Previous grants of incentive stock options are taken 
into account when considering new grants.  The purpose of granting such stock options is to assist 
the  Company  in  compensating,  attracting,  retaining  and  motivating  the  officers,  directors  and 
employees of the Company and to closely align the personal interests of such persons to the 
interests of the shareholders.
The exercise price of the stock options granted will generally be determined by the market price 
at the time of grant, less any allowable discount.  Implementation of a new incentive stock option 
plan and amendments to the existing stock option plan are the responsibility of the Company’s 
Board.

The fair value of option-based awards is determined by the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.  The Company has chosen 
the Black-Scholes methodology to calculate the grant date fair value of option-based awards as it is the methodology used 
in the Company’s financial statements.  
The fair value of 230,000 stock options exercisable at $0.15 as granted on April 15, 2015. 
Pursuant to  a consulting  agreement  entered into on  July 1,  2011,  by  the Company  and MK  Consulting Ltd.,  a private 
corporation which includes Mr. Kreczmer among its shareholders, a fee of $8,000 per month is paid to MK Consulting Ltd.  
The fee was reduced for the financial year ended January 31, 2016, to reflect market conditions. 
Mr Peck was appointed as CFO of the Company on July 1, 2014.   
The fair value of 50,000 stock options exercisable at $0.15 as granted on April 15, 2015.

3.
4.
The Option Price under each Option shall be not less than the Discounted Market Price

Any Unissued Option Shares not acquired by an Optionee under an Option which has

may be made the subject of a further Option granted pursuant to the provisions of the 
Plan.  The Expiry Date for each Option shall be set by the Board at the time of issue of 
the Option and shall not be more than ten years after the Grant Date.  Options shall not

(b)

Employee or a Consultant Company, the Optionee’s employer, ceases to be an 
Eligible Person as a result of termination for cause, as that term is interpreted by 
the courts of the jurisdiction in which the Optionee, or, in the case of a Management 
Company  Employee  or  a  Consultant  Company,  of  the  Optionee’s  employer,  is 
employed or engaged; any outstanding Option held by such Optionee on the date 
of such termination shall be cancelled as of that date.

the Optionee or, in the case of a Management Company Employee or a Consultant 
Company, the Optionee’s employer, ceases to be an Eligible Person due to his or 
her  retirement  at  the  request  of  his  or  her  employer  earlier  than  the  normal 
retirement date under the Company’s retirement policy then in force, or due to his 
or  her  termination  by  the  Company  other  than  for  cause  or  due  to  his  or  her 
voluntary resignation, the Option then held by the Optionee shall be exercisable to 
acquire Vested Unissued Option Shares at any time up to but not after the earlier 
of the Expiry Date and the date which is 30 days after the Optionee or, in the case 
of a Management Company Employee or a Consultant Company, the Optionee’s 
employer, ceases to be an Eligible Person.

National Instrument 52-110 - Audit Committees (“NI 52-110”) provides that a member of an audit

NI 52-110 provides that an individual is “financially literate” if he or she has the ability to read and 
understand  a  set  of  financial  statements  that  present  a  breadth  and  level  of  complexity  of 
accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues that 
can  reasonably  be  expected  to  be  raised  by  the  Company’s  financial  statements.    All  of  the 
members of the Audit Committee are “financially literate” as that term is defined. The following

Exemption in Section 6.1  
 
The Company is a “venture issuer” as defined in NI 52-110 and is relying on the exemption in 
section 6.1 of NI 52-110 relating to Parts 3 (Composition of Audit Committee) and 5 (Reporting 
Obligations).
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE
National Instrument 58-101 - Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices, requires all reporting 
issuers to provide certain annual disclosure of their corporate governance practices with respect 
to the corporate governance guidelines (the “Guidelines”) adopted in National Policy 58-201.  
These  Guidelines  are  not  prescriptive,  but  have  been  used  by  the  Company  in  adopting  its 
corporate  governance  practices.    The  Board  and  Management  consider  good  corporate 
governance to be an integral part of the effective and efficient operation of Canadian corporations.  
The Company’s approach to corporate governance is set out below.
16 | P a g e
Board of Directors
Management is nominating four individuals to the Board, all of whom are current directors of the 
Company.
The Guidelines suggest that the board of directors of every reporting issuer should be constituted 
with  a  majority  of  individuals  who  qualify  as  “independent”  directors  under  NI  52-110,  which 
provides that a director is independent if he or she has no direct or indirect “material relationship” 
with the Company.  The “material relationship” is defined as a relationship which could, in the view 
of  the  Company’s  Board,  reasonably  interfere  with  the  exercise  of  a  director’s  independent 
judgement.  All of the current members of the Board are considered “independent” within the 
meaning of NI 52-110, with the exception of Marek Kreczmer as he also serves as CEO of the 
Company.
The Board has a stewardship responsibility to supervise the management of and oversee the 
conduct  of  the  business  of  the  Company,  provide  leadership  and  direction  to  Management, 
evaluate Management, set policies appropriate for the business of the Company and approve 
corporate strategies and goals.  The day-to-day management of the business and affairs of the 
Company is delegated by the Board to the CEO and the President.  The Board will give direction 
and guidance through the President to Management and will keep Management informed of its 
evaluation of the senior officers in achieving and complying with goals and policies established 
by the Board.
The Board recommends nominees to the shareholders for  election as directors.  Immediately 
following each annual general meeting, the Board appoints an Audit Committee and an Audit 
Committee Chairperson.  The Board establishes and periodically reviews and updates the Audit 
Committee  mandates,  duties  and  responsibilities,  elects  a  chairperson  of  the  Board  and 
establishes his or her duties and responsibilities, appoints the CEO, CFO and President of the 
Company  and  establishes  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  those  positions  and  on  the 
recommendation of both the CEO and the President, appoints the senior officers of the Company 
and approves the senior Management structure of the Company.
The Board exercises its independent supervision over management by its policies that (a) periodic 
meetings of the Board be held to obtain an update on significant corporate activities and plans; 
and (b) all material transactions of the Company are subject to prior approval of the Board.  The 
Board shall meet not less than three times during each year and will endeavour to hold at least 
one meeting in each fiscal quarter.  The Board will also meet at any other time at the call of the 
President, or subject to the Articles of the Company, of any director.
The  Board  meets  at  least  once  each  calendar  quarter  to  review,  among  other  things,  the 
performance  of  the  Company.    Results  will  be  compared  and measured  against  a  previously 
established plan and performance of prior fiscal years.  Other meetings of the Board will be called 
to deal with special matters, as circumstance require.
The mandate of the Board, as prescribed by the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) 
(the “Act”), is to manage or supervise management of the business and affairs of the Company 
and to act with a view to the best interests of the Company.  In doing so, the Board oversees the 
management of the Company’s affairs directly and through the Audit Committee.  In fulfilling its 
mandate, the Board, among other matters, is responsible for: (i) reviewing and approving the 
Company’s overall business strategies; (ii) reviewing major strategic initiatives; (iii) reviewing and
17 | P a g e
approving the reports and other disclosure issued to shareholders; and (iv) ensuring the effective 
operation of the Board.
At present, the Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the business and affairs of 
the Company to the executive officers of the Company.  Generally, operations in the ordinary 
course or that are not in the ordinary course and do not exceed material levels of expenditures or 
commitment on the part of the Company have been delegated to Management.  Decisions relating 
to  matters  that  are  not  in  the  ordinary  course  and  that  involve  material  expenditures  or 
commitments on the part of the Company require prior approval of the Board.  Any responsibility 
which is not delegated to Management or a committee of the Board remains with the Board.
Directorships
The following directors of the Company are also directors of other reporting issuers as stated:
x
x
Darryl Yea is a director of American Potash Corp. (CSE: AMP) and LED Medical 
Diagnostics Inc. (TSX-V: LMD).; and
Dr. Humphrey Mathe is a director of Wescoal Holdings Limited and Howden Africa 
Holdings Limited.
Orientation and Continuing Education
New Board members receive an orientation package which includes reports on operations and 
results, and public disclosure filings by the Company.  Board meetings are sometimes held at the 
Company’s offices and, from time to time, are combined with presentations by the Company’s 
management to give the directors additional insight into the Company’s business.  In addition, 
Management makes itself available for discussion with all Board members.
Ethical Business Conduct
The Board has found that the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by the Company’s 
governing corporate legislation and the common law and the restrictions placed by applicable 
corporate legislation on an individual director’s participation in decisions of the Board in which the 
director has an interest have been sufficient to ensure that the Board operates independently of 
Management and in the best interests of the Company.
Nomination of Directors
The Board considers its size each year when it considers the number of directors to recommend 
to the shareholders for election at the annual meeting of shareholders, taking into account the 
number required to carry out the Board’s duties effectively and to maintain a diversity of view and 
experience.
The Board does not have a nominating committee, and these functions are currently performed 
by the Board as a whole.  However, if there is a change in the number of directors required by the 
Company, this policy will be reviewed.
18 | P a g e
Assessments
While no formal policy has been established to monitor the effectiveness of the directors, the 
Board works together to evaluate its effectiveness and that of the Audit Committee and of its 
individual directors on an ad-hoc basis.
The  Board  believes  its  corporate  governance  practices  are  appropriate  and  effective  for  the 
Company, given its size and operations.  The Company’s corporate governance practices allow 
the  Company  to  operate  efficiently,  with  checks  and  balances  that  control  and  monitor 
Management and corporate functions without excessive administration burden.
Board Committees
The Board has no committees, other than the Audit Committee.
