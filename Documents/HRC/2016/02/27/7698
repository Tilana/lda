<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In decision 23/114, adopted during its twenty-third session in June 2013, the Human 
Rights Council decided to hold a &#8220;stand-alone high-level interactive dialogue with the aim 
of exploring how all stakeholders can work effectively towards the finalization and 
implementation of the road map and the realization of human rights in Somalia&#8221;. The 
interactive dialogue was held during the twenty-fourth session of the Council, on 
24 September 2013.  
</p>
<p>2. The interactive dialogue was moderated by the President of the Human Rights 
Council, Remigiusz Henczel. The United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, Flavia Pansieri, made opening remarks, which were followed by presentations by 
the panellists, namely Abdi Farah Shirdon, Prime Minister of Somalia; Shamsul Bari, 
Independent Expert appointed by the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights in 
Somalia; Nicholas Kay, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia and 
Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM); Mahamat Saleh 
Annadif, Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for 
Somalia and Head of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM); Zahra Nur, 
National Coordinator (Somalia), Forum for African Women Educationalists; Fartuun Adan, 
Executive Director, Elman Peace and Human Rights Centre; and Mohamed 
Abdi Mohamed, Director General of Horn Cable TV. 
</p>
<p>3. The present summary was prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Human Rights Council 
decision 23/114. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and contributions by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening statement, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for 
Human Rights noted that despite positive developments on the political front since the 
stand-alone interactive dialogue on Somalia that had taken place in September 2010, the 
human rights situation in the country continued to be very challenging. The conducting of 
hostilities, particularly in parts of south and central Somalia, continued to impact negatively 
on civilians, who were often caught in the crossfire between the parties to the conflict. The 
Deputy High Commissioner pointed out that human rights defenders and journalists 
continued to be the targets of assassination. The situation in terms of economic, social and 
cultural rights remained a matter for concern; access to education and to services such as 
health was very limited. The high rates of sexual and gender-based violence also remained 
a concern. The Deputy High Commissioner added that continued attacks by Al-Shabaab 
were a reminder that much work remained to be done in the fight to ensure security for all 
people living in Somalia. She noted that addressing impunity and violence and ensuring 
protection of human rights was key to building peace. Regarding the road map, she urged 
that there should be clear benchmarks, with timelines for implementation, and identification 
of implementing agencies for each benchmark. For the road map to be a success, the 
Government should endeavour to consult on its implementation with all the stakeholders, 
nationwide, through an inclusive and participatory process, and should regularly report 
back on efforts to implement it. The Deputy High Commissioner stated that OHCHR would 
work with UNSOM to support the Government of Somalia in upholding its commitments 
made under the universal periodic review and as a signatory to a number of international 
human rights instruments.  </p>


<p>5. The Prime Minister of Somalia noted that while Al-Shabaab had been weakened, the 
recent attacks on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya were a reminder that there were still 
challenges in ensuring security in Somalia and in the region. He stated that a military 
solution to the situation in Somalia was not enough, and that all areas had to be addressed, 
including establishing the rule of law, revitalizing the economy, and providing education 
and employment opportunities for young people. The Prime Minister noted that amidst the 
challenges facing Somalia, his Government had made progress in the area of promoting and 
protecting human rights, for example by promoting participation rights for minorities via 
the abolishment of the 4.5 clan quota system, and by promoting women&#8217;s political 
participation including via appointments to key government positions. He noted that a bill 
to establish a national human rights commission had been drafted, and that the Government 
was in the process of implementing the recommendations from the universal periodic 
review of Somalia. He reported that a task force had been established to investigate attacks 
against journalists and killings of journalists. With regard to sexual and gender-based 
violence, he noted that the Government maintained a zero-tolerance policy. He added that 
the practice of female genital mutilation was not condoned under Islam, and as such, his 
Government would take steps to eradicate it. In order to address the question of impunity, 
efforts were under way to strengthen rule-of-law institutions and to tackle corruption. The 
Government had set up an initiative aimed at providing education for all Somalis, and 
planned to collaborate with the International Labour Organization to increase employment 
opportunities. The Prime Minister recognized the critical role that civil society and the 
diaspora were playing in reconstructing the country. He commended the Independent 
Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia on his efforts and his contribution to 
initiating the development of the road map, and reiterated that his Government was 
committed to undertaking a nationwide consultation when finalizing the road map. In 
conclusion, he expressed his Government&#8217;s gratitude to AMISOM for its support in 
fighting Al-Shabaab, and to UNSOM for providing support towards building and 
strengthening the various State institutions. 
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia stated that the 
country had reached a critical juncture and was ready to move forward, but noted that in 
order to do so effectively, it would need the combined and coordinated support of the 
international community and civil society actors. He stated that reconstruction and 
reconciliation would be advanced by the establishment of a solid human rights protection 
system that would have the active support of the people of Somalia. He welcomed the 
adoption of the road map, and the decision by the Government to establish a human rights 
ministry to coordinate proper implementation of the road map. However, he reminded all 
present that more than twenty years of armed conflict had destroyed the social fabric and 
the basic social institutions that had kept Somalia together in the past. This had led to the 
creation of a deep-rooted culture of impunity and wanton disregard of authority, illustrated 
by the recent handling of some cases of alleged rape. The Independent Expert 
acknowledged that UNSOM had a strong human rights mandate, and urged close 
cooperation between UNSOM and OHCHR in supporting the implementation of the road 
map. He proposed that OHCHR should, in the future, consider a more dedicated, stand-
alone role for the promotion and protection of human rights in Somalia. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia and Head of 
UNSOM explained the mandate of UNSOM, particularly as it related to human rights, and 
summarized the efforts made to establish regional offices throughout the country. He stated 
that UNSOM would work together with the United Nations agencies in applying an 
integrated approach to addressing the human rights challenges in Somalia. He also said that 
UNSOM was expected to collaborate with AMISOM to provide policy advice to the 
Government on peace-building and state-building. In addition, UNSOM had started work 
on ensuring implementation of the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations </p>


<p>support to non-United Nations security forces. He said that UNSOM would continue to 
collaborate with the Independent Expert, and noted that the road map could lay the 
foundation for improving the protection and promotion of human rights in Somalia. He 
advised that implementation of the road map would require the joint efforts of the 
Government, the Independent Expert, civil society actors, UNSOM, and the United Nations 
agencies, as well as bilateral and multilateral partners.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for 
Somalia and Head of AMISOM noted that while AMISOM&#8217;s mandate was predominantly 
of a military or security nature, it also had a civilian component. He stated that AMISOM 
had taken significant steps to ensure that military operations were conducted with full 
respect for international humanitarian law, and that collateral damage was kept to a 
minimum. He particularly referred to the adoption in 2011 of the indirect fire policy, and to 
the pre-deployment training which included the human rights due diligence policy and the 
United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse. He also mentioned 
the African Union&#8217;s protection of civilians strategy adopted in March 2013, and the civilian 
casualty tracking, analysis and response cell to be established in accordance with Security 
Council resolutions 2036 (2012) and 2093 (2013). The Special Representative of the 
Chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia outlined the various areas of 
cooperation with the Somali Government, and added that AMISOM was providing 
humanitarian assistance to the population, including rebuilding schools, rehabilitating 
health infrastructure, providing free medical treatment and supplying medicines. In 
conclusion, he noted that much remained to be done to advance human rights in Somalia, 
and hoped that the road map would provide the template for ensuring promotion and 
protection of human rights in Somalia. 
</p>
<p>9. The National Coordinator, for Somalia, of the Forum for African Women 
Educationalists considered that the persistence of a wide range of human rights abuses and 
violations in Somalia was mainly due to weak governance structures and institutions. Clan 
domination in positions of governance continued to undermine the democratization process 
in the country. In addition, slow development and a weak national economic base had 
resulted in massive unemployment, with youths illegally immigrating into other countries, 
and opting to join pirates or militant groups such as Al-Shabaab.  
</p><p>10. The Executive Director of the Elman Peace and Human Rights Centre stated that the 
incidence of sexual and gender-based violence, mainly targeting women and children, was 
very high in Somalia. She reported that, often, civil society organizations criticized the 
Government so as to motivate it to improve the human rights situation. Civil society was 
willing to work with the Government to rebuild the country. She urged the Government to 
ensure security for civil society organizations and human rights defenders, as well as other 
vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>11. The Director General of Horn Cable TV stated that freedom of expression and media 
freedom were severely curtailed in Somalia. Journalism was a dangerous occupation, as 
journalists continued to be the targets of attacks and killings, especially by Al-Shabaab. 
Since the interactive dialogue on Somalia that had taken place in September 2010, 28 media 
professionals had been killed in the country. He noted that the culture of impunity 
exacerbated the situation, and called on the Government to ensure that perpetrators of 
human rights violations were held accountable. He noted that some of the provisions of the 
draft media law would violate principles of freedom of expression, and urged the 
Government to address the issue.  </p>


<p><b> III. Summary of interventions at plenary discussions 
</b>12. During the plenary discussions, the following delegations took the floor: Australia, 
Bahrain, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the European Union, France, Gabon 
(on behalf of the African Group), Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Mexico, 
Morocco, Norway, Sierra Leone, the State of Palestine (on behalf of the Arab Group), the 
Sudan, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United 
States. The following non-governmental organizations contributed to the discussion: the 
East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project, Human Rights Watch, the 
International Development Law Organization, International Educational Development, Inc., 
and the International Federation of Journalists. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation 
also took the floor, as an intergovernmental organization. 
</p>
<p>13. Many delegations noted that the convening of the interactive dialogue indicated the 
importance placed by the international community on the stability and prosperity of 
Somalia. It was also seen as a reaffirmation of the determination of the international 
community, and of the renewed commitment of all stakeholders, to support the Government 
of Somalia in its efforts towards peace-building, stabilization and economic development. 
Several delegations welcomed the continued engagement of the Independent Expert, and 
his valuable support and assistance to Somalia, and took note of the decision by the 
Security Council to upgrade the engagement of the United Nations in Somalia via the 
establishment of a political mission in-country. 
</p>
<p>14. Many delegations commended the Government of Somalia on its positive and 
constructive engagement with United Nations human rights mechanisms, and on its robust 
engagement with the international community. The delegations welcomed the adoption of a 
post-transition human rights road map, noting that this demonstrated the Government&#8217;s 
commitment and political will to institutionalize respect for human rights. The 
announcement of the decision to establish a ministry of human rights and to designate 
27 August as national human rights day in Somalia was also welcomed. Delegations 
acknowledged the steps taken by the Government of Somalia to improve the human rights 
situation, such as introducing key human rights legislation into Parliament &#8212; including on 
establishing a national human rights commission, an Ombudsman&#8217;s office, a judicial 
service commission, and a constitutional court, as well as adopting and initiating the 
implementation of a national stabilization plan. 
</p>
<p>15. Several delegations pointed out, however, that despite some positive developments 
in the area of human rights, there were still serious challenges. The main challenges were to 
rebuild state institutions based on the rule of law and respect for human rights, and to 
provide basic services such as health and education. Many delegations expressed concern 
about the situation of internally displaced persons and refugees, the high rates of sexual and 
gender-based violence, and the continuing targeted attacks and killing of human rights 
defenders and journalists. Impunity for human rights violations was also raised as a major 
concern. 
</p>
<p>16. With respect to the security situation, many delegations stated that this remained of 
serious concern, and noted that ending the conflict in Somalia was not only crucial for 
ensuring the stability of the Government but also for fostering global security. Some 
delegations stated that terrorism remained a major threat to establishing an environment 
conducive to the advancement of human rights, and recommended that addressing the 
political and security situation in Somalia should be done in parallel with ensuring the 
promotion and protection of human rights. While condemning the terrorist attack on the 
Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, many delegations stressed that it reinforced the need 
for the international community to further support the Government of Somalia to 
consolidate peace and stability. They stated that the security situation in Somalia could not </p>


<p>be seen in isolation, but rather needed to be seen in the context of its impact across the 
entire horn of Africa.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b>17. The panellists made concluding remarks in response to some of the comments and 
questions raised during the plenary discussion. The Prime Minister outlined the 
Government&#8217;s priorities as follows: improving security and the justice system; proper 
management of public finances; and provision of basic services. He stated that his 
Government was committed to the institutionalization as well as to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. In that regard, he emphasized that implementation of the road 
map was critical, and that the international community could support the Government by 
providing relevant expertise and capacity-building. He explained that an independent 
commission would be set up to monitor the situation of internally displaced persons. The 
Prime Minister urged the international community to honour its pledges contained in the 
Somali Compact, the implementation of which would have an impact on the human rights 
of Somalis.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia pointed out that the 
support expressed for the Government and for the United Nations agencies in Somalia had 
to be converted into concrete action on the ground. There was a need to focus on a limited 
number of priorities in the road map if tangible results were to be achieved, and the 
Government of Somalia should be open to strategic advice from UNSOM and the United 
Nations agencies. He also advised the Government of the necessity of heeding the voice of 
civil society. He cautioned that the international community had to be realistic about what 
could be achieved, given the very challenging situation. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for 
Somalia noted that while all agreed with the diagnosis of the challenges that the country 
faced, there was a difference in approach with regard to tackling the problem. He outlined 
the mechanisms that AMISOM had put in place to address some of the human rights 
concerns, which included a monitoring and investigation mechanism to address concerns 
about protection of civilians, and a prevention, response and awareness mechanism on 
sexual and gender-based violence. AMISOM was also working with civil society 
organizations to provide various humanitarian services to the population. 
</p>
<p>20. The Independent Expert was of the view that the road map needed to be more 
comprehensive, and that it should prioritize the human rights challenges that needed to be 
addressed in the immediate term and should provide appropriate measures and time frames 
for implementation. That would assist the international community to provide targeted 
support. 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Nur reminded the Government that ownership of the road map by all Somalis 
could only be ensured if there was wide consultation on it, including in the regions such as 
Puntland and Galmudug and among the diaspora. 
</p>
<p>22. Ms. Adan emphasized that the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s human rights 
should not be politicized. She stressed that the Government should ensure that 
commitments made at various forums to protect the rights of women were honoured and 
implemented, particularly in order to ensure accountability for sexual and gender-based 
violence.  </p>
