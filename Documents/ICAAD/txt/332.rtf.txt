2ND DEFENDANT

Counsel for the Plaintiff: G.P. Lala, G.P. Lala & Associates

RULING

I have carefully considered the 1st Defendants application for leave to appeal my ruling of 22 September 2003, and the grounds advanced in its support.

I do not believe that I have not exercised the Courts discretion properly in declining the application for joinder by the 1st Defendant under O.15.

In the circumstances leave is denied.

As originally ordered we shall proceed with the hearing of the Plaintiffs Originating Summons. The 21 days given to the 1st Defendant to file its submission begins as from today with the Plaintiffs reply if necessary 7 days thereafter.

The matter is adjourned before the Deputy Registrar for fixing of a hearing date early in the new year.

There will be a stay in the proceedings only if the Defendants application for leave to appeal is filed with the Fiji Court of Appeal Registry within 14 days from today.

Costs in the sum of $250.00 is awarded against the 1st Defendant.
