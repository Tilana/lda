Corporate Governance Statement
Overview 
 
The  Company’s  Board  governs  the  business  on  behalf  of  shareholders  as  a  whole  with  the  prime  objective  of 
protecting and enhancing shareholder value.  The Board is committed to, and ensures that the:-
(i)  executive management runs the Company in accordance a high level of ethics and integrity; 
(ii)  Board and management complies with all applicable laws and regulations; 
(iii)  Company continually reviews the governance framework and practices to ensure it fulfils its
corporate governance obligations.
The Board endorses the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (‘ASX CGP’) however, as a 
junior  company,  at  this  stage  of  the  Company’s  corporate  development,  implementation  of  the  ASX  CGP  is  not 
practical in every instance given the modest size and scale of the Company operations.   
 
During  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  the  Company  considered  the  3rd  Edition  of  the  ASX  CGP.  This  Statement 
reports  on  the  revised  recommendations  and  outlines  the  main  corporate  governance  practices  employed  by  the 
Board. Where it has not adopted a particular recommendation, an explanation is provided.   
 
This Corporate Governance Statement was approved by the Board on 30 August 2016 and is current as at that date 
in  accordance  with  ASX  Listing  Rule  4.10.3.    The  Corporate  Governance  Statement  will  also  be  published  on  the 
Company’s website at http://www.oakajeecorp.com.au/ 
 
1.  Laying solid foundations for management and oversight 
 
Role and Responsibility of Board and Management 
 
The  relationship  between  the  Board  and  senior  management  is  critical  to  the  Company’s  long  term  success.    The 
Board  is  responsible  for  the  performance  of  the  Company  in  both  the  short  and  longer  term  and  seeks  to  balance 
sometimes competing objectives in the best interests of the Company as a whole.  The key aims of the Board are to 
enhance the interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders and to ensure the Company is properly managed. 
 
Day  to  day  management  of  the  Company’s  affairs  and  the  implementation  of  the  corporate  strategy  and  policy 
initiatives are formally delegated by the Board to the Chief Executive Officer and senior management. 
 
The  responsibilities  of  the  Board  as  a  whole,  the  Chairman  and  individual  Directors  are  set  out  in  the  Company’s 
Board  Charter  and  are  consistent  with  ASX  CGP  1.    A  copy  of  the  Board  Charter  is  available  in  the  Corporate 
Governance section of the Company’s website. 
 
Before  appointing  a  new  Director,  the  Company  will  undertake  appropriate  checks  such  as  a  character  reference, 
police clearance certificate, bankruptcy check and any other check it deems appropriate.   Where a Director is to be 
re-elected  or  a  candidate  is  put  up  for  election  to  shareholders,  all  material  information  will  be  provided  to 
shareholders for consideration.   
  
To ensure that Directors clearly understand the requirements of their role, formal letters of appointment are provided 
to them.  The content of the appointment letter is consistent with that set out in ASX CGP 1.    
 
To ensure that Executive Directors clearly understand the requirements of the role, service contracts and formal job 
descriptions are provided to them, the content of which is consistent with ASX CGP1. 
 
Access to information 
 
Directors may access all relevant information required to discharge their duties in addition to information provided in 
Board  papers  and  regular  presentations  delivered  by  executive  management  on  business  performance  and  issues.  
With  the  approval  of  their  Chairman,  Directors  may  seek  independent  professional  advice,  as  required,  at  the 
Company’s expense.

Diversity 
 
The  Board  considers  that  due  to  the  size  of  the  Company,  formally  documenting  the  policy  concerning  gender 
diversity  and  the  setting  of  measurable  diversity  objectives  is  not  appropriate.  The  Company  has  only  one  full  time 
employee  and  utilises  external  consultants  and  contractors  to  complement  the  full  time  workforce  as  and  when 
required.  
 
The Company provides equal employment opportunities to men and women at all times. Measurable objectives will 
be considered by the Board when the Company becomes of a size that warrants such objectives. Once established, 
the Board will review progress against any objectives identified on an annual basis.  
 
Performance Evaluation 
 
The Chairman and/or the Managing Director are responsible for reviewing the performance of each individual Director 
at least once every calendar year with reference to the terms of their employment contract. A Director is nominated to 
review  the  individual  performance  of  the  Chairman  and/or  the  Managing  Director  and  meets  privately  with  him  to 
discuss this assessment.   
 
2.  Structure of the Board
Board composition 
 
The Directors determine the composition and size of the Board in accordance with the Company’s Constitution.  The 
Constitution empowers the Board to set upper and lower limits with the number of Directors not permitted to be less 
than three.  There are currently three Directors appointed to the Board and their skills and experience, qualifications, 
term of office and independence status is set out in the Directors’ Report. 
 
Nominations committee 
 
Due  to  the  Company’s  size  and  scale,  the  Board  has  not  established  a  sub-committee  to  undertake  the 
responsibilities  normally  undertaken  by  a  Nomination  Committee.    The  Board  is  charged  to  undertake  the 
responsibilities normally undertaken by a Nomination Committee. 
 
Board succession/Board skills matrix 
 
The  Board  has  adopted  a  Board  skills  matrix  which  identifies  its  collective  mix  of  skills  and  diversity.  The  current 
composition of the Board is regarded as balanced with a complementary range of skills, independence, diversity and 
experience to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. 
 
Should the Company be in the position where it believes that it or a new  Director does not have the requisite skills 
and  experience,  the  Company  will  ensure  that  appropriate  training  or  development  is  provided  to  ensure  that  the 
current or new Director has sufficient knowledge, skills and an understanding of their responsibilities. 
 
Director independence 
 
Based on the definition of independence published in ASX CGP 2,  only one Director is considered independent. Mr 
Jones  and  Mr  Thomas  are  not  independent  as  they  are  substantial  security  holders  of  the  Company.  Mr  Rose  is 
deemed independent.   
 
Independent Decision Making 
 
The majority of the Board is not independent and the Company recognises that this is a departure from ASX CGP 2. 
All  Directors  bring  to  the  Board  the  requisite  skills  which  are  complementary  to  those  of  the  other  Directors  and 
enable  them  to  adequately  discharge  their  responsibilities  and  bring  independent  judgments  to  bear  on  their 
decisions.
12
OAKAJEE CORPORATION LIMITED
ACN 123 084 453
Corporate Governance Statement
Materiality  thresholds  used  to  assess  Director  independence  have  not  as  yet  been  established  however  the  Board 
considers a Director to be independent where he or she is not a member of management and is free of any business 
or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, 
the Director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Company.   
 
The  Board  believes  that  the  interests  of  the  shareholders  are  best  served  by  the  current  composition  of  the  Board 
which  is  regarded  as  balanced  with  a  complementary  range  of  skills,  diversity  and  experience  as  detailed  in  the 
Directors’ Report. 
 
The following measures are in place to ensure the decision making process of the Board is subject to independent 
judgments:-
-  A standard item on each Board Meeting agenda requires Directors to focus on and declare any conflicts of
interest in addition to those already declared;
-  Directors are permitted to seek the advice of independent experts at the Company’s expense, subject to the
approval of the Chairman;
-  All Directors must act all times in the interest of the Company; and 
-  Directors meet as required independently of executive management.
Ethical and Responsible Decision Making
Adoption of these measures ensures that the interests of shareholders, as a whole, are pursued and not jeopardised 
by a lack of independence. 
 
Inducting new Directors 
 
New  Non-Executive  Directors  will  be  provided  with  a  pack  of  information  and  documents  relating  to  the  Company 
including the Constitution, financial statements, recent Board papers and the various Board policies and charters.     
 
3. 
 
Code of Conduct 
 
A  Code  of  Conduct  Policy  is  in  place  to  promote  ethical  and  responsible  practices  and  standards  for  Directors, 
employees and consultants of the Company to discharge their responsibilities.  This Policy reflects the  Directors’ and 
key officers’ intention to ensure that their duties and responsibilities to the Company are performed with the utmost 
integrity.  A copy of the Code of Conduct policy is available to all employees and is also available in the Corporate 
Governance section of the Company’s website.  The terms are consistent with ASX CGP 3. 
 
4. 
 
Audit Committee 
 
Due  to  the  size  and  scale  of  the  Company,  during  the  year  the  Board  has  not  established  a  sub-committee  to 
undertake the responsibilities normally undertaken by an Audit Committee.   
 
The full Board undertakes all Audit Committee responsibilities in accordance with its Audit Committee Charter located 
on the Company’s website.  The responsibilities include the following:-
Integrity of corporate reporting
-  Reviewing and approving statutory financial reports and all other financial information distributed externally; 
-  Monitoring the effective operation of the risk management and compliance framework; 
-  Reviewing  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  environment  including  compliance  with
-
applicable laws and regulations; 
The  nomination  of  the  external  auditors  and  the  review  of  the  adequacy  of  the  existing  external  audit 
arrangements; and
-  Considering whether non audit services provided by the external auditor are consistent with maintaining the
external auditor’s independence.
The  Company  will  give  consideration  at  an  appropriate  time  in  the  Company’s  development,  for  the  creation  of  an 
Audit Committee.

5.  Timely and balanced disclosure
Rights of Security holders
Continuous Disclosure Policy 
 
The Company has a written policy on information disclosure that focuses on continuous disclosure of any information 
concerning  the  Company  that  a  reasonable  person  would  expect  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  price  of  the 
Company’s securities. 
 
A copy of the Continuous Disclosure Policy is located in the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website

Securities Exchange (ASX).  This role includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with the continuous disclosure 
requirements in the ASX Listing Rules and overseeing and co-ordinating information disclosure to the ASX, analysts,

6. 
 
Website

with ASX CGP 6. 
 
Communication 
 
The  Company’s  Shareholder  Communications  Policy  promotes  effective  communication  with  the  Company’s 
shareholders and encourages shareholder participation at general meetings.  A copy of this Policy, which deals with 
communication through the ASX, the Share Registry, shareholder meetings and the annual report, may be found in 
the  Corporate  Governance  section  of  the  Company’s  website.   All  of  the  Company’s  announcements  to  the  market

electronic communications to, the Company and its share registry. 
 
7.  Recognising and Managing Risk
Risk Committee 
 
Due  to  the  size  and  scale  of  the  Company,  during  the  year  the  Board  has  not  established  a  sub-committee  to 
undertake the responsibilities normally undertaken by a Risk Committee.   
 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that risks, as well as opportunities are identified on a timely basis and receive 
an  appropriate  and  measured  response,  recognising  however  that  no  cost  effective  internal  control  system  will 
preclude all errors and irregularities.
14
OAKAJEE CORPORATION LIMITED
ACN 123 084 453
Corporate Governance Statement
The Company currently is not subject to  any material exposure to environmental and social sustainability risks. The 
principal areas of risk for the Company are in:-
- 
-
occupational health and safety and work related safety risks; and 
financial risk in the areas of maintaining sufficient funding for the continuation of operations and risks related 
to fraud, misappropriation and errors.
The Board will review the effectiveness of implementation of the risk management system and internal control system 
at least annually. When reviewing risk management policies and internal control system the Board should take into 
account  the  Company’s  legal  obligations  and  should  also  consider  the  reasonable  expectations  of  the  Company’s 
stakeholders, including security holders, employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, consumers and the community. 
 
Internal Audit 
 
The  Company  does  not  currently  have  an  internal  audit  function.    Once  the  Company  is  at  a  size  and  scale  that 
warrants  an  internal  auditor  or  nears  production  status,  the  Board  will  be  responsible  for  the  appointment  and 
overseeing of the internal auditor. 
 
8.  Remunerating Fairly and Responsibly 
 
Remuneration and Nominations Committee 
 
Due  to  the  size  and  scale  of  the  Company,  during  the  year  the  Board  has  not  established  a  sub-committee  to 
undertake the responsibilities normally undertaken by a  Remuneration & Nomination Committee. The Company  will 
give consideration at an appropriate time in the Company’s development, for the creation of sub-committees.   
 
The full Board approves all management remuneration including the allocation of options (if any) and involves itself in 
the nomination, selection and retirement of Directors. No Director may be involved in setting their own remuneration 
or  terms  and  conditions  and  in  such  a  case  relevant  Directors  are  required  to  be  absent  from  the  full  Board 
discussion. 
 
The Board seeks to ensure that collectively its membership represents an appropriate balance between Directors with 
experience and knowledge of the Company and Directors with an external or fresh  perspective.  It shall review  the 
range  of  expertise  of  its  members  on  a  regular  basis  and  seeks  to  ensure  that  it  has  operational  and  technical 
expertise relevant to the operation of the Company. 
 
Directors  are  re-elected,  nominated  and  appointed  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the  Board’s  policy  on  these 
matters  set  out  in  the  Remuneration  Committee  Charter,  the  Company’s  Constitution  and  ASX  Listing  Rules.    In 
considering  appointments  to  the  Board,  the  extent  to  which  the  skills  and  experience  of  potential  candidates 
complement those of the Directors in office is considered. 
 
The  Company’s  remuneration  philosophy,  objectives  and  arrangements  are  detailed  in  the  Remuneration  Report 
which forms part of the Directors’ Report.  
 
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors 
 
The annual total of fees to Non-Executive Directors is set by the Company’s shareholders and allocated as Directors’ 
Fees  by  the  Board  on  the  basis  of  the  roles  undertaken  by  the  Directors.    Full  details  of  Directors’  remuneration 
appear  in  the  Remuneration  Report.    These  fees  are  inclusive  of  statutory  superannuation  contributions.    No 
retirement benefits are paid to Non-Executive Directors and no equity-based remuneration scheme exists for them. 
 
Remuneration of Executive Management 
 
Remuneration  packages  for  Executive  management  are  generally  set  to  be  competitive  so  as  to  both  retain 
executives and attract experienced executives to the Company.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
1.  Statement of Significant Accounting Policies
The following is a summary of the material accounting policies adopted by the Company in the preparation of the 
financial  report.  The  accounting  policies  have  been  consistently  applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless 
otherwise stated.
a)  Basis of Preparation
The  financial  report  is  a  general  purpose  financial  report,  which  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements  of 
the  Corporations  Act  2001,  applicable  Australian  Accounting  Standards,  Accounting 
Interpretations and other mandatory professional reporting requirements. The financial report has been prepared 
on a historical cost basis, except for available-for-sale financial assets which have been measured at fair value, 
and is presented in Australian dollars.  
 
Oakajee  Corporation  Limited  is  a  Company  limited  by  shares,  incorporated  and  domiciled  in  Australia,  whose 
shares commenced public trading on the Australian Securities Exchange on  11 June 2008. The Company was 
registered on 11 December 2006.
b)  Statement of Compliance
The  financial  report  of  Oakajee  Corporation  Limited  (the  “Company”  or  “Oakajee”)  for  the  year  ended  30  June 
2016 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 30 August 2016. 
 
The  financial  report  complies  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards,  which  include  Australian  equivalents  to 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“AIFRS”). Compliance with AIFRS ensures that the financial report, 
comprising the financial statements and notes thereto, complies with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”).
c)
New, revised or amending Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted 
 
In  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  the  directors  have  reviewed  all  of  the  new  and  revised  Standards  and 
Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to the Group for the current annual reporting period.   
 
It  has  been  determined  by  the  directors  that  there  is  no  impact,  material  or  otherwise,  of  the  new  and  revised 
Standards and Interpretations on its business and, therefore, no change is necessary to Group accounting policies. 
 
The  directors  have  also  reviewed  all  new  Standards  and  Interpretations  that  have  been  issued  but  are  not  yet 
effective for the year ended 30 June  2016. As a result of this review the directors have determined that there is no 
impact, material or otherwise, of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations on its business and, therefore, 
no change necessary to Group accounting policies.

ACN 123 084 453
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
d)  Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The  application  of  accounting  policies  requires  the  use  of  judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  about 
carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources.  The  estimates  and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing  basis.  Revisions  are  recognised  in  the  period  in  which  the  estimate  is  revised  if  it  affects  only  that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods of the revision affect both current and future periods.
Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets
The  Company  follows  the  guidance  of  AASB  139  Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement  to 
determine  when  an  available-for-sale  financial  asset  is  impaired.    This  determination  requires  significant 
judgement.  In making this judgement, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to 
which  the  fair  value  of  an  investment  is  less  than  its  cost  and  the  financial  health  of  and  short-term  business 
outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology and 
operational and financing cash flows.
A  net  impairment  expense  of  $225,944  (2015:  $198,750)  has  been  recognised  during  the  year  against  the 
Company’s available-for-sale financial assets as these investments have experienced a significant or prolonged 
decline in fair value below their cost.
e)  Going Concern
The financial report has been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern which 
assumes  the  commercial  realisation  of  the  future  potential  of  the  Company’s  assets  and  the  discharge  of  its 
liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
As at 30 June 2016, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of $878,698 and net operating cash outflows 
of $274,571 for the year ended on that date. Notwithstanding this, the accounts have been prepared on a going 
concern  basis.  The  Company  has  available-for-sale  financial  assets  with  a  market  value  of  $1,467,000  at  30 
June 2016. These available-for-sale financial assets represent investments in listed companies which are traded 
on ASX.
The  Company  has  the  ability  to  sell  these  investments  in  a  liquid  market  as  and  when  the  need  for  additional 
working capital arises. Listed shares were disposed of during the year ended 30 June 2016 for total proceeds of 
$1,023,027. Further tranches will be sold if and when the need arises. 
 
Accordingly, the Directors believe that Oakajee Corporation Limited has access to sufficient funding to enable it 
to continue as a going concern and that it is appropriate to adopt that basis of accounting in the financial report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
f)  Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and 
the  revenue  can  be  reliably  measured.  The  following  specific  recognition  criteria  must  also  be  met  before 
revenue can be recognised: 
 
(i)  Interest income
Interest  income  is  accrued  on  a  time  basis,  by  reference  to  the  principal  outstanding  and  at  the  effective 
interest  rate  applicable,  which  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts  through  the 
expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
(ii)  Dividends
Dividends are recognised as revenue when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established.
g)  Leases
Leases are classified at their inception as either operating or finance leases based on the economic substance 
of the agreement so as to reflect the risks and benefits incidental to ownership. 
 
Operating leases 
The minimum lease payments of operating leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks 
and benefits of the leased item, are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
h)  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and on hand. Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.   
 
For  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  and  cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
i)  Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, less an allowance for impairment.  Trade receivables are generally 
due for settlement within periods ranging from 15 days to 30 days.  
 
Impairment  of  trade  receivables  is  continually  reviewed  and  those  that  are  considered  to  be  uncollectible  are 
written  off  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  directly.    An  allowance  account  is  used  when  there  is  objective 
evidence  that  the  Company  will  not  be  able  to  collect  all  amounts  due  according  to  the  original  contractual 
terms.  Factors  considered  by  the  Company  in  making  this  determination  include  known  significant  financial 
difficulties  of  the  debtor,  review  of  financial  information  and  significant  delinquency  in  making  contractual 
payments to the Company.

Trade and other receivables (continued) 
 
The impairment allowance is set equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Where receivables 
are  short-term  discounting  is  not  applied  in  determining  the  allowance.  The  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses. When a trade receivable for which 
an  impairment  allowance  had  been  recognised  becomes  uncollectible  in  a  subsequent  period,  it  is  written  off 
against  the  allowance  account.  Subsequent  recoveries  of  amounts  previously  written  off  are  credited  against 
other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Income tax 
 
The  income  tax  expense  or  benefit  for  the  period  is  the  tax  payable  on  the  current  period’s  taxable  income 
based  on  the  applicable  income  tax  rate  for  each  jurisdiction  adjusted  by  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and 
liabilities attributable to temporary difference and to unused tax losses.  
 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  countries  where  the  Company  operates  and  generate  taxable  income. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation.  
 
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are  
those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance date. 
 
Deferred  income  tax  is  provided  on  all  temporary  differences  at  the  balance  date  between  the  tax  bases  of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:


when  the  deferred  income  tax  liability  arises  from  the  initial  recognition  of  goodwill  or  of  an  asset  or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or 
when  the  taxable  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or 
interests in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax 
assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilised, except:


when the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or 
when  the  deductible  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or 
interests in joint ventures, in which case a deferred tax assets is only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  revise  in  the  foreseeable  future  and  taxable  profit  will  be 
available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent 
that  it  is  no  longer  probable  that  sufficient  taxable  profit  will  be  available  to  allow  all  or  part  of  the  deferred 
income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance date 
and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively  enacted  at  the  balance  date.  Income  taxes  relating  to  items  recognised  directly  in  equity  are 
recognised in equity and not in profit or loss.

k)      Goods and services tax (GST)
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  GST,  except  where  the  amount  of  GST 
incurred  on  a  purchase  of  goods  and  services  is  not  recoverable  from  the  Australian  Tax  Office.  In  these 
circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the 
expense. 
 
Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST. The net amount of 
GST  recoverable  or  payable  is  included  as  a  current  asset  or  current  liability  in  the  statement  of  financial 
position. Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash 
flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable or payable are classified as operating 
cash flows. 
 
Commitments  and  contingencies  are  disclosed  net  of  the  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the 
taxation authority.
l)  Property plant and equipment
Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  depreciation  and  any  accumulated 
impairment losses.  
 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Class of fixed asset
Office Furniture
Depreciation rate
20%
25%
Computer Software and Equipment
Impairment 
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date, with recoverable 
amount  being  estimated  when  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  be 
impaired. 
 
The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current  market assessments of the time value of  money and the risks specific to the 
asset. 
 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs, unless the asset's value in use can be estimated to be close to 
its fair value. 
 
An  impairment  exists  when  the  carrying  value  of  an  asset  or  cash-generating  units  exceeds  its  estimated 
recoverable amount. The asset or cash-generating unit is then written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
Derecognition and disposal 
An  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  derecognised  upon  disposal  or  when  no  further  future  economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit and loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
m)  Financial assets
Financial  assets  within  the  scope  of  AASB  139  Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement  are 
classified  as  either  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  loans  and  receivables,  held-to-maturity 
investments,  or  available-for-sale  investments,  as  appropriate.  When  financial  assets  are  recognised  initially,  
they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly 
attributable  transaction  costs.  The  Company  determines  the  classification  of  its  financial  assets  after  initial 
recognition  and,  when  allowed  and  appropriate,  re-evaluates  this  designation  at  each  financial  year-end.  All 
regular  way  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  assets  are  recognised  on  the  trade  date  i.e.  the  date  that  the 
Company  commits  to  purchase  the  asset.  Regular  way  purchases  or  sales  are  purchases  or  sales  of financial 
assets under contracts that require delivery of the assets within the period established generally by regulation or 
convention in the marketplace. 
 
(i)    Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial  assets  classified  as  held  for  trading  are  included  in  the  category  ‘financial  assets  at  fair  value 
through profit or loss’. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose 
of selling in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as 
effective  hedging  instruments.  Gains  or  losses  on  investments  held  for  trading  are  recognised  in  profit  or 
loss.
(ii)   Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as held-
to-maturity when the Company has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Investments intended 
to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification. Investments that are intended to be 
held-to-maturity, such as bonds, are subsequently measured at amortised cost. This cost is computed as the 
amount initially recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the 
effective interest method of any difference between the initially recognised amount and the maturity amount. 
This  calculation  includes  all  fees  and  points  paid  or  received  between  parties  to  the  contract  that  are  an 
integral  part  of  the  effective  interest  rate,  transaction  costs  and  all  other  premiums  and  discounts.  For 
investments  carried  at  amortised  cost,  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  when  the 
investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
(iii)  Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted  in  an  active  market.  Such  assets  are  carried  at amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method. 
Gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  loans  and  receivables  are  derecognised  or 
impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
(iv)  Available-for-sale investments
Available-for-sale investments are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-
sale or are not classified as any of the three preceding categories. After initial recognition available-for sale 
investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of 
equity  until  the  investment  is  derecognised  or  until  the  investment  is  determined  to  be  impaired,  at  which 
time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
The  fair  value  of  investments  that  are  actively  traded  in  organised  financial  markets  is  determined  by 
reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance date. For investments with no 
active  market,  fair  value  is  determined  using  valuation  techniques.  Such  techniques  include  using  recent 
arm’s  length  market  transactions;  reference  to  the  current  market  value  of  another  instrument  that  is 
substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
n)  De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
(i)    Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial 
assets) is derecognised when: 
 

the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; 
the Company retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to 
pay   them in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or

OAKAJEE CORPORATION LIMITED
ACN 123 084 453
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
n)  De-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either:
 
(a)  has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
 
(b)  has  neither  transferred  nor  retained  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  asset,  but  has
transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset 
is  recognised  to  the  extent  of  the  Company’s  continuing  involvement  in  the  asset.  Continuing  involvement 
that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration received that the Company could be required 
to repay.
(ii)  Financial liabilities
A  financial  liability  is  derecognised  when  the  obligation  under  the  liability  is  discharged  or  cancelled  or 
expires.  When  an  existing  financial  liability  is  replaced  by  another  from  the  same  lender  on  substantially 
different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are  substantially  modified,  such  an  exchange  or 
modification  is  treated  as  a de-recognition  of  the  original  liability  and  the  recognition of  a  new  liability,  and 
the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
o)
Impairment of financial assets
(i)   Financial assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has 
been  incurred,  the  amount  of  the loss  is  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  asset’s carrying  amount 
and the presented value of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been 
incurred)  discounted  at  the  financial  asset’s  original  effective  interest  rate  (i.e.  the  effective  interest  rate 
computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of 
an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets 
that  are  individually  significant,  and  individually  or  collectively  for  financial  assets  that  are  not  individually 
significant.  If  it  is  determined  that  no  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists  for  an  individually  assessed 
financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a Company of financial assets with similar 
credit  risk  characteristics  and  that  Company  of  financial  assets  is  collectively  assessed  for  impairment. 
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be 
recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.  
 
If, in  a  subsequent  period,  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  decreases  and  the  decrease  can  be  related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss, to the extent 
that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
(ii)  Available-for-sale investments
If  there  is  objective  evidence  that  an  available-for-sale  investment  is  impaired,  an  amount  comprising  the 
difference between its cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and is current fair value, less 
any  impairment  loss  previously  recognised  in  profit  or  loss,  is  transferred  from  equity  to  the  statement  of 
comprehensive  income.  Reversals  of  impairment  losses  for  equity  instruments  classified  as  available-for-
sale are not recognised in profit. Reversals of impairment losses for debt instruments are reversed through 
profit or loss if the increase in an instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event occurring after 
the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
p)  Trade and other payables
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised cost and represent liabilities for goods and services 
provided  to  the  Company  prior  to  the  end  of  the  financial  year  that  are  unpaid  and  arise  when  the  Company 
becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. Trade and 
other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months.
q)  Provisions
Provisions  are  recognised  when  the  Company  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a  result  of  a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for 
future operating losses. 
 
When  the  Company  expects  some  or  all  of  a  provision  to  be  reimbursed,  for  example  under  an  insurance 
contract,  the  reimbursement  is  recognised  as  a  separate  asset  but  only  when  the  reimbursement  is  virtually 
certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any 
reimbursement.
If  the  effect  of  the  time  value  of  money  is  material,  provisions  are  discounted  using  a  current  pre-tax  rate  that 
reflects  the  risks  specific  to  the  liability.  When  discounting  is  used,  the  increase  in  the  provision  due  to  the 
passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
r)  Employee leave benefits
Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits  and accumulating  sick leave expected to be 
settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in other payables in respect of employees’ services 
up to the  reporting date and are  measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
Liabilities  for  non-accumulating  sick  leave  are  recognised  when  the  leave  is  taken  and  measured  at  the  rates 
paid or payable.
s)
Issued capital
Ordinary  share  capital  is  recognised  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  by  the  Company.  Any 
transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds received.
t)  Earnings or loss per share
Basic earnings or loss per share is calculated as net profit or loss after income tax attributable to members of the 
Company,  adjusted  to  exclude  any  costs  of  servicing  equity  (other  than  dividends)  and  preference  share 
dividends,  divided    by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  outstanding,  adjusted  for  any  bonus 
elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.

t)  Earnings or loss per share (continued)
Diluted  earnings  or  loss  per  share  is  calculated  as  net  profit  or  loss  attributable  to  members  of  the  Company, 
adjusted for: 
 

costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends; 
the  after  tax  effect  of  dividends  and  interest  associated  with  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares  that  have 
been recognised as expenses; and
other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of 
potential  ordinary  shares;  divided  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  and  dilutive  potential 
ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
u)  Segment reporting
Operating  segments  are  reported  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  internal  reporting  provided  to  the  chief 
operating  decision  maker.  The  chief  operating  decision maker,  who  is  responsible for  allocating  resources  and 
assessing  performance  of  the  operating  segments,  has  been  identified  as  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Oakajee 
Corporation Limited.
v)  Comparative figures
When  required  by  Accounting  Standards,  comparative  figures  have  been  adjusted  to  conform  to  changes  in 
presentation for the current financial year.

The  Company  has  tax  losses  arising  in  Australia,  the  tax  effect  of  these  losses  is  $1,609,165  (2015: 
$1,336,882).  The  losses  are  available  indefinitely  for  offset  against future  taxable  profits  of  the  companies  in 
which the losses arose. 
  
The deductible temporary differences and tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax 
assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the Company can utilise the benefits thereof.

19.   Financial instruments disclosure (continued) 
 
(f) Credit risk 
 
Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial 
loss to the Company. The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and 
obtaining  sufficient  collateral  where  appropriate,  as  a  means  of  mitigating  the  risk  of  financial  loss  from 
defaults. The Company only transacts with entities that are rated to the equivalent of investment grade and 
above. This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, the 
Company uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate is major customers.  
 
The  Company’s  exposure  and  the  credit  ratings  of  its  counterparties  are  continuously  monitored  and  the 
aggregate  value  of  transactions  concluded  is  spread  amongst  approved  counterparties.  Credit  exposure  is 
controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board annually.  
 
The Company does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any  Company 
of  counterparties  having  similar  characteristics.  The  credit  risk  on  liquid  funds  is  limited  because  the 
counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.  
 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, 
represents  the  Company’s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  without  taking  account  of  the  value  of  any 
collateral obtained. 
 
(g) Equity price risks 
 
The Company is exposed to equity price risks arising from equity investments. Equity investments are held for 
strategic  rather  than  trading  purposes.  The  Company  does  not  actively  trade  these  investments.  The 
Company’s investments are publicly traded and ASX listed.  
 
Equity price sensitivity 
The  sensitivity  analysis  below  have  been  determined  based  on  the  exposure  to  equity  price  risks  at  the 
balance date.  
 
At balance date, if the equity prices had been 5% higher or lower:
  Net loss for the year ended 30 June 2016 would decrease/increase by $73,350 (2015: $37,100) as a
result of disposal and impairment recorded on available-for-sale financial assets; and
  Other  equity  reserves  would  decrease/increase  by  $73,350  (2015:  $97,600)  as  a  result  of  the
changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets.
The Company’s sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior year.
(h) Fair value of financial instruments  
 
AASB  7  Financial  Instruments:  Disclosures  requires  disclosure  of  fair  value  measurements  by  level  of  the 
following fair value measurement hierarchy:
  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1); 

Inputs  other  than  quoted  prices  included  within  level  1  that  are  observable  for  the  asset  or  liability, 
either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2 ); and 
Inputs  for  the  asset  or  liability  that  are  not  based  on  observable  market  data  (unobservable  inputs) 
(level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as available-for-sale securities) is based 
on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets 
held by the Company is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.
(i) Liquidity Risk
Ultimate  responsibility  for  liquidity  risk  management  rests  with  the  Board  of  Directors,  who  have  built  an 
appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and 
long-term  funding  and  liquidity  management  requirements.  The  Company  manages  liquidity  risk  by 
maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report  that gives a true and

requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  report,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s preparation of the financial report 
that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion  on the effectiveness of the  company’s internal control. An 
audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 
accounting  estimates  made  by  the  directors,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial 
report.
Our audit did not involve an analysis of the prudence of business decisions made by directors or management.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.

In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.
