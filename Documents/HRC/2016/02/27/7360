<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
</p>
<p>Rashida Manjoo, visited Honduras from 1 to 8 July 2014. The purpose of the visit was to 
</p>
<p>examine the situation of violence against women in the country in a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>manner, including violence perpetrated within the family, in the community, in institutional 
</p>
<p>settings and in the transnational sphere. During the visit she met with relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba.  
</p>
<p>2. In Tegucigalpa, the Special Rapporteur met with the Deputy Minister for Security, 
</p>
<p>the Deputy Secretary for Justice and Human Rights and representatives of her department;1 
</p>
<p>the Deputy Secretary for Social Development and representatives of her department, 
</p>
<p>including the Deputy Chair of the National Institute for Women (INAM); representatives of 
</p>
<p>the Gender Unit of the Honduran National Police; the President of the Supreme Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice; members of the congressional Commission on Gender Equity; staff of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the Public Prosecutor (Fiscal&#237;a General); and representatives of the Office of the National 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (CONADEH), the National Committee for the Prevention 
</p>
<p>of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CONAPREV) and the Inter-
</p>
<p>Agency Commission to Combat Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons (CICESCT). In San Pedro Sula and in La Ceiba, she met with the mayors and with 
</p>
<p>the staff of each city&#8217;s Municipal Office for Women (OMM). 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to speak with the staff and women 
</p>
<p>survivors of violence in three shelters and to hear the testimonies of women and girls in 
</p>
<p>detention facilities. In La Ceiba, she visited a comprehensive centre for victims of domestic 
</p>
<p>and sexual violence (Centro MAI), where she met with the staff working in the medical and 
</p>
<p>legal units. She also met with representatives of civil society, including women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>organizations, and representatives of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses her deep appreciation to all her interlocutors, 
</p>
<p>including State authorities and representatives of civil society organizations and United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies. Most importantly, she wishes to thank the individual women who shared 
</p>
<p>their personal experiences of violence and survival with her. She looks forward to a fruitful 
</p>
<p>and continued dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the implementation 
</p>
<p>of her recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Honduras is classified as a lower middle-income country with a population 
</p>
<p>estimated at 8.1 million in 2013. Approximately 65 per cent of the population lives in 
</p>
<p>poverty. While 60 per cent of the national income is earned by the wealthiest 20 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the nation, the poorest 20 per cent earn just 2.02 per cent of the income.2 High levels of 
</p>
<p>illiteracy and low levels of school attendance are also challenges facing Honduras.  
</p>
<p>6. In a historical context of poverty, underdevelopment and citizen insecurity, the 2009 
</p>
<p>coup further resulted in serious human rights violations being committed. On 28 June 2009, 
</p>
<p>the Honduran military forces apprehended the then President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Prior to the recent restructuring of the Government, the Department of Justice and Human Rights was 
</p>
<p>a ministry.  
</p>
<p> 2 World Bank data indicators of income share held by lowest 20 per cent. See 
</p>
<p>www.tradingeconomics.com/honduras/income-share-held-by-lowest-20percent-wb-data.html. </p>

<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>and led to his forced exit out of the country. The justification given was that he had planned 
</p>
<p>to organize a poll on the possibility of holding a referendum on constitutional reforms prior 
</p>
<p>to the November 2009 elections. Thereafter the then Speaker of Congress, Roberto 
</p>
<p>Michelitti, was sworn in as the new President of Honduras. The international community 
</p>
<p>largely recognized these actions as a military coup, which further exacerbated the situation 
</p>
<p>and negatively affected Honduran society as a whole. As a response to the coup, the 
</p>
<p>international community imposed sanctions and economic pressure on the country. The 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic inequalities are compounded by high homicide rates, alarming levels of 
</p>
<p>other expressions of violence, robberies, extortion, the proliferation of small and light 
</p>
<p>weapons, and an increase in organized crime and the drug trade. The actions of violent 
</p>
<p>gangs (<i>maras</i>) further contribute to high levels of insecurity.  
</p>
<p>7. In recent years, Honduras has been undergoing a period of stabilization. A number 
</p>
<p>of measures have been taken to address the climate of widespread and systematic crime, 
</p>
<p>corruption and impunity, including, among others, the establishment in 2010 of a ministry 
</p>
<p>of justice and human rights and the setting up of the Truth Commission to examine events 
</p>
<p>surrounding the 2009 coup. To address the growing insecurity and violence, in November 
</p>
<p>2011 the Congress passed an emergency decree allowing military personnel to carry out 
</p>
<p>public service duties. In August 2013 it authorized the creation of a military police force 
</p>
<p>with powers to seize control of violent neighbourhoods and make arrests, among other 
</p>
<p>duties.3 The role and continuing influence of the military in general, but particularly in 
</p>
<p>policing and education activities, was a concern expressed by many interviewees.  
</p>
<p>8. In addition, the current Government, which has been in place since January 2014, 
</p>
<p>has adopted strategies to tackle the financial crisis and reduce costs, while enhancing 
</p>
<p>efficiency in responding to critical issues at the national level. For example, there has been 
</p>
<p>a considerable reduction in the number of government ministries. However, the overall lack 
</p>
<p>of institution-building, the high turnover of staff in the civil service, the reduction of 
</p>
<p>specialized services and the politicization of appointment processes negatively affect the 
</p>
<p>continuity and sustainability of Government policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Manifestations of violence against women  
</b></p>
<p>9. Violence against women is widespread and systematic and affects women and girls 
</p>
<p>in numerous ways. A climate of fear, in both the public and private spheres, and a lack of 
</p>
<p>accountability for violations of human rights of women are the norm, despite legislative and 
</p>
<p>institutional developments.  
</p>
<p>10. In 2006, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the prevalence of many forms of violence against women, 
</p>
<p>including sexual abuse against women and girls, particularly incestuous abuse of girls, as 
</p>
<p>well as rape, domestic violence and femicide (CEDAW/C/HON/CO/6, para. 18).  
</p>
<p>11. The existence of multiple and conflicting statistics reported by different stakeholders 
</p>
<p>gives rise to concerns about the accuracy of data collection. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women in the family 
</b></p>
<p>12. According to the national health and population survey for the period covering 
</p>
<p>2011/12, 27 per cent of women aged between 15 and 49 years interviewed stated that they 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 See Decree No. 168-2013 establishing the Military Police for Public Order. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.1

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>had been subjected to physical violence at some point in their lives.4 In 2012, the Statistical 
</p>
<p>Observatory of the Office of the Public Prosecutor reported receiving more than 
</p>
<p>16 thousand complaints related to violence against women. About 74.6 per cent of those 
</p>
<p>complaints pertained to domestic violence and intrafamily violence, followed by sex 
</p>
<p>crimes, which accounted for almost 20 per cent of the total.  
</p>
<p>13. Domestic violence remains the leading reported crime at the national level. Between 
2009 and 2012, 82,547 domestic violence complaints were lodged in both <i>juzgados de 
</i></p>
<p><i>letras</i> (first instance courts) and <i>juzgados de paz</i> (local courts that address minor cases) 
</p>
<p>across the territory.5 Statistics illustrate that Honduran women are disproportionately 
</p>
<p>affected by domestic violence: of the 21,170 such complaints received by the courts in 
</p>
<p>2013, 19,458 (92 per cent) were filed by women, as compared to 1,712 filed by men.6 
</p>
<p>Statistics provided by the Special Prosecutor for Women show a low percentage of 
</p>
<p>convictions as compared to the large number of complaints. During the 2012&#8211;2014 period, 
</p>
<p>4,992 complaints were registered, with just 134 convictions.7  
</p>
<p>14. Femicides have increased alarmingly in recent years and were highlighted as a major 
</p>
<p>source of concern by all interlocutors. In 2012, 606 cases of femicides were reported, which 
</p>
<p>represents, on average, 51 women murdered per month.8 According to preliminary statistics 
</p>
<p>from official sources, 629 cases of femicide were registered in 2013. A total of 445 violent 
</p>
<p>deaths of women were reported through the main media outlets during the same period.9 
</p>
<p>Traditionally, domestic violence and intrafamily violence were the leading causes of 
</p>
<p>femicides, but new scenarios involving sexual violence, gang-related violence and 
</p>
<p>organized crime have emerged in Honduras. It is reported that one in five cases of femicide 
</p>
<p>occurs in the context of domestic or intrafamiliar violence; 7 per cent are linked to sexual 
</p>
<p>violence and 60 per cent are linked to organized crime.10  
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women in the community 
</b></p>
<p>15. Violence against women in the community can include rape and other forms of 
</p>
<p>sexual assault and harassment. During the period from 2006 to 2010, the number of cases of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence reported to the police per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 42.35 in 2006 to 
</p>
<p>52.65 in 2009.11 The online database of the judiciary indicates that 2,850 cases relating to 
</p>
<p>sexual offences were registered between 2011 and 2013, including, among others, cases of

<p> 7 The Government of Honduras provided statistics in its response to the draft report provided, and 
</p>
<p>informed the Special Rapporteur that a technical agency for criminal investigation would soon be 
</p>
<p>established.

</p>
<p>rape, sexual intercourse with a minor and abduction.12 However, other sources claim that in 
</p>
<p>2013 alone, approximately 2,851 sexual violence complaints were filed.13  
</p>
<p>16. The acts of gangs further exacerbate the levels of violence and insecurity in 
</p>
<p>Honduras. Young girls involved in gangs are subjected to rape and are forced to carry drugs 
</p>
<p>and guns. They are also pressured to have sex during initiation rituals. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that women and girls between the ages of 15 and 34 are often 
</p>
<p>killed in vengeance acts to settle disputes between gang members. The victims&#8217; bodies 
</p>
<p>reveal the brutality inflicted, including appalling levels of mutilation and torture, and also 
</p>
<p>decapitation to erase all traces of identity. Those acts, which are most common in urban 
</p>
<p>areas, are often also associated with acts of kidnapping and sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>17. Violence against sex workers is escalating. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender 
</p>
<p>and intersex community is also facing escalating violence; the Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that 107 members of this community were murdered between 1994 and October 
</p>
<p>2012 in the departments of Francisco Moraz&#225;n, Cort&#233;s, Atl&#225;ntida, Islas de la Bah&#237;a, 
</p>
<p>Choluteca, Comayagua, Olancho and El Para&#237;so.14 Lesbians and other women who live 
</p>
<p>outside of heterosexual norms are often subjected to violence, rape and other forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination. In the workplace they are often bullied, harassed or overlooked for 
</p>
<p>promotions, and may even be denied employment due to their style of dress.15 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed of an increasing trend of migration, especially among transgender 
</p>
<p>sex workers seeking to flee from discrimination and abuse.  
</p>
<p>18. The working conditions in <i>maquila</i> plants in the country&#8217;s export processing zones 
</p>
<p>(EPZs) are also a subject of concern. The <i>maquila</i> industry employs approximately 125,000 
</p>
<p>people, 65 per cent of whom are women.16 Most of the employees are young women from 
</p>
<p>rural areas between the ages of 17 to 25. Interviewees referred to recurrent violations of 
</p>
<p>their rights, including verbal and physical abuse by supervisors, sexual harassment, being 
</p>
<p>subjected to pre-employment pregnancy tests, unfair dismissal and discrimination on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of pregnancy, and denial of maternity leave and other social benefits.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence perpetrated and/or condoned by the State 
</b></p>
<p>19. It has been reported that, during and after the coup, hundreds of people were brutally 
</p>
<p>repressed by the police, the military and security forces to break up demonstrations, and 
</p>
<p>that more than 10 people died. Multiple cases of threats, intimidation, illegal arrests, 
</p>
<p>kidnappings and torture occurred.17The Special Rapporteur was also informed of cases of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances of women. Sources indicate that there has been a 281 per cent

<p>increase in reported cases of disappeared women, up from 91 cases in 2008 to 347 in

</p>
<p>20. As regards the situation in prisons and other detention facilities, in 2009 the 
</p>
<p>Committee against Torture expressed concern at reports of frequent ill-treatment and torture 
</p>
<p>and excessive use of force on arrest, as well as acts of extortion by law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials, and at the persistent high number of detainees, both children and adults, in 
</p>
<p>prolonged pretrial detention (CAT/C/HND/CO/1, para. 14). In 2012, the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights reported that the main structural deficiencies in the 
</p>
<p>Honduran prison system included the delegation of internal control of the prisons to the 
</p>
<p>prisoners themselves; overcrowding; lack of sufficient budget and adequate legal structure; 
</p>
<p>lack of professional prison staff that was trained and specialized; and the lack of separation 
</p>
<p>between male and female inmates and between those awaiting trial and those who had been 
</p>
<p>convicted. In 2012, CONADEH reported that 56 per cent of the total prison population 
</p>
<p>consisted of convicted persons, whereas the remaining 44 per cent had yet to be 
</p>
<p>sentenced.19 CONAPREV, established in 2008, monitors detention centres and ensures that 
</p>
<p>the treatment of prisoners is in compliance with the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
</p>
<p>Treatment of Prisoners.  
</p>
<p>21. As in most countries, the number of incarcerated women in Honduras has been 
</p>
<p>growing, with a female inmate population of 718 female prisoners across 24 prisons. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur visited the national penitentiary for women (Penitenciar&#237;a Nacional 
</p>
<p>Femenina de Adaptaci&#243;n Social), the only prison exclusively for women, in Tamara, 
</p>
<p>40 kilometres from Tegucigalpa. At the time of the visit, 300 inmates and 12 children, who 
</p>
<p>are allowed to stay with their mothers up to the age of 4, were housed in the facility. 
</p>
<p>Although high degrees of overcrowding were not observed, the Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that at times there were up to 16 women in a 4 metre by 4 metre cell. Currently 
</p>
<p>the food budget allocated to each inmate is about 13 lempiras for three meals, which is the 
</p>
<p>equivalent of approximately US$ 0.60.20 In addition, while there is a complaints procedure 
</p>
<p>within the facility to report abuse, the Special Rapporteur was informed that fear of 
</p>
<p>repercussions against families prevents inmates from voicing their concerns.  
</p>
<p>22. Women are held for crimes such as theft, extortion, possession and trafficking of 
</p>
<p>drugs, kidnapping and murder. While some have been convicted, many women were still 
</p>
<p>awaiting sentencing or trial.21 The women in the latter situation regularly miss their 
</p>
<p>hearings due to inadequate legal representation and the unavailability of transportation to 
</p>
<p>go to court. The Special Rapporteur was informed that after two years as pretrial detainees, 
</p>
<p>the women are released. Through interviews with both inmates and staff, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur confirmed that many women in detention have a history of being subjected to 
</p>
<p>violence prior to being imprisoned. The links between violence against women and 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s incarceration, whether prior to, during or after incarceration, is not being 
</p>
<p>adequately addressed.  
</p>
<p>23. Located in the vicinity of the women&#8217;s penitentiary are two rehabilitation facilities 
</p>
<p>for 12- to 18-year-old adolescents who are in conflict with the law. Those institutions were

<p>2013. </p>

</p>
<p>under the administration of the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family (IHNFA), 
</p>
<p>with one facility for adolescent boys and the other for girls. Due to recent changes by the 
</p>
<p>Government, the Institute is no longer in existence. At the time of the visit, 22 girls had 
</p>
<p>been temporarily transferred to the premises of the Casita 21 de Octubre, a centre for 
</p>
<p>vulnerable adolescent boys who are not yet in trouble with the law. The boys were moved 
</p>
<p>to the girls&#8217; detention centre in Tamara. Reasons for the urgent relocation of the girls 
</p>
<p>include allegations of improper management; the need to address repeated break-out 
</p>
<p>attempts; and the need to prevent the girls from fraternizing with the boys in the other 
</p>
<p>detention facility.  
</p>
<p>24. The majority of the girls had been detained for theft and drug crimes and on the 
</p>
<p>presumption that they were involved with gangs, in accordance with article 332 of the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code on &#8220;unlawful associations&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur heard from the girls and 
</p>
<p>also witnessed the injuries sustained by some of them due to the excessive use of force to 
</p>
<p>enforce cooperation and obedience to the rules set by the administrators of the facility. The 
</p>
<p>issue of violence against the girls was raised with CONAPREV during the mission. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also notes the lack of rehabilitation activities offered to the girls in the 
</p>
<p>facility. 
</p>
<p>25. The problematic nature of article 332 is of concern, as the term &#8220;unlawful 
</p>
<p>associations&#8221; can and has led to the incarceration of girls without proper due process. In 
</p>
<p>2009, the Committee against Torture expressed concern that a suspected member of an 
</p>
<p>&#8220;unlawful association&#8221; could be arrested without an arrest warrant and that his/her 
</p>
<p>detention on remand was mandatory. It expressed further concern at the repressive social 
</p>
<p>policy in combating &#8220;unlawful associations&#8221;, or &#8220;<i>maras</i>&#8221; or &#8220;<i>pandillas</i>&#8221;, which did not 
</p>
<p>adequately consider the root causes of the phenomenon and might criminalize children and 
</p>
<p>young people on the sole ground of their appearance (CAT/C/HND/CO/1, para. 19). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence linked to the transnational sphere 
</b></p>
<p>26. Due to its strategic location, Honduras is a country of origin and transit in Central 
</p>
<p>America and, to a lesser extent, a destination country, confronted with numerous challenges 
</p>
<p>related to migration and to trafficking, both of persons and of narcotics.  
</p>
<p>27. The lack of economic opportunities pushes people to leave their homes and 
</p>
<p>communities in search of better lives. Some are drawn to neighbouring countries, while 
</p>
<p>others migrate to the United States of America. Reportedly, 17,582 unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>undocumented minors were apprehended at United States borders in 2014. Of the 98 
</p>
<p>children from Honduras interviewed by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 44 per cent had been threatened with or were 
</p>
<p>victims of violence by organized armed criminal actors; 24 per cent reported abuse at 
</p>
<p>home; 11 per cent reported that they had been victims of both violence in society and abuse 
</p>
<p>in the home; and 21 per cent discussed situations of deprivation.22 Sources indicate that 
</p>
<p>from 1997 to 2012, 250,205 migrants were returned/deported by the United States back to 
</p>
<p>Honduras.23  
</p>
<p>28. Impoverished women and children are particularly vulnerable and are often tricked 
</p>
<p>or forced into commercial sexual exploitation or servitude. Although they are promised 
</p>
<p>well-paying jobs in the service-related sector, upon arrival at their destinations, they are 
</p>
<p>made to work under inhumane conditions and are often subjected to threats of deportation 
</p>

<p>or incarceration, physical and emotional abuse and violence. Trafficking remains grossly 
</p>
<p>underreported due to the hidden nature of the crime, and also the prevalence of organized 
</p>
<p>crime. The Office of the Public Prosecutor registered 27 complaints of trafficking of 
</p>
<p>women for sexual exploitation in 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implications of inequality, discrimination and violence  
</b></p>
<p>29. Equality and non-discrimination principles are enshrined in the Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Honduras and other legal instruments, but there is still considerable de facto gender 
</p>
<p>inequality in the civil, political, economic and social spheres, which precludes the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by women and girls.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights  
</b></p>
<p>30. Violence against women negatively affects civil and political rights, including, 
</p>
<p>among others, women&#8217;s right to life, bodily integrity and equal protection under the law.  
</p>
<p>The right to life is guaranteed under article 65 of the Constitution. During her visit, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed that the number of violent deaths of women had risen by 
</p>
<p>263.4 per cent between 2005 and 2013. Evidence suggests a direct correlation between 
</p>
<p>femicide rates and the proliferation and use of small arms. In Honduras, a person is legally 
</p>
<p>allowed to register up to five firearms.24 Given that men comprise the majority of those who 
</p>
<p>use small arms, they represent a threat both at home and on the streets, thus contributing to 
</p>
<p>the generalized culture of violence and insecurity facing women and girls in particular. 
</p>
<p>31. Violence against women also restricts women&#8217;s freedom of movement in a number 
</p>
<p>of ways. The Special Rapporteur was informed that during the demonstrations that had 
</p>
<p>taken place during the coup, several women had been arbitrarily detained and suffered 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse. This type of behaviour further served to intimidate women into avoiding the 
</p>
<p>public arena, thus affecting women&#8217;s effective participation in decision-making processes, 
</p>
<p>both in the public and private spheres. Prior to the restructuring of the Government, women 
</p>
<p>held 3 out of 17 ministerial positions.25 The Equal Opportunities for Women Act of 2000 
</p>
<p>established, for the first time, a minimum 30 per cent quota for women with respect to posts 
</p>
<p>filled by popular vote. Despite this provision, women represented only 7.1 per cent of 
</p>
<p>elected officials in Congress in 2001. The mandatory requirement for political parties to 
</p>
<p>comply with the provisions on participation by women, contained in the reform of the 
</p>
<p>Elections and Political Organizations Act in 2004, proved to be effective, as in 2005, 
</p>
<p>women constituted 24.2 per cent of the candidates elected. However, women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>representation in parliament dropped to 19.5 per cent in 2009.  
</p>
<p>32. In April 2012, Congress approved an amendment to article 105 of the elections law 
</p>
<p>which increased the minimum quota of women candidates from 30 to 40 per cent for 
</p>
<p>primary elections. The amendment also stipulated that the quota would increase to 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent for future election processes.26

</p>
<p>33. Women made up 40.4 per cent of candidates for Congress and 20.8 per cent of 
</p>
<p>candidates for mayor in the 2013 general elections. The elections resulted in a Congress 
</p>
<p>with 24.2 per cent women members, and local governments in which 6.7 per cent of mayors 
</p>
<p>are women.27 With regard to the judiciary, there are 798 judges and magistrates in 
</p>
<p>Honduras; of those, 398 are women.28 Of the 15 magistrates in the Supreme Court, 3 are 
</p>
<p>women.29 A gender unit was established within the Supreme Court pursuant to Accord 
</p>
<p>No. 04-2010 of 30 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that access to justice for women, including for 
</p>
<p>indigenous and Afro-descendant women, is seriously compromised due to a range of 
</p>
<p>institutional and procedural factors. These obstacles include insufficient resources and poor 
</p>
<p>infrastructure; the lack of specialized units and staff trained on gender issues within the 
</p>
<p>different criminal justice institutions, including police, prosecutors and judges; and the 
</p>
<p>length of trials and delays in the criminal justice process. Moreover, the lack of proper 
</p>
<p>investigation, evidence collection and forensic facilities and capacities further hinder 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s access to justice.  
</p>
<p>35. Reporting of violence against women is extremely low compared to the actual 
</p>
<p>occurrence. Reasons that prevent women and girls from seeking help or reporting acts of 
</p>
<p>violence include stigma, shame, discrimination, fear of reprisals from the perpetrators, 
</p>
<p>feelings of guilt and lack of support from friends and family, as well as complications and 
</p>
<p>risks on prior to lodging the complaints.30 The Special Rapporteur was informed that even 
</p>
<p>when women wish to file complaints, they are often encouraged to withdraw the case. The 
</p>
<p>lack of a responsive environment, and the lack of economic independence, results in many 
</p>
<p>victims being compelled to stay in abusive relationships.  
</p>
<p>36. As regards domestic violence, while there are legal provisions aimed at securing the 
</p>
<p>safety of those accessing justice through protection orders, injunctions or other interim 
</p>
<p>measures, the Special Rapporteur was informed that perpetrators seldom abide by these 
</p>
<p>provisions. In theory, the latest amendment to article 23 (8) of the Domestic Violence Act 
</p>
<p>of 1997 protects the confidentiality of the concerned parties, but in fact it restricts victims&#8217; 
</p>
<p>access to justice by preventing service providers from having access to information 
</p>
<p>necessary to assist such clients with their cases.31 The Special Rapporteur also notes the 
</p>
<p>absence of an effective witness protection programme and safe accommodation for those at 
</p>
<p>risk of further violations.32 
</p>
<p>37. Human rights defenders, particularly those working on issues linked to land claims, 
</p>
<p>environmental protection and the rights of minorities, face numerous challenges, including 
</p>
<p>harassment, intimidation and reprisals related to their activities. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>was informed of the case of Gregoria Flores Mart&#237;nez, a member of the Honduran Black 
</p>
<p>Fraternal Organization (OFRANEH), who was shot and wounded by security forces on 
</p>
<p>30 May 2005 as she was collecting testimony to present before the Inter-American Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. The Court issued a ruling acknowledging the precarious security situation

</p>
<p> 32 Despite the response from the Government indicating that victims in need of special protection are

<p>measures for Ms. Flores, her family and other members of OFRANEH.33 
</p>
<p>38. Interviewees largely confirmed the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders that women defenders are more at risk of certain forms 
</p>
<p>of violence and other violations, such as prejudice, exclusion and repudiation, than their 
</p>
<p>male counterparts due to the fact that they are seen as challenging accepted sociocultural 
</p>
<p>norms, traditions, perceptions and stereotypes about femininity, sexual orientation and the 
</p>
<p>role and status of women in society, which often serve to normalize and perpetuate forms of 
</p>
<p>violence and oppression. Furthermore, their complaints are often dismissed and they are 
</p>
<p>subjected to repeated threats and intimidation by the authorities (see A/HRC/22/47/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic and developmental rights  
</b></p>
<p>39. Honduras is the second poorest country in Central America, with an estimated gross 
</p>
<p>domestic product of US$ 18.55 billion in 2013.34 The country faces an extremely unequal 
</p>
<p>distribution of income and a high unemployment rate. Due to the economic crisis and high 
</p>
<p>levels of poverty, many men and some women have been forced to migrate in search of 
</p>
<p>better means to support their families. It is reported that women head approximately 32 per 
</p>
<p>cent of households.35 This phenomenon is attributable to the disintegration of families due 
</p>
<p>to domestic and intrafamiliar violence, and also the high level of homicide in the country. It 
</p>
<p>is estimated that the annual cost of violence amounts to 10 per cent of the gross domestic 
</p>
<p>product (nearly US$ 900 million).36  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur notes the efforts made by the Government to alleviate 
</p>
<p>poverty through its poverty reduction strategy and to promote women&#8217;s economic 
</p>
<p>development and empowerment through the adoption of the National Policy on Women and 
</p>
<p>the Second Plan for Equality and Gender Equity (2010&#8211;2022). Furthermore, the principle of 
</p>
<p>equal remuneration for work of equal value applies to all workers without any 
</p>
<p>discrimination pursuant to article 128 (3) of the Constitution and article 367 of the Labour 
</p>
<p>Code. In practice however, gender-based discrimination in employment occurs. Although 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s literacy rate is almost the same as men&#8217;s, on average women are paid 67.6 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the wage earned by men and women&#8217;s unemployment rate is double that of men.37 
</p>
<p>The areas in which women work, particularly the <i>maquila</i> industry and domestic work in 
</p>
<p>private homes, tend to be less subject to regulation. Women are thus exposed to poor 
</p>
<p>working conditions, low wages, little job security and the potential risk of exploitation and 
</p>
<p>violence.  
</p>
<p>41. Historically dependent on agriculture and the export of bananas and coffee, 
</p>
<p>Honduras has established EPZs as a means to stimulate economic growth by attracting 
</p>
<p>foreign direct investment. It has diversified its export base to include the clothing and 
</p>
<p>automobile industries. The first free zone was established in 1977 in the city of Puerto 
</p>
<p>Cort&#233;s. In 2007, 342 companies operated in 67 EPZs. As at 2010, there were 102 EPZs and 
</p>
<p>19 industrial parks in Honduras.38

<p>42. A study on these zones conducted in 2010 revealed that 110,912 people were 
</p>
<p>employed in various industries, with 78.5 per cent of them employed in garment factories.39 
</p>
<p>Companies in the zones operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week and their production 
</p>
<p>targets range from 1,800 to as high as 4,800 pieces per day, with the more a worker 
</p>
<p>produces in one day, the higher the quota.40 According to one report, women EPZ workers 
</p>
<p>were allowed two timed bathroom breaks per shift and were not paid for their overtime if 
</p>
<p>their production requirements were not met. The report also states that the workers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>minimum wage is less than US$ 0.70 per hour; that in many cases the employers do not 
</p>
<p>contribute to the social security fund; that the workers have no health care rights; and that 
</p>
<p>any attempt to organize or protest is punished with firing and blacklisting.41  
</p>
<p>43. Former <i>maquila</i> workers shared their testimonies with the Special Rapporteur and 
</p>
<p>confirmed that they often worked long hours without rest. They also witnessed co-workers 
</p>
<p>succumb to chronic fatigue, depression and musculoskeletal disorders as a result of the 
</p>
<p>hazardous working conditions. Women working in EPZs are unable to claim their social 
</p>
<p>benefits, including maternity leave, and earn between 28 and 51 per cent less than the 
</p>
<p>minimum wage. Employers justify lower wages for women with the stereotype that 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s work is less demanding than men&#8217;s work.  
</p>
<p>44. Domestic workers are also at an increased risk of exploitation, as they work in 
</p>
<p>private households. There are an estimated 64,000 domestic workers in Honduras; of which 
</p>
<p>20,000 are women. Article 131 of the Constitution states that domestic workers are covered 
</p>
<p>by &#8220;social legislation&#8221;, which provides health coverage for illness and maternity and 
</p>
<p>allowances for family members, including the elderly and orphans. The law also addresses 
</p>
<p>issues of lockouts, accidents, unemployment benefits, occupational diseases and all other 
</p>
<p>contingencies that affect the ability to be productive. Unfortunately, in practice, many 
</p>
<p>domestic workers are denied such protections. 
</p>
<p>45. Interlocutors also raised the issue of access to land for farmers as a concern. Since 
</p>
<p>2009, the Bajo Agu&#225;n region in northern Honduras has been the setting of land disputes. 
</p>
<p>Some concerns raised in interviews include the problematic nature of the land reform 
</p>
<p>programme of 1972; the allocation, over two decades, of an estimated 120,000 hectares of 
</p>
<p>land to farmers who had migrated from the south of the country; and the subsequent 
</p>
<p>modification of the land reform in 1992, which allowed the farmers to sell their land to 
</p>
<p>third parties. It was argued that thousands of acres of land had been transferred from the 
</p>
<p>farmer communities to large agro-industrial firms, with entrepreneurs in palm oil 
</p>
<p>production seizing the opportunity and acquiring a significant percentage of the land.42 
</p>
<p>46. Farmer communities have disputed the legality of such land sales, claiming that they 
</p>
<p>are still the rightful owners of the land. Information was shared indicating that between 
</p>
<p>January 2010 and March 2011, 25 deaths had been registered relating to conflicts over land. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also received allegations that Margarita Murillo, president of the 
</p>
<p>farmers organization Las Ventanas and the founder of the National Farmers Trade Union 
</p>
<p>(Uni&#243;n Nacional de Campesinos), had been assassinated in August 2014 as she was 
</p>
<p>working on a piece of land in the department of Cort&#233;s. It is alleged that her death may be 
</p>
<p>due to her work defending the rights of farmers.

<p>47. Sources indicate that 1,487 land-ownership deeds were issued to farmers between 
</p>
<p>February and August 2010, but less than one third of these (482) were awarded to women. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore women were allocated 28.4 per cent of the ownership rights for agricultural 
</p>
<p>land during this period. Some sources argue that women are largely denied access to and 
</p>
<p>control of productive resources and that, in most cases, they are unable to obtain credit to 
</p>
<p>enable them to be successful farmers. This results in their dependency on their husbands or 
</p>
<p>male relatives being reinforced, and renders them vulnerable to violence.43  
</p>
<p>48. One report states that 300,000 children between the ages of 5 and 14 work in 
</p>
<p>Honduras, with 63 per cent of them in the agricultural sector. The report also reveals the 
</p>
<p>prevalence of child labour within indigenous communities.44  
</p>
<p><b> C. Social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>49. Obstacles to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of women&#8217;s human rights and 
</p>
<p>a life free from all forms of violence include deeply rooted patriarchal attitudes and the 
</p>
<p>pervasiveness of a <i>machista</i> culture that reinforces stereotypes about the roles and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of women and men in the family, in the workplace and in society.  
</p>
<p>50. Education is free in the public system, and the number of girls enrolled in primary 
</p>
<p>school is higher than that of boys. However, the level of education remains inadequate, 
</p>
<p>particularly in rural areas. The Special Rapporteur was informed that due to the prevalent 
</p>
<p>and visible drug trade, which has given rise to concerns about safety and exposure to drug 
</p>
<p>dealers, parents living in certain areas are reluctant to send their children to school.  
</p>
<p>51. The lack of education and employment opportunities are among the major causes of 
</p>
<p>gang involvement by children. The Government established the Guardians of the Homeland 
</p>
<p>initiative in 200745 which extends the mandate of the military to incorporate the training of 
</p>
<p>vulnerable children aged between 5 and 18, and adults up to 23 years of age, in &#8220;values&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>with a view to discouraging children from joining gangs and to reducing delinquency. It 
</p>
<p>was estimated that 75,000 children participated in the initiative in 2013.  
</p>
<p>52. A study conducted between September and December 2010 revealed that there were 
</p>
<p>approximately 4,281 active gang members operating in different cities, including 
</p>
<p>872 female adolescents, with 60 per cent of them in San Pedro Sula and 21 per cent 
</p>
<p>operating in Tegucigalpa.46 In addition, 447 active gang members were in detention in 
</p>
<p>January 2014. Amendments to article 332 of the Criminal Code resulted in the migration of 
</p>
<p>members from urban to rural areas, turning these areas into new hubs for gangs.47  
</p>
<p>53. Reproductive rights remain an area of particular concern. Honduras has the second 
</p>
<p>highest rate of teenage fertility, with a rate of 102 per 100,000 live births. On 2 April 2009, 
</p>
<p>Congress prohibited the promotion, use, sale, purchase and creation of any policy or 
</p>
<p>programme related to the emergency contraception pill. It also banned the distribution and 
</p>
<p>the commercialization of emergency contraception through pharmacies, drug stores and any 
</p>
<p>other means. Additionally, Congress prohibited the use of oral contraceptives as a method

<p>of emergency contraception.48 The Supreme Court subsequently declared the ban on 
</p>
<p>emergency contraception constitutional, upholding the view that emergency contraception 
</p>
<p>was a method of abortion and therefore violated article 126 of the Criminal Code of 
</p>
<p>Honduras, which criminalizes abortion without exception. The Article 132 of the Code 
</p>
<p>provides for a sentence of four to six years&#8217; imprisonment for anyone who causes an 
</p>
<p>abortion through acts of violence, even if unintentionally, while knowing the victim&#8217;s state 
</p>
<p>of pregnancy. The absolute prohibition of abortion implies that women and girls are 
</p>
<p>condemned to continue pregnancies and to face revictimization by society. It has also led 
</p>
<p>women and girls who are impregnated as a result of rape or incest to resort to unsafe and 
</p>
<p>clandestine abortion services and practices, sometimes with fatal consequences.  
</p>
<p><b> V. </b>Challenges in fulfilling the State&#8217;s obligation to act with due 
<b>diligence to eliminate violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>54. Honduras has committed to protecting and promoting the rights of women through 
</p>
<p>its ratification of numerous international instruments, including the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights (1997) and its Optional Protocols; the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1981); the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women (1983); the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>(1990) and the first two Optional Protocols thereto; the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1996) and the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol thereto; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination (2002); the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
</p>
<p>Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (2005); the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities (2008) and the Optional Protocol thereto; and the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (2008).  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur notes that Honduras is not yet a party to the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women or the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>56. At the regional level, Honduras has ratified, among others, the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p>57. The National Institute for Women, established by Decree No. 232-98 of 1999, is the 
</p>
<p>central body responsible for the implementation of the country&#8217;s obligations with regard to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights, and its gender policy. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the 
</p>
<p>Institute falls under the Social Development Department, perpetuating the view that 
</p>
<p>violence against women needs to be addressed through a social welfare lens as opposed to 
</p>
<p>through a human rights-based approach. She also expressed concern at the lack of resources 
</p>
<p>allocated to the different mechanisms, which limits their capacity to effectively respond to 
</p>
<p>violence against women.  
</p>
<p>58. The following section examines the measures taken by the Government to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>international obligations to prevent, investigate, prosecute, and punish violence against 
</p>
<p>women, as well as to protect victims and provide them with effective remedies. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 48 See Decree No. 54-2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prevention  
</b></p>
<p>59. Measures by which States can fulfil their due diligence obligation to prevent 
</p>
<p>violence against women include the enactment of laws, policies and programmes; the 
</p>
<p>development of awareness-raising campaigns; the provision of training for relevant 
</p>
<p>professionals; and the development of action plans to coordinate multisectoral approaches 
</p>
<p>to addressing violence against women. Short illustrated publications, such as the popular 
</p>
<p>version of the gender equality policy prepared by La Ceiba Municipality, can be considered 
</p>
<p>a good practice for raising the awareness of a wider range of actors, including children.  
</p>
<p>60. The Domestic Violence Act is a preventive mechanism to combat domestic 
</p>
<p>violence. Penalties of one to three years, and up to four years in aggravated cases, are set 
</p>
<p>under article 179 (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code.49 In many cases victims are reluctant to 
</p>
<p>press charges against abusers for fear of reprisals. In addition to the Act, a national plan on 
</p>
<p>violence against women was adopted in 2014 for the period covering 2014&#8211;2022. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of consultation with civil society in the elaboration of 
</p>
<p>the plan.  
</p>
<p>61. The law against trafficking in persons was passed in April 2012. It prohibits all 
</p>
<p>forms of trafficking and prescribes penalties ranging from 10 to 15 years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>It also sets out, among other things, the structure and role of the Inter-Agency Commission 
</p>
<p>to Combat Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons (art. 7).  
</p>
<p>62. Rape is considered a &#8220;public crime&#8221; and proceedings can be initiated even if the 
</p>
<p>victim does not press charges.
50
</p>
<p> In the absence of a complaint on the part of the victim of 
</p>
<p>spousal rape, only a judge can take the decision to bring proceedings on an ad hoc basis. 
</p>
<p>The penalties for sexual violence, including rape, vary depending on the type of the 
</p>
<p>violation and aggravating circumstances. Penalties depend on factors such as the age, 
</p>
<p>capacity, and state of the victim; the relationship between the victim and the aggressor; and 
</p>
<p>the intentional transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The maximum 
</p>
<p>sentence ranges from 15 to 20 years.51 Article 149 of the Criminal Code also makes 
</p>
<p>provisions to address the sexual abuse of minors. Preventive measures are included in the 
</p>
<p>protocol provided to police on assistance to women survivors of violence, the National 
</p>
<p>Mental Health Policy and the Third National Strategic Response to HIV and AIDS, among 
</p>
<p>others.52 Sexual harassment is criminalized under article 147 A of the Criminal Code and 
</p>
<p>sentences range from one to three years&#8217; imprisonment. Pregnancy testing, as a condition of 
</p>
<p>employment, is outlawed under the law.  
</p>
<p>63. In terms of education and training, the Government has expressed its intention to 
</p>
<p>revise the school curricula to incorporate sections on human rights education, health, sexual 
</p>
<p>and reproductive rights and gender equity.  
</p>
<p>64. The Gender Unit of the Supreme Court provides training at the national level on 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Department of Justice 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights had conducted a series of training sessions in June 2014, aimed at 
</p>
<p>ensuring the effective implementation of the national human rights policy and its action 
</p>
<p>plan, for 9,000 civil servants across Honduras. The training was also extended to 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers and the military. The National Institute for Women provides the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Security with guidelines and materials on prevention of domestic violence for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 49 In its response, the Government indicated that reforms to the Domestic Violence Act were under way. 
</p>
<p>There are conflicting views about the integration of criminal provisions within the Act.  
</p>
<p> 50 See Decree No. 54-2009.

<p>use in police training centres.53 The National Autonomous University of Honduras offers 
</p>
<p>the opportunity for civil society organizations to enrol in a 200-hour certification 
</p>
<p>programme on gender and public policy. The Government of Honduras organizes 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising activities during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence 
</p>
<p>campaign.  
</p>
<p>65. The minimal attention to, and the lack of effective measures to address, women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>empowerment needs is a factor that contributes to continuing insecurity and fear, and 
</p>
<p>precludes the possibility of eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur expressed her concern at the ineffective measures to address social 
</p>
<p>transformation through activities that are not sustainable and that do not meet the goal of 
</p>
<p>addressing myths and stereotypes about gender roles and responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection  
</b></p>
<p>66. Measures by which States can fulfil their due diligence obligation to protect women 
</p>
<p>from violence include the provision of services such as telephone helplines, health care, 
</p>
<p>counselling centres, legal assistance, access to shelters, protection orders and financial aid 
</p>
<p>for victims.  
</p>
<p>67. The Department of Health manages the Integral Family Support programme, which 
</p>
<p>offers services to women and adolescents in some municipalities where specialized clinics 
</p>
<p>for battered women have been established.54 In Tegucigalpa, the Ministry of Health and 
</p>
<p>Doctors Without Borders set up the <i>servicio prioritario</i> (priority service) in 2011, which 
</p>
<p>provides free-of-charge emergency attention for people suffering the medical and 
</p>
<p>psychological consequences of violence, including sexual violence.55 In 2011, Honduras 
</p>
<p>had 16 family counsellors specialized in the provision of assistance to victims of 
</p>
<p>intrafamily violence in the Department of Health. However, they lack sufficient technical 
</p>
<p>and material resources, and their focus is largely on domestic violence cases that are 
</p>
<p>referred by the courts.56  
</p>
<p>68. In March 2014, the Inter-Agency Commission on the Implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Act, composed of representatives of the National Institute for Women, 
</p>
<p>the Public Ministry, the Department of Health, the Central District Municipality, the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission and civil society organizations, launched the Centre 
</p>
<p>for Support and Protection of Women&#8217;s Rights (CAPRODEM) in the city of Comayaguela. 
</p>
<p>The Centre offers orientation, medical, legal and psychological assistance to victims of 
</p>
<p>domestic and intrafamiliar violence. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a protocol 
</p>
<p>that outlines the procedures and practices to follow in providing comprehensive assistance 
</p>
<p>to victims of domestic and intrafamiliar violence.  
</p>
<p>69. The Centro MAI in La Ceiba is a one-stop centre where victims receive legal, 
</p>
<p>medical and psychological assistance, but it does not cater exclusively to the needs of 
</p>
<p>women. There are guidelines for the implementation of model comprehensive care for 
</p>
<p>medical personnel and agencies involved in the criminal justice system. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur expressed concern at the absence of a gender-responsive reception area at the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 53 Central America Women&#8217;s Network, &#8220;The response of international aid agencies to violence against

<p>Centre and raised the concern of confidentiality and possible breaches of security as regards 
</p>
<p>the management and storing of case files.  
</p>
<p>70. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the lack of sufficient 
</p>
<p>facilities, such as shelters for battered women and safe houses for women who have to enter 
</p>
<p>the witness protection programme. A visit was conducted to the only such shelter in 
</p>
<p>Tegucigalpa, which is for victims of domestic violence and run by a non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Special Prosecutor for Women had on multiple occasions referred high-risk cases involving 
</p>
<p>women linked to, inter alia, murderers, organized crime and gangs, to this shelter. The 
</p>
<p>practice has continued, despite repeated warnings by the director that such practices place 
</p>
<p>the shelter, its staff and its residents in a state of extreme vulnerability, and hinders the 
</p>
<p>ability to effectively provide assistance to victims and guarantee their safety. A similar 
</p>
<p>situation was highlighted in La Ceiba, where a woman under witness protection in relation 
</p>
<p>to the murder of a relative was placed in a shelter for victims of domestic violence. The 
</p>
<p>State has a duty to provide differentiated and appropriate protection or assistance to women 
</p>
<p>victims of violence, based on whether they are witnesses or direct victims of violence. The 
</p>
<p>State cannot justify imposing on third parties its primary responsibility to prevent acts of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and to protect victims who are witnesses in criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>71. Efforts to provide services at the municipal level include having a gender unit or 
</p>
<p>department with professional staff to address the therapeutic and other needs of women. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such services are linked to donor funding and their sustainability is a source 
</p>
<p>of concern.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>72. There are several ways in which States can fulfil their obligation to ensure 
</p>
<p>perpetrators&#8217; accountability for acts of violence against women, including by adopting or 
</p>
<p>amending legislation and strengthening the capacities of the different criminal justice 
</p>
<p>system agencies. In Honduras, the challenges to an effective criminal justice response are 
</p>
<p>the lack of coordination of the different mechanisms and the lack of expertise and resources 
</p>
<p>to conduct credible investigations of crimes relating to gender-based violence, including 
</p>
<p>domestic violence, sexual abuse and femicide.  
</p>
<p>73. Victims of gender-based violence can file complaints with the police, the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission, the Office of the Public Prosecutor or the Municipal Offices 
</p>
<p>for Women, among others. Women who file complaints of gender-based offences are often 
</p>
<p>revictimized through the process. In general, no space is set aside where such complaints 
</p>
<p>can be filed in a manner that guarantees the complainant&#8217;s privacy and security. Often such 
</p>
<p>statements have to be made in open areas in front of the general public, which compounds 
</p>
<p>the complainant&#8217;s sense of vulnerability. Furthermore, the complainant has to provide her 
</p>
<p>testimony multiple times in the presence of various actors who, although members of 
</p>
<p>different institutions, are nonetheless part of the same criminal justice system. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomed the fact that the Centro MAI in La Ceiba offered the possibility of a 
</p>
<p>one-stop approach where victims and witnesses recorded their testimony once, thereby 
</p>
<p>avoiding repetition. 
</p>
<p>74. There are also structural problems associated with the justice system that have a 
</p>
<p>negative impact on the investigation and prosecution of cases, including the lack of police 
</p>
<p>stations, courts and forensic units across the country. The closure or merging of investigation 
</p>
<p>units has also led to concerns about the lack of specificity in prosecuting crimes against 
</p>
<p>women, the lack of appropriate equipment and tools and the lack of human resources, thereby 
</p>
<p>further eroding the need for accountability for such crimes. A further source of concern at 
</p>
<p>both the central and municipal levels is the limited collection of data on the prevalence of, and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>on outcomes of, investigations and prosecutions. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to stress 
</p>
<p>that the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination facing women of indigenous 
</p>
<p>background and Afro-descendant women further affects their access to justice. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings echo those highlighted in the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights report <i>Access to Justice for Women Victims of Sexual 
</i></p>
<p><i>Violence in Mesoamerica</i>. In the report, the Commission indicates that the failure to 
</p>
<p>investigate gender-related crimes can be partially attributed to discriminatory sociocultural 
</p>
<p>patterns that discredit women victims and reinforce the perception that such crimes are not 
</p>
<p>priorities. The Special Rapporteur was informed that in some cases, the police laugh or 
</p>
<p>refuse to register complaints from women. Increasing the number of female police officers 
</p>
<p>would encourage a more responsive reporting environment and may help address the issue 
</p>
<p>of frequent withdrawal of complaints, which negatively impacts prosecution rates. 
</p>
<p>76. While noting the positive measures taken to criminalize femicide, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned that very few cases have been tried under the newly created 
</p>
<p>offence. In fact, she was informed that prosecutors have a tendency to take to trial only 
</p>
<p>those cases in which the evidence is considered sufficient to win a conviction. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was also informed of difficulties in obtaining evidence, including DNA, due to 
</p>
<p>the shortage of forensic facilities. She was also informed that the presence of a prosecutor 
</p>
<p>was required in order to authorize forensic physicians to begin gathering evidence in rape 
</p>
<p>cases. However interviewees were not in agreement about such a requirement, and were 
</p>
<p>unable to confirm the legal basis for such a requirement. 
</p>
<p>77. Without making any assumptions about or expressing an opinion on the facts of 
</p>
<p>cases shared during the visit to the national penitentiary, or on the veracity of the 
</p>
<p>testimonies received, the Special Rapporteur notes that the information shared by 
</p>
<p>interviewees seems to indicate serious limitations during the investigative stages of the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system. Furthermore, the lack of adequate legal assistance for women, as 
</p>
<p>well as the allegations that female offenders seem to face harsher sentences and that women 
</p>
<p>are treated differently from their male counterparts by the criminal justice system, seem to 
</p>
<p>indicate gender stereotyping and gender bias practices by the criminal justice system.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Provision of effective remedies, including reparations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The provision of effective remedies involves ensuring the rights of women to access 
</p>
<p>both criminal and civil remedies and the establishment of effective protection, support and 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation services (A/HRC/14/22, p. 1). The failure to provide victims with legal 
</p>
<p>assistance, information and support obstructs the right to effective remedies.  
</p>
<p>79. Under the Domestic Violence Act, the offender is obliged to provide full 
</p>
<p>compensation to the survivor, including payment for damages and the expenses incurred by 
</p>
<p>victims in dealing with the effects of the acts of violence. No information was shared on the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of this provision. 
</p>
<p>80. Following the second regional meeting of the Central American Court of Justice, 
</p>
<p>held in Tegucigalpa, a set of rules for the assistance to victims of gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>with an emphasis on sexual violence was adopted in October 2011. The rules provide for 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a State compensation fund for the harm caused by gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence. Compensation is not limited to financial compensation, but also includes 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic programmes to help victims to rebuild their lives. The rules further provide 
</p>
<p>that remedial measures should include medical and psychological rehabilitation. No 
</p>
<p>information was shared on the effectiveness of this provision. 
</p>
<p>81. According to interviewees, there is no national assistance office for crime victims 
</p>
<p>and the Government does not provide monetary compensation to such victims. This seems </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>to corroborate the view that there is a major gap between laws and their implementation and 
</p>
<p>enforcement, which leaves victims with a sense of insecurity, defenselessness and loss of 
</p>
<p>confidence in the justice system.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Government has undertaken a number of legislative and institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives to meet its human rights obligations to address the situation of women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls in the country. However, these have not been translated into practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>improvements in the lives of the majority of women who remain marginalized, 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminated against and at a high risk of being subjected to numerous human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations, including violence and sexual and reproductive rights violations. Impunity, 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic disparities and corruption continue to foster a generalized state of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence. The absence of a comprehensive data collection system to guide policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>development and to monitor progress in the field of violence against women is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>further challenge. Moreover, the failure of the State to exercise its due diligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish perpetrators of gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributes to an environment of impunity that results in a decline of trust in national 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and the rule of law among the Honduran population  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Law and policy reforms 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:

<p><b>the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol to the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Revise article </b>332 of the Criminal Code on &#8220;unlawful associations&#8221; and 
</p>
<p><b>ensure that the enforcement of this provision does not result in due process rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations and the criminalization of juveniles, including girls;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Establish a specialized investigation and prosecution unit on femicide to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat impunity in cases of gender-based murder and conduct effective criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure adequate funding to improve existing infrastructure to support 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of gender-based violence and to create new centres that provide psychosocial, 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal and residential services throughout the country, paying special attention to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>increased vulnerability of indigenous women and Afro-descendant women living in 
</b></p>
<p><b>rural areas;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Build the capacity of institutions, such as the National Institute for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women, the National Police, the Office of the Public Prosecutor the Supreme Court of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice and the Institute of Forensic Medicine, including by increasing their human 
</b></p>
<p><b>and material resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Strengthen the independence of the National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the

</b></p>
<p><b>nomination and selection process is fair and transparent;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(g) Establish an independent national w</b>omen&#8217;s <b>commission in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the Paris Principles and which is mandated to receive and investigate complaints

</b></p>
<p><b>negatively affect the health, well-being and security of workers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Ensure that all police stations, tribunals and courts are equipped with

<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take effective measures to ensure access to justice and effective remedies 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all women victims of violence, and in particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Develop mechanisms to ensure a holistic, coordinated and sustained 
</b></p>
<p><b>response to violence against women in order to apprehend, prosecute and 
</b></p>
<p><b>convict offenders, contribute to the health and safety of the victim and prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>revictimization; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Ensure the fast and efficient management of cases;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Ensure that all incidents of violence against women are thoroughly 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated by the police and are prosecuted effectively, and that perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p><b>are sanctioned in proportion to the severity of their crime; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Strengthen fair trial safeguards by ensuring access to legal counsel 
</b></p>
<p><b>during all phases of pretrial detention and the investigative stages of cases;

</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) </b>Establish specific safeguards to ensure that women&#8217;s histories of

<p><b> C. Societal transformation, including awareness-raising, addressing 
</b></p>
<p>gender stereotypes and women&#8217;s empowerment<b>  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The</b> <b>Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Design and launch targeted awareness-raising campaigns to educate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>change the mindsets and attitudes of men, women and children through all available 
</b></p>
<p><b>means, including schools and the media; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) </b>Train and sensitize the media in issues related to women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p><b>generally and violence against women in particular, in order to contribute to changing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the predominant social and cultural beliefs and attitudes that are harmful to women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and address the current sensational reporting practices. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Statistics and data collection 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Improve data collection and analysis of incidents of violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination against women in all sectors, particularly those relating to labour, 
</b></p>
<p><b>health, education and the criminal justice system, while ensuring safety and privacy

<p><b>rights throughout the process;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure common, reliable and transparent recording methods on all 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of violence against women, its causes and consequences. Such data should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated by sex, race, age, ethnicity, geographic location and other relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>characteristics, in order to understand the magnitude, trends and patterns of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women in the country, both general and gender-specific; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In cooperation with civil society organizations, develop monitoring and 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluation tools to evaluate progress made in eradicating violence against women in a

<p><b> E. Recommendation to United Nations agencies and entities 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that, in light of the systemic, widespread 
</b></p>
<p><b>and pervasive problem of violence against women and girls in Honduras, there is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>need to review the presence, programmes and resources of United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p><b>that exist in the country in the quest to respond to and prevent violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and girls. Technical cooperation and assistance is needed to ensure that this 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violation is addressed more substantively by United Nations agencies.
