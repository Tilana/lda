<b>Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General

<p><b>  Assistance to Sierra Leone in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 Sierra Leone has continued to progress in building its capacity for the promotion 
and protection of human rights. The passage of the Chieftaincy Act, the ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and various sensitization 
programmes organized on the Child Rights Act, the Domestic Violence Act, the 
Registration of Customary Marriage and the Divorce Act were notable in this regard. The 
Capacity of civil society organizations, government officials and the Human Rights 
Commission was also developed through training and other activities. 
</p>
<p> Progress has been made in strengthening the rule of law. An active role was played 
by the Anti-Corruption Commission in taking action against corrupt practices. Activities 
carried out to strengthen the justice sector institutions, including the judiciary, prison and 
the police, were significant. 
</p>
<p> Progress in improving prison conditions has also been made. The supply of 
necessary logistics, the provision of water and regular supplies of food marked a definite 
improvement in prison conditions. However, challenges remain, as detention by police for 
periods beyond the lawful detention period, the poor condition of police detention cells, 
inadequate supplies of medicine in prisons and overcrowding in some of the prisons 
continue to pose a threat to the protection of the rights of accused persons. 
</p>
<p> The Government adopted the second poverty reduction strategy in the name of the 
Agenda for Change. The strategy aims at improving the socio-economic conditions of 
people. The Government also adopted a strategy to address the challenges in the health 
sector. However, effective implementation of these strategies depends on the mobilization 
of resources by the Government, as well as on the support of international partners. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p> The law reform process, including constitutional review, is making little progress. 
As no reference was made to the recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission in the review process, crucial recommendations are yet to be implemented. 
The issues of the separation of Attorney General from the Ministry of Justice, the removal 
of the death penalty from the Constitution, the amendment of discriminatory provisions of 
the Constitution and the review of the seditious libel provision of the Public Order Act have 
yet to be addressed. 
</p>
<p> In the area of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, customs and traditions continue to bar 
full implementation of certain laws, such as the Child Rights Act and the Domestic 
Violence Act. Capacity constraints on investigating authorities, the low rate of prosecution, 
out of court settlements and interference by traditional leaders in judicial matters continue 
to undermine the judicial process, thus creating room for impunity, particularly regarding 
sexual and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p> In the light of the above challenges, the report concludes with a set of 
recommendations for the Government of Sierra Leone and its international partners.

<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2009, the Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) was engaged in implementing 
the human rights aspects of Security Council resolution 1829 (2008) and the subsequent 
extension under resolution 1886 (2009), namely, monitoring and promoting human rights, 
democratic institutions and the rule of law, and reviewing the Constitution of 1991 and 
relevant legislation. The Human Rights Section provided advisory and technical support to 
the independent national institution for human rights, and also implemented capacity-
development projects with combined funding support from UNIPSIL and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The Human Rights 
Section carried out its activities through field offices in Freetown, Bo, Kenema, Makeni and 
Kono, in close collaboration with the United Nations country team, relevant government 
agencies, including the Human Rights Commission, and civil society.  
</p>
<p>2. There were a number of positive developments in 2009, notably in relation to 
legislative, economic and social rights. Parliament enacted a new Chieftaincy Act, which 
mandated the National Electoral Commission to conduct the election of paramount chiefs to 
ensure that elections are conducted in a fair and free manner. This amended the previous 
practice whereby elections were conducted by the local administration. Elections were held 
for 40 vacant positions of paramount chiefs in December under the new act. While serious 
challenges to securing the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights confront 
Sierra Leone, 2009 saw the unveiling of a second poverty reduction strategy, dubbed the 
Agenda for Change, and a five-year health strategy. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Situation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Extrajudicial killings 
</b>3. There were some instances of violations of the right to life by State authorities. For 
example, in September 2009, in Lungi, 3 people were shot dead and at least 13 others were 
injured as a result of the use of excessive force by the police, who opened fire on 
demonstrators attacking a police post. Monitors from the Human Rights Section observed 
that the police failed to take the necessary precautionary actions and give adequate warning 
before firing live bullets. The lack of adequate non-lethal equipment at the police station, 
namely tear gas, was also a reason for the police to resort to live bullets. Although the 
Government has carried out an investigation into the incident, no action has been initiated 
to date against the responsible police officers. In February, when secondary school pupils 
rioted at the national stadium during an inter-school sporting activity, police fired tear gas 
canisters into the area, injuring many children, some as young as 6 years old.  
4. Ritual murders continued in various parts of the country, and no successful 
prosecution or effective investigation into these cases was undertaken. In January, a ritual 
murder was reported in Moyamba district, where the body of a female child was found with 
some body parts removed. In June, a minor girl was murdered for ritual purposes in 
Bombali; her remains were found with body parts missing. In September, a 6-year-old boy 
residing in Kissi Tang, Kailahun, was murdered and certain body parts were removed. 
</p>
<p>5. The de facto moratorium on the death penalty, which has been in place for the past 
10 years, was respected. A total of 15 prisoners, including 3 females, have been sentenced 
to death, although the sentences have not been executed. The Truth and Reconciliation </p>


<p>GE.10-10771 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Commission recommended the removal of the death penalty from the statutes, and the 
Human Rights Commission and civil society organizations continued to advocate for the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 
this regard.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to personal security 
</b></p>
<p>6. Violence and intolerance between the supporters of the two main political parties, 
the Sierra Leone People&#8217;s Party (SLPP) and the incumbent All People Congress (APC), 
contributed to violations of civil and political rights. In March, there was a wave of violent 
political clashes between supporters of APC and SLPP in Pujehun, Kemena and Freetown. 
A by-election in Pujenun district had to be postponed as a result, the car of the resident 
Minister for the Eastern Region was set on fire, and economic and social activity was 
brought to a halt for two days in Freetown. There were also allegations of rape of female 
SLPP supporters. In June, the Government established a high-level commission, under the 
chairmanship of Justice Bankole Thompson, to investigate these allegations. The 
commission concluded that the victims had been subjected to acts of physical mistreatment 
amounting to outrages of personal dignity. There was not sufficient evidence, however, to 
determine whether rape had been perpetrated. Concerns were raised by civil society 
organizations that the commission could have undertaken a more thorough investigation of 
the rape allegations, and that it had also failed to recommend appropriate action against the 
identified perpetrators. The Government has appointed a panel to review the commission&#8217;s 
report and to make recommendations for necessary actions. 
</p>
<p>7. In January, the chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights 
alleged that she had been assaulted by members of the army deployed at the residence of 
the Presidential Press Secretary. She also complained that the access road to the community 
where she was residing had been blocked. The matter was resolved through intervention at 
the government level, and the access road was later opened.  
</p>
<p>8. A spate of armed robberies, with, in some instances, alleged links between members 
of the security forces and robbers, posed serious challenges to the right to personal security 
and property. In November, a senior officer, together with two other police officers and a 
soldier, were arrested for their involvement in certain armed robberies in Freetown. 
Similarly, in October, three military and four police officers were arraigned before the 
Kenema Magistrate Court, charged for having taken part in an armed robbery against 
civilians in Kenema district. Also in October, four soldiers were arrested for their 
involvement in an armed robbery in Freetown. 
</p>
<p>9. In February, the town chief of Foindu Mameima Village in Lower Bambara 
Chiefdom, Kenema district, reported that he had to flee town for fear of being manhandled 
and molested by members of the Poro society, a secret society for men, because he was 
opposed to forceful initiation into its ranks. There were also instances of interference by 
traditional leaders in police investigations into such matters. In January, in Kono district, 
three arrested suspects involved in forceful initiations were released by the police on the 
instructions of a local traditional leader. The suspects had allegedly dragged a resident of 
Taidu Village into a Poro bush, a place typically designated for initiation, and beaten him.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the period under review, reports of religious intolerance were also received. 
In April, a church in Kambia district was destroyed, allegedly by a group of Muslims who 
claimed that their mosque had been demolished in order to build the church. In December, a 
church in Allen Town, Freetown, was attacked and vandalized, allegedly by members of a 
nearby mosque claiming that the church used loud megaphones that regularly disrupted 
their services at the mosque. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>11. Although the right to freedom of expression was generally respected, there were 
instances of violations of this right. In May, the editor of a newspaper, <i>For Di People</i>, was 
assaulted, allegedly by a press photographer associated with the Office of the Presidency, 
for publishing news and articles criticizing the Government. A reporter associated with 
United Nations Radio in Kenema was allegedly assaulted and humiliated by women of the 
Bondo society, a secret society for women, for airing discussions on the negative effects of 
female genital mutilation. A youth leader of the ruling political party, the All People&#8217;s 
Congress, in Kambia district wrote a threatening letter to a local radio journalist who had 
reported on the local radio station on the misuse of hospital vehicles by the chairman of the 
district council.  
</p>
<p>12. Journalists continued to advocate for the abolition of the seditious libel provisions 
under the Public Order Act of 1965. The writ petition filed by the Sierra Leone Association 
of Journalists challenging the constitutionality of the act was quashed by the Supreme Court 
on 10 November 2009. On 8 December, however, the President of Sierra Leone, during a 
press conference, promised that the Government would review the act. 
</p>
<p>13. In December, the Parliament of Sierra Leone approved the Sierra Leone 
Broadcasting Corporation Bill establishing a national independent public broadcaster to 
ensure impartial access to all opinions. The initiative is considered to be the first of its kind 
in the West Africa region. UNIPSIL has plans to handover United Nations Radio to the 
Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation in 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>14. Reports of threats against human rights defenders were made during the period 
under review. In February, death threats were made by an anonymous person, via e-mail, 
against a prominent human rights activist and director of the Society for Democratic 
Initiatives, a local non-governmental organization. He was reportedly intimidated and 
physically attacked after his organization released a media report on the status of the media 
a year since the APC Government came to power. In September, the chairperson of the 
Human Rights Committee of the Bombali district was harassed by the provincial secretary 
of the northern region for having raised a case of torture of a woman by a chiefdom 
policeman in Bombali. The same person was also detained for two days in November by 
the magistrate in Makeni, allegedly for criticizing the ruling of the court on a rape case. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Land disputes 
</b></p>
<p>15. The absence of a clear land policy in Sierra Leone has caused several disputes and 
violent attacks resulting from disputes over the ownership of lands; at least six such 
incidents were reported to the Human Rights Section.1 Lack of appropriate demarcation, 
proper registration and record-keeping were some of the causes of such disputes. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 In January, three houses were set alight in a clash between the residents of Tissor village and Hanga 
</p>
<p>village over a plot of land. In January, Mandingoes of Rogbalan village and Lokos of Tambayama 
and Mayemeh villages in Bombali district clashed over a plot of land; six people were subsequently 
charged in court. In June, fighting erupted in Mokong Betty village, Mobamba district, between the 
residents over a plot of land used for a palm oil plantation. In April, violence erupted between the 
residents of Gohun and Kuiva villages in Mandu Chiefdom in Kailahun district over a land issue. In 
June, locals of Panderu and villages were involved in a violent clash over farming land. </p>


<p>GE.10-10771 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Children&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. Some progress was noted in the area of children&#8217;s rights. In February 2009, 
following sensitization activities in communities in Bombali district, <i>Soweis</i> (female genital 
mutilation initiators) and paramount chiefs in five chiefdoms agreed not to initiate girls 
under the age of 18 years of age into the Bondo society (see also paragraph 11 above). 
Nonetheless, serious challenges still remain for the protection of the rights of children.  
</p>
<p>17. The rape of minor girls and teenage pregnancies continue to cause serious concern. 
In many cases, close relatives, schoolteachers and, in some cases, even security personnel 
were allegedly involved in such activities. At least 10 cases of rape2 and several cases of 
teenage pregnancy3 were reported to the Human Rights Section during the period under 
review. It was observed that the capacity constraints of the police to investigate the matter 
properly, a failure to produce witnesses in court and out of court settlements compromised 
the justice system. In June, at the monthly District Development Coordination Forum 
Meeting in Kono, an officer from Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs reported 
that 20 such cases had been reported, and maintained that more cases were concealed by 
parents and guardians.  
</p>
<p>18. Incidents of forced marriage and child trafficking were also reported to the Human 
Rights Section. Child trafficking and sexual exploitation were also serious concerns.  
</p>
<p>19. The lack of remand homes and approved schools in most of the districts resulted in 
the detention of juveniles with adults. For example, in October and November, the Human 
Rights Section found juveniles detained in Kenema police station with adult suspects. The 
juveniles were later released by the police following the intervention of human rights 
officers.  
</p>
<p>20. Some key provisions of the Child Rights Act of 2007 have not yet been 
implemented. The child commission provided for under the act to promote, protect, monitor 
and advise the Government on policies regarding children in the country has not yet been 
established.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>21. Some progress was noted in the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights. A 
national gender strategic plan was developed and a validation workshop was held thereon 
on 22 June. Similarly, efforts were also made to further the implementation of Security 
Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women, peace and security. A task 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 In January, a 6-year-old primary school pupil was raped by her teacher in a primary school in 
</p>
<p>Sandeyallu town, Kailahun; and a 12-year-old girl was raped in Hangha road, Kenema. In February, a 
13-year-old girl was raped in Shengema village in Bo district, and later died while in hospital; and a 
13-year-old girl was gang raped in Makeni; a suspect was charged in court. Also in February, a 12-
year-old girl was raped by a medical superintendant in Kailahun, and a 13-year-old girl was raped in 
Bumpuh Chiefdom, Bo. The victim fell into a coma and died three days later in Bo hospital. In 
September, a police officer reportedly raped a 14-year-girl in Kenema. In October, an 11-year-old girl 
was raped in Ngohanwun, Bombali district, a 12-year-old girl was raped in New England, Freetown, 
and a 9-year-old girl was raped in Kenema. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 In January, it was reported that a 16-year-old student had been impregnated by her teacher. The girl, 
</p>
<p>whose baby was one month old, told human rights officers that the teacher&#8217;s relatives had accepted 
the pregnancy but, since then, the man was not caring for the girl and her newborn. Also in January, a 
30-year-old man was arrested for impregnating his 14-year-old stepdaughter. The girl was taken to 
the Rainbow Centre for medical examination while the stepfather was on remand.  </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p>force consisting of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs and civil 
society organization completed a draft national plan of action, due to be launched in March 
</p><p>2010. The Ministry established a secretariat for the preparation of the sixth report, to be 
submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. A gender donor coordination group has been set up to coordinate the activities to 
promote gender equality and women&#8217;s rights. The Government has expressed its 
commitment to address the high rate of maternal mortality; in November, the President 
declared that medical services for pregnant women and children under the age of 5 would 
be free by April 2010. 
</p>
<p>22. Despite the above-mentioned positive developments, women continue to suffer from 
exclusion and discrimination in various fields. During the 2009 chieftaincy elections, two 
women were denied the right to run for the position of paramount chief because of 
traditional and cultural beliefs. In June, it was reported that a woman in Kenema who went 
through all the necessary stages of recruitment for a position at the municipality office was 
denied a job because of her affiliation with a political party. The Human Rights Section 
brought this matter to the attention of the mayor, who later agreed to employ her. It was 
also reported that the criteria applied for distributing a scholarship in Birewa chiefdom in 
Makeni were discriminatory to girls. The scholarship was granted to boys on the basis of 
their academic performance, while girls were considered eligible only if they passed a 
virginity test. In July, at a meeting, the National Gender-Based Violence Committee 
expressed serious concern about this scheme, as the process of being tested for virginity 
itself dehumanized the girls. 
</p>
<p>23. Female genital mutilation and forceful initiation into secret societies continues to be 
a concern. In January, in Bo district, a 25-year-old woman was tortured and forcefully 
initiated by a gang of women for allegedly insulting a Bondo society member. Initially, the 
family support unit in Bo was reluctant to commence investigation into the matter, but 
following the subsequent intervention of a higher level police authority, four people were 
arrested. A United Nations Radio reporter working in Kenema reported in February that she 
had been humiliated by Bondo society members for having campaigned against female 
genital mutilation; she was stripped almost half naked and crowds of women chanted 
abusive and humiliating slogans at her. She was then paraded to the residence of the 
paramount chief in Kenema town.  
</p>
<p>24. Only one case of domestic violence has been prosecuted under the Domestic 
Violence Act 2007. Lack of access of women to the police, the exorbitant fees charged by 
medical officers and out of court settlements were some of the causes of the low 
prosecution rate.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Socio-economic and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Government adopted a second poverty reduction strategy for the period 2009&#8211;
2012, which was contained in the Agenda for Change document, and outlined the following 
strategic priority areas: enhancing national electricity; developing the national 
transportation network; enhancing productivity in agriculture and fisheries; and sustaining 
human development, notably in health, education and water. Peace, security, human rights 
and good governance were identified as preconditions to achieve the strategic objective. In 
November, the Government presented the Agenda for Change during a consultative group 
meeting held in London, which was attended by development partners and investors. At the 
meeting, the Government and development partners agreed to work on a plan of action to 
implement the new aid policy and pledged to organize jointly an aid effectiveness forum 
early in 2010 to take this important agenda forward.  </p>


<p>GE.10-10771 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>26. The United Nations Family integrated its support in the country in line with the 
Agenda for Change, developing the Joint Vision of the United Nations Family for Sierra 
Leone. This document consolidates 21 programmes of the United Nations Family in Sierra 
Leone, including one on access to justice and human rights. It defines human rights as a 
cross-cutting issue in all programmes, and is committed to adopting a right-based approach 
to all 21 of them.  
</p>
<p>27. The first phase of the Bumbuna hydroelectricity project was completed. Freetown 
and some other towns began to receive a regular electricity supply in October 2009. A 
regular power supply is expected to be instrumental to the creation of income-generating 
activities that will eventually improve living standards.  
</p>
<p>28. Access to basic health services continued to be a serious challenge. Most 
government hospitals suffer from shortages of staff, medical equipment and necessary 
medicines. For example, in February, the Magburaka Government Hospital informed the 
Human Rights Section that the maternity ward, which had more than 20 patients, had only 
one midwife, and there was no blood bank in the hospital. Concerns were also raised that 
the pharmacies in the country were selling counterfeit, expired and controlled drugs without 
prescription. Responding to this problem, in November, the Ministry of Health cancelled 
the licences of more than 21 pharmaceutical outlets. 
</p>
<p>29. In November, the Government adopted a five-year health sector strategy to address 
health issues in the country systematically. The President also announced that free health-
care services would be provided to pregnant women and children under 5 years of age as of 
April 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Rule of law and administration of justice, including 
transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rule of law and administration of justice 
</b>30. The Anti-Corruption Commission played an effective role in prosecuting several 
high-profile cases under the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008 (the act conferred on the 
Commission prosecutorial power for such cases). A former ombudsman was convicted on 
163 charges of corruption; the Minister for Health was also indicted. Following successful 
prosecution, the Minister was removed from office. A magistrate was indicted and an 
investigation into the affairs of a high court judge was opened.  
31. The bar association registered its dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Anti-
Corruption Commission was handling the corruption cases involving judges and 
magistrates. This view was expressed by the bar when a high court judge was arrested in 
June in his chamber in dubious circumstances. The bar association was concerned that the 
modus operandi of the Anti-Corruption Commission could undermine the credibility of the 
justice system.  
32. The judiciary carried out strategic reforms, ranging from human resource 
development to infrastructural improvements, with the support of the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund and the Justice Sector Development Programme of the Department for 
International Development. Eight new magistrate courts were established in various 
communities to ensure access to justice, and also to decongest some of the magistrate courts 
in central Freetown. A child-friendly court was established in Freetown, and is now in 
session on a daily basis. Preparations are under way to establish and operationalize a 
commercial court in 2010, to ensure that commercial disputes are handled by specialized 
courts. The judiciary also made progress in human resource development. In 2009, five new </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p>magistrates were recruited and three vacant positions of judges were filled in the High 
Court, the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court, respectively. Judges and magistrates 
received specialized training on case management, juvenile justice, judicial administration, 
organized crimes and corruption. An Internet connection and computer facilities were 
provided to all magistrates and judges. The law court library was also completed; electronic 
filing of all judgements of the Supreme Court is now in progress.  
</p><p>33. Various policy documents were adopted to ensure efficiency in the judiciary. In 
October, the Supreme Court launched a set of bail policy guidelines for magistrates and 
judges to ensure uniformity in the bail system. Also in October, an operational manual 
outlining the duty and functions of bailiffs was issued, and a manual on juvenile justice was 
adopted.  
</p>
<p>34. The Justice Sector Technical Working Group comprising representatives of the 
Ministry of Justice, the judiciary, prisons and the police met regularly to address issues 
pertaining to the justice sector, under the chairmanship of a Supreme Court judge. The 
Working Group also facilitated the implementation of the Justice Sector Strategy and 
Investment Plan for the period 2008&#8211;2011.  
</p>
<p>35. Despite the above-mentioned developments, challenges remained in the 
administration of justice. Of 13 districts, 5 (Kabala Kambia, Pujehun, Bonthe and 
Kailahun) lacked a resident magistrate. As roaming magistrates were also responsible for 
circuit courts, the number and frequency of court sittings were significantly affected in 
these districts. Delays in justice, prolonged pretrial detention and cases of detention by 
police for periods longer than stipulated by law were common. Consequently, 
overcrowding in prisons and backlogs continued to pose a serious challenge, in terms of 
both physical conditions and the enjoyment of legal guarantees. For example, when human 
rights officers visited Kalaihun prison in October, they observed that four suspects who had 
been charged for various crimes would not be able to appear in court for three months 
owing to the absence of a magistrate. 
</p>
<p>36. Prosecutorial capacity was slightly improved following the appointment of five new 
prosecutors in 2009. Currently, there are 12 prosecutors, compared to just 7 in 2009. The 
Human Rights Section distributed copies of the prosecutorial manual, prepared in 
collaboration with the Director of Public Prosecution, to police prosecutors, who are 
responsible for prosecuting cases in magistrate courts. State counsels, present in three 
provincial headquarters only, are overloaded. Inadequate prosecutorial capacity has also 
contributed to the delay in adjudicating matters in courts. 
</p><p>37. Local courts throughout the country did not operate for almost a year prior to 
February 2009, owing to delays in the appointment of local court chairmen. When the 
newly appointed chairpersons took up their functions, the issue was one of capacity 
constraints. The lack of training of the newly appointed chairpersons posed a serious 
challenge; reports were received of excessive fines being imposed, and also of cases being 
handled that were beyond their jurisdiction. 
38. There were reports of the encroachment of traditional leaders into judicial matters. 
The Human Rights Section received reports in June that, in Foredugu chiefdom, Port Loko, 
a human rights activist associated with Amnesty International had been sued for damages, 
to the sum of 200,000 leones (approximately $50), by a local court for challenging the 
decision of a local chief to impose a fine on a woman. The chief pressured the local court 
chairman for strong action against the defendant, who was eventually fined. 
</p>
<p>39. There was considerable improvement in facilities in prisons all over the country as a 
result of the investments made through the Peacebuilding Fund. Mattresses and iron beds 
were provided in all prisons, and the perennial problem of water supply was also addressed 
in most of them. The Mafanta prison was refurbished to decongest the crowded Pademba </p>


<p>GE.10-10771 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Road prison. The detention facility of the Special Court for Sierra Leone was handed over 
to the Prison Department, to which the Department plans to transfer female prisoners. 
Training was provided for prison officers on a human rights approach to prison 
management. Nonetheless, challenges remained, such as a lack of vehicles to convey 
convicted prisoners to court, inadequate supplies of medicine and toiletries, and cases of 
prolonged detention. Similarly, some prisons remained extremely overcrowded, a factor 
that affected the quality of the services provided to prisoners. 
</p>
<p>40. The Human Rights Section continued to participate in the regular justice sector 
coordination meetings of international partners. Eight such meetings were held to 
harmonize interventions in the justice sector to assist the implementation of the three-year 
justice sector reform strategy. The Justice Sector Development Programme of the 
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), the International Rescue Committee and the World Bank continued to be the 
main actors involved in strengthening the justice sector.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Transitional justice 
 1. Special Court for Sierra Leone 
</b></p>
<p>41. In October, the Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone upheld the 
convictions handed down in April by the Trial Chamber against three Revolutionary United 
Front indictees &#8212; Issa Sessay, Augustine Gbao and Mossis Kallon &#8212; who were sentenced 
to a term of 52, 40 and 25 years of imprisonment, respectively. The Court&#8217;s decision was 
important, as it was the first time that an international criminal tribunal had considered 
forced marriage and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers as crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>42. All eight prisoners convicted by the Special Court were transferred in October 2009 
to Rwanda to serve their sentences, the Court deciding that there was no detention facility 
in Sierra Leone that could meet international minimum standards. The Human Rights 
Commission, however, expressed its serious concern at the transfer of prisoners to a foreign 
country, which would detach them from family ties.  
</p>
<p>43. While the Special Court is about to complete its mandate (only the case against 
Charles Talyor remains to be completed), it was involved in transferring its knowledge and 
legacy to national institutions, namely, the judiciary, prosecution, the police, prison and 
other national institutions and also civil society. In November, the Special Court detention 
facility was handed over to the Prison Department; there are plans to house female 
prisoners in the facility.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Implementation of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  
</b></p>
<p>44. Through the catalytic funding of $3 million provided by the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund, the National Action for Social Change, the implementing agency, 
made significant progress in implementing the reparations programme. The programme was 
launched in January 2009; 29,733 beneficiaries had been registered by the end of June. A 
total of 40 symbolic reparations were conducted in various parts of the country, involving 
symbolic reburial, memorials and remembrances. Micro-grants of $80 were provided to 
21,000 beneficiaries, and fistula surgery was carried out on 235 victims of sexual violence. 
Surgery was also conducted on 36 victims to remove bullets. In addition, educational 
support was provided to 6,984 child victims. A five-year strategic plan for 2010&#8211;2014 was 
developed to continue physical health care, educational support, skill training, micro-grants, 
housing, symbolic reparations, construction of a national peace monument, psychosocial 
support and pension payments to those who have lost 50 per cent of their earning capacity. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p>Following the recommendation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a war victims 
trust fund was launched in December to establish a sustainable funding mechanism for the 
implementation of the reparations programme. Currently, however, there are not sufficient 
funds to implement the programme effectively. Under the leadership of the Executive 
Representative of the Secretary-General, the United Nations Family has identified the 
reparations programme as a priority area for support. A multi-donor trust fund has been 
established to attract funds for the implementation of the programmes outlined in the Joint 
Vision document (see paragraph 26 above), including the reparations programme. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights activities of the Human Rights Section 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Human Rights Section, in close collaboration with civil society organizations 
and the Human Rights Commission, carried out regular monitoring of human rights 
throughout the country. Continuous monitoring allows any necessary adjustment to 
technical cooperation and capacity-building projects to be made to ensure effectiveness in 
the light of changing circumstances. Priority areas were health, education, child labour, 
sexual and gender-based violence, prison and detention facilities, local courts and the rights 
of women and children, among others. The Human Rights Section also engaged relevant 
authorities at different levels to address the issues identified through monitoring activities.  
</p>
<p>46. The human rights aspect of the chieftaincy election conducted in November and 
December in 40 chiefdoms was also monitored. The electoral commission was involved in 
the conduct of elections under the new Chieftaincy Act 2009; the electoral process was 
found to be relatively fair. However, some cases of discrimination resulting from customs 
and traditions of particular communities were reported. For example, in Gbampi 
Kamaranka chiefdom, in Bombali, a woman was harassed and barred from competing for 
the position of paramount chief. Similarly, a woman aspiring to the position of paramount 
chief in Kono district saw her candidacy denied and the High Court upheld the decision of 
the Provincial Secretary. In Kailahun district, Kissi-Teng chiefdom, a woman was denied 
the right to run for the position of paramount chief by the Provincial Secretary, despite the 
fact that she had been officially declared a candidate. 
</p>
<p>47. The Human Rights Section carried out extensive monitoring of local courts 
throughout the country from August to October 2009, during which time more than 100 
local courts were visited and information collected. While preparation of the final report is 
under way, preliminary findings revealed that there were serious human rights issues 
associated with the functioning of local courts. Since local courts apply customary laws, 
there was inconsistency in procedures and decisions. Cases of exorbitant fines, arbitrary 
detention, the exercise of power beyond one&#8217;s jurisdiction and undue influence of 
traditional authorities on matters under consideration by local courts were rampant. Poor 
infrastructure negatively affected the effective functioning of courts, and the lack of regular 
supervision fostered corrupt practices. The low level of education on human rights issues 
and the lack of capacity of local court officials remained a concern.  
</p>
<p>48. Magistrate courts that included justices of the peace were also regularly visited. 
Justices of the peace complained that they had not been paid their sitting fees for a long 
time. For example, in November, during a visit to Tonkolili, one justice of the peace 
complained that he had not received sitting fees for the previous year. Magistrates in 
Freetown were found to be overloaded with cases, and the rights of suspects were violated 
owing to a lack of resident magistrates in many districts. </p>


<p>GE.10-10771 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>49. During the period under review, prisons and detention facilities of the police were 
also regularly monitored. Prisons in Bo, Kenema, Makeni and Freetown remained 
overcrowded. The Human Rights Section also observed that the number of prisoners 
fluctuated, owing also to the large number of prisoners convicted for loitering, a minor 
offence. For example, in a visit on 21 October to Bo prison, it was observed that 50 
prisoners were serving sentences for loitering of a total of 159 inmates. Similarly, Makeni 
prison was also overcrowded owing to a large number of prisoners convicted for loitering.  
</p>
<p>50. Police detention cells in most districts were in a derelict condition. There were cases 
of detention beyond the period stipulated by the Constitution. The challenges facing the 
criminal justice system included a lack of necessary logistic facilities and equipment to 
investigate crimes effectively, a shortage of pathologists to conduct examinations and the 
failure of police to produce witnesses before the court.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>51. During the period under review, the Human Rights Section implemented a broad 
range of activities, including training, advisory services, joint programming and material 
support for the promotion and protection of human rights. Training was conducted for 
human rights activists, religious leaders, parliamentarians, government officials and 
commissioners and staff of the Human Rights Commission, on thematic human rights 
issues, as well as on human rights monitoring and reporting. A total of 530 national actors 
benefited from the training. Human Rights Committees, an umbrella group of local civil 
society in Kambia, Port Loko, Bombali, Tonkolili, Pujehun and Bonthe, was provided with 
material support such as computers, furniture and other material. A human rights resource 
centre was established in Freetown, equipped with necessary facilities, such as computers 
with Internet connections, furniture and a human rights resource library. Work is in 
progress to establish a library in the Pademba road prison, in collaboration with the Justice 
Sector Development Programme and other actors. The Human Rights Section also 
implemented joint activities with civil society and the Human Rights Commission in the 
sensitization on human rights and the need for implementation of the recommendations of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, human rights monitoring and the 
commemoration of United Nations days, including International Human Rights Day. The 
Human Rights Section supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the area of treaty 
reporting. Logistic support and staff were provided to the treaty reporting secretariat of the 
Ministry that had been established pursuant to the national strategy on treaty reporting, 
elaborated with advice from the Human Rights Section. Technical support was provided to 
prepare a common-core document, to be submitted to treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Partnership with national actors and United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Human Rights Commission published its second annual human rights status 
report in June 2009. The Human Rights Section provided technical support to the 
Commission in the preparation of the report, and financial support was provided to print 
copies of the report for wider distribution. The Commission held discussions on the report 
and its recommendations with political parties, parliamentarians, civil society and other 
partners to inform the broader population on the situation of human rights in the country.  
</p>
<p>53. The Human Rights Section also provided technical support to the Commission in the 
finalization of its three-year strategic plan for 2009-2011. In August, the Executive 
Representative of the Secretary-General convened a meeting of international partners to </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p>garner support for the implementation of the Commission&#8217;s strategic plan. The Human 
Rights Section implemented joint activities with the Commission in the area of human 
rights monitoring, capacity-building and advocacy. 
</p>
<p>54. While the Government covered basic operational costs, including salaries for 30 
staff members and rent for the office, the Commission had to face a serious funding 
shortfall when the project under the Peacebuilding Fund ended in March 2009. Although 
the Commission managed to establish regional offices in Bo, Kenema and Makeni, each 
office is manned by only one staff member owing to a lack of adequate funding. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National Commission for Social Action 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Human Rights Section continued its engagement with the National Commission 
for Social Action, designated to implement the reparations programme in accordance with 
the recommendation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Human Rights 
Section continued representing the United Nations country team in the National Committee 
on Reparation, which provides advisory services to the National Commission with regard to 
the implementation of the Peacebuilding Fund project in support of the reparations 
programme.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Human Rights Section continued its partnership with civil society 
organizations, particularly in the areas of advocacy and capacity-building on human rights. 
Joint programmes were conducted with human rights committees in all 13 districts, and 
assistance was provided to district human rights committees to ensure their effective 
operation. The Human Rights Section supported committees in Kambia, Bombali, Port 
Loko, Pujehun, Tonkolili and Bonthe, by supplying them with computers, furniture and 
office space.  
</p>
<p>57. A national forum was organized in April 2009 for 40 civil society members 
representing all 13 districts, whereby the district human rights committee established a 
network of committees and expressed its commitment to work together on human rights 
issues at the national level. The committees also adopted a national plan of action for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. The Human Rights Section continued its regular 
interaction with civil society organizations on pertinent human rights issues. A total of 80 
such interaction meetings were held in various districts. Training was provided to 180 
members of civil society in Kambia, Kabala, Kailahun, Pujehun and Freetown on human 
rights monitoring and thematic human rights issues. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Parliamentary committee on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Human Rights Section continued its interaction with the parliamentary human 
rights committee on pertinent human rights issues, and provided a comprehensive human 
rights training session in September 2009 to 30 parliamentarians, in collaboration with 
UNDP. In December, a consultative forum of civil society and parliamentarians was also 
facilitated to enhance collaboration between Parliament and civil society on human rights 
issues. The committee also adopted a plan of action for the next two years, outlining plans 
to play an active role in addressing pertinent human rights issues, including law reform and 
the ratification of and reporting on human rights treaties, gender issues and budgeting.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Enhancing the cooperation of Sierra Leone with human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Human Rights Section continued its engagement with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs with regard to the ratification of human rights treaties and the preparation of reports 
for treaty bodies. The support included office equipment and staff provided to the treaty </p>


<p>GE.10-10771 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>reporting secretariat of the Ministry. Technical support was provided to the Ministry to 
prepare a common-core document, to be submitted to treaty bodies; and a draft of the 
document was completed and circulated to various stakeholders for comment. Plans are 
under way to prepare the pending reports under various human rights treaties. Steps are also 
being taken to prepare the sixth report to be submitted to the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women, and a secretariat for relevant matters has been 
established in the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs. Progress was 
also made in the ratification of key international human rights treaties: the Parliament 
ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Provincial and district security committees 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Human Rights Section regularly participated in district and provincial security 
committee meetings, which remained significant forums for bringing human rights issues to 
the attention of relevant government authorities. Issues such as sexual violence, ritual 
murder, prison conditions, the shortage of magistrates, delays in trials, threats against 
human rights defenders and forceful initiation into secret societies were discussed at the 
meetings, and strategies to address them were elaborated. The Human Rights Section also 
provided advisory and technical support with regard to the actions taken by the committees 
in addressing human rights issues. For example, the provincial security committee for the 
southern region discussed, with traditional leaders, the increasing incidence of ritual murder 
in Moamba district; the committee also formed a task force to look into teenage pregnancy 
and prison conditions in Bo. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Collaboration with the United Nations country team and other international partners 
</b></p>
<p>61. Human rights activities were carried out in close collaboration with the United 
Nations country team. The Human Rights Section participated in regular country team 
meetings and worked closely with its members in mainstreaming human rights in all 
activities of the United Nations Family. Contributions were also made to the Joint Vision 
initiative with the aim of mainstreaming human rights, and the country team was updated 
regularly on human rights issues. The Human Rights Section also collaborated with 
international non-governmental organizations and partners, including Save the Children, the 
International Rescue Committee, ActionAid, the Justice Sector Development Programme 
(see paragraph 32 above), Irish Aid, the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) 
and the European Union on human rights and rule of law issues.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>62. <b>Significant progress has been noted in the protection and promotion of human 
rights, particularly in the area of national capacity-building. The Human Rights 
Commission has demonstrated the important role that it has to play, and made several 
important interventions, including issuing press statements to highlight ongoing 
violations and publishing the annual report on the state of human rights, which 
contained recommendations addressed to the Government of Sierra Leone on how to 
improve the promotion and protection of human rights. Civil society organizations are 
also active in raising pertinent human rights issues. The progress made in 
implementing the reparations programme for war victims is also significant. The 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
progress made in the area of treaty reporting are also positive developments. 
Nonetheless challenges remain.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The nature of human rights violations in Sierra Leone is more structural than 
systematic. Prevailing socio-economic conditions, including poverty, unemployment </b></p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10771 
</p>
<p><b>and dependency on donor support, have severely affected the enjoyment of socio-
economic and cultural rights. Limited access to health, education and employment 
continues to be a serious challenge. There are also serious human rights issues 
associated with customary and traditional practices; impunity for the perpetrators of 
forceful initiation, including female genital mutilation, domestic and sexual violence, 
continues to be a serious concern. There are also human rights issues resulting from 
the weakness of the justice system. Prolonged pretrial detention, delayed justice and a 
chronic backlog of cases continues to frustrate the system. The slow pace of law 
reform and the lack of effective implementation of new laws, including the Child 
Rights Act and Domestic Violence Act, are also a concern. Lack of necessary resources 
for the Human Rights Commission and the delay in constitutional review process 
should also be noted.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>In the light of the above conclusions, the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights strongly urges the Government of Sierra Leone: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To speed up the implementation of the recommendations of the Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission, including through the allocation of adequate human 
and financial resources, and to mobilize resources to implement the reparations 
programme; and to fast-track the law reform process, particularly in relation to the 
pending sexual offences bill and the matrimonial bill, ensuring the integration of 
critical human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, into national law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To investigate and prosecute security officials involved in violating 
human rights, notably in the Lungi incident, in which three people were killed 
following the use of firearms by police; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To improve the conditions of service of judges and magistrates, to 
further strengthen the independence of the judiciary and prosecutors, and to fill 
vacant positions of magistrates and prosecutors;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To provide adequate budget resources to the Human Rights Commission 
to allow it to carry out its core statutory functions, and to implement the 
recommendations made by the Commission in its state of human rights reports for 
2007 and 2008; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To submit, in a timely manner, pending reports to the treaty bodies, 
pursuant to the international human rights conventions that it has ratified; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) To adopt a clear land policy, including with regard to the demarcation 
and proper registration of land; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) To repeal the criminal libel provision of the Public Order Act of 1965; 
 (h) To adopt a national strategy for the elimination of violence against 
women. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The High Commissioner also urges international partners to continue 
supporting the Government in addressing the human rights challenges and, in 
particular, to assist in the funding of the reparations programme. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
