 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 11 August 2006, at its second special session, convened to address the ongoing 
conflict in Lebanon, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-2/1, entitled &#8220;The grave 
situation of human rights in Lebanon caused by Israeli military operations&#8221;, in which it decided 
to &#8220;establish urgently and immediately dispatch a high-level commission of inquiry&#8221;.  The 
Commission, according to paragraph 7 of resolution S-2/1, was mandated: &#8220;(a) to investigate the 
systematic targeting and killings of civilians by Israel in Lebanon; (b) to examine the types of 
weapons used by Israel and their conformity with international law; and (c) to assess the extent 
and deadly impact of Israeli attacks on human life, property, critical infrastructure and the 
environment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2. On 1 September 2006, the President of the Human Rights Council, Luis Alfonso de Alba, 
announced the nomination of Jo&#227;o Clemente Baena Soares, Mohamed Chande Othman and 
Stelios Perrakis as members of the Commission of Inquiry.  The Commission assembled in 
Geneva, together with its Secretariat, and began its work on 11 September.  It agreed to report to 
the Council within two months. 
</p>
<p>3. In Geneva, the Commission held meetings with the President of the Human Rights 
Council, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Missions of 
Lebanon and Israel, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGO).  The 
Commission visited Lebanon from 23 September to 7 October, and from 17 to 21 October.  It 
met with the President and Prime Minister of Lebanon, members of the Government and other 
senior officials, members of parliament, local authorities, representatives of the private sector 
and hospitals, victims and witnesses, as well as representatives of NGOs, United Nations 
agencies, United Nations representatives, United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) 
and United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).  The Commission visited the 
suburbs of South Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, Byblos, and made an extended tour of southern 
Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>4. The report describes the terms of reference, methodology, approaches and activities of 
the Commission.  It provides an overview of the 33-day long conflict with an historical 
background and addresses the qualification of and the law applicable to the conflict.  The report 
then concentrates on the various substantive issues the Commission considered it should address 
in detail in accordance with its mandate.  The report further provides an analysis on the various 
aspects of the impact of the conflict on life in Lebanon.  Finally, the report presents the 
conclusions of the Commission and its recommendations. 
</p>
<p>5. It is not for the Commission to comment on the political-legal context of the adoption of 
resolution S-2/1, nor to make judgment on the content of its mandate.  It is clear that the mandate 
of the Commission has limits <i>ratione personae</i> (actions by the Israeli military) and <i>ratione loci</i> 
(on Lebanese territory) and does not allow for a full examination of all of the aspects of the 
conflict, nor does it permit consideration of the conduct of all parties.  The Commission is bound 
by the mandate given to it by the Human Rights Council (hereafter &#8220;the Council&#8221;) which it 
interprets broadly, in the light of the principles and rules of international law, international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law, and having in mind the need for the 
respect for human life and dignity in the face of the complex challenges posed in the context of 
armed conflict. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. A fundamental point in relation to the conflict and the Commission&#8217;s mandate as defined 
by the Council is the conduct of Hezbollah.  The Commission considers that any independent, 
impartial and objective investigation into a particular conduct during the course of hostilities 
must of necessity be with reference to all the belligerents involved.  Thus an inquiry into the 
conformity with international humanitarian law of the specific acts of the Israel Defense Forces 
(IDF) in Lebanon requires that account also be taken of the conduct of the opponent. 
</p>
<p>7. That said, taking into consideration the express limitations of its mandate, the 
Commission is not entitled, even if it had wished, to construe it as equally authorizing the 
investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel.  To do so would exceed the Commission&#8217;s 
interpretative function and would be to usurp the Council&#8217;s powers. 
</p>
<p>8. The hostilities that took place from 12 July to 14 August constitute an international 
armed conflict to which conventional and customary international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law are applicable. 
</p>
<p>9. In analysing the characteristics of the conflict, the Commission highlights its sui generis 
nature in that active hostilities took place only between Israel and Hezbollah fighters.  While the 
Government of Lebanon claimed that it was not responsible for and had no prior knowledge of 
the operation carried out by Hezbollah inside Israeli territory on 12 July 2006, the Government 
of Israel has officially stated that responsibility lies with the Government of Lebanon.  It is the 
view of the Commission that hostilities were in fact and in the main only between IDF and 
Hezbollah.  The fact that the Lebanese Armed Forces did not take an active part in them neither 
denies the character of the conflict as a legally cognizable international armed conflict, nor does 
it negate that Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah were parties to it. 
</p>
<p>10. The Commission stresses that, generally, respect for the principle of humanity and 
humanitarian considerations (Martens clause) was absent during the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Findings 
</b></p>
<p>11. The 33-day conflict in Lebanon had a devastating impact, notably in southern Lebanon.  
It exacted a heavy human toll.  According to Lebanese authorities, the conflict resulted 
in 1,191 deaths and 4,409 injured.  More than 900,000 people fled their homes. 
</p><p>12. The hostilities that took place from 12 July to 14 August 2006 constitute an international 
armed conflict to which conventional and customary international humanitarian law and human 
rights law are applicable. 
</p>
<p>13. The Commission highlights a significant pattern of excessive, indiscriminate and 
disproportionate use of force by IDF against Lebanese civilians and civilian objects, failing to 
distinguish civilians from combatants and civilian objects from military targets.  The 
Commission was able to verify for itself the circumstances of a number of incidents which 
occurred during the conflict. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to precautions taken by Israel to minimize civilian casualties, the 
Commission came to the conclusion that IDF did not give effective warning as required under 
international humanitarian law.  Where warnings were given, they often did not allow sufficient </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>time for the population to leave, and in any event, civilians were at risk of being attacked if they 
did leave and did not have access to safe humanitarian exit corridors.  The Commission 
addresses cases of attacks on convoys of civilians, such as those from Marwaheen and 
Marjayoun, where IDF clearly must have known that these were not a legitimate military target.  
Often these warnings contributed to creating a climate of fear and panic among the civilian 
population. 
</p>
<p>15. In the same vein, the Commission documented various cases of direct attacks on medical 
and relief personnel.  The Commission received various testimonies regarding the obstacles and 
difficulties the medical and humanitarian relief personnel had to face in reaching civilians in 
need of medical care and humanitarian assistance due to IDF-imposed constraints.  The 
concurrence system adopted to satisfy IDF requirements was not adapted for an efficient 
humanitarian assistance.  On a number of occasions the IDF conducted hostilities either directly 
against relief assistance movements or indirectly. 
</p>
<p>16. One of the most striking aspects of the conflict was the massive displacement of civilians.  
According to Government estimates, nearly one quarter of the population was displaced 
between 12 July and 14 August, with approximately 735,000 seeking shelter within Lebanon 
and 230,000 abroad.  Much of the displacement in Lebanon was the result, either direct or 
indirect, of indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian property and infrastructure, as well as 
the climate of fear and panic among the civilian population caused by the warnings, threats and 
attacks by IDF.  The Commission highlights a number of concerns related to the protection of 
displaced persons, as well as those who were unable to flee, notably the constant and pernicious 
threat posed by cluster munitions. 
</p>
<p>17. The Commission met a number of individuals who told of being detained, mistreated 
and/or abducted and transferred to Israel before being released. 
</p>
<p>18. The Commission notes with concern the impact of the conflict on vulnerable groups.  It 
was estimated that one third of the casualties and deaths were children.  Many of the survivors 
will have to live with the trauma produced by the conflict.  Women and the elderly were also 
particularly affected, as well as migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>19. The Commission considered it important to analyze the attacks on UNIFIL and Observer 
Group Lebanon (OGL) positions which were either directly hit by IDF fire or were the object of 
firing close to their positions, including the deaths of four unarmed United Nations observers at 
the Khiyam base.  The Commission has found no justification for the 30 direct attacks by the 
IDF on United Nations positions, including those which resulted in deaths and injury to protected 
United Nations personnel. 
</p>
<p>20. During the conflict, major damage was inflicted on civilian infrastructure, including 
critical infrastructure.  According to the Government of Lebanon, 32 &#8220;vital points&#8221; were targeted 
by IDF, 109 bridges and 137 roads damaged.  The destruction of the land transportation network 
had a huge impact on humanitarian assistance and on the free movement of displaced civilians.  
Housing, water facilities, schools, medical facilities, numerous mosques and churches, TV 
and radio transmission stations, historical, archaeological and cultural sites also suffered 
massive damage.  The economic infrastructure was targeted by aerial bombardment and 
127 factories were hit by IDF strikes.  In addition, agriculture and tourism were particularly hit.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The Commission considers that it will take years for Lebanon, with the help of the international 
community, to be able to rebuild all the damaged buildings and other facilities.  In the meantime, 
solutions must be found for the civilian population to see their human rights, in particular their 
right to adequate housing and to the highest attainable standard of health, respected. 
</p>
<p>21. Israel justified its attacks on the civilian infrastructure by arguing its hypothetical use by 
Hezbollah.  The Commission appreciates that some infrastructure may have had &#8220;dual use&#8221; but 
this argument cannot be put forward for each individual object directly hit during this conflict.  
By using this argument, IDF effectively changed the status of all civilian objects by alleging that 
they might be used by Hezbollah.  Further, the Commission is convinced that damage inflicted 
on some infrastructure was done for the sake of destruction. 
</p>
<p>22. From the first days of the armed conflict until early September 2006, Israel imposed a sea 
and air blockade on Lebanon which had an impact on the humanitarian situation, the civilian 
population, the environment, and on the economy as a whole. 
</p>
<p>23. The Commission considered the devastating effect the oil spill from the bombing of the 
Jiyyeh power plant has had and will continue to have in the years to come.  The Commission is 
convinced that this attack was premeditated.  The spill affected two thirds of Lebanon&#8217;s 
coastline.  IDF&#8217;s failure to take the necessary precautionary measures violated Israel&#8217;s 
obligations to protect the natural environment and the right to health.  In particular it caused 
significant damage to the Byblos archaeological site, included in the UNESCO World Heritage 
list. 
</p>
<p>24. None of the weapons known to have been used by IDF are illegal per se under 
international humanitarian law.  However, the way in which the weapons were used in some 
cases transgresses the law.  The Commission addressed more specifically the use of cluster 
munitions, 90 per cent of which were fired by IDF during the last 72 hours of the conflict.  The 
Commission finds that their use was excessive and not justified by any reason of military 
necessity.  The Commission finds that these weapons were used<b> </b>deliberately to turn large areas 
of fertile agricultural land into &#8220;no go&#8221; areas for the civilian population.  Furthermore, in view of 
the foreseeable high dud rate, their use amounted to a de facto scattering of anti-personnel mines 
across wide tracts of Lebanese land.  The presence of unexploded ordnance continues to act as a 
major impediment to the return of IDPs and refugees, as well as threatening the lives and 
livelihoods of those who have chosen to return.  While the use of depleted uranium munitions 
could not be confirmed, the Commission received a number of reports regarding the use of 
phosphorous weapons. 
</p>
<p>25. The Commission considers that the excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of 
force by the IDF goes beyond reasonable arguments of military necessity and of proportionality, 
and clearly failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets, thus constituting a flagrant 
violation of international humanitarian law.  The Commission has formed a clear view that, 
cumulatively, the deliberate and lethal attacks by the IDF on civilians and civilian objects 
amounted to collective punishment. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. There is some evidence that Hezbollah used towns and villages as &#8220;shields&#8221; for their 
firings.  At the same time, evidence points to such use when most of the civilian population had 
departed the area.  The Commission found no evidence regarding the use of &#8220;human shields&#8221; by 
Hezbollah.  However, there was evidence of Hezbollah using UNIFIL and Observer Group 
Lebanon posts as deliberate shields for the firing of their rockets. 
</p>
<p>27. The Commission was able to verify that the IDF carried out attacks on a number of 
medical facilities in Lebanon, despite their protected character.  The Commission also noted that 
the Red Cross Movement was not spared during the conflict, as indicated in several incidents 
reported by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lebanese Red Cross 
(LRC).  In some cases, medical personnel were the victim of collateral damage.  
</p>
<p>28. The widespread and systematic nature of messages relayed and communicated to the 
Lebanese, the timing and manner in which they were relayed, and the inflammatory language 
used, bear out that they were intended to incite or otherwise provoke inter-confessional violence 
and civil disorder in Lebanon.  Given the particular political context in Lebanon, these acts 
amount to undue interference in Lebanese internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>29. The Commission considers that the conflict gives rise to two pertinent issues.  Namely, 
(<i>a</i>) the international responsibility of Israel under international law, international humanitarian 
law and human rights and (<i>b</i>) the accountability of individuals, for serious international 
humanitarian law and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>30. The Commission examined during its inquiry different individual incidents and situations 
of a general character, taking into account the post-conflict situation in Lebanon.  Thus the 
Commission classifies its legal evaluation on two levels:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) In some cases where the attacks against civilians or their property were direct and 
deliberate, where abductions, transfers and detentions in Israel of civilians occurred, it can be 
consider that there is a violation of the right to life, the right to property, the interdiction of 
inhuman, humiliating and degrading treatment.  Moreover, these deliberate strikes against 
civilians amount in fact to summary and extra-judicial executions of persons (suspected or 
assimilated to terrorists-enemies).  It not only violated the fundamental rights of these persons 
(right to life, right to personal security, fair trial, non- discrimination) but also constitutes a very 
negative State practice, extremely disturbing for contemporary legal culture.  The particular 
attention of the international community is drawn to this; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) In a general framework, the issues of violation of the right to life, right to 
education, right to property, right to a healthy environment, right to voluntarily return home in 
safety (without limitations), right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and 
her family, including adequate food, clothing and housing and the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work are open. 
<b>Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Commission submits the following recommendations to the Human Rights Council: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Humanitarian assistance and reconstruction 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Considering the consequences of the conflict in Lebanon and its effects on the 
Lebanese population, notably in the South, the Council should promote initiatives and call for 
the mobilization of the international community to assist Lebanon and its people.  The Council 
should consider the possibility of encouraging organs, agencies and institutions within the 
United Nations system to work together in a comprehensive and coordinated programme of 
cooperation with the Government of Lebanon  aimed at the improvement of living conditions, 
particularly in Southern Lebanon, so that the civilian population can fully enjoy their human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Council should encourage the United Nations system (UNESCO, UNEP, 
UNHCR, UNICEF, WHO), and the Bretton Woods institutions in their multi-sectoral 
programmes and projects to promote and undertake precise and concrete actions, including with 
professional and technical expertise in the necessary reconstruction efforts (buildings, bridges, 
cleaning of areas affected by clusters, environment, archaeological sites (Byblos)); 
</p>
<p> (c) The Council should call upon the Secretary-General to undertake an evaluation of 
humanitarian assistance provided to civilians by the United Nations System and other 
humanitarian and relief organizations in Lebanon.  The Cargo Movement Notification Procedure 
and the notification or &#8220;concurrence procedure&#8221; set up during the conflict with a view to 
enhancing the right to immediate and unlimited access to humanitarian assistance for civilians in 
armed conflict could be part of this assessment; 
</p>
<p> (d) The Council should call for the mobilization of professional and technical 
expertise necessary to cope with the ecological disaster on the maritime environment on the 
Lebanese coast and beyond.  In this context, it should be useful to engage the Barcelona 
Convention system covering the Mediterranean and the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency 
Response Centre for the Mediterranean based in Malta; 
</p>
<p> (e) The Council should establish a follow-up procedure on the measures to be taken, 
notably for the rebuilding of Lebanon and above all reparations for victims among the Lebanese 
civilian population;  
</p>
<p><b>Vulnerable groups (children) 
</b> (f) The Council should give careful attention to the fate of child victims of the armed 
conflict.  National institutions and specialized international agencies should work together to 
effectively assist the Government of Lebanon in the implementation of health programmes, 
rehabilitation projects and mental health care initiatives for children; 
<b>Respect for IIHL 
</b></p>
<p> (g) The Council should promote and monitor the obligation to &#8220;respect and ensure 
respect&#8221; of international humanitarian law by all parties in a conflict, including non-State actors; 
</p>
<p> (h) In order to establish responsibility for human rights violations, some aspects of 
the conduct of IDF need more legal inquiry, with full cooperation from both victims and the 
perpetrator; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (i) The Council should establish a follow-up procedure to monitor the human rights 
situation in Lebanon, taking into account the conclusions and recommendations of this report; 
</p>
<p><b>Weapons 
</b></p>
<p> (j) The Council should take the initiative to promote urgent action to include cluster 
munitions to the list of weapons banned under international law.  The Council should request the 
relevant international bodies, including the Meetings of States Parties to the Convention on 
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be 
Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and to the Convention on 
the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on 
Their Destruction, to address the legality of some weapons particularly indiscriminate to the 
civilian population, including weapons which use depleted uranium;  
</p>
<p> (k) The scientific research currently under way in Lebanon and abroad on the effects 
of certain weapons used during the conflict needs to be continued.  The results will be decisive in 
the examination of the lawfulness of certain &#8220;new weapons&#8221; in the light of international 
humanitarian law.  The Council should encourage these efforts and follow-up developments; 
</p>
<p> (l) The Council should strongly call upon Israel to immediately hand over to UNIFIL 
and the Government of Lebanon full and detailed information on the use, and of all coordinates 
of cluster munitions launched in Lebanon to enable timely clearance of unexploded ordnance 
(UXO), avert continued death toll and injury, enable the return of displaced persons to their 
communities and resumption of normal social and economic life; 
</p>
<p><b>Redress violations of international humanitarian law and human rights 
</b></p>
<p> (m) It is important to address and promote legal means for individuals to redress 
violations of human rights and humanitarian law during conflicts.  This is an urgent issue for 
particular regions and countries not covered by existing human rights mechanisms.  Once more, 
the issue of individual complaints concerning violations of international humanitarian law arises;  
</p>
<p> (n) The Commission draws the attention of the Council to the serious lacunae in 
international law, international humanitarian and human rights law as regards the possibility of 
victims to seek and obtain reparations and compensation.  In this regard, the Commission 
proposes that the Council could explore possibilities aimed at the creation of a commission 
competent to examine individual claims; 
</p>
<p> (o) A commission of arbitration could be envisaged between the interested parties to 
examine issues of reparations; 
</p>
<p> (p) The Commission calls upon the Council to follow closely, and upon the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights to accord whatever assistance it can, to the work of 
the Lebanese Parliamentary Human Rights Committee for it to complete its comprehensive 
investigation into reported killings and other alleged serious international humanitarian law and 
human rights violations. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The Commission of Inquiry 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Establishment and role 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 11 August 2006, the Human Rights Council convened a second special session, in 
order to address the ongoing conflict in Lebanon.  At this session the Council adopted resolution 
S-2/1,<b>1</b> entitled &#8220;The grave situation of human rights in Lebanon caused by Israeli military 
operations&#8221;, in which it decided to &#8220;establish urgently and immediately dispatch a high-level 
commission of inquiry&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. The mandate of the Commission, according to paragraph 7 of resolution S-2/1, is: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(a) To investigate the systematic targeting and killings of civilians by Israel in 
Lebanon; 
</p>
<p> (b) To examine the types of weapons used by Israel and their conformity with 
international law; and 
</p>
<p> (c) To assess the extent and deadly impact of Israeli attacks on human life, 
property, critical infrastructure and the environment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>3. The resolution also urged all concerned parties to respect the rules of international 
humanitarian law, to refrain from violence against the civilian population, and to treat detained 
combatants and civilians in accordance with the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. 
</p>
<p>4. On 1 September 2006, the President of the Human Rights Council, Luis Alfonso de Alba, 
announced the nomination of Jo&#227;o Clemente Baena Soares (Brazil), Mohamed Chande Othman 
(United Republic of Tanzania) and Stelios Perrakis (Greece) as members of the Commission of 
Inquiry.  The members were appointed on the basis of their expertise in international 
humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>5. In resolution S-2/1 the Council also requested the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all 
administrative, technical and logistical assistance required to enable the Commission of 
Inquiry (hereafter &#8220;the Commission&#8221;) to fulfil its mandate promptly and efficiently.  By 
11 September 2006, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
completed the establishment of a secretariat for the Commission headed by a Secretary and 
including three human rights officers and a military analyst, as well as security, logistical and 
administrative staff, with offices in Geneva and Beirut. 
</p>
<p>6. The Commission assembled in Geneva, together with its secretariat, and began its work 
on 11 September.  It adopted terms of reference on 19 September 2006 and agreed to report to 
the Council within two months of the commencement of its work. 
</p>
<p>7. The Commission&#8217;s terms of reference<b>2</b> specified, inter alia, that the Commission should 
enjoy the full cooperation of all States Members of the United Nations, and that it may also seek </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the cooperation of international institutions and other relevant actors, as appropriate.  Further, in 
order to enable the Commission to discharge its mandate, the following facilities should in 
particular be provided: 
</p>
<p> (a) Freedom of movement throughout the territory of Lebanon, including facilities of 
transport; 
</p>
<p> (b) Unhindered access to all places and establishments, and freedom to meet and 
interview representatives of governmental and local authorities, military authorities, community 
leaders, non-governmental organizations and other institutions, and any such person whose 
testimony is considered necessary for the fulfilment of its mandate; 
</p>
<p> (c) Unhindered access for individuals and organizations wishing to meet with the 
Commission; 
</p>
<p> (d) Free access to all sources of information, including documentary material and 
physical evidence; 
</p>
<p> (e) Security arrangements for the personnel and documents of the Commission to be 
provided in accordance with the United Nations Host Country Agreements; 
</p>
<p> (f) Protection of victims and witnesses and all those who are in contact with the 
Commission in connection with the inquiry; no such person shall, as a result of such contact, 
suffer harassment, threats, acts of intimidation, ill-treatment or reprisals. 
</p>
<p>8. The Commission agreed to carry out its mandate in confidentiality and, in particular, to 
limit its contacts with the media to factual information about its visits to Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>9. On 22 September 2006, the Commission provided a progress report on its activities to the 
President of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Mandate and scope 
</b></p>
<p>10. It is not for the Commission to comment on the political-legal context of the adoption of 
resolution S-2/1, nor to make judgment on the content of its mandate.  It is clear that the mandate 
of the Commission has limits <i>ratione personae</i> (actions by the Israeli military) and <i>ratione loci</i> 
(on Lebanese territory) and does not allow for a full examination of <i>all</i> of the aspects of the 
conflict, nor does it permit consideration of the conduct of <i>all</i> parties.  The Commission is bound 
by the mandate given to it by the Human Rights Council which it interprets broadly, in the light 
of the principles and rules of international law, international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law, and having in mind the need for the respect for human life and dignity in the 
face of the complex challenges posed in the context of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>11. Paragraph 7 of resolution S-2/1 assigns to the Commission three key responsibilities.  
The first task requires the Commission to &#8220;investigate the systematic targeting and killings of 
civilians by Israel in Lebanon&#8221;.  While this first task refers explicitly to the actions &#8220;by Israel in 
Lebanon&#8221;, the responsibility of the Commission to investigate nonetheless requires a 
consideration of all factors relevant to the actions of Israel in relation to the conflict in Lebanon. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. The second task requires the Commission to &#8220;examine the types of weapons used by 
Israel and their conformity with international law&#8221;.  This requires the Commission to evaluate 
the types of weapons, as well as the manner in which they were used and their impact, through 
the perspective of international law. 
</p>
<p>13. The third task is to &#8220;assess the extent and deadly impact of Israeli attacks on human life, 
property, critical infrastructure and the environment.&#8221; This task requires the Commission to 
consider the immediate as well as mid- and longer-term social, cultural, physical, economic and 
environmental impact of the conflict in Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>14. A fundamental point in relation to the conflict and the Commission&#8217;s mandate as defined 
by the Council is the conduct of Hezbollah.  The Commission considers that any independent, 
impartial and objective investigation into a particular conduct during the course of hostilities 
must of necessity be with reference to all the belligerents involved.  Thus an inquiry into the 
conformity with international humanitarian law of the specific acts of IDF in Lebanon requires 
that account also be taken of the conduct of the opponent. 
</p>
<p>15. That said, taking into consideration the express limitations of its mandate, the 
Commission is not entitled, even if it had wished, to construe it as equally authorizing the 
investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel.  To do so would exceed the Commission&#8217;s 
interpretative function and would be to usurp the Council&#8217;s powers. 
</p>
<p>16. In carrying out all three of its tasks the Commission gave due consideration to relevant 
activities within the United Nations system, including the work of human rights special 
procedures, as well as ongoing initiatives of the specialized agencies. 
</p>
<p>17. Paragraph 7 of resolution S-2/1 is silent with regard to the period of time to be addressed 
by the Commission.  Taking into account the three tasks assigned to it the Commission 
considered all information relevant to the conflict in Lebanon, focusing in particular on the 
impact of events in the period from 12 July to 14 August 2006, as well as the subsequent period 
of occupation. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Commission is an independent, impartial fact-finding body.  It based its work on 
investigation, first-hand testimonies, evidence and other information it received during the 
course of its inquiry, including through meetings in Geneva and visits to Lebanon.  During its 
first weeks of work, the Commission met with the President of the Human Rights Council and 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The Commission sent letters requesting information 
relevant to its mandate to intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations.  
The Commission also met with officials of relevant United Nations agencies, including 
UNESCO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Mine Action Service (UNMAS), as well as 
the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Lebanon (via teleconference), three of the 
Special Rapporteurs who had been on recent mission to Lebanon and Israel, ICRC and NGOs. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. The Commission sought the cooperation of the Governments of Lebanon and Israel.  
Lebanon fully cooperated.  Israel refused to cooperate. 
</p>
<p>20 Considering the call from the Council for the Commission to accomplish its mandate 
promptly and with necessary dispatch, the time constraint, the intensity and geographical reach 
of hostilities, the displacement of the affected civilian population, and the preliminary nature of 
technical, financial, scientific and related studies currently being conducted by the Government 
of Lebanon and other national institutions, the Commission&#8217;s report cannot constitute a full and 
final accounting of all alleged violations.  Accordingly, the Commission primarily oriented its 
inquiry on what within the terms of its mandate representatively stand out and emerge as serious 
international humanitarian law and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>21. The Commission visited Lebanon from 23 September through 7 October, and 17 
through 21 October.  It met with President Lahoud and Prime Minister Siniora, and held separate 
meetings with the Minister of Environment; the Minister of Electricity and Water Resources; the 
Minister of Culture; the Minister of Agriculture; the Minister of Social Affairs; the Minister of 
Health; the Minister of Foreign Affairs; the Minister of Public Works and Transportation; the 
Acting Minister of the Interior; the Minister of Justice; the Minister of Economy and Commerce; 
the Minister of Labour; and the Minister for the Displaced, as well as with Members of 
Parliament, members of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, the Bar Association, the 
Council of the South, the Council for Scientific Research and the Council for Reconstruction and 
Development.  The Commission held meetings with high-rank officials from the Lebanese 
Armed Forces, as well as municipal authorities, the Prosecutor-General, the Director of the 
National De-Mining Office, the Director of Civil Defence, the Military Prosecutor, the Director 
of the Port of Beirut, the Mayor of Beirut and the Director-General of Antiquities. 
</p>
<p>22. The Commission also met with the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General of 
the United Nations, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and representatives of 
United Nations agencies in Lebanon, as well as the Commander and other staff of UNIFIL and 
UNTSO.  The Commission met with representatives of OHCHR, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNICEF, 
the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
ICRC and LRC, as well as academic experts in humanitarian and human rights law and social 
sciences.  The Commission held meetings in Beirut and in Tyre, with representatives of local and 
international non-governmental organizations, hospital authorities, and local and international 
press with testimony and materials to offer. 
</p>
<p>23. In Lebanon, basing its work on the specific incidents and locations mentioned in 
resolution S-2/1, as well as the advice it received from various sources, the Commission visited 
the suburbs of South Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, Byblos, and in particular southern Lebanon, 
gathering testimonies, evidence and other information directly from municipalities, communities 
and individuals.  In Beirut, the Commission visited the port of Dalieh Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf, and in 
South Beirut, the municipalities of Ghobeiri, Haret Hreik and Chiyah.  In the Bekaa Valley, the 
Commission visited Ali al Nahri and Baalbeck.  In southern Lebanon, the Commission visited 
many villages and towns, in particular between the Litani River and the Blue Line, among those 
Aita Ech Chaab, Aitarun, Bent J&#8217;beil, Chamaa, Chihine, Debel, El Duweir, Qauzah, Ghazieh, 
Houla, Khiyam, Marjayoun, Marwaheen, Naqoura, Qana, Saida, Siddiqine, Taibe, Tibnin, Tyre, 
Yatar and Zabqine.  The Commission also travelled to Byblos to address issues related to 
damage caused by the conflict to the environment and cultural property at the archaeological site. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. The findings of the Commission are based on investigation and all information available 
to it, including first-hand accounts.  In particular, the Commission considered all information and 
documentation from Ministries of the Government of Lebanon, members of the Lebanese 
Parliament, the Lebanese Armed Forces, the Bar Association, as well as representatives of 
Hezbollah.  The Commission considered publicly available written material from the 
Government of Israel and IDF relevant to the conflict.  The Commission also considered all 
information shared by UNIFIL and UNTSO, United Nations agencies and programmes, and 
international and national non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>25. The Commission is thankful to the Government of Lebanon for its cooperation, as well as 
to Members of the Lebanese Parliament, the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee and its 
rapporteur for sharing information.  The Commission would like to thank, in particular, the 
people of Lebanon and regional and local authorities for sharing their testimonies and 
experiences in relation to the conflict.  The Commission is grateful for the assistance and 
support it received from the OHCHR and appreciates the cooperation it received from other 
United Nations agencies and representatives, intergovernmental organizations and NGOs 
throughout the course of its mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The conflict as addressed by the Commission&#8217;s mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Lebanon:  profile and background 
</b></p>
<p>26. Lebanon is a Mediterranean and mountainous country of 10,452 sq. km. and a 
population estimated at 3.8 million, composed of different groups.  No official census has been 
carried out since 1932.  It is estimated that about 40 per cent are Christians, 35 per cent Shiite 
Muslims, 23 per cent Sunni Muslims, and 5 per cent are Druze.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>27. About 406,342 Palestinian refugees have registered in Lebanon with the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). 
</p>
<p>28. Since the end of the Second World War, Lebanon has experienced international conflict, 
civil war, &#8220;security zones&#8221; and occupation.  Lebanon took part in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war 
providing logistical support to the Arab Liberation Army.  In pursuance of Security Council 
resolution 62 (1948) of 16 November 1948, Lebanon and Israel signed on 23 March 1949 a 
general armistice agreement.  A peace treaty, however, did not follow.  The Lebanese-Israeli 
border remained closed, but quiet, until the 1967 Six Day War. 
</p>
<p>29. From 1975 to 1990, civil war erupted in Lebanon.  It resulted in the deaths of an 
estimated 120,000 people.  Militias that corresponded to Lebanon&#8217;s different confessional 
communities carried much of the fighting during the conflict.  Over the years, various foreign 
powers deployed forces in Lebanon at the request of its Government to stabilize the situation. 
</p>
<p>30. During the 1980s Israel carried out frequent military operations, including shellings and 
air attacks, and undertook an extended occupation of southern Lebanon.  The Hezbollah 
organization, as will be explained later, was created in the context of the Israeli occupation. 
</p>
<p>31. Israel remained in control of Southern Lebanon until May 2000, when it withdrew its 
troops in compliance with Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. Since 1978, the Security Council has adopted a number of resolutions calling, inter alia, 
for an end to violence, the protection of civilians, respect for Lebanese sovereignty, the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory and the exercise of Lebanese authority 
throughout the country.<b>4</b>  Pursuant to Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978), UNIFIL 
was deployed, with three purposes as set forth in resolution 425: (<i>a</i>) confirming the withdrawal 
of Israeli forces; (<i>b</i>) restoring international peace and security; and (<i>c</i>) assisting the Government 
of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.  UNIFIL mandate has 
been regularly renewed.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>33. On 22 October 1989, members of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies signed the Taif 
Agreement.  This agreement called for national reconciliation and for &#8220;spreading the sovereignty 
of the State of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory&#8221; through a one-year plan that included the 
&#8220;disbanding of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias&#8221;.  The militias&#8217; weapons were to &#8220;be 
delivered to the State of Lebanon within a period of six months&#8221;.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>34. On 16 June 2000, the Secretary-General informed the Security Council that Israel had 
withdrawn its forces, in accordance with resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978), and had met the 
requirements set out by the Secretary General in his report of 22 May 2000 (S/2000/460) to the 
Council.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>35. Despite the Israeli withdrawal, sporadic armed operations along the Israeli-Lebanese 
southern border continued to oppose the Israeli armed forces to Hezbollah militia, mainly on the 
grounds of Israel&#8217;s continued occupation of the Shab&#8217;a farms.  The Shab&#8217;a farms area was 
occupied by Israel in 1967.  In 1981, Israel decided to extend the application of Israeli law to the 
occupied Shab&#8217;a region.  The Security Council, in resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
condemned this action and declared it &#8220;null and void and without international legal effect&#8221;.  
Lebanon considers the Shab&#8217;a farms as part of its territory, as indicated in the Memorandum of 
12 May 2000 addressed to the Secretary-General on 12 May 2000.<b>8</b>  The Hezbollah leadership 
has pledged to continue opposing Israel as long as it continues its occupation of the Shab&#8217;a farms 
area.  As stated by the Secretary-General, representatives of the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic have repeatedly stated that the Shab&#8217;a farms area belongs to Lebanon and not to 
Israeli-occupied Syrian territory.  However, the Secretary-General has also recalled that &#8220;the 
determination by the United Nations of the status of the Shab&#8217;a farms is without prejudice to any 
border delineation agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon&#8221;.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>36. On 2 September 2004, the Security Council adopted resolution 1559 (2004) which 
reiterated the Council&#8217;s strong support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political 
independence of Lebanon.  It called upon all parties concerned to cooperate fully and urgently 
with the Council for the full implementation of that and other relevant Council resolutions.  
It aimed among other things, at the disarmament of Hezbollah, as well as the retreat of Syrian 
troops which, according to the Secretary General, were the only significant foreign forces 
deployed in Lebanon as at 30 September 2004.<b>10</b>  As reported by the Secretary-General, on 
26 April 2005, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reported that it had completed its 
full withdrawal of Syrian troops, military assets and the intelligence apparatus from Lebanon, as 
required by Security Council resolution 1559 (2004).<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Hezbollah is a Shiite organization that began to take shape during the Lebanese civil war.  
It originated as a merger of several groups and associations that opposed and fought against </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the 1982 Israeli occupation of Lebanon.  Hezbollah has grown to an organization active in the 
Lebanese political system and society, where it is represented in the Lebanese parliament and in 
the cabinet.  It also operates its own armed wing, as well as radio and satellite television stations.  
It further funds and manages its own social development programmes. 
</p>
<p>38. Throughout the 1980s, 1990s and after, Hezbollah&#8217;s raison d&#8217;&#234;tre has been the continued 
occupation by Israel of Lebanese territory and the detention of Lebanese prisoners in Israel.  The 
extent of the destruction and the difficult conditions that the Israeli occupation imposed on the 
Lebanese population, particularly the Shiite population living in south Lebanon, generated strong 
popular support for Hezbollah.  Furthermore, a number of incidents involving Israeli attacks 
against the civilian population, the Sabra and Chatila killings in 1982, and the Nabatiyeh incident 
a year later, as well as the high number of Lebanese and Palestinians held in Israeli detention, 
further strengthened the commitment to Hezbollah&#8217;s objective of driving the Israeli occupying 
forces out of Lebanese territory. 
</p>
<p>39. Hezbollah has maintained an active armed presence despite Security Council 
resolution 1559 (2004).  While this failure to disarm constitutes a non-compliance with the 
resolution, Hezbollah&#8217;s military wing maintains that it is entitled to exercise armed resistance 
against Israel&#8217;s unlawful occupation of Lebanese territory. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The July-August 2006 hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 12 July 2006, a new incident between Hezbollah military wing and IDF led to an 
upward spiral of hostilities in Lebanon and Israel that resulted in a major armed confrontation.  
The situation began when Hezbollah fighters fired rockets at Israeli military positions and border 
villages while another Hezbollah unit crossed the Blue Line, killed eight Israeli soldiers and 
captured two. 
</p>
<p>41. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert described this capture as an action by the sovereign 
country of Lebanon that attacked Israel and promised a &#8220;very painful and far-reaching 
response.&#8221;<b>12</b>  Israel blamed the Government of Lebanon for the raid, as it was carried out from 
Lebanese territory and Hezbollah was part of the Government.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>42. In response, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora denied any knowledge of the raid 
and stated that he did not condone it.<b>14</b>  An emergency meeting of the Government of Lebanon 
reaffirmed this position.  Furthermore, in a letter dated 13 July 2006 to the Secretary-General and 
the President of the Security Council, the Government of Lebanon declared that &#8220;[T]he Lebanese 
Government was not aware of the events that occurred and are occurring on the international 
Lebanese border&#8221; and that &#8220;[T]he Lebanese Government is not responsible for these events and 
does not endorse them.&#8221;<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>43. From 13 July 2006, the IDF attacked Lebanon by air, sea and land.  Israeli ground forces 
carried out a number of incursions on Lebanese territory.  Israel&#8217;s chief of staff Dan Halutz 
stated that &#8220;if the soldiers are not returned, we will turn Lebanon&#8217;s clock back 20 years,&#8221;<b>16</b> while 
the head of Israel&#8217;s Northern Command Udi Adam said, &#8220;this affair is between Israel and the 
State of Lebanon.  Where to attack? Once it is inside Lebanon, everything is legitimate - not just 
southern Lebanon, not just the line of Hezbollah posts.&#8221;<b>17</b>  The Israeli Cabinet authorized &#8220;severe 
and harsh&#8221; retaliation on Lebanon.<b>18</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. The Government of Lebanon decided on 27 July 2006 that it would extend its authority 
over its territory in an effort to ensure that there would not be any weapons or authority other 
than that of the Lebanese State.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>45. Terms for a ceasefire were drawn and revised several times over the course of the 
conflict, yet successful agreement between the parties took several weeks.  Lebanon frequently 
pleaded for the Security Council to call for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire between Israel 
and Hezbollah. 
</p>
<p>46. On 11 August 2006, the Security Council adopted resolution 1701 (2006) calling inter 
alia for a &#8220;full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the immediate cessation by 
Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all offensive military 
operations, and emphasizing the need to address urgently the causes that have given rise to the 
current crisis, including by the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers.&#8221;  On the 
same day, the Human Rights Council, meeting in special session, adopted resolution S-2/1, 
condemning Israeli violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law and calling 
for the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry. 
</p>
<p>47. Both parties to the conflict agreed on a ceasefire, which took effect on 14 August 2006 
at 0800 hours. 
</p>
<p>48. The Lebanese Army began deploying in southern Lebanon on 17 August 2006.  As 
reported by the Secretary-General, from an initial deployment of 1,500 troops, they built up to a 
full strength south of the Litani River of around 10,000-15,000.<b>20</b>  As of 18 August, UNIFIL 
had some 2,000 personnel in Southern Lebanon; by 13 October, this had increased to 
over 5,000 - the figure required for the IDF to withdraw fully from Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>49. The blockade was lifted on 6-7 September 2006.  On 1 October, the Israeli army reported 
that it had completed its withdrawal from southern Lebanon, information that was confirmed by 
UNIFIL.<b>21</b>  UNIFIL confirmed that its forces were still operating near Ghajar, and the situation 
was still being discussed between UNIFIL, IDF and the Lebanese Army at the time of writing.<b>22</b>  
The situation related to Shab&#8217;a Farms remained the same. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Qualification of the conflict 
</b>50. An essential pre-condition for the application of international humanitarian law and the 
establishment of the applicable and governing rules, is a determination on the factual existence 
of an armed conflict, and its legal classification.  Legal obligations under international 
humanitarian law also depend on the very character of a conflict.  Accordingly, the two key 
issues that inherently arise are, (<i>a</i>) whether or not between 12 July and 14 August 2006 an armed 
conflict took place in Lebanon and in Israel, and if so, (<i>b</i>) who were the Parties to it. 
</p>
<p>51. First, it is well established in international humanitarian law that for the existence of an 
armed conflict the decisive element is the factual existence of the use of armed force.  That aside, 
there is authority for the proposition that an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to 
armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and 
organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.<b>23</b>  International humanitarian law 
applies as soon as an armed conflict arises and it binds all the parties thereto to fully comply </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>with it.  On the basis of the factual circumstances of the conduct of the hostilities that took place, 
including the intensity of the violence and the use of armed force, the Commission is of the view 
that the existence of an armed conflict during the relevant period has been sufficiently 
established. 
</p>
<p>52. Second, neither Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), which called for a full cessation 
of hostilities, nor Council resolution S-2/1 contains any reference to the qualification of the 
armed conflict.  The language of the latter, particularly in paragraph 5, urges all the parties to 
respect the rules of international humanitarian law, to refrain from violence against the civilian 
population and to treat under all circumstances detained combatants and civilians in accordance 
with the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. 
</p>
<p>53. A particular characteristic and the sui generi<i>s</i> nature of the conflict is that active 
hostilities only took place between Israel and Hezbollah fighters.  The Commission found no 
indication that the Lebanese Armed Forces actively participated in the hostilities that ensued.  
For its part, IDF attacked the Lebanese Armed Forces and its assets (e.g. military airport at 
Qliat in northern Lebanon,<b>24</b> all radar installations along the Lebanese coast, and the army 
barracks at Djamhour, 100 kilometres from the southern border with Israel.<b>25</b>)  A joint Security 
Force comprising the LAF and the Police offered no resistance to the IDF at Marjayoun 
on 10 August 2006. 
</p>
<p>54. On the conflict, the position of the Government of Lebanon is that it was not responsible 
for and had no prior knowledge of the operation carried out by Hezbollah against an IDF patrol 
inside Israeli territory on 12 July 2006.<b>26</b>  This was orally confirmed by Prime Minister Siniora to 
the Commission when they met in Beirut on 25 September 2006.  Lebanon has also stated that it 
disavowed and did not endorse that act.<b>27</b>  Furthermore, the Government of Lebanon has 
emphasized that it is the sole authority that decides on peace and war and the protection of the 
Lebanese people.<b>28</b>  It participated effectively in the negotiations leading to the adoption of 
Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) accepted by both Israel and Lebanon.  For its part, the 
Government of Israel has officially stated that responsibility lies with the Government of 
Lebanon, from whose territory these acts were launched into Israel,<b>29</b> and that the belligerent act 
was the act of a sovereign State, Lebanon.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>55. It is the view of the Commission that hostilities were in actual fact and in the main only 
between the IDF and Hezbollah.  The fact that the Lebanese Armed Forces did not take an active 
part in them neither denies the character of the conflict as a legally cognizable international 
armed conflict, nor does it negate that Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah were parties to it.  
Regarding this, the Commission stressed three points. 
</p>
<p>56. First, in Lebanon, Hezbollah is a legally recognized political party, whose members are 
both nationals and a constituent part of its population.<b>31</b>  It has duly elected representatives in the 
Parliament and is part of the Government.  Therefore, it integrates and participates in the 
constitutional organs of the State. 
</p>
<p>57. Secondly, for the public in Lebanon, resistance means Israeli occupation of Lebanese 
territory.  The effective behaviour of Hezbollah in South Lebanon suggests an inferred link 
between the Government of Lebanon and Hezbollah in the latter&#8217;s assumed role over the years as 
a resistance movement against Israel&#8217;s occupation of Lebanese territory.<b>32</b>  In its military </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>expression and in the light of international humanitarian law, Hezbollah constitutes an armed 
group, a militia, whose conduct and operations enter into the field of application of article 4, 
paragraph 2 (<i>b</i>), of the Third Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949.  Seen from inside Lebanon 
and in the absence of the regular Lebanese Armed Forces in South Lebanon, Hezbollah 
constituted and is an expression of the resistance (&#8216;<i>mukawamah</i>&#8217;) for the defence of the territory 
partly occupied.  A government policy statement regarded the Lebanese resistance as a true and 
natural expression of the right of the Lebanese people in defending its territory and dignity by 
confronting the Israeli threat and aggression.<b>33</b>  In his address to the nation, on 18 August 2006, 
President Emile Lahoud paid tribute to the &#8220;National Resistance fighters&#8221;.<b>34</b>  Hezbollah had also 
assumed de facto State authority and control in South Lebanon in non-full implementation of 
Security Council resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), which, inter alia, had called for and 
required the disarmament of all armed groups, and had urged the strict respect of the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and unity of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the 
Government of Lebanon throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>58. Thirdly, the State of Lebanon was the subject of direct hostilities conducted by Israel, 
consisting of such acts, as an aerial and maritime blockade that commenced on 13 July 2006, 
until their full lifting on 6 and 8 September 2006, respectively; a widespread and systematic 
campaign of direct and other attacks throughout its territory against its civilian population and 
civilian objects, as well as massive destruction of its public infrastructure, utilities, and other 
economic assets; armed attacks on its Armed Forces; hostile acts of interference with its internal 
affairs, territorial integrity and unity and acts constituting temporary occupation of Lebanese 
villages and towns by IDF. 
</p>
<p>59. That aside, a number of Lebanese high government authorities informed the Commission 
that they considered that, to the extent that Lebanon was a victim, and suffered the devastating 
effect of armed hostilities by Israel, it was a party to the conflict.  In the words of the Minister of 
Justice: &#8220;un agress&#233; peut &#234;tre une partie d&#8217;un conflit&#8221;.<b>35</b>  Insofar as it is relevant and having 
regard to common article 2, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, international 
humanitarian law applies even in a situation<i>, </i>where for example the armed forces of a State party 
temporarily occupy the territory of another State, without meeting any resistance from the latter.  
On the same legal basis, it has been stated that the Geneva Conventions apply even where a State 
temporarily occupies another State without an exchange of fire having taken place or in a 
situation where the Occupying State encounters no military opposition whatsoever.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>60. The Commission considers that both Lebanon and Israel were parties to the conflict.  
They remain bound by the Geneva Conventions of 1949, and customary international 
humanitarian law existing at the time of the conflict.  Hezbollah is equally bound by the same 
laws.  For completeness, and as mentioned earlier, both Israel and Lebanon are parties to the 
main international human rights instruments, and they remain legally obliged to respect them. 
</p>
<p>61. Moreover, while Hezbollah&#8217;s illegal action under international law of 12 July 2006 
provoked an immediate violent reaction by Israel, it is clear that, albeit the legal justification for 
the use of armed force (self-defence<b>37</b>), Israel&#8217;s military actions very quickly escalated from a 
riposte to a border incident into a general attack against the entire Lebanese territory.  Israel&#8217;s 
response was considered by the Security Council in its resolution 1701(2006) as &#8220;offensive 
military operation&#8221;.  These actions have the characteristics of an armed aggression, as defined by 
General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. The fact that Israel considered Hezbollah a terrorist organisation and its fighters as 
terrorists does not influence the Commission&#8217;s qualification of the conflict.  Several official 
declarations of the Government of Israel addressed Lebanon as assuming responsibility.  IDF 
views its operations in Lebanon as an international armed conflict.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Commission has carried out its tasks, in accordance with its mandate and terms of 
reference, through the application of international law, international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law.  It was guided essentially by the principles of human dignity 
which underpin human rights and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>64. While the conduct of armed conflict and military occupation is governed by international 
humanitarian law, human rights law is applicable at all times, including during states of 
emergency or armed conflict.  The two bodies of law complement and reinforce one another.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) International Humanitarian Law 
</b>65. The basic corpus of international humanitarian law is applicable to the conflict, and 
both Israel and Lebanon are party to key international humanitarian law instruments.  Israel is 
party to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, but has not ratified Additional 
Protocol I or II on the protection of victims of armed conflict.  In addition, Israel is party to the 
Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 
14 May 1954 and its First Protocol (1954); the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the 
Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to 
have Indiscriminate Effects of 10 October 1980, as well as its Protocol I on non-detectable 
fragments (1980), Protocol II on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mines, booby-traps and 
other devices (1980 and as amended on 3 May 1996), and Protocol IV on Blinding Laser 
Weapons (1995).  Israel has neither ratified Protocol III on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the 
Use of Incendiary Weapons (1980), nor Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War (2003). 
</p>
<p>66. Lebanon is party to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 as well as 
Additional Protocols I and II relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts.  It is also 
party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of 
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (1972), and the 
Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 
14 May 1954 and its First Protocol.  Lebanon is not party to the Convention on Prohibitions or 
Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be 
Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects of 10 October 1980, nor to any of its 
Protocols. 
</p>
<p>67. In addition to the international treaty obligations, rules of customary international human 
rights and humanitarian law bind States and other actors.  In other words, all of the parties to the 
conflict are also subject to customary international humanitarian law.<b>40</b>  As a party to the 
conflict, Hezbollah is also bound to respect international humanitarian law and human rights.<b>41</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>68. Serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law 
are regulated inter alia by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, as well as 
customary international law.  Israel has signed but has not ratified the Statute.  Lebanon has 
neither signed nor ratified the Statute. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) International Human Rights Law 
</b>69. Israel and Lebanon both are bound by international instruments relating to international 
human rights law, which requires that they respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of those 
within their respective jurisdictions.  These instruments include the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, as well as major human rights treaties, namely the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to the situation of children in armed conflict, States parties to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child have specific obligations.  Article 38 of the Convention requires States 
to respect and ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law which are relevant to 
the child.  In accordance with their international legal obligations to protect the civilian 
population in armed conflicts, States parties also must take all feasible measures to ensure 
protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>71. While the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allows for the possibility, 
in circumstances that threaten the life of the nation, to derogate from certain guarantees - 
provided that the measures are strictly necessary - certain guarantees are non-derogable at any 
time (art. 4).  These include, inter alia, the right to life (art. 6); the prohibition of torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading punishment (art. 7); the principle of legality in the field of criminal law 
(art. 15) and the recognition of everyone as a person before the law (art. 16).  In addition, other 
non-derogable elements of the Covenant, as defined by the Human Rights Committee, include 
the right of all persons deprived of their liberty to be treated with humanity and with respect for 
the inherent dignity of the human person; the prohibition against taking hostages, abductions or 
unacknowledged detention; certain elements of the rights of minorities to protection; the 
prohibition of deportation or forcible transfer of population; and the prohibition of propaganda 
for war and of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that would constitute incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence.<b>42</b>  The obligation to provide effective remedies for any 
violation of the provisions of article 2, paragraph 3, of the Covenant must be always complied 
with<b>43</b> the protection of those rights recognized as non-derogable also requires certain procedural 
safeguards, including judicial guarantees.  Measures derogating from the Covenant must not 
involve discrimination on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin. 
</p>
<p>72. In addition, the rights reflected in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights may, in times of armed conflict where resources are constrained, be limited in 
accordance with articles 4 and 5.  However, the primary purpose of article 4 is to protect the 
rights of individuals rather than to permit the imposition of limitations by States.<b>44</b>  Any 
restrictions must therefore be proportional, in accordance with the law, including international </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>human rights standards, compatible with the nature of the rights protected by the Covenant, in 
the interest of legitimate aims pursued; and strictly necessary for the promotion of the general 
welfare in a democratic society.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>73. Lebanon has not notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the state of 
emergency in accordance with article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, although it proclaimed a national state of emergency on 12 July 2006.  Israel declared a 
state of public emergency on 19 May 1948 and has remained in this state continuously since 
then.  Upon ratifying the Covenant, Israel made a declaration regarding the existence of this state 
of emergency and noted a reservation to article 9 (liberty and security of person).<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>74. Article 2 of the Covenant obliges each State party &#8220;to respect and to ensure to all 
individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction&#8221; the rights recognized within it.  In 
addition, the International Court of Justice has recognized that the Covenant &#8220;is applicable in 
respect of acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory&#8221;.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II.</b>  <b>THE FACTS AND LEGAL ANALYSIS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General approach 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  On the facts 
</b></p>
<p>75. From the outset, the Commission wishes to underline certain characteristics that emerge 
from the conflict. 
</p>
<p>76. The 33-day conflict in Lebanon more than affected the country.  It exacted a heavy 
human toll and damaged economic and social structures, as well as the environment.  During the 
campaign, Israel&#8217;s Air Force flew more than 12,000 combat missions.  Its Navy fired 
2,500 shells, and its Army fired over 100,000 shells,<b>48</b> destroying as a consequence large parts of 
the Lebanese civilian infrastructure, including roads, bridges and other &#8216;targets&#8217; such as Beirut 
International Airport, ports, water and sewage treatment plants, electrical facilities, fuel stations, 
commercial structures, schools and hospitals, as well as private homes.<b>49</b>  According to 
Government of Lebanon figures, 30,000 homes were destroyed or damaged, 109 bridges and 
137 roads (445,000 sq. km.) damaged, and 78 health facilities (dispensaries, health centres and 
hospitals) were seriously affected, with 2 hospitals destroyed.  Furthermore, the Lebanese 
Government indicates that 900 commercial centres and factories were affected, as were 32 other 
&#8220;vital points&#8221; (airports, ports, water and sewage treatment, electrical plants).  Over 789 
cluster-bomb sites have been identified in southern Lebanon, and over one million bomblets 
have littered the region. 
</p>
<p>77. The conflict resulted in 1,191 deaths and 4,409 injured.  More than 900,000 people fled 
their homes.<b>50</b>  It was estimated that one third of the casualties and deaths were children.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>78. Israel also suffered serious casualties.  Reports indicate that 43 civilians were 
killed, 997 were injured (75 seriously injured, 115 moderately injured, 807 lightly injured), 
6,000 homes were affected and 300,000 persons were displaced by Hezbollah&#8217;s attacks on Israeli 
towns in northern Israel. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>79. The Israeli operations had a devastating impact, notably in southern Lebanon.  The 
effects touched the civilian population, property and infrastructure, cultural objects, mosques and 
churches, all with tragic results.  Since the end of the hostilities, Israel has dropped leaflets in 
southern Lebanon which refer to &#8220;destruction, devastation, and death&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>80. The conduct of Israel demonstrates an overall lack of respect for the cardinal principles 
regulating the conduct of armed conflict, most notably distinction, proportionality and 
precaution.  The particularly tragic impact on civilians and civilian property is certainly due to 
this deficit. 
</p>
<p>81. It is significant to observe IDF actions in terms of their direct and deliberate attacks 
against the Lebanese population.  The obligation to distinguish civilians from combatants, 
civilian property from military targets, and protected civilian objects was not often respected.  
Civilians suffered greatly from indiscriminate attacks.  The idea of treating Lebanese citizens as 
members, friends, family or sympathizers of Hezbollah, and therefore as potential enemies 
and/or combatants susceptible to lawful attack, goes well beyond any legal interpretation of the 
principle of &#8216;civilians having lost their protected status&#8217; and of their &#8216;direct participation in the 
hostilities&#8217;. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  On legal basic principles 
</b></p>
<p>82. During an armed conflict, the protection of civilians is a fundamental precept of 
international humanitarian law, one which includes cardinal principles related to distinction, 
proportionality and military necessity.  Respect for human life and human dignity are at the core 
of the protection afforded under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>83. International law requires States to ensure full respect for the right to life of those within 
their jurisdiction, including protection against the arbitrary deprivation of life.  At the same time, 
in order to ensure the protection of civilians in armed conflict, international humanitarian law 
requires that all parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and 
combatants.  In essence, this means that attacks may be directed only at military objectives, that 
is those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to 
military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the 
circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.<b>52</b>  Civilians may only be 
targeted for such time as they participate directly in the hostilities.<b>53</b>  Attacks on civilian objects 
are strictly prohibited unless, at the time of the attack, they were used for military purposes and 
their destruction offered a definite military advantage.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>84. According to the principle of distinction, indiscriminate attacks are strictly prohibited.<b>55</b>  
This includes attacks which are not directed at a specific military objective, employ a method or 
means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective, or employ a method 
or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by international 
humanitarian law, and consequently are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or 
civilian objects without distinction.  Attacks by bombardment, including with rockets, which 
treat as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives 
located in an urban area or rural village are prohibited.<b>56</b>  The prohibition of indiscriminate 
attacks must not only determine the strategy adopted for a particular military operation but also 
limit the use of certain weapons in situations where the civilian population will be affected.<b>57</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>85. Attacks on legitimate military objectives which may be expected to cause incidental loss 
of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which 
would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, are 
prohibited.<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>86. All feasible precautions must be taken in order to avoid, or in any event to minimize, 
incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.<b>59</b>  International 
humanitarian law prescribes specific precautionary measures in relation to the planning and 
conduct of attacks, including an obligation to give effective advance warning of attacks which 
may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>87. Ensuring the protection of civilians in armed conflict also requires that civilians be kept 
away from military targets.  In addition, international law prohibits the intentional use by a party 
to the conflict of civilians to immunize otherwise legitimate military objectives from lawful 
attack.<b>61</b> 
</p>
<p>88. Other fundamental principles of international law related to the protection of civilians in 
armed conflict should be recalled prior to the Commission&#8217;s consideration of specific issues.  
For example, States must exert their influence, to the degree possible, to stop violations of 
international humanitarian law.<b>62</b>  Collective punishment - that is, the punishment of a group of 
people for the acts committed by one or several - is prohibited.<b>63</b>  Where they are not prohibited 
by international law, belligerent reprisals are subject to strict conditions.<b>64</b>  They are prohibited 
altogether against persons protected by the Geneva Conventions.<b>65</b>  And in addition, reprisals 
against objects protected under the Geneva Conventions and Hague Convention for the 
Protection of Cultural Property are strictly prohibited.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p>89. Forcible displacement of civilians for reasons related to an armed conflict is prohibited, 
unless the security of the civilians involved or military necessity so require.<b>67</b>  Where 
displacement occurs, all possible measures must be taken in order that the civilians concerned 
are received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and 
that members of the same family are not separated.<b>68</b> 
</p>
<p>90. Humanitarian access to affected populations is crucial, where the State in question is 
unable or unwilling to provide for the basic needs of civilians on their territory.  According to 
international law, humanitarian relief personnel must be respected and protected,<b>69</b> and all parties 
to the conflict must allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for 
civilians in need.<b>70</b>  The Security Council has stressed, in particular, the need for all parties 
concerned to cooperate fully with the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and 
United Nations agencies in providing safe and unimpeded access to civilians in armed conflict.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Specific approach 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Attacks on the civilian population and objects 
</b>91. One of the most tragic facts of the conflict raises the question of direct and indiscriminate 
attacks on civilians and civilian objects and the violation of the right to life.  Due to the time 
constraints, as well as practical considerations, such as the continued displacement of survivors </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and the need for a full and careful documentation of individual eye-witness accounts, the 
Commission was able to examine only a certain number of incidents which occurred during the 
conflict.  Findings based on particular incidents are set out below. 
</p>
<p>92. The Commission is aware that a comprehensive investigation related to a large number of 
alleged killings (see annex VI) is being conducted under the auspices of the Lebanese 
Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, in cooperation with civil society and concerned 
individuals.  The Commission stresses that violations of international humanitarian law and 
incidents involving alleged infringement of the right to life and other human rights, justify such 
investigations, and should be given due support and assistance, including from the Office of the 
High Commissioner and other United Nations agencies, as necessary. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Southern Lebanon 
</b>93. Numerous villages throughout southern Lebanon suffered extensive bombing and 
shelling resulting in killings and massive displacement of civilians.  Some villages were 
occupied by Israeli forces and suffered other kinds of damage.  The Bekaa Valley also came 
under attack. 
</p>
<p>94. The village of Al Duweir is located in South Lebanon a few kilometres north of the 
Litani River.  The three-storey family house of Sheikh Adil Akkash was located outside the 
village in an isolated spot on a hillside.  The Commission visited the site and spoke with the 
father of Sheikh Adil Akkash, Mr. Mohammed Mustafa Akkash.  He told the Commission how, 
on 14 July at 0400 hours, the house was hit by three missiles.  The 41-year old cleric, his wife, 
seven daughters and three sons (aged 6 months to 17 years), and Sri Lankan maid were inside the 
house.  All 13 were killed.  The house was completely destroyed. 
</p>
<p>95. The Sheikh was a religious scholar, his father said, a peaceful man.  &#8220;Ask anyone in the 
village, everyone will say the same thing&#8221;, he said.  He taught in a religious school in Saida, 
which, the father said, was also hit a few days later.  The Sheikh had a huge collection of books, 
which the Commission saw littered across the hillside amid the rubble.  The house was located 
about 200 metres away from the nearest house, which was untouched, suggesting that the 
bombing was targeted.  There was no indication of any hostilities in or around the vicinities.  
However, no information could be collected which would explain the motivation for the killing 
of this family.  As a civilian and a cleric, the Sheikh and his family would be clearly protected by 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>96. In Marwaheen, the Commission interviewed witnesses in relation to the occupation of 
the village by IDF, as well as on the attacks on convoys leaving the village on 15 and 16 July 
(see sect. B.2).  UNIFIL reported that as IDF advanced into the village they fired at every single 
house with tanks and machine guns.  In addition, numerous houses were vandalized by IDF 
troops during their period of occupation and one was deliberately set on fire.  The fire damage 
was witnessed by members of the Commission: the beds used in the house by IDF were stacked 
together in one room and had been deliberately set on fire.  Towards the end of the conflict, after 
IDF had withdrawn, the village was subjected to cluster-bomb attacks. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>97. The Commission is of the view that these acts, including suppressive fire or the 
destruction of empty buildings, could not be justified in terms of military necessity, particularly 
in view of the fact that IDF had ordered and witnessed the evacuation of the village, and would 
have known that all civilians had left. 
</p>
<p>98. On 30 July the Israeli Air Force (IAF) bombed a three-storey building in the town of 
Qana.  As a result 29 civilians, including 17 children,<b>72</b> were killed.  This was the repetition of 
the tragic event of 18 April 1996, in which 100 Lebanese civilians were killed.<b>73</b>  The incident 
provoked extraordinary emotion, particularly in view of the number of victims.  In a statement 
on 30 July 2006 to an emergency meeting of the Security Council, the Secretary-General urged it 
&#8220;to condemn the Israeli attack on the Qana&#8221; and called for an immediate cessation of 
hostilities<b>74</b>.  On the same day the Security Council expressed shock and distress at Israeli 
shellings in Qana, strongly deplored loss of innocent lives in the conflict and requested the 
Secretary-General to report within one week on the tragic attack.<b>75</b>  The Secretary-General&#8217;s 
report of 7 August<b>76</b> outlined events according to the Government of Israel and by the 
Government of Lebanon.<b>77</b> 
</p>
<p>99. The IAF Chief of Staff held a press conference on the attack on 30 July.<b>78</b>  This was 
followed by an official inquiry by the Israeli authorities published on 2 August 2006, which 
confirmed that &#8220;since July 12 over 150 rockets were launched from within the village and 
immediate surroundings.  Residents had been warned several times to evacuate the area&#8221;.<b>79</b>  IAF 
stated that they had photographic evidence of the precision attacks, confirming that this 
particular building was hit at 0052 hrs by two bombs: the first exploded, while the second was a 
dud.  The report states that &#8220;the building was attacked in accordance with their military 
guidelines regarding the use of fire against suspicious structures inside villages whose residents 
have been warned to evacuate and which were adjacent to areas where rockets are fired towards 
Israel (&#8230;).  IDF operated on information the building was not inhabited by civilians and was 
being used as a hiding place for terrorists&#8221;.<b>80</b> 
</p>
<p>100. The Commission visited Qana and was informed that the members of two families, who 
normally lived elsewhere in the village, had moved into the building in question that night for 
shelter because it was one of the larger buildings in the area and had a reinforced basement.  
According to witnesses, two members of one family were Hezbollah fighters that had been killed 
in fighting elsewhere and therefore were not in Qana on 30 July.  One survivor spoke of the 
ground swelling up beneath him and the building then collapsing.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>101. Following the attack, IDF reportedly continued to attack Qana.  As a result, neither 
Lebanese Red Cross, Civil Defence teams, nor rescue services/UNIFIL were able to reach the 
house until 0900 hours that morning.  IDF state that they first received reports of the incident 
around 0800-0830 hours.  At the same time, IDF gave warnings to civilians to evacuate, 
although it was clear that the local inhabitants were too petrified to leave because of the 
continuous bombardment in Qana and on the routes leading away from it.  In other words, the 
warnings could not be considered as being &#8220;effective&#8221; as required by international humanitarian 
law.<b>82</b> 
</p>
<p>102. The Commission did not receive any information to suggest that the building in question 
was being used as a Hezbollah missile launch site, either prior to or at the time of the attack, and 
that it therefore may have been a legitimate military target.<b>83</b>  The precautionary measures taken </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>by IDF on 30 July just two hours before the strike, warning the civilians to flee Qana, were 
neither an active nor an effective action.  IDF attacks had already seriously limited road access, 
the town was under intensive and heavy bombardment, and the time for inhabitants to flee was in 
the circumstances too short.<b>84</b>  It is the view of the Commission that the reasons advanced for its 
targeting are not tenable.<b>85</b> 
</p>
<p>103. In Taibe, the Commission gathered information on the occupation of part of the town by 
IDF, which set up sniper positions in the castle from which they could dominate the surrounding 
area; 136 houses and 2 schools were destroyed in Taibe. 
</p>
<p>104. Witnesses explained to the Commission that most of the men in the village possessed 
guns.  They stressed, however, that a distinction should be made between professional Hezbollah 
fighters and civilian militia volunteers from Amal and the Lebanese communist party who took 
up arms during the conflict.  The volunteers were welcomed if they obeyed the Hezbollah rules 
but were otherwise ordered to leave the area.  According to witnesses, Hezbollah did not fire 
rockets and mortars from within the village, or otherwise use it as a shield for its activities.  
Rather, Hezbollah used adjoining valleys, as well as caves and tunnels in the surrounding area 
from which to operate, and the surrounding countryside provided ample cover and security for 
their operations. 
</p>
<p>105. The Commission heard witness testimony and saw evidence of IDF behaviour in the 
village, including houses which had been occupied and vandalized, and water containers 
contaminated with human waste.  Similarly, the private school in the village had been vandalized 
and trashed, a fact witnessed and recorded by Swedish TV. 
</p>
<p>106. The Commission also was informed that the body of a Hezbollah fighter killed by IDF 
snipers had been set on fire by the roadside outside the town and mutilated.<b>86</b> 
</p>
<p>107. Several individuals told the Commission of another very serious incident involving the 
killing of the four members of one family, Nasrallah, as well as of the mutilation of the father&#8217;s 
body.  One witness reported that IDF snipers had fired on a woman who was returning to her 
house, having taken refuge in another house in the village.  Her daughter, who had gone to check 
on her, also was shot by the snipers.  The same thing happened to the father and his son who also 
had gone to the house to see what had happened.  The villagers later found the four bodies.  The 
father&#8217;s hands and legs had been cut off, and a note saying &#8220;this is what will happen to 
Nasrallah&#8221; was attached to his body.  Investigation on these allegations is currently being 
conducted by the Lebanese Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, Human Rights Watch and 
local NGOs. 
</p>
<p>108. The Commission visited the small town of Ghazieh, located north of the Litani river, 
which was attacked by IAF on 7 and 8 August 2006.  At least 29 people were killed in the attack, 
and another 56 were wounded.  The Commission met with the Mayor and with families that had 
been affected by the bombings, and was shown two out of four destroyed buildings that had been 
attacked.  The Mayor informed the Commission that there had been no prior hostilities in the 
town, the houses were not connected to Hezbollah, and the town had not been used to launch 
attacks against Israel.  Apparently no warnings were given prior to the attacks.  The houses had </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>been destroyed by precision bombing by aircraft and there was very limited collateral damage.  
The Commission was informed that a further attack took place nearby when the burial service for 
the victims of these attacks took place.  However, this incident did not result in any casualties. 
</p>
<p>109. In Yatar, the Commission was briefed by the Mayor and a number of town officials, who 
explained that the town had been subjected to heavy bombardment in which around 850 homes 
were damaged and 230 completely destroyed.  The inhabitants had been given warnings to leave 
but the exit routes were blocked as a result of IDF bombardments.  There was no warning before 
the first attack on the town.  On 12 July, an IDF helicopter was shot down by Hezbollah 
1,000 meters outside the village.  This led to intensified bombardment.  A Lebanese Red Cross 
ambulance was attacked on 13 August.  The Commission was informed that cluster bombs were 
dropped on and around the village.  This took place only during the last three days of the 
conflict.  The officials stated that no missiles had been fired from within the village, only from 
its outskirts.  They stated that 80 per cent of the houses were destroyed in the last few days of the 
war, one 15 minutes before the ceasefire came into effect. 
</p>
<p>110. It is likely that the town of Yatar was used as a base for Hezbollah fighters.  Officials 
explained that the outskirts had been used as launching sites for missiles, and that six fighters 
from the town had been killed.  The shooting down of the IDF helicopter may have led to 
retribution in the form of cluster bombs used in the last three days of the conflict.  The pattern 
and manner of attacks is not justifiable in terms of military necessity and was both indiscriminate 
and disproportionate.  The use of cluster bombs suggests a degree of vindictiveness and an effort 
to punish the population as a whole, including those returning to town.  As with so many other 
cases investigated by the Commission, the IDF actions were indiscriminate and disproportionate.  
The destruction of so many civilian houses is not justifiable in terms of military necessity<i>.</i> 
111. The Commission visited the town of Aita Ech Chaab, which was the scene of intense 
fighting and bombardment throughout the conflict.  The Commission was informed by the 
Mayor that on the first day of the conflict, the population was warned that they had 2 hours to 
leave.  The shelling began 10 minutes later.  Most of the civilian population of 12,000 left at this 
time but about 100 people remained.  Around 800 houses were totally destroyed and 400 were 
partially destroyed.  The centre of the town was the most severely damaged. 
</p>
<p>112. According to witness accounts, the town was defended by Hezbollah fighters who 
throughout the conflict withstood repeated IDF attempts to take control of the town.  Each 
incursion was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment and by air strikes.  IDF attempted to 
demolish buildings with bulldozers, but this strategy failed.  In the Commission&#8217;s view, the 
widespread destruction of residential buildings and other civilian property was disproportionate 
and would be difficult to justify on grounds of military necessity.<b>87</b> 
113. Bent J&#8217;beil, a thriving town of some 30,000 people, was known as the &#8220;capital of 
resistance&#8221;.  IDF operations against this town were similar in nature to those in Aita Ech Chaab.  
The Mayor informed the Commission that 800 houses had been destroyed and that &#8220;strange 
weapons&#8221; had been used on the town resulting in some children suffering strange spot marks on 
their skin.<b>88</b>  Two hospitals were directly targeted, as well as mosques.  Six schools were 
completely destroyed, and two partially destroyed. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>114. The Commission was informed that IDF had attempted to enter Bent J&#8217;beil but had been 
repeatedly resisted by Hezbollah fighters;<b>89</b> 15 fighters and 27 civilians were killed, and another 
100-120 people were injured.  As in the case of Aita Ech Chaab, it would appear that the failed 
attempts of IDF led them to resort to the tactic of bombardment.  Yet again, civilian property was 
targeted indiscriminately. 
</p>
<p>115. In several attacks on the village of Sreifa, about 30 kilometers east of Tyre, at 
least 25 civilians were killed and 26 others injured while 13 houses were destroyed.  According 
to a report presented by the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee network against Israeli war 
crimes, after the first bombing on 13 July, which killed four members of a family, villagers 
began fleeing to neighbouring villages for safety.  The IDF started shelling the area around the 
village from airplanes.  The people followed the advice of the Sheikh of the village and sought 
shelter in the big houses with basements used to dry tobacco in Haret Najdi neighbourhood.  
Around 0330 hours on 19 July, at least three Israeli planes struck at least 13 homes in 
Haret Najdi neighbourhood, firing multiple munitions and causing the homes to collapse on their 
basements, which were packed with sheltering civilians.<b>90</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) South Beirut 
</b>116. The Commission visited the South East suburbs of Beirut, which were heavily bombed 
from the earliest days until the last days of the conflict.  This largely Shiite district of high-rise 
buildings is densely populated and a busy commercial centre, with hundreds of small shops and 
businesses.  It was also a centre for Hezbollah activities in the city, including offices of the 
political headquarters of the organization, and its associated infrastructure, including <i>Jihad al 
Bina</i>, offices of parliamentarians, and the TV station <i>Al-Manar</i>.  During the course of the 
conflict, many displaced persons from the South had sought refuge in the relative safety of this 
neighbourhood. 
</p>
<p>117. The Commission members were shocked by the utter devastation of large sections of the 
area.  Throughout the period of the conflict, nearly every day, IDF attacked and destroyed a 
handful of unoccupied multi-storey buildings.  Nearly all of its 220,000 inhabitants have been 
forced to evacuate at the commencement of the hostilities.  The presence of Hezbollah offices, 
political headquarters and supporters would not justify the targeting of civilians and civilian 
property as military objectives. 
</p><p>118. The Commission met with community officials and people and visited the various 
municipalities affected by the bombing of the South Beirut Dahiyeh area and the adjoining 
Chiyah district. 
</p>
<p>119. The devastation in Dahiyeh was extensive.  The area had been subjected to very heavy 
aerial bombardment from apparently precision-guided bombs.  Whole buildings of 10 or more 
floors had completely collapsed.  The bomb craters witnessed by the Commission were 
enormous, indicating the use of very heavy ordnance.  There were still unexploded bombs in 
some buildings.  There was a pattern in the bombing and some buildings had been hit several 
times.  326 residential buildings were either damaged or destroyed in the southern suburbs.<b>91</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>120. During one single bombing, 35 people were killed.  Twenty-four hours before the end of 
the conflict, one building was bombed and six families within it were hit when they came back to 
clean their apartments.  The total figures of those killed or injured were, however, comparatively 
low in relation to the utter destruction of the area, because after the second day of the conflict a 
large portion of the population had vacated the area.  The total of those killed is estimated at 
around 110 with another 300 people injured. 
</p><p>121. In Chiyah, according to witness reports, on 7 August one building was hit twice 
within 10 seconds, first by four bombs and second by two bombs.  The Commission was given a 
list of the names of 41 individuals who were killed in this incident, including 13 children, 
one newborn, and 17 women.  Many of those killed were internally displaced persons  (IDPs) 
who had fled from the South. 
</p>
<p>122. In Roueiss, the Commission received information about the bombing of 8 eight-storey 
buildings which were attacked on the afternoon of 13 August, a few hours before the ceasefire.  
Only two people survived this strike.  The bodies of 13 people disintegrated completely.  The 
death toll is now 43 civilians.  Witnesses described how the buildings collapsed in less than one 
minute.  One man was trapped in the rubble, the stairs having fallen on him.  He stayed there for 
three days, screaming as he heard the bulldozers removing the rubble around him.  In the centre 
of these buildings was a yard where children were playing at the time of the bombing. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Bekaa Valley 
</b>123. In Al Qa&#8217;a, in the Bekaa Valley, the Commission saw the wreckage of a metal-roofed 
building used by Syrian workers employed on a farm to gather peaches during the harvest 
season.  The building housed workers&#8217; quarters composed of 12 rooms and a central corridor.  
According to one witness, the building was bombed on 4 August at 1400 hours in two strikes.<b>92</b>  
At the time of the bombing, most of the workers were having their lunch in the building.  The 
witness told the Commission that there was an MK drone over that location prior to the bombing 
and that two hours before the air strike, a truck had come to load fruit.  The truck was open and it 
was possible to see from the air what was inside.  One farmer was killed outside on a tractor and 
another was injured while collecting water from a tank located a few meters away from the 
building.  Figures regarding the total death toll from this incident vary from 25 to 39.<b>93</b> 
</p>
<p>124. A separate attack destroyed the house of a local farmer a few hundred metres away; 
however nobody was hurt as the family had left that house before that day and the farmer was 
outside at the time of the bombing. 
</p>
<p>125. From the close location of the two buildings, the farming activities carried out in the open 
and the circumstances of the attacks as described by the farmer, it would appear to the 
Commission that these strikes were deliberately targeted.  The Israeli authorities said they 
targeted the buildings suspecting they were being used as storage points for weaponry, having 
followed from the Syrian border to that farm a large truck they suspected of transporting arms.<b>94</b>  
The Commission considers that the presence of a drone above these locations should have 
allowed IDF to identify the nature of agricultural activities taking place and the presence of a 
large number of farm workers and their families.  Even if the truck had been carrying arms, and 
the farm had a dual use, nothing explains why the strikes took place at a time when all workers 
and their families were present in the building. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>126. In Rayak, on 17 July 2006 at 0200 hours, four individuals were killed and five injured 
(including two children) when Israeli planes raided the main road and hit a house inhabited by 
two elderly persons.  The attack hit a residential area and caused damages to nearby houses and 
shops.  It is not clear whether the Israeli Defense Forces had given any prior warning to Rayak&#8217;s 
residents.<b>95</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Attacks on convoys of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>127. One particularly disturbing aspect of the conflict was the attacks on civilian convoys.  
On 15 July 2006 a convoy of three civilian vehicles - one pick-up truck and two cars - was hit by 
IDF between Chamaa and Bayadda on an exposed section of road on a hillside over looking the 
sea, South of Tyre.  The people involved had fled Marwaheen in the panic following IDF 
announcement by loudspeaker that the town had to evacuate within two hours; 16 people were 
killed and seven more died later.  The Commission visited the site of the convoy incident, which 
appeared to be the result of an attack by a combination of weapons.<b>96</b>  In the subsequent recovery 
operation carried out by UNIFIL, one man and one girl were found dead 200 metres from the 
road, apparently having been targeted and killed while trying to escape. 
</p>
<p>128. The Commission is of the view that the attack on the convoy was a target of opportunity, 
rather than a pre-planned operation.<b>97</b>  This attack clearly was disproportionate, violated the 
principle of distinction, and cannot be justified on the basis of the convoy being a military 
objective.  Moreover, the people of Marwaheen had been ordered by loudspeaker to leave town, 
although the routes for escaping were obstructed and the warning time given by IDF was 
extremely short.  IDF command headquarters in the area must have known of the warning that 
had been issued and should then have ensured that orders were given throughout the chain of 
command to look out for evacuating civilians and ensure their safe passage.  This was evidently 
not done and resulted in the convoy attack.  The experience would have been terrifying, 
especially for the children, and demonstrates blatant disrespect for the civilians.  The warning 
given by IDF could in no way be considered &#8220;effective&#8221; as required by international 
humanitarian law.<b>98</b> 
</p>
<p>129. Another example of an attack on a convoy took place on 11 August 2006 when 
about 600 vehicles left the village of Marjayoun for the Bekaa Valley.<b>99</b>  IDF had entered the city 
on 10 August and occupied the Lebanese military barracks.  They asked the Lebanese military to 
evacuate the population but did not provide any guarantee for their safety.  According to 
testimonies collected by the Commission, on 11 August at 0800 hours, village inhabitants 
gathered in the main square.  At 1540 hours, the convoy, which included all patients and staff 
from Marjayoun hospital, left town and reached the Western Bekaa at 2130 hours.<b>100</b>  On 
departure from Marjayoun and up to Hasbaye, the convoy was escorted by two armoured 
personnel carriers (APCs) from UNIFIL, one at the front and one at the end of the convoy.<b>101</b>  At 
2215 hours, around 15 vehicles were hit by the shelling.<b>102</b>  Eight persons were killed, including 
an engineer from the hospital and a Lebanese Red Cross volunteer trying to reach one of the 
wounded persons. 
</p>
<p>130. In a communiqu&#233; of 12 August 2006, an IDF spokesman justified the attack on the 
convoy and argued that: IDF identified suspicious movement along a route forbidden for travel 
which had been used by Hezbollah to transport rockets and other weaponry.  Acting on the 
suspicion that these were Hezbollah terrorists transporting weaponry an aerial attack was carried </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>out.  Further inquiry into the incident following information from UNIFIL has concluded that the 
movement was of a convoy that had left Marjayoun earlier.  It is important to note that a request 
for the passage of the convoy was submitted to IDF coordination apparatuses prior to its 
departure and was not authorized.  Furthermore a curfew<b>103</b> has been placed on any 
non-authorized vehicular movement south of the Litani River several days ago.<b>104</b> 
</p>
<p>131. This justification raises major problems.  The curfew imposed by IDF south of the Litani 
River had the effect of stripping civilians travelling in the south of their protected status and 
turning them into military targets.  The fact that a civilian stayed or moved within that zone did 
not mean that he was participating directly in hostilities.  The precautions taken by IDF fell far 
below the requirements as set forth in international humanitarian law, which would have 
required a careful assessment, taking into account the conditions governing this particular 
situation, as to whether there were sufficient indications to warrant an attack. 
</p>
<p>132. Again in Marwaheen, another convoy faced an IDF attack on 16 July.  Further to the 
request made by the IDF for the population to leave town, on 15 July UNIFIL discussed plans 
for an evacuation convoy.  On 16 July an IDF clearance was obtained and the UNIFIL convoy of 
four buses, four or five trucks, two APCs and two Military Police vehicles left Naqoura at 
0715 hours, reaching Marwaheen at 0900 hours.  By 1100 hours, the local people who wanted to 
leave were ready and UNIFIL Naqoura had approved the additional evacuation of people from 
the village of Um al Tut, near Marwaheen.  By 1115, when the UNIFIL convoy had reached the 
Military Observers patrol base, UNIFIL Operations informed the convoy that IDF clearance had 
been revoked and the Military Observers suggested that the convoy return to the village.  At 
about 1300 hours, two rockets were launched towards Israel, from a distance from the village. 
</p>
<p>133. At approximately 1400 hours, UNIFIL Operations informed the convoy that they had 
obtained new clearance from IDF.  The first vehicle had reached a house across the street from 
the mosque, when a first round hit the roof of the house, ricocheted and fell in front of the 
vehicle.  In all, six rounds hit the same house.<b>105</b>  People then got out of the buses and gathered in 
the central square for protection.  A report was made to UNIFIL Operations to inform IDF and 
request immediate cessation of fire.  After 10-30 minutes, a second attack took place, including 
another six to seven smoke shell rounds launched around the same house.  Again, a report was 
sent to UNIFIL Operations.  At about 1730 hours, the convoy was able to leave for Tyre.  One 
old man succumbed to a heart attack as a result of the choking smoke.  No one else was hurt in 
the incident. 
</p>
<p>134. Smoke shells of this type are designed to provide a smoke screen for troops or tanks, 
rather than to kill.  This attack appears to be an attempt to panic the civilians.  There is no 
military justification for such an action. 
</p><p>135. The Commission notes that civilian convoys have repeatedly been the target of military 
attacks.  It is clear that IDF must have known that these convoys were not a legitimate military 
target, as they either had asked the civilian population to leave (Marwaheen) or were present 
when the convoy left (Marjayoun).  Even if there were Hezbollah members among the civilians 
who left the villages in convoys, this does not justify the attacks as they would be utterly 
disproportionate and beyond any concept of military necessity or the principle of distinction. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Attacks on infrastructure and other objects 
</b>136. During the conflict major damage was inflicted on civilian infrastructure<b>106</b>.  According 
to the Government of Lebanon, 32 &#8220;vital points&#8221; were targeted by IDF.  These include for 
example, the Port of Beirut where the radar was hit.  The Commission was told by the Managing 
Director of the Port that the radar was used for ship navigation tracking, and not for military 
purposes.  In addition, the modern lighthouse of Beirut was put out of use by a strike on 15 July.  
The airport of Beirut also suffered severe damage to its five runways<b>107</b> and fuel tanks.  This 
major destruction occurred during the first days of the conflict. 
137. A total of 109 bridges and 137 roads (445,000 sq. km.) were damaged during the conflict, 
including some bridges which had been repaired once already.<b>108</b>  The Commission heard 
evidence in Qana of the disproportionate use of weapons by IDF.  In one incident, for example, 
IDF rockets were fired at a small bridge, three times with two rockets at a time, while the bridge 
was a simple construction used by shepherds. 
</p>
<p>138. The destruction of the land transportation network had a huge impact on humanitarian 
assistance and on the free movement of displaced civilians, notably those who had been ordered 
by IDF to leave their villages.  The Commission was told by humanitarian workers that on many 
occasions their movement was limited not only because the Israeli authorities did not consent to 
it but also because the roads and bridges were severely damaged.  On many occasions this 
destruction occurred after humanitarian organizations had obtained a clearance from Israel to use 
these roads.  In the same vein, the Commission was told that the evacuation of civilians was 
particularly hampered by the destruction of roads and bridges.  This was for example the case for 
the convoy of Marjayoun as part of the road had been heavily bombed and therefore the progress 
of the convoy was dramatically delayed (the convoy left at about 1600 hours and reached 
Western Bekaa at 2130 hours). 
</p>
<p>139. Water facilities were destroyed or damaged during this conflict in many parts of the 
country.  The Commission saw numerous water tanks damaged in Chihine, and on the road 
between Taibe and Qantara.  In Khiyam, the Commission saw evidence of damage to pipes.  
Numerous water towers had been hit by a direct fire weapon- probably a tank round.  Most had a 
single round through them, sufficient to empty their content.  Israeli soldiers were stationed in 
Froun, in order to control the water source.  This led to a decrease of water distribution to the 
villages located in the Qada of Marjayoun, south of Taibe.<b>109</b>  In fact fears of lack of water were 
one of the reasons why civilians left their villages.<b>110</b>  In Beirut, in the Christian neighbourhood 
of Achrafieh, on 19 July, IDF bombed two engineering vehicles used to drill water.<b>111</b> 
</p>
<p>140. Transmission stations used by Lebanese television and radio were also the targets of 
bombing.  A clear distinction has to be made between the Hezbollah-backed Al-Manar television 
station and others.  While the first is clearly a tool used by Hezbollah in order to broadcast 
propaganda, nothing similar can be said regarding the others.  IDF repeatedly targeted Al-Manar 
at the beginning of the conflict, notably its headquarters in the Beirut suburb of Haret-Hreik. 
</p>
<p>141. In addition to Al-Manar, Future TV, New TV, and the Lebanese Broadcasting 
Corporation (LBCI) suffered damages to their infrastructure.  The transmission and 
communication towers of T&#233;l&#233; Lumi&#232;re, a Christian television station founded in 1991, were 
damaged in six different locations.<b>112</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>142. Regarding the Al-Manar TV station, Israel said that it has for many years served as the 
main tool for propaganda and incitement by Hezbollah, and has also helped the organization 
recruit people into its ranks.<b>113</b>  The Commission wishes to recall that the fact that al-Manar 
television broadcasts propaganda in support of Hezbollah&#8217;s attacks against Israel does not render 
it a legitimate military objective, unless it is used in a way that makes an &#8220;effective contribution 
to military action&#8221; and its destruction in the circumstances at the time offers &#8220;a definite military 
advantage.&#8221;  The Commission points out that a TV station can be a legitimate target, for 
instance, if it called upon its audience to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity or 
genocide.<b>114</b>  If it is merely disseminating propaganda to generate support for the war effort, it is 
not a legitimate target.  The Commission was not provided with any evidence of this &#8220;effective 
contribution to military action&#8221;.  The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemned 
this attack in a press release of 14 July 2006, &#8220;warning that the attack follows a pattern of media 
targeting that threatens the lives of media staff, violates international law and endorses the use of 
violence to stifle dissident media&#8221;.<b>115</b> 
</p>
<p>143. With regard to attacks on other stations, nothing was said by the Israeli authorities and 
official reports only mention the destruction of the Hezbollah communications infrastructure.  
For these TV stations, links with Hezbollah could not be documented by the Israeli authorities 
and the Commission could not find any evidence in that regard.  IFJ released a second 
communiqu&#233; on 24 July 2006 to condemn Israeli attacks on the media after one media worker of 
the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation was killed in a bombing by IDF in Fatka<b>116</b> and two 
others were wounded in a separate strike.<b>117</b> 
</p>
<p>144. The economic infrastructure was also targeted by aerial bombardment.  The Lebanese 
Minister of Labour provided the Commission with a list of 127 factories hit by IDF strikes.  
Among them, Liban Lait (dairy products) in Baalbeck; Maliban (glass bottles) in Tanayel; and 
Plastimed (medical supplies) in Tyre.  The Commission witnessed the wreckage of the Liban 
Lait factory. 
</p>
<p>145. The agricultural sector was also particularly hit, notably in South Lebanon.  Agricultural 
land was burned, numerous crops were destroyed, and poultry stocks were severely affected.  
Tourism was severely affected as the season was lost. 
</p>
<p>146. Israel justified its attacks on the civilian infrastructure by invoking their hypothetical use 
by Hezbollah.  For example, regarding Beirut International Airport, Israel said that it served 
Hezbollah to re-supply itself with weapons and ammunition.  It also said it was a response to 
reports that it was the intention of Hezbollah to fly the kidnapped Israelis out of Lebanon.  
However, it underlined that in its operation at Beirut Airport IDF was careful not to damage the 
central facilities of the airport, including the radar and control towers, allowing the airport to 
continue to control international flights over its airspace.<b>118</b>  The same arguments were used 
regarding roads and bridges.<b>119</b> 
</p>
<p>147. The Commission appreciates that some infrastructure may have had &#8220;dual use&#8221; but this 
argument cannot be put forward for each individual object directly hit during this conflict.  Even 
if some claims were true, the collateral harm to the Lebanese population caused by these attacks 
would have to be weighed against their military advantage, to make sure that the rule on 
proportionality was being observed.  For example, cutting the roads between Tyre and Beirut for 
several days and preventing UNIFIL from putting up a provisional bridge cannot be justified by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law.  It jeopardized the lives of many civilians and prevented 
humanitarian assistance from reaching them.  Injured persons needing to be transferred to 
hospitals north of Tyre could not get the medical care needed. 
</p>
<p>148. By using this argument, IDF simply changed the status of all civilian objects by making 
them legitimate targets because they might be used by Hezbollah.  The principle of distinction 
requires the Parties to the conflict to carefully assess the situation of each location they intend to 
hit to determine whether there is sufficient justification to warrant an attack.  Further, the 
Commission is convinced that damage inflicted to some infrastructure was done for the sake of 
destruction. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Precautionary measures in attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Warnings:  leaflets, phone, text and loudspeaker messages 
</b>149. From mid-July on, IDF began warning villagers in the south to evacuate their towns and 
villages.  The warnings sere given by leaflets dropped by aircraft, through recorded messages to 
telephones and by loudspeaker.  The Commission obtained examples of some of these leaflets 
(see annex VI). 
</p>
<p>150. On 25 July 2006 the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs published on its official 
website<b>120</b> the following example of a warning to Lebanese civilians to leave areas allegedly 
being used to launch rockets and not to travel by truck: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;<b>To the people of Lebanon</b> 
Pay attention to these instructions!! 
</i></p>
<p><i>The IDF will intensify its activities and will heavily bomb the entire area 
from which rockets are being launched against the State of Israel. 
<b>Anyone present in these areas is endangering his life! 
In addition, any pickup truck or truck travelling south of the Litani River 
will be suspected of transporting rockets and weapons and may be 
bombed</b>. 
</i></p>
<p><i>You must know that anyone travelling in a pickup truck or truck is 
endangering his life. 
The State of Israel.&#8221;</i> 
</p>
<p>151. International humanitarian law requires that warring parties give &#8220;effective advance 
warning&#8221; of attacks which may affect the civilian population.  It is also generally accepted that a 
warning is not required when circumstances do not permit, such as in cases where the element of 
surprise is essential.&#8221;<b>121</b>  State practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international 
law.  Obligations with respect to the principle of distinction and the conduct of hostilities remain </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>applicable even if civilians remain in the zone of operations after a warning has been given.  
Threats in the past, for example that all remaining civilians would be considered liable to attack, 
have been condemned and withdrawn.<b>122</b> 
</p>
<p>152. International humanitarian law also prohibits &#8220;acts or threats of violence the primary 
purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population&#8221;.<b>123</b>  Statements calling for the 
evacuation of areas that are not genuine warnings, but are intended to frighten or cause panic 
among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety, could 
fall under this prohibition. 
</p>
<p>153. Military planning staff should pay strict attention to the requirement for any warning to 
be <i>&#8220;effective&#8221;</i>.  The timing of the warning is of importance.  In some cases IDF is reported to 
have dropped leaflets or given loudspeaker warnings<b>124</b> only two hours before a threatened 
attack.  Having given a warning, the actual physical possibility to react to it must be considered. 
</p>
<p>154. As the High Commissioner for Human Rights has pointed out, &#8220;Many people are simply 
unable to leave southern Lebanon because they have not transport, because roads have been 
destroyed, because they are ill or elderly, because they must care for others who are physically 
unable to make the journey, or because they simply have nowhere to go&#8221;<b>125</b>. 
155. Also of great concern was the physical danger they might face if they heeded the warning 
and took to the roads.  There were number of civilians who, when warned by IDF to evacuate, 
did so only to be attacked on their way out.  On 15 July, for example, a number of families fled 
the southern Lebanese village of Marwaheen after IDF warned them to evacuate.  On the road 
leading to the coast through Chamaa the convoy was attacked, leaving 23 dead (see detailed 
report earlier).  On 7 August, Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets over southern Lebanon with the 
following wording: &#8220;Any vehicle of any kind travelling south of the Litani River will be 
bombarded, on suspicion of transporting rockets, military equipment and terrorists.  Anyone who 
travels in any vehicle is placing his life in danger&#8221;.<b>126</b>  This obviously made further evacuation 
from the area extremely difficult if not impossible. 
</p>
<p>156. If a military force is really serious in its attempts to warn civilians to evacuate because of 
impending danger, it should take into account how they expect the civilian population to carry 
out the instruction and not just drop paper messages from an aircraft. 
</p><p>157. To be truly &#8220;effective&#8221;, the message should also give the civilians clear time slots for the 
evacuation linked to guaranteed safe humanitarian exit corridors that they should use.  Military 
staff should ensure that civilians obeying evacuation orders are not targeted on their evacuation 
routes. 
</p>
<p>158. A warning to evacuate does not relieve the military of their ongoing obligation to &#8220;take 
all feasible precautions&#8221; to protect civilians who remain behind, and this includes their property<i>.  
</i>By remaining in place, the people and their property do not suddenly become military objectives 
which can be attacked<i>.  </i>The law requires the cancelling of an attack when it becomes apparent 
that the target is civilian or that the civilian loss would be disproportionate to the expected 
military gain.<b>127</b>  Official statements issued during the conflict by Israeli authorities cast doubt on </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>whether in fact they were fully aware of these obligations<i>.  </i>For example, as reported on BBC 
news on 27 July,<b>128</b> Israeli Justice Minister Haim Raimon said: &#8220;that in order to prevent 
casualties among Israeli soldiers battling Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, villages 
should be flattened by the Israeli air force before ground troops moved in&#8221;<i>.  </i>He added that Israel 
had given the civilians of southern Lebanon ample time to quit the area and therefore anyone still 
remaining there could be considered a Hezbollah supporter<i>.  </i>&#8220;All those now in south Lebanon 
are terrorists who are related in some way to Hezbollah&#8221;, Mr<i>.</i> Ramon said. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Propaganda leaflets and messages 
</b>159. In Beirut and other places, leaflets were also dropped but in the main they were of an 
anti-Hezbollah propaganda nature rather than warnings<i>.  </i>The same applies to the 
computer-generated telephone calls many people received.  An example of this type of leaflet is 
as follows and further examples given in annex VI<i>.</i>  IDF tells the people of Lebanon that they are 
in conflict with the Hezbollah terrorists, not the people of Lebanon, and that they should not 
allow themselves to be used as human shields (3 August 2006):<b>129</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<b><i>To the people of Lebanon</i></b>  
<i>IDF forces operated with daring and force in Baalbek, the centre of 
operations of the Hezbollah terror band, in the framework of its 
defense of the citizens of the State of Israel and the return of the 
abducted IDF soldiers. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Know that the IDF will continue to send its long arm to wherever 
Hezbollah terrorists are found, in order to strike at them forcefully 
and with determination, and to neutralize their options to execute 
their criminal ideology against the citizens of Israel. 
Citizens of Lebanon, 
The IDF forces are not acting against the Lebanese people, but 
against the Hezbollah terrorists, and will continue to act as long as it 
deems necessary. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Do not allow Hezbollah elements to hold you as prisoners and use 
you as a human shield for the sake of foreign interests. 
The State of Israel.</i>&#8221; 
</p>
<p>160. It also appears that IDF dropped propaganda leaflets after the conflict.  An example given 
to the Commission by the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre (UNMACC)<b>130</b> is as 
follows: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<b>To the citizens of South Lebanon</b> </p>
<p><i>Now that you have returned to your villages, and you are facing a big 
crisis: destruction, devastation and death 
</i></p>
<p><b><i>how did you arrive at this situation? 
</i></b></p>
<p><i>Nasrallah claims that it is his right to kidnap Israeli soldiers - was 
this a worthwhile decision? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Nasrallah claims that he is not serving the interests of Iran and Syria 
- is that true? 
</i></p>
<p><i>Nasrallah claims that he is a deterrent for Israel - is that true? 
<b>Was all this worth the price you paid? 
</b></i></p>
<p><i>Be aware that the Israeli Defense Force will come back and act with 
the required force any time the terrorist elements carry out their 
operations against the citizens of the State of Israel from inside 
Lebanese territory. 
</i></p>
<p><i>You have the possibility to prevent this by bringing calm, security, 
and prosperity in your region. 
</i></p>
<p><i>State of Israel&#8221;</i> 
</p>
<p>161. These leaflets and messages were not warnings<i>.  </i>They were of a propaganda nature and 
constituted undue interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Attacks on medical facilities 
</b></p>
<p>162. The Commission was able to verify that IDF had carried out attacks on a number of 
medical facilities in Lebanon, despite their protected character.  An assessment by the WHO and 
the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health on the damage inflicted on primary health care centres 
and hospitals<b>131</b> shows, for example, that 50 per cent of outpatient facilities were either 
completely destroyed or severely damaged, while one of the region&#8217;s three hospitals sustained 
severe damage.  This study also reflects serious shortages of fuel, power supply and drinking 
water.<b>132</b>  The Commission was told in Tyre that hospitals were not short of medication, since 
they all had stocked up for a few months.  However, hospital authorities informed the 
Commission that they would not have been able to provide food and blood without the help of 
Palestinian refugees, who volunteered for blood donations and were a major food provider for 
the hospitals during the conflict.<b>133</b> </p>
<p>163. In Tibnin, the governmental hospital showed signs of being hit by direct fire weapons, 
possibly a tank shell or a missile strike from a helicopter.  The Commission saw at least five 
direct hits on the hospital&#8217;s infrastructure.  According to reports received by the Commission, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on 13 August, the immediate area of the hospital was the object of a cluster bomb attack - just 
before the ceasefire.  According to these reports, the attack took place while some 2,000 civilians 
were sheltered in the hospital. 
</p>
<p>164. IDF would know about the hospital, built on a hill and which stands out for miles around.  
Whether it had a Red Cross flag flying on its roof is relatively unimportant.  In fact the small flag 
that the Commission saw flying on the hospital would be indiscernible from the air and possibly 
from the ground.  This is in any case irrelevant because of the facts listed above. 
</p>
<p>165. According to the information gathered, the Commission finds that from a military 
perspective there was no justification in either the direct fire on the hospital or the cluster bomb 
attack.  The Commission did not find any evidence that the hospital was being used in any way 
for military purposes.  Furthermore, Israeli intelligence drones, which were extensively used, 
would have clearly shown that civilians were sheltering in the hospital. 
</p>
<p>166. In Baalbeck, the Commission saw another example of a hospital that was the target of 
IDF military operations.  The hospital Dar-el-Hekma is a private charitable institution affiliated 
to the Imam Khomeini Foundation.  On 1 August, at around 2130 hours, Israeli troops landed in 
the close vicinity and entered the hospital after having hit all lights on the surrounding fence.  At 
the time of the attack, the hospital had no patients but was functioning with out-patients services.  
Only 10 staff members were present at that time; one was killed and two were injured.  Once in 
the building, the soldiers went into all rooms but one and destroyed doors, windows, computers, 
furniture, a safe, and medical equipment.  Some patients&#8217; files were taken from the archives, 
stacked in a room and burned.  Deeds related to the hospital were removed from the safe.  
According to reports received by the Commission, Israeli soldiers stayed for about seven hours 
in the building. 
</p>
<p>167. The Commission did not find any information as to whether the hospital was used by 
Hezbollah fighters.  There is no justification for the damage and destruction of medical 
equipment, furniture, official documents or patient files, each of them being purely civilian 
objects.  Furthermore, the Commission finds that the origin of the hospital&#8217;s funding, or the 
possible links between some staff members and Hezbollah do not, in any way, justify 
considering this institution as a military target. 
</p>
<p>168. The Commission came across cases of medical institutions which sustained collateral 
damage due to military actions that occurred in the close vicinity of their premises.  For example, 
in Marjayoun, while the hospital was not directly hit, its electrical and electronic equipment was 
damaged due to the destruction of the electricity network.<b>134</b> 
</p>
<p>169. In Tyre, authorities from the Najem and the Jabal Amel Hospitals informed the 
Commission about two occasions on which Israeli troops landed in the vicinity of the 
hospitals.<b>135</b>  In both cases, patients and staff members were brought to the basement for 
protection.  Physical collateral damage was reported in the Jabal Amel Hospital due to the 
bombing of two houses located 50 metres away from the hospital.  Collateral damage was also 
reported at the Najem Hospital. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>170. According to international humanitarian law, medical units exclusively assigned to 
medical purposes must be respected in all circumstances.  They lose their protection if they are 
being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy.<b>136</b>  In this 
respect, the Commission finds that medical facilities were both the object of unjustified direct 
attacks and the victim of collateral damage.  The Commission did not find any explanation by 
the Israeli authorities that could justify their military operations that affected, directly or 
indirectly, protected medical facilities.  Israel&#8217;s general explanation that all infrastructure hit was 
used by the Hezbollah is insufficient to justify IDF&#8217;s violation of its obligation to abstain from 
carrying out attacks against protected medical facilities. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Medical personnel and access to medical and humanitarian relief 
</b></p>
<p>171. The Commission notes that the Red Cross Movement was not spared during the conflict, 
as indicated in several incidents reported by ICRC and LRC.<b>137</b>  In some cases, medical 
personnel were the victim of collateral damage. 
</p>
<p>172. The Commission took note that LRC reported nine different incidents involving 
ambulances and five others involving medical facilities that were targeted.  In total, LRC had 
one volunteer killed, 14 staff members injured, three ambulances destroyed and four others 
damaged; one medical facility destroyed and four others damaged.  The following three incidents 
involving LRC ambulances illustrate the Commission&#8217;s findings. 
</p>
<p>173. On 23 July, at 2315 hours, two LRC vehicles were hit by munitions in Qana.  The 
two vehicles were clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem on the rooftop.  The incident 
happened while first-aid workers were transferring wounded patients from one ambulance to 
another.  According to LRC reports and witness&#8217; accounts, one ambulance left Tibnin with 
three wounded people and three first-aid workers on board.  The second ambulance left Tyre 
with three first-aid workers on board.  Both vehicles met in Qana in order to transfer the patients 
from one ambulance to the other.<b>138</b>  As the Tyre ambulance was about to leave, it was hit by 
Israeli missiles.  A few minutes later, as the personnel of the Tyre ambulance tried to call for 
assistance, the Tibnin ambulance was also hit by a missile.  The missile struck the ambulance in 
the middle of the Red Cross painted on the roof.  LRC staff succeeded in calling ICRC, which 
managed to contact IDF to request that the attack be stopped.  The Red Cross workers hid for 
around two hours, unable to provide assistance to the injured persons who were still in the 
vehicles.  As a result, nine people, including six Red Cross volunteers, were wounded.<b>139</b> 
</p>
<p>174. The Commission received information of another incident, which took place 
on 11 August, at 1750 hours.  An ambulance with medical supplies on board was shelled by IDF 
on the road between Ain el Mazrab and Tibnin.  A first strike hit the front of the vehicle, while a 
second shell hit the roof.  The ambulance exploded and burned completely.  Fortunately, the 
two LRC staff members were only superficially injured. 
175. On the night of 11 August, people fleeing by car the area of Marjayoun came under fire 
from Israeli aircraft.  Six dead and 32 wounded were evacuated by LRC to nearby hospitals.  
Among the fatalities was one LRC first-aid volunteer, who was killed while assisting a wounded 
person.  An engineer from the Marjayoun hospital was also killed in the same incident.<b>140</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>176. In all three cases described above, LRC was carrying out protection activities, as defined 
in the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  The vehicles used were clearly marked with the Red Cross 
emblem and their operations were done in full respect of international humanitarian law rules.  
The Commission did not find any evidence showing that these attacks were linked in any way to 
Hezbollah military activities.  The Commission finds, therefore, that all these incidents constitute 
a deliberate and unjustified targeting of protected medical vehicles and personnel. 
177. The Lebanese Civil Defence was also the target of attacks by IDF.<b>141</b>  The Commission 
was informed that, during the armed conflict, one volunteer was killed and 59 other members of 
the Civil Defence were injured (11 staff and 48 volunteers).  A total of 48 stations were 
damaged, as well as many vehicles.<b>142</b> 
</p>
<p>178. Beside direct attacks on medical and relief personnel, the Commission received various 
testimonies regarding the obstacles and difficulties the medical and humanitarian relief personnel 
had to face in carrying out their activities.  The Commission received a number of testimonies 
from humanitarian organizations, hospitals and other medical centre personnel and from civilians 
confirming that access to civilians who needed medical care and humanitarian assistance was 
difficult and many times impossible due to IDF imposed constraints. 
</p>
<p>179. For example, WFP was confronted early in the conflict by serious movement and 
deployment limitations, including cases of close firings against its humanitarian convoys.<b>143</b>  
Although no WFP convoy was directly hit, two security incidents occurred next to the same 
convoy on 6 August 2006.  According to a WFP report &#8220;[O]n the way to Tyre, some 15 km north 
of the city, a van travelling in the opposite direction was hit by a missile, apparently fired from 
the air.  Both occupants of the vehicle were killed.  There was no damage or injuries to the 
United Nations convoy.  As the empty trucks were returning to Beirut, another vehicle, some 
30 meters ahead of the convoy, was hit by a missile.  The driver, who was apparently alone in 
the vehicle, was killed.&#8221;<b>144</b>  In view of the difficulties to provide humanitarian assistance to 
civilians in need, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator called for an end to attacks in 
Lebanon on civilian infrastructure and to measures which slowed down or hindered the 
distribution of humanitarian supplies to thousands of displaced persons.<b>145</b> 
</p>
<p>180. Further evidence of the difficulties faced by humanitarian agencies can be seen in the 
humanitarian cargo movement notification procedure.<b>146</b>  According to this procedure, no 
humanitarian convoy could move without the Israeli authorities&#8217; express authorization (so-called 
&#8220;concurrence&#8221; mechanism).  In fact, many convoys were not given authorization by IDF.  In 
many cases, while authorization was granted, IDF bombed roads which, due to the advance 
notification process, it knew were to be used by the convoys.  Consequently, numerous 
humanitarian assistance movements had to be cancelled.  In a press communiqu&#233; released on 
10 August, WFP stated that &#8220;a combination of 70 bridges destroyed and the denial of 
&#8220;concurrence on safety&#8221; by IDF for aid convoys was crippling efforts of WFP, on behalf of the 
entire humanitarian community, to organize overland transport of relief items, including food for 
one quarter of the Lebanese population displaced from their homes.&#8221;<b>147</b> 
</p>
<p>181. Efforts undertaken by humanitarian agencies to ease access for humanitarian relief but 
were often unsuccessful.  On 28 July, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, 
Jan Egeland, called for a 72-hour pause in the fighting to facilitate aid efforts, but Israel rejected 
the call the following day.<b>148</b>  On 30 July, the Security Council also urged all parties to grant </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>immediate and unlimited access to humanitarian assistance.<b>149</b>  Despite the announcement made 
by a United States of America State Department spokesperson on 30 July 2006 that Israel had 
agreed to a 48-hour suspension of aerial bombardments,<b>150</b> Israel continued with its military 
operations in the South, thus impeding humanitarian agencies&#8217; access to locations south of the 
Litani River.<b>151</b> 
</p>
<p>182. The difficulties encountered by humanitarian relief organizations applied equally in 
relation to medical care.  All medical staff met by the Commission underlined this aspect.  
Indeed, many injured persons who could have been brought to hospital or had access to medical 
care could not do so due to IDF imposed movement limitations.  As a result, many patients who 
suffered from light injuries had their condition deteriorate as time passed.<b>152</b>  On various 
occasions the lack of timely medical assistance resulted in the death of patients.  These problems 
of access to medical care are confirmed in the data provided by the Jabal Amal hospital in Tyre.  
Indeed, in the two days after the cease fire it received 80 patients.  All of them were injured 
persons who could not be reached during the conflict. 
</p>
<p>183. In Qana, for example, the Commission was informed that several persons died because of 
lack of medicines.  Among the victims, the brother of the town&#8217;s mayor died due to the lack of 
insulin to treat his diabetes.  In Chihine, the Commission was informed that on 8 August, one 
woman was killed and another injured by IDF when they raided their home.  IDF left the 
wounded woman in the house, unable to get medical attention due to the intense fighting.  She 
could only be treated after the entry into force of the ceasefire, when LRC was finally allowed to 
enter the town.<b>153</b>  
</p>
<p>184. ICRC reported on several occasions the difficulties faced by LRC and ICRC to reach 
people in need of assistance.  In a press briefing on 19 July 2006, Mr. Pierre Kr&#228;henb&#252;hl, ICRC 
Director of Operations, stated that the principal medical problem within Lebanon was finding 
ways to evacuate patients to hospitals.<b>154</b>  The ICRC President, Mr. Jakob Kellenberger, also 
raised this issue when visiting Lebanon and Israel in August 2006.<b>155</b>  Christopher Stokes, head 
of mission for M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) in Lebanon, said on 1 August 2006 that the 
&#8220;concept of humanitarian corridors has been used as a &#8220;kind of alibi&#8221; because in effect there is 
no real access for humanitarian organizations in the south&#8221;.<b>156</b> 
</p>
<p>185. The Commission was also informed that ships loaded with humanitarian assistance that 
had left the port of Larnaca, Cyprus, were not able to enter Lebanese ports until late in the 
conflict both because of the blockade<b>157</b> as well as because of delays in obtaining the required 
authorization from the Israeli authorities. 
</p>
<p>186. Under international humanitarian law, &#8220;humanitarian relief personnel must be respected 
and protected&#8221;.<b>158</b>  Furthermore, &#8220;the parties to the conflict must allow and facilitate rapid and 
unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, which is impartial in character 
and conducted without any adverse distinction, subject to their right of control&#8221;.<b>159</b>  These rules 
apply whether the armed conflict is international or non-international.  In addition, the 
Security Council, as it did for this armed conflict, had called on many occasions on all parties to 
an armed conflict to respect and ensure respect for the security and safety of humanitarian relief 
personnel.  In its resolution 1296 (2000) on protection of civilians in armed conflicts, the 
Security Council called upon all parties, including non-State actors, &#8220;to ensure the safety, 
security and freedom of movement&#8221; of humanitarian relief personnel.  The issue of denial or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>obstruction of access to vulnerable populations by humanitarian missions has been raised in each 
of the five reports submitted by the Secretary-General to the Security Council further to that 
resolution.  In his last report, the Secretary-General urged &#8220;the Council to consider the 
application of targeted sanctions in situations where access for humanitarian operations is denied 
as a result of specific attacks on those involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance&#8221;.<b>160</b> 
</p>
<p>187. The Commission understood from all testimonies it received from a wide range of actors 
that free access for humanitarian assistance for people in need had not been guaranteed during 
the conflict.  First, the concurrence system adopted to satisfy IDF requirements was not adapted 
for an efficient humanitarian assistance.  Indeed, this procedure required from humanitarian 
agencies that they adapt their work to the way in which military operations were carried out, 
instead of giving priority to providing humanitarian assistance.  On many occasions this meant 
that clearance for convoy movements was not granted at all, or was given with such delay that 
the operation was no longer possible.  In addition, on a number of occasions IDF conducted 
hostilities either directly against relief assistance movements or indirectly, so that free and safe 
movement of humanitarian relief personnel was no longer guaranteed. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Attacks on religious property and places of worship 
</b></p>
<p>188. During its visit to south Lebanon, the Commission saw damage caused by IDF attacks on 
a number of places of worship.  For instance, the Commission found that the village of Qauzah, a 
Christian village close to the Blue Line, had been occupied by IDF.  Most of the villagers had 
left during the conflict but 10 persons remained.  Of particular note was the damage caused to 
the Christian Maronite church, which was damaged by bombing in the early days of the conflict 
and was later occupied by Israeli forces and used as its base.  The roof had been badly damaged 
and there was a large shell hole in the front right corner of the wall.  The damage to the church&#8217;s 
roof and wall of the church appeared to have been caused by a tank round.  Furthermore, during 
their 16-day occupation IDF vandalized the church, breaking religious statues, leaving behind 
garbage and other waste.  The Commission saw a statue of the Virgin Mary that had been 
smashed and left in the church grounds.  When the villagers returned, they found the church had 
been wrecked, the church benches and confessional box smashed.   Silver items remained but 
had been deliberately broken.  There were sandbagged defensive positions within the church 
grounds.  There was no evidence to suggest fighting in and around the church to capture it.  It 
therefore appears that IDF simply took it over.  The damage was either caused on their 
occupation of the village or on their departure.   
</p>
<p>189. The Commission also visited Debel, another Christian village that was partially occupied 
by IDF.  Tank shell damage was visible on the main Christian church building, as well as on the 
roof of the mosque.  Witnesses informed the Commission that six tank rounds had been fired 
against these two buildings.  They indicated that no fighters were in the buildings and that it was 
practically impossible for Hezbollah fighters to use these positions for firing rockets. 
</p>
<p>190. The Commission noticed that, in many of the towns or villages it visited or passed 
through in south Lebanon, numerous mosques and churches had been damaged or destroyed.  
For instance, the mosque in Marwaheen had impacts of shells and artillery.  Damage to these 
places of worship could also be seen in Bent J&#8217;Beil, and Aita Ech Chaab, among others.<b>161</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>191. In most of the incidents the damage to mosques or churches was only partial.  
Considering the nature of the destruction, the types of damage and vandalism caused and the use 
of some of these religious buildings and places of worship as temporary bases, it appears to the 
Commission that while there was clear intent for IDF to cause unnecessary damage to protected 
religious property and places of worship, their complete destruction was not aimed for. 
</p>
<p>192. Under international humanitarian law, religious property and places of worship are 
protected during a conflict.<b>162</b>  Most of these rules are norms of customary international law,<b>163</b> 
as confirmed by the ICJ in its advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of the nuclear 
weapons case.<b>164</b>  It is also important to stress that the Rome Statute qualifies as a war crime 
intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion.<b>165</b> 
</p>
<p><b>8.  Abduction, transfer and unlawful imprisonment of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>193. The Commission received information on persons, who bore the same name as the 
Hezbollah&#8217;s leader, arrested on Lebanese territory and then transferred to Israel before being 
released and, on several occasions, handed over to UNIFIL.  The Commission was able to meet 
with two members of the Nasrallah family who, together with three other men from the town of 
Baalbeck, had been detained by IDF.  According to their account, they were arrested and taken to 
Israel, where they were held for 20 days.  The two victims told the Commission that they were 
arrested in the middle of the night of 1 August by Israeli soldiers.  They were tightly handcuffed 
and blindfolded.  They were marched for about two hours.  They were then taken at gunpoint on 
board a helicopter to an Israeli jail.  During their detention they were subjected to cruel, 
degrading and inhuman treatment, before they were finally released and handed over to ICRC.  
When the Commission met with them, they still had visible handcuff marks on their ankles and 
wrists.<b>166</b> 
</p>
<p>194. The Commission also received information from the Parliamentary Human Rights 
Committee regarding a Christian Maronite, sympathizer of the Aoun party, who was detained in 
the town of Debel during occupation of the village by IDF.  He stated that he had been subjected 
to cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment before being released when IDF left the town.  This 
person is currently under psychological therapy for trauma from the event. 
</p>
<p>195. The Commission took note of Khiyam Rehabilitation Center for the Victims of Torture 
(KRC) memorandum<b>167</b> that includes a list of people arrested in Lebanon and transferred to 
Israel prisons.  This list also includes cases of arrests which took place after the ceasefire. 
</p>
<p>196. The Commission also met with two women who belonged to a group of women detained 
by IDF on 8 August, in the village of Chihine.  The group had taken refuge in one house when 
Israeli soldiers shot dead one of them and injured another.  The soldiers stayed about 15 minutes 
in the house, while they interrogated the women, asking them about their links with the 
Hezbollah fighters.  Then, IDF soldiers forced the women to walk barefoot and with their hands 
over their heads to another house down in the village.  Before entering this house, they were 
asked to kneel down on the street, a position in which they stayed for over 15 minutes and were 
then taken inside the house.  They heard two soldiers arguing about whether or not they should 
kill them. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>197. Under international humanitarian law, civilians must be treated humanely.<b>168</b>  Corporal 
punishment,<b>169</b> torture,<b>170</b> enforced disappearance<b>171</b> and arbitrary deprivation of liberty<b>172</b> are 
also prohibited under international humanitarian law.  In addition, these acts constitute human 
rights violations as regulated in a wide range of human rights provisions.<b>173</b>  Furthermore, torture 
and inhuman treatment, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement, constitute war 
crimes under the Rome Statute.<b>174</b> 
</p>
<p>198. The Commission expresses its utmost concern at civilians being detained on suspicion 
not backed up by any evidence.  If their names, or the fact that those civilians were found in 
locations where Hezbollah had influence or were once present, were the basis for their detention, 
it clearly constitutes a violation of the minimum standards laid down in both international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law.  In addition, the Commission is concerned 
about reports of detainees being subjected to cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment.  This is 
even more obvious with regard to children and women, who, given the circumstances of their 
arrests, could not be suspected of being Hezbollah fighters or of having taken direct part in 
hostilities in any way. 
</p>
<p><b>9.  Internal displacement of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>199. One of the most striking aspects of this conflict is the massive displacement of civilians 
which took place during the hostilities.  According to Government estimates, 974,184 people - 
nearly one quarter of the population - were displaced between 12 July and 14 August, with 
approximately 735,000 seeking shelter within Lebanon and 230,000 abroad.<b>175</b>  Up to one half of 
the displaced were children.  These figures must be considered against the demographic reality in 
Lebanon, where many people had already been displaced as a result of previous conflicts and 
communities still were in the process of recovery and rebuilding.  The figures also include the 
secondary displacement of approximately 16,000 Palestinian refugees.<b>176</b>  
</p>
<p>200. During the conflict about 142,397 internally displaced persons were accommodated in 
schools,<b>177</b> while over 600,000 sought shelter with families, friends or in other temporary 
accommodation and, in some cases, in open spaces such as parks.  As a result of the massive 
destruction of houses and other civilian infrastructure, displaced individuals and families were 
forced to live in crowded and often insecure conditions with limited access to safe drinking 
water, food, sanitation, electricity and health services.  Other reports suggested an increased 
incidence of respiratory diseases and diarrhoea in schools and public areas during the period of 
displacement.<b>178</b>  It should be noted that the displacement crisis triggered by the conflict, as well 
as the serious displacement-related protection concerns, may have led additionally to a 
humanitarian crisis were it not for the families, communities and organizations in Lebanon 
which hosted and/or supported many of the displaced during and after the conflict. 
</p>
<p>201. The Commission was not able to carry out a full analysis of the impact of displacement 
due to a lack of detailed information.  It is clear, however, that the greatest impact of the conflict 
was felt by those living in areas already affected by poverty, including the urban suburbs of 
south Beirut, villages in the South, and some rural districts.<b>179</b>  According to United Nations 
estimates, up to 70 per cent of the total number of IDPs were housed in temporary 
accommodation in Beirut.  In addition, some individuals who had fled north of the Litani river </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>seeking safe shelter with family or other members of the community were affected a second time 
by IDF bombardments.  The Commission received reliable information and gathered witness 
testimonies in relation to two such incidents, in Ghazieh and Chiyah districts respectively.   
</p>
<p>202. Until the last days of the conflict, Ghazieh was seen as a safe haven for displaced 
civilians coming from the South and, according to the mayor, over 10,000 displaced people 
arrived in the town over the course of the conflict.  According to witness testimonies, on Monday 
7 August at around 0800 hours the town was attacked by Israeli air strikes.  Several buildings 
were seriously damaged and at least three houses were completely destroyed by direct hits.  
Roads and bridges were also badly damaged, resulting in the isolation of Ghazieh from the main 
points of access into and out of town.  According to one witness testimony, eight people were 
killed in one attack on a residential building, while another victim reported that he had lost his 
wife and four of his children in the bombardment.  In another attack, a house was hit directly and 
its five inhabitants, including a two-year old, two sisters and their mother, were killed when the 
structure collapsed.  In total, at least twenty-nine civilians died in Ghazieh between 6 
and 8 August. 
</p>
<p>203. In the Chiyah district of south Beirut, civilians had sought shelter with family members 
after having fled southern Lebanon earlier in the conflict.  According to testimonies collected by 
the Commission, as well as information provided by local non-governmental organisations, 
civilians had fled the areas of Deir Intar, Majadel and Touleen of Bent J&#8217;beil and sought refuge 
in Chiyah.  Others had fled to there from the Ghobeiri neighborhood of southern Beirut, which 
had been heavily hit by air bombardments.  The Commission received information in relation to 
at least one building in Chiyah occupied by people displaced from the South, which was 
destroyed by air strikes.  On 7 August 2006 at around 1945 hours, at least 39 civilians were 
killed in their homes when the Israeli air force bombarded the building in the residential 
neighborhood of Chiyah.  One witness from Chiyah explained to the Commission that her family 
had been hosting displaced people who had fled the conflict in southern Lebanon.  She stated 
that, although they felt safe, the house was extremely crowded and the children were constantly 
fighting as a result.  She confirmed other reports received by the Commission that no warning 
had been given prior to the air strike on the evening of 7 August, which destroyed the building 
next door and caused significant damage to neighbouring buildings.  The witness&#8217;s 16-year old 
son was killed when the building collapsed.  Her 13-year old son was seriously injured and her 
youngest son, a five-year old, suffers from serious post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the 
incident. 
</p>
<p>204. While a great many Lebanese were displaced during the conflict, many others were 
unable to flee either due to fear related to the ongoing attacks and insecurity; destroyed or 
damaged roads, bridges and other basic infrastructure; lack of means to secure transport; 
difficulties related to age or disability; or unwillingness to leave relatives or friends, who were 
themselves unable to leave.  Those who did not leave - in particular, women who stayed behind 
to care for the elderly and/or young children - were vulnerable to the ongoing violence and were 
further at risk due to limited access to water, electricity, food and medical care, as well as 
restricted humanitarian access.  Pregnant women suffered due to limited access to reproductive 
health services, for example, and the majority of women who gave birth immediately prior to or 
during the conflict could not ensure basic necessary items and supplies for the newborns.<b>180</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>205. Following the cessation of hostilities on 14 August, massive numbers of internally 
displaced persons and refugees returned to their areas of origin, particularly in southern Lebanon 
and the southern suburbs of Beirut.  According to UNHCR, approximately 90 per cent of those 
displaced in Lebanon during the hostilities returned to their homes, or were staying nearby, 
within days of the ceasefire.  Some, however, were displaced for a second time, having returned 
home to find their homes uninhabitable and their livelihoods destroyed.  At the time of writing 
an estimated 255,000 people were believed still to be displaced within Lebanon and abroad.<b>181</b>  
A paramount concern for the protection of the displaced returning to their homes, as well as to 
the lives of humanitarian and reconstruction workers, peacekeeping personnel, and others, is the 
constant and pernicious threat posed by unexploded ordnance, in particular cluster munitions.   
</p>
<p>206. International law prohibits forced displacement in situations of armed conflict, unless the 
security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand.<b>182</b>  As set out in the 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, before any decision is made requiring the 
displacement of persons, the authorities concerned must ensure that all feasible alternatives are 
explored in order to avoid displacement altogether.<b>183</b>  In particular, authorities and other actors 
must respect and ensure respect for their obligations under international law, including human 
rights and humanitarian law &#8220;so as to prevent and avoid conditions that might lead to 
displacement of persons&#8221;.<b>184</b>  Where no alternatives exist, all measures shall be taken to 
minimize displacement and its adverse effects.<b>185</b>  
</p>
<p>207. Much of the displacement in Lebanon was the result, either direct or indirect, of 
indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian property and infrastructure, as well as the climate 
of fear and panic among the civilian population caused by the warnings, threats and attacks by 
IDF.  Furthermore, in many cases, the attacks were disproportionate in nature and could not be 
justified on the basis of military necessity.  Taking into account all of these facts, the 
Commission notes that the displacement itself constitutes a violation of international law.   
</p>
<p>208. The Commission further recalls that displaced persons are entitled to the full protection 
afforded under international human rights and humanitarian law.  At the same time, they have 
specific needs distinct from those of the non-displaced population which must be addressed by 
specific protection and assistance measures.<b>186</b>  The Commission notes that, throughout the 
period of the conflict, IDPs often did not have access to humanitarian assistance to meet their 
needs.<b>187</b>  
</p>
<p><b>10.  Environment 
</b></p>
<p>209. Already in the early stages of the conflict, IDF attacks on Lebanese infrastructure created 
large-scale environmental damage.  The Commission considered the devastating effect the oil 
spill from the Jiyyeh power plant has had and will continue to have in the years to come over the 
flora and fauna on the Lebanese coast.  This very serious event took place when the Israeli Air 
Force bombed the fuel storage tanks of the Jiyyeh electrical power station, situated 30 km south 
of Beirut.  Due to its location by the sea, the attack resulted in an environmental disaster.  The 
plant&#8217;s damaged storage tanks gave way.  According to the Lebanese Ministry of Environment, 
between 10,000 and 15,000 tons of oil spilled into the eastern Mediterranean Sea.<b>188</b>  
A 10 km-wide oil slick covered 170 km of the Lebanese coastline. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>210. The Commission was informed by the Director of the Jiyyeh power plant that the 
compound had been subject to two different attacks.  The first strike took place on 13 July and 
was directed at one storage tank with a capacity of 10,000 tons of oil.  Oil flowed from the tank 
but was held by the external retainer wall of the power plant building, which was some 4 metres 
high.  Firefighters were able to put out the fire that ensued.  The second attack, on 15 July, was 
directed at another storage tank, with a capacity of 15,000 tons of oil.  The explosion and 
subsequent fire caused the explosion of another tank, with a capacity of 25,000 tons.  The 
explosion and the very high temperature caused by the fire destroyed the retaining wall, thus 
leading to the massive flow of oil into the sea.<b>189</b>  
</p>
<p>211. The Commission is convinced that the attack was premeditated and was not a target of 
opportunity.  Indeed, the strike was directly aimed at those tanks that had been filled in the days 
preceding the attacks.  No missile was directed at empty tanks, nor at the main generator and 
machinery, which are just a few meters away from the storage tanks. 
212. The spill affected two thirds of Lebanon&#8217;s coastline.  Beaches and rocks were covered in 
a black sludge up to Byblos, north of Beirut and extended into the southern parts of Syria.  
According to the Lebanon Marine and Coastal Oil Pollution International Assistance Action Plan 
prepared by the Expert Working Group for Lebanon,<b>190</b> winds and surface sea currents caused 
the oil slick to move north, some 150 km from the source in a matter of a few days.  This rapid 
movement of the slick caused significant damages on the Lebanese coastline, as well as the 
Syrian coast.  Furthermore, due to the air blockade no air surveillance and assessment actions 
were possible.  The only possibility left was to use satellite remote-sensing images.  While 
cleaning up measures were undertaken a few days before the end of the conflict, under the 
authority of the Lebanese Ministry of Environment and the Lebanese Army, weeks after the 
ceasefire there were reports of oil slicks still floating in different areas.<b>191</b> 
</p>
<p>213. The Commission found that the environmental damage caused by the intensive Israeli 
bombing goes beyond the Jiyyeh oil spill.  Damaged power transformers, collapsed buildings, 
attacks on fuel stations, and the destruction of chemical plants and other industries may have 
leaked or discharged hazardous substances and materials to the ground, such as asbestos and 
chlorinated compounds.  These hazardous materials may gravely affect underground and surface 
water supplies, as well as the health and fertility of arable land. 
</p>
<p>214. Similarly, the large destruction of buildings and other civilian infrastructure may pose a 
threat to public health in view of the massive amount of debris that needs to be disposed of.  In 
this respect, the UNEP Environmental Update of 24 August indicates, for example, that in the 
southern suburb of Haret Hreik the destruction of buildings in an area of about 200 by 
240 meters generated approximately 1 million cubic metres of rubble, which amounts to the 
total waste that the whole Lebanese population generates in one year. 
</p>
<p>215. Furthermore, the Commission has also considered that direct attacks on fuel storage tanks 
and petrol stations, as well as on factories such as the Maliban glass factory, the Sai El-Deen 
plastics facility and the Liban Lait dairy plant, among others, have created increased risks of 
pollution by chemical agents that may have contaminated water sources, arable land and the air, 
posing a direct threat to the health of the Lebanese population. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>216. Article 35(3) of Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions establishes a 
general prohibition on employing methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be 
expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment.  
Similarly, article 55(1) of the Protocol further indicates that special care shall be taken during 
armed conflict to protect the natural environment against widespread, long-term and severe 
damage.   
</p>
<p>217. Furthermore, as indicated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ)<b>192</b> and reiterated in 
the legal literature,<b>193</b> the principle that parties to a conflict shall take all necessary measures to 
avoid serious damage to the natural environment constitutes a norm of customary international 
law.<b>194</b>  In this respect, ICJ has stated the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(&#8230;) States must take environmental considerations into account when assessing what is 
necessary and proportionate in the pursuit of legitimate military objectives.  Respect for 
the environment is one of the elements that go to assessing whether an action is in 
conformity with the principles of necessity and proportionality.&#8221;<b>195</b> 
</p>
<p>218. Moreover, under article 8(2)(b)(iv) of the Rome Statute, the intentional launching of an 
attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to 
the natural environment is considered a war crime.   
</p>
<p>219. The Commission finds that, while Israel may argue that attacks on these facilities were 
justified under military necessity, the fact is that it clearly ignored or chose to ignore the 
potential threats these attacks posed to the well-being of the civilian population.  While Israel 
may have attained its military objective, it did so by putting the health of part of the population at 
risk.  The Commission does not see how this potential threat can be outweighed by 
considerations of military necessity.  It thus finds that Israel violated its international legal 
obligations to adequately take into consideration environmental and health minimum standards 
when evaluating the legitimacy of the attacks against the above-mentioned facilities. 
</p>
<p>220. Furthermore, the Commission holds the view that Israel should have taken into account 
the possibility that the attacks on the Jiyyeh power plant could lead to a massive oil spill into the 
sea.  Despite the risks, IDF went ahead and attacked the site, with the consequences already 
explained.  Whether the attack was justified or not by military necessity, the fact remains that the 
consequences went far beyond whatever military objective Israel may have had. 
</p>
<p><b>11.  Attacks on cultural and historical property 
</b></p>
<p>221. The Commission witnessed the damage on the Byblos archaeological site caused by the 
oil spill originating from IDF attack on the Jiyyeh thermo-electrical plant in Saida.  The site, 
listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, suffered substantially from the oil pollution.  In this 
respect, for example, the UNESCO Mission to assess the effects of the war on Lebanon&#8217;s 
Cultural Heritage indicated in its September 2006 report the following on this exceptional 
archaeological site: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;La mission a constat&#233; que le port ancien avait &#233;t&#233; nettoy&#233; rapidement par la marine 
libanaise tout d&#8217;abord, puis avec une assistance du Danemark et de la France.  En 
revanche, les blocs de pierre qui constituent les soubassements des deux tours m&#233;di&#233;vales </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>nord et sud &#224; l&#8217;entr&#233;e du port restent recouverts d&#8217;une &#233;paisse couche d&#8217;hydrocarbure.  
Les vestiges de l&#8217;&#233;poque antique (ph&#233;nicienne, hell&#233;nistique et romaine) situ&#233;s en 
contrebas du tell, sont &#233;galement recouverts de la m&#234;me nappe d&#8217;hydrocarbure.&#8221;<b></b></i><b>196</b> </p>
<p>222. The Commission was able to verify the impact of the spill on the site&#8217;s coastal 
archaeological foundations.  The Commission saw the damage to rocks and foundations caused 
by the oil, which according to the Ministry of Culture&#8217;s experts, has permeated the surface of the 
rock.  The same phenomenon is visible in the site&#8217;s Hellenic greenhouse, whose porous 
characteristic makes it particularly vulnerable to this type of water pollution.  In its report, the 
Directorate General of Antiquities of the Ministry of Culture indicates: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Le fioul a souill&#233; toutes les fondations des tours est et ouest datant de la p&#233;riode 
M&#233;di&#233;vale ainsi que le part antique, le mur jonchant la c&#244;te nord-ouest de la tour ouest, 
la baie de Chamiyeh et de Skhin&#233;, l&#8217;&#238;le de Yasmine ainsi que le vivier arch&#233;ologique 
datant de la p&#233;riode Hell&#233;nistique. 
</i></p>
<p><i>(&#8230;) Les rochers et structures arch&#233;ologiques, notamment les tours m&#233;di&#233;vales ainsi que 
le vivier hell&#233;nistique sont poreux de nature.  En cons&#233;quence, le fioul y est d&#233;j&#224; 
profond&#233;ment ancr&#233;.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p>223. Furthermore, the Commission obtained credible information from the Lebanese Ministry 
of Culture, as well as from UNESCO, concerning further damage to other historical, 
archaeological and cultural sites.  In the case of the Baalbeck archaeological site, the UNESCO 
mission established the following: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;L&#8217;examen minutieux des diff&#233;rentes parties du temple de Jupiter a montr&#233; qu&#8217;au niveau 
de la cour hexagonale, o&#249; un bloc de pierre s&#8217;est d&#233;tach&#233; et bris&#233;, des fissures 
nombreuses sont visibles sur les linteaux.  Selon le professeur Croci qui avait examin&#233; le 
site en 2001, dans le cadre du projet CHUD, ces fissures pourraient avoir &#233;t&#233; aggrav&#233;es 
par les vibrations des bombardements.  Il faut noter &#224; cet &#233;gard que le souk ancien de 
Baalbek, endommag&#233; par les bombardements, se situe &#224; environ deux cents m&#232;tres des 
monuments.  Un rapport d&#233;taill&#233; sera fourni par les deux experts sp&#233;cialistes des 
structures et de la conservation de la pierre dans les jours qui viennent.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p>224. The UNESCO mission reported also on the destruction of part of the frescos contained in 
a tomb dating from the Roman era in Tyre. 
</p>
<p>225. The Commission received reliable information from the Lebanese Ministry of Culture 
concerning the damage and destruction of further Lebanese archaeological and historical sites 
not included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The Commission visited some of these sites 
and was able to see the damage caused by IDF military operations. 
</p>
<p>226. Among these sites, the Chamaa citadel, built in the 12th century, suffered substantial 
damage.  The Chamaa mausoleum, its minaret and part of its mosque were completely 
demolished.  The four domes topping the building were partially destroyed.  Inside the citadel 
fence, dwellings and stores were destroyed.  In Bent J&#8217;Beil, most of the constructions dating 
from the 18th century were completely destroyed, including the town&#8217;s old souks.  In the town of 
Khiyam, the regional museum built by the Mercy Corps Association in an underground hospital </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>located in the al-Dardara region suffered massive damage from the intensive bombing in the 
area.  The Khiyam former prison building was subject to intensive bombing.  The Castle of 
Toron, in the Tibnin citadel, was directly targeted causing the destruction of important parts of 
the castle.  In-depth damage assessment has yet to be carried out, due to the unexploded 
ordnance still surrounding the premises of the castle. 
</p>
<p>227. Cultural, historical and archaeological sites are clearly protected by international 
humanitarian law.  While international humanitarian law and public international law principles 
applicable to cultural, historical and archaeological property admit that if they are used for 
military purposes they may lose their protection and can be attacked, belligerent parties need to 
take the necessary precautions to limit the impact of its attack on the sites.   
</p>
<p>228. After reviewing the material received and based on its visits to some of these sites, the 
Commission finds that Israeli attacks caused considerable and disproportionate damage to 
cultural, archaeological and historical property in Lebanon, which cannot be justified under 
military necessity.  These unjustified attacks include, firstly, sites that, while not listed in the 
UNESCO World Heritage List, constitute nevertheless sites of extreme historical importance to 
the Lebanese population.  That is the case of the destruction of sites in Chamaa, Khiyam, Tibnin, 
and Bent J&#8217;Beil.  Second, Israel&#8217;s attacks in the vicinity of sites listed in the UNESCO World 
Heritage List, such as in the case of Baalbeck&#8217;s Jupiter&#8217;s temple, Byblos archaeological site and 
Tyre&#8217;s archaeological property, while not constituting a direct attack, caused important damage 
to specially protected property.  The Commission finds that Israel could have and should have 
employed the necessary precautionary measures to avoid direct or indirect damage to especially 
protected cultural, historical and archaeological sites in Lebanese territory.   
</p>
<p>229. Taking into account the number and gravity of incidents affecting protected cultural 
property, the Commission finds that these attacks constitute a violation of existing norms of 
international law and international humanitarian law requiring the special protection of cultural, 
historical and archaeological sites.   
</p>
<p><b>12.  Schools 
</b></p>
<p>230. The conflict took place at a time when children were on summer holidays.  According to 
statistics issued by the Ministry of Education,<b>197</b> some 16 schools were directly hit, causing 
major destruction of the building.  Another 157 were seriously damaged, either following direct 
hits or in collateral damage from attacks on adjacent buildings.  Some three others were in need 
of repair having been using as shelter for as many as 128,760 internally displaced.  In Bent J&#8217;beil 
six schools were completely destroyed and another two partially.  Two private schools and two 
public schools had been totally destroyed in the town of Khiyam, with another two, including a 
vocational (agricultural) school, badly damaged. 
</p>
<p>231. In Bent J&#8217;beil the Commission saw one school that had been destroyed completely but for 
the ground floor.  It was later learned that pupils would return on 16 October, using only this 
ground floor as the rest of the building was being restored.  In one school in the town, the 
Commission was informed, 37 civilians had taken shelter and the building came down around 
them; injuries were suffered and one old man and one old woman were found under the rubble at 
the end of the war.  In Yatar, the Mayor recounted how the school had been attacked and the 
Lebanese Army found one unexploded missile there shortly before the school year began again.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>In Al Duweir, the members of the Commission were told how the religious school in Saida, at 
which Sheikh Adil Akash (see above, &#8220;Attacks on civilians&#8221;) taught, had been targeted.  In 
Taibe, they were told how Israeli soldiers had occupied the private school and despoiled the 
teachers&#8217; kitchen and left urine in bottles around the classrooms.  In Khiyam, the Commission 
visited one of the schools that had been very badly damaged, a school that UNESCO had helped 
build.  One school in the town had already been renovated with help from Qatar; that and the 
agricultural school would be used to accommodate pupils from all four destroyed schools when 
the school year began again. 
</p>
<p>232. Little has been said of the reasons for the targeting of schools specifically.  As is the case 
with other civilian objects, school buildings are protected under international humanitarian 
law.<b>198</b>  In case of doubt whether a school is being used to make an effective contribution to 
military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.<b>199</b>  According to the ICC Statute, 
intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to education is a war crime, provided 
they are not military objectives.<b>200</b>  Without any clear indication as to the military importance of 
these buildings, such attacks would constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian 
law, which may amount to war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b>13.  United Nations Peacekeepers - UNIFIL/Observer Group Lebanon 
</b></p>
<p>233. During the conflict a number of UNIFIL and Observer Group Lebanon (OGL) positions 
were either directly hit by IDF fire or were the subject of firing close to their positions.  All these 
United Nations positions are clearly marked, most are on prominent hill tops to aid observation.  
Their positions were notified in 12 figure grid references to IDF.  On 12 July, IDF issued a 
warning to UNIFIL that &#8220;any person -including United Nations personnel- moving close to the 
Blue Line would be shot at&#8221;.<b>201</b>  On 15 July, UNIFIL was informed by IDF that Israel would 
establish a &#8220;special security zone&#8221; between 21 villages along the Blue Line and the Israeli 
technical fence.  IDF informed UNIFIL that any vehicle entering the area would be shot at.  This 
security zone was directly within the UNIFIL area of operation, which made it impossible to 
support (or evacuate, if necessary) many UNIFIL positions located in the zone.  In effect, these 
warnings prevented UNIFIL from discharging its mandate conferred upon it by Security Council 
resolution 1655(2006) of 31 January 2006.<b>202</b> 
</p>
<p>234. The Commission found that there were 30 recorded direct attacks by IDF on UNIFIL and 
OGL positions during the conflict.  These attacks resulted, among others, in the death of four 
unarmed United Nations observers at the Khiyam base.  A staff member and his wife died in an 
air strike on their apartment in Tyre.  In addition, five Ghanaian, three Chinese and one French 
soldier of UNIFIL were injured, together with one officer from OGL.  
</p><p>235. It is significant that, towards the end of the conflict, after the ceasefire had been 
announced, there was a dramatic increase in IDF direct attacks on UNIFIL positions.  For 
example on 13 August there were five direct hits, on positions at Tiri, Bayt Yahun, and Tibnin 
(on three occasions during the reporting period).  There was extensive material damage in all 
these locations.  On 14 August there were nine direct hits, on positions at Tibnin (four times), 
Haris (twice), Tiri (twice), and Marun al Ras (once). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>236. A total of 85 artillery rounds impacted inside these UNIFIL bases on these two days 
alone, 35 in Tibnin.  These attacks caused &#8220;massive material damage&#8221; to all the positions.  All 
UNIFIL personnel were forced into shelters, which prevented casualties.   
</p>
<p>237. The attack on the UNIFIL Khiyam base of 25 July 2006 was a major incident during the 
conflict and is the subject of a separate UN report.  For completeness, it was necessary for the 
Commission to review certain relevant facts relating to the incident.  The Khiyam base was built 
34 years ago and was one of four observation sites used by Observer Group Lebanon.  UNIFIL 
records show that during the conflict a total of 36 IDF air strikes occurred within 500 metres of 
the base, 12 of these within 100 metres.  In addition there had been 12 artillery bombardments 
within 100 metres of the base; four of these hit the base directly.  While Hezbollah had a base 
150 metres away, as well as some form of operational base in a nearby prison, UNIFIL reported 
that there was no Hezbollah firing taking place within the immediate vicinity of the base that 
day.  Throughout 25 July, UNIFIL had protested directly to IDF after each of the incidents of 
close firing to the base.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>238. At<b> </b>1925 hours on 25 July 2006 the base was struck by a 500 kilogramme 
precision-guided aerial bomb and destroyed.  The United Nations Board of Inquiry noted that the 
Israeli authorities accepted full responsibility for the incident and apologized to the 
United Nations for what they say was an &#8220;operational level&#8221; mistake.  The Board did not have 
access to operational or tactical level IDF commanders involved in the incident, and was, 
therefore, unable to determine why the attacks on the United Nations position were not halted, 
despite repeated demarches to the Israeli authorities from United Nations personnel, both in the 
field and at Headquarters.  The report concluded that all standard operating procedures were 
followed and no additional actions could have been taken by United Nations personnel that 
would have changed the outcome.<b>203</b> 
</p>
<p>239. Furthermore, UNIFIL has listed, by distance, all so-called &#8220;close firings&#8221; to their 
positions that took place during the conflict.<b>204</b>  The total number of such incidents was 208.  
Regarding the breakdown, it is worth noting that 71 of these close firings were between 10 and 
50 meters; 61 aerial bombs are included in these close firings; 530 artillery shells were listed as 
close firings; and 162 tank rounds.<b>205</b> 
</p>
<p>240. It is worthy of note that, as with direct attacks, there was a marked increase in these 
incidents of &#8220;close firing&#8221; on the last two days of the conflict, during which 10 aerial rockets and 
108 artillery shells impacted in the vicinity of United Nations bases including the UNIFIL 
Headquarters.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>241. State practice treats United Nations peacekeeping forces as civilians because they are not 
members of a party to the conflict and are deemed to be entitled to the same protection against 
attack as that accorded to civilians, as long as they are not taking a direct part in hostilities.  By 
the same token, objects involved in a peacekeeping operation are considered to be civilian 
objects, protected against attack.<b>206</b>  Under the Rome Statute, intentionally directing attacks 
against personnel and objects involved in a peacekeeping mission in accordance with the Charter 
of the United Nations constitutes a war crime as long as they are entitled to the protection given 
to civilians and civilian objects under international humanitarian law.<b>207</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>242. The Commission has found no justification for the attacks on United Nations positions by 
IDF.  Each United Nations position was clearly notified to IDF.  In any case the locations have 
been in place for many years; they are easily recognized and built on prominent hilltop positions.  
There can be no doubt that both ground and air forces of IDF would have been fully aware of 
their locations.  Firing of rockets by Hezbollah from the vicinity of these bases might explain the 
large number of &#8220;close firings&#8221; described above.  However, from an international humanitarian 
law perspective of military necessity, and bearing in mind the principle of distinction, the 
Commission does not see how IDF can possibly justify the 30 direct attacks on United Nations 
positions and the deaths and injury to protected United Nations personnel.<b>208</b>   
243. Furthermore, the significant increase in the bombardment of United Nations positions 
on 13 and 14 August cannot be described as being of imperative or even of vague necessity from 
a military perspective.   
</p>
<p>244. With regard to Hezbollah firings from and into the immediate vicinity of United Nations 
positions, the Commission finds, based on the daily UNIFIL press releases, that there were 
six incidents of direct fire against UNIFIL positions and 62 incidents where Hezbollah fired their 
rockets from the close proximity of United Nations positions towards Israel.   
</p>
<p>245. The Commission finds that Hezbollah fighters were using the vicinity of United Nations<b> 
</b>positions as shields for the launching of their rockets.  This is an obvious violation of 
international humanitarian law <b>209</b> and also put the United Nations forces in danger.  However, 
&#8220;the vicinity&#8221; does not mean from within the bases as mentioned above.  The direct targeting by 
IDF, when they have the advantage of modern precision weapons, remains inexcusable. 
</p>
<p>246. The direct firing on United Nations positions by Hezbollah is equally illegal and 
inexcusable and would appear to be an attempt by them to blame IDF for such incidents.   
</p>
<p><b>14.  Use of weapons 
</b></p>
<p>247. Israeli armed forces are equipped with state-of-the-art equipment in terms of surveillance, 
intelligence-gathering and precision targeting.<b>210</b>  During the Commission&#8217;s investigations 
allegations were made concerning the use by the IDF of a range of weapons or, more accurately, 
ammunition which might be considered illegal.  Such allegations were made in relation to the 
use of depleted uranium, white phosphorous and fuel air explosives.  Some witnesses also 
brought to the Commission&#8217;s attention injuries they described as abnormal, e.g. completely 
charred but intact corpses, or human bodies that apparently simply vaporized. </p>
<p>248. The Commission investigated the use of weapons as best it could through on-site visits, 
witness statements, discussions with the Lebanese Army, hospital officials and Lebanese 
Red Cross authorities who had treated the casualties; also with UNIFIL and Observer Group 
Lebanon sources that had first hand observation of actions on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Cluster munitions 
</b>249. Cluster munitions were used extensively by IDF throughout Lebanon.  These consisted of 
both ground-based (M483A1 155mm artillery shells, M 395 and M 396 155 mm artillery shells 
and the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)) and air-dropped (CBU-58 munitions).<b>211</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>There is ample evidence pointing to a significant increase in the intensity of the overall 
bombardment including cluster munitions in the last 72 hours of the conflict, including the 
period after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).  OCHA affirms that 
90 per cent of all cluster bombs and their sub-munitions were fired by IDF into south Lebanon 
during these last 72 hours of the conflict.<b>212</b>  For example, cluster bombardments were 
particularly heavy in and around the Tibnin hospital grounds, especially on 13 August 
when 2,000 civilians were seeking shelter there.   
</p>
<p>250. UNMACC, in cooperation with the Lebanese armed forces (National De-mining Office), 
has identified a total of 789 cluster strike locations throughout Lebanon.  As of 31 October 2006, 
the estimate is that over one million cluster bombs had been fired in Lebanon.  The reported dud 
rate of cluster munitions is as high as 40 per cent.<b>213</b>  In other words, many of the bomblets did 
not explode but, rather like anti-personnel mines, they littered the ground with the potential to 
explode at any time later.    
</p>
<p>251. This wide use of cluster bombs has been admitted by Israeli forces.  On 12 September, 
the Haaretz newspaper quoted an IDF unit commander stating that &#8220;[I]n order to compensate for 
the rockets&#8217; imprecision, the order was to &#8220;flood&#8221; the area with them. &#8230;  We have no option of 
striking an isolated target, and the commanders know this very well&#8221;.  He also stated that the 
reserve soldiers were surprised by the use of MLRS rockets, because during their regular army 
service, they were told these are &#8216;judgment day weapons&#8217; of IDF and intended for use in a 
full-scale war.<b>214</b>  An Israeli reservist soldier interviewed by the same newspaper also stated that 
&#8220;[I]n the last 72 hours we fired all the munitions we had, all at the same spot, we didn&#8217;t even 
alter the direction of the gun.  Friends of mine in the battalion told me they also fired everything 
in the last three days - ordinary shells, clusters, whatever they had.&#8221;<b>215</b>  With regard to the exact 
timing of the launching of the cluster rockets, a unit commander said &#8220;[T]hey told us that this is a 
good time because people are coming out of the mosques and the rockets would deter them.&#8221;<b>216</b>  
The commander also said that at least in one case, they were asked to fire cluster rockets toward 
&#8220;a village&#8217;s outskirts&#8221; in the early morning. 
</p>
<p>252. During the conflict, including the last 72 hours, IDF cluster strikes were concentrated on 
three main areas of southern Lebanon.  First, in the areas immediately to the east and south east 
of Tyre, a heavy populated area.  The locality was possibly targeted because of its very rich 
agricultural area specializing in banana and citrus orchards, but more probably because it was 
used by Hezbollah to fire missiles using the orchards as cover.<b>217</b>  Second, in the Tibnin area, 
which is a Hezbollah stronghold.  Lastly, in the area north of the Litani; this is more difficult to 
explain, as it is known to be outside the range of Hezbollah rockets into Israel.  The argument for 
using cluster bombs to interdict rocket firings therefore does not apply. 
</p>
<p>253. There is also ample evidence that cluster bombs were used in an indiscriminate manner 
and that many towns and villages were littered with the bomblets as well as large tracts of 
agricultural land.  In addition to Tibnin, Nabatiyeh, Yahmor, Ain Ibel,Yaroun, Bent J&#8217;beil, 
Qfar Tibnit and Swane were also deliberate targets of cluster bombings. 
</p>
<p>254. The particular military use of these munitions lies in the wide area the munitions can 
cover.  It provides the military with a very effective weapon against targets such as troops in the 
open or in defensive positions, artillery batteries, and concentrations of vehicles or tanks.  
However, the inherent area coverage of cluster munitions calls for clear separation between </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>military targets and civilians or their property otherwise the latter will suffer the indiscriminate 
consequences of their use.  Account must also be taken of the known failure rates of such 
ammunition which can result in excessive and disproportionate harm to civilians after the 
conflict.   
</p>
<p>255. Although there are ongoing efforts to ban cluster munitions, for example under the 
umbrella of the Conventional Weapons Convention, unfortunately there is no prohibition under 
international humanitarian law on their use at present.  The key issue in relation to the law and 
their use by the military rests on the known wide dispersal pattern of the cluster munitions on the 
ground and hence the fact that they cannot be targeted precisely.  As a result it is often difficult, 
if not impossible, for the military to discriminate between military and civilian objects when the 
weapons are used in or near populated areas.  The pertinent issue therefore is how the munitions 
are used. 
</p>
<p>256. Considering the indiscriminate manner in which cluster munitions were used, in the 
absence of any reasonable explanation from IDF, the Commission finds that their use was 
excessive and not justified by any reason of military necessity.  When all is considered, the 
Commission finds that these weapons were used<b> </b>deliberately to turn large areas of fertile 
agricultural land into &#8220;no go&#8221; areas for the civilian population.  Furthermore, in view of the 
foreseeable high dud rate, their use amounted to a de facto scattering of anti-personnel mines 
across wide tracts of Lebanese land. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Depleted uranium  
</b>257. The IDF has within its arsenal of weapons munitions that can be equipped with depleted 
uranium warheads.  It is therefore possible that depleted uranium (DU) munitions were used by 
the IDF during the conflict.<b>218</b>  However, the preliminary findings of the Lebanese National 
Council for Scientific Research, which carried out a detailed field survey of several bomb sites, 
concluded that there was no indication of depleted uranium having been used in the conflict, 
with the caveat that some additional field work was still necessary to draw a final conclusion.<b>219 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) White phosphorous/incendiary weapons  
</b>258. White phosphorous is designed for use by artillery, mortars or tanks to put down an 
instant smoke screen to cover movement in, for example, an attack or flanking manoeuvre.  The 
phosphorous ignites on contact with air and gives off a thick smoke.  If the chemical touches 
skin it will continue to burn until it reaches the bone unless deprived of oxygen.  It is not 
designed as an incendiary weapon per se, for example in the same way as a flame thrower or the 
petroleum jelly substance used in napalm.<b> 
</b>259. The Commission received a number of reports concerning the use of this type of 
ammunition.  On 16 July, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Lebanese military sources 
stated that IDF had &#8220;used white phosphorous incendiary bombs against civilian targets on 
villages in the Arqoub area&#8221; in southern Lebanon.  In addition, the Commission was told about 
and witnessed a number of sites where the possible use of white phosphorous had occurred, 
among others, at Marwaheen on 16 July during the gathering of the civilians in the village prior </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to their evacuation under UNIFIL supervision.  This was witnessed by civilians concerned and 
interviewed by the Commission.  It was also confirmed by UNIFIL officers on the scene 
that 12 white phosphorous rounds were fired directly at the civilians.<b>220</b>   
</p>
<p>260. Another report mentioned an incident that took place at Aita ech Chaab.  The 
Commission visited two houses that had been badly burnt.  The Commission did not find 
evidence of the use of incendiary weapons on the outside of the house.  It is possible that smoke 
shells from a tank were fired into it to ignite the fires inside but this could not be confirmed. 
</p>
<p>261. On 23 October it was reported in <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i> newspaper<b>221</b> that the Government of 
Israel had &#8220;admitted that it used &#8230; phosphorous weapons in its attacks against targets during 
its month-long war in Lebanon this summer&#8221;.  The Israeli admission was made by 
Minister Jacob Edery, who was questioned on the subject by Zahava Gal-On, a member of the 
Knesset.  Mr. Edery said that &#8220;[T]he IDF holds phosphorous munitions in different forms.  The 
IDF made use of phosphorous shells during the war against Hezbollah in attacks against military 
targets in open ground&#8221;.<b>222</b> 
</p>
<p>262. The Commission did not find evidence concerning the use of incendiary weapons, such 
as flame throwers or napalm. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Dense inert metal explosives (DIME)</b> 
263. Various media<b>223</b> have reported on the possible use by IDF of Dense inert metal 
explosives (DIME), a new weapon, in Lebanon.  It was reported that Israeli Air Force Major 
General Yitzhak Ben-Israel had described the weapon as being designed &#8220;to allow those targeted 
to be hit without causing damage to bystanders or other persons&#8221;.<b>224</b>  It was brought to the 
Commission&#8217;s attention by a number of expert medical witnesses<b>225</b> that some of the casualties 
had suffered from inexplicable burn injuries not witnessed before.  These witnesses had 
extensive experience of war wounds from previous conflicts; their testimony is therefore of some 
relevance.  IDF have strongly denied the use of such weapons.  If they were effectively used, the 
Commission finds that they would be illegal under international humanitarian law.  Protocol I of 
the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons 
Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (hereafter 
&#8220;the Conventional Weapons Convention&#8221;), to which Israel is a signatory, prohibits the use of any 
weapon the primary effect of which is to injure by fragments which cannot be detected by 
X-rays.  The Commission was unable in the time available to thoroughly investigate the claims.  
However, in drawing attention to this weapon and in particular to the expert witnesses&#8217; 
testimonies, it finds that the possible use of such weapons in Lebanon should be the subject of 
further investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Fuel-air explosives 
</b>264. There were some allegations from witnesses that IDF used fuel-air explosives during the 
conflict.  This was particularly the case in relation to the destruction of property in South 
Beirut.<b>226</b>  The weapon is designed for targets such as minefields, armour, and aircraft parked in 
the open and vehicles.  Its vacuum effect is particularly useful against hardened bunkers.  The 
Commission found no evidence of its use for such purposes. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>265. There were some reports that Israel employed fuel-air explosives to clear areas suspected 
to be planted with improvised explosive device (IED) and mines placed by Hezbollah in 
South Lebanon.  The fuel-air countermine called &#8220;carpet&#8221; is employed by the Israeli corps of 
engineers.  The carpet uses small rockets fired from a stand-off range, deploying highly 
explosive aerosol over the suspected area.  The explosion of this mixture develops high pressure 
impulse which effectively &#8220;kills&#8221; fuses or sets off explosive devices in the affected area.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Booby traps and improvised explosive devices (IEDs)</b> 
266. The Commission was informed that improvised explosive devices (IEDs) may have been 
left behind by IDF as they withdrew.  The Lebanese newspaper Annahar in October 2006 
showed a picture of two children examining a so-called &#8220;chocolate bar&#8221; booby trap.  It was a 
silver-wrapped rectangular piece of material.  In fact, this was nothing more than a piece of the 
&#8220;chaff&#8221; discarded by a passing IDF fighter jet, i.e. the magnesium flares ejected by such aircraft 
to act as a heat source decoy to deflect a missile attack.  The Commission in fact found no 
evidence of booby traps having been left in place by IDF.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>267. None of the weapons known to have been used by IDF are illegal per se under 
international humanitarian law.  However, the way in which the weapons were used in some 
cases transgresses the law.  The use of cluster munitions has already been addressed.  The 
Commission&#8217;s findings, detailed earlier in this report in relation to the direct targeting of civilian 
objects, infrastructure and protected property is at odds with the apparent interpretation of IDF 
and the application of the principle of distinction.  The vast destruction of civilian objects 
throughout the Lebanon, but especially in the South where some villages were virtually 
completely destroyed indicates that weapons systems were not used in a professional manner, 
despite assurances from IDF that legal advice was being taken in the planning process.  The 
record shows this: 1,191 persons killed; 30,000 houses destroyed; 30 UNIFIL and OGL positions 
directly targeted with 6 dead and 10 injured; and 789 cluster munitions strike locations. 
</p>
<p><b>15.  Blockade 
</b></p>
<p>268. On 13 July 2006 Israeli naval ships entered Lebanese waters to impose a comprehensive 
blockade of Lebanese ports and harbours.  The next day, on 14 July, Israel&#8217;s air force imposed an 
air blockade and proceeded to hit runways and fuel tanks at Rafik Hariri International Airport, 
Lebanon&#8217;s only international airport. 
</p>
<p>269. Israel justified the sea blockade with the argument that &#8220;[T]he ports and harbours of 
Lebanon are used to transfer terrorists and weapons by the terrorist organizations operating 
against the citizens of Israel from within Lebanon, mainly Hezbollah&#8221;.<b>227</b>  IDF further stated that 
&#8220;The Lebanese government is openly violating the decisions of the Security Council by doing 
nothing to remove the Hezbollah threat on the Lebanese border, and is therefore fully responsible 
for the current aggression.&#8221;<b>228</b> 
</p>
<p>270. In his 12 September 2006 report on the implementation of Security Council 1701 (2006) 
the Secretary-General informed the Council that he had undertaken discussions with all 
concerned parties and that Israel had lifted the aerial blockade on 6 September and the maritime 
blockade on 7 September.<b>229</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>271. In the view of the Commission, the blockade imposed by Israel against Lebanon needs to 
be analyzed from three different perspectives.  The first is related to the impact of the blockade 
on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon during and after the conflict.  From a second 
perspective, the blockade needs to be analyzed in the light of the Commission&#8217;s findings of the 
environmental damage.  Finally, the Commission addressed the question of the crippling effects 
the blockade had on the Lebanese economy. 
</p>
<p>272. Parties to a conflict need to take into consideration the impact of the conflict on the 
civilian population.  One of the most important aspects to consider is that of access to 
humanitarian assistance.  Yet, as indicated by OCHA at the outset of the conflict, the 
Israeli-imposed blockade limited tremendously the work of humanitarian agencies by leaving 
only one entry point, by land, through Damascus.<b>230</b>  It was not until the second week of the 
conflict that Israel began considering expanding humanitarian entry points for relief aid to be 
sent into Lebanon.  In this respect, for example, OCHA reported on 25 July that it was still 
seeking authorization for two ships arriving from Cyprus with an aid cargo to be allowed to land 
in Beirut.<b>231</b>  On 30 July, OCHA indicated that &#8220;the road between Aarida, on the Lebanon-Syria 
border, and Beirut is currently the only road open continuously&#8221;.<b>232</b>  Yet, on 4 August this road 
was also bombarded by IDF, thus seriously disrupting the overall provision of humanitarian 
aid.<b>233</b>  In general, access to ports in Beirut, Tripoli and Tyre was, at best, sporadic, thus forcing 
humanitarian agencies to continue using ground transportation through Damascus as the sole 
means for the transfer of aid supplies to the entire country.  For instance, two WFP tankers 
carrying 87,000 tons of fuel and food supplies could not enter into Lebanese waters due to the 
lack of adequate security guarantees by the Israeli navy.<b>234</b>  The two ships were not allowed to 
dock until 13 August.<b>235</b>  Similarly, the Commission received reports of other cargo ships being 
unnecessarily held off the Lebanese coasts, thus delaying the distribution of urgent humanitarian 
supplies to the civilian population.<b>236</b> 
</p>
<p>273. The Commission also considered the impact of the blockade on the environmental 
catastrophe that followed the Israeli attacks on the Jiyyeh power station.  The Commission finds 
that the blockade unnecessarily obstructed the deployment of immediate measures to clean or 
contain the oil spill.  It was not until shortly before the end of the conflict that initial clean up 
operations along the coast could actually be initiated under the authority of the Lebanese 
Ministry of Environment and the Lebanese Army.  By then, the oil slick had moved north and 
had already contaminated a large extent of the Lebanese coast, including its archaeological sites, 
as well as parts of the Syrian coast.<b>237</b>  The Commission finds that the Israeli Government should 
have ordered an immediate relaxation of the blockade to allow the necessary urgent evaluation to 
be made, assessment measures to be adopted and the necessary cleanup measures to be carried 
out.  In the view of the Commission there is no reason that justifies a failure to do so.  Israel&#8217;s 
engagement in an armed conflict does not exempt it from its general obligation to protect the 
environment and to react to an environmental catastrophe such as that which took place on the 
Lebanese coasts. 
</p>
<p>274. Finally, there is no doubt that the blockade had tremendous negative effects on the 
Lebanese economy.  The Lebanese Government has estimated the loss in public finance due to 
the conflict at around 1.6 billion dollars, with the blockade having a very high impact on the loss 
of revenue.<b>238</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>275. The Commission believes that the impact of the blockade on human life, on the 
environment and on the Lebanese economy seems to outweigh any military advantage Israel 
wished to obtain through this action.  The Commission finds that the blockade should have been 
adapted to the situation on the ground, instead of being carried out in a comprehensive and 
inflexible manner that resulted in great suffering to the civilian population, damage to the 
environment, and substantial economic loss.   
</p>
<p><b>III.  FINDINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The consequences of the conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Displacement and displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>276. While the longer-term consequences of displacement are difficult to measure, it is clear 
that the displacement of nearly one quarter of the country&#8217;s population will have lasting social 
and economic repercussions, both for host communities and for communities of origin.  Routine 
health services, including child immunization, were severely disrupted during the displacement 
period and, as many IDPs continue to live with relatives and friends, efforts to re-launch these 
services are complicated.  Economic activity was severely disrupted during the conflict and even 
after due to the continuation of the blockade; at the same time, displaced persons were forced to 
rely on family and extended social networks for their survival and deplete their savings, placing 
a strain on both displaced and host families.  The presence of unexploded ordnance continues to 
act as a major impediment to the return of IDPs and refugees, as well as threatening the lives and 
livelihoods of those who have chosen to return, and will further exacerbate the social and 
economic impact of displacement.<b>239</b>  
</p>
<p>277. Other challenges may include problems associated with the breakdown of communities, 
such as increased violence - in particular gender-based violence; difficulties linked to family 
reunification and tracing of family members; legal and financial issues related to property, as 
well as access to compensation and restitution for victims.  These problems may be particularly 
acute for female heads of household and other women, who may be marginalized or isolated 
from social support networks.<b>240</b> 
</p>
<p>278. Serious human rights concerns for the medium and longer-term recovery for displaced 
and returning populations include the urgent need for clearance of all unexploded ordnance; 
rebuilding of civilian homes and other infrastructure, as well as resolution of property-related 
legal issues in South Beirut and southern Lebanon;<b>241</b> restoration of economic activities and 
infrastructures; and restoring and strengthening health systems in Lebanon, which have been 
affected by the displacement of medical staff and damage to health facilities.<b>242</b>  Longer-term 
rehabilitation and recovery also will require the development and implementation of a strategy, 
through proper consultation with those affected by the displacement, for redressing the social 
and economic inequalities with regard to the South. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Women and elderly 
</b></p>
<p>279. The Commissioners learned first hand of the sufferings of women and children and of the 
elderly in this, as in other conflicts.  As the Representative of the Secretary-General on human 
rights of internally displaced persons has pointed out, women and children represent the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>overwhelming majority of internally displaced persons.  In addition to the general suffering of 
civilians, women have been the victims of more specific human rights violations such as 
arbitrary detention or cruel and inhuman treatment.<b>243</b>  In addition, due to the armed conflict 
there will be an increase in women-headed households with all the human rights problems that 
implies, such as limited access to social benefits and housing rights. 
</p>
<p>280. As the conflict becomes more distant and life resumes, it is feared that other problems 
will arise.  There is concern about an increase in domestic violence and sexual abuse due to the 
fact people again have to live together in very close proximity having lost their homes, creating 
distress and stress.  Domestic violence and sexual abuse are known to rise in such circumstances.  
Intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations told the Commission that they are trying 
to collect data.  In the meantime, projects are being developed with local associations in areas 
such as South Beirut to sensitize mothers and community leaders.  In southern Lebanon women&#8217;s 
community centres are being created. 
</p>
<p>281. The conflict also brought to light the specific problems of the many unskilled foreign 
workers in Lebanon.  Agricultural workers were mentioned earlier (see Al Qaa).  At the time of 
the conflict, it was reported that more than 200,000 migrants were living and working in 
Lebanon, many from poor countries.  Among them were more than 90,000 documented 
Sri Lankan women working as cheap domestic help and child-minders.<b>244</b>  One, it will be 
recalled, perished together with the family of Sheikh Akkash in Al Duweir.  The Commission 
came across another person in the streets of Khiyam: the family had left when the bombing 
began, but she had nowhere to go.  One spoke of how the family with whom she worked had fled 
when the bombing began, taking her passport and leaving her locked in the house.  Other 
families either dropped off their employee in the street in front of their embassy or simply left 
them to fend for themselves when the bombing began.  Charitable organizations tried to find 
them shelter and food, and to help them return home.<b>245</b>  It was clear that the situation of migrant 
workers in Lebanon needs to be monitored, to ensure that their human rights are fully respected.  
Lebanon should seriously consider become a party to the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>282. The Commission also heard of several other cases of how the elderly were often unable 
to leave their communities after warnings were given, and got caught in the bombings, their 
bodies later found under rubble of the buildings in which they sheltered.  Others died from heart 
attacks or inability to obtain medication for serious health conditions. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Children 
</b></p>
<p>283. Children have been disproportionately affected by the armed conflict in Lebanon.  As in 
all recent armed conflicts, children have numbered too many among casualties.  Children 
continue to be victims of cluster bombs in the south of the country.  This represents a clear 
violation of the basic rules of international humanitarian law, as indicated earlier in this report, 
and is also a blatant violation of one of the core principles of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the right to life (art. 6). Consequently, more special awareness sessions need to be 
provided to children regarding the danger of cluster munitions and other unexploded 
ordnance (UXO). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>284. The right to life also requires for the State party to undertake all efforts to provide health 
care for all children, including the wounded.  Access to health (art. 24 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the life) is an important issue, because of the disruption of the health system during the 
conflict and the damage caused to many medical facilities.<b>246</b>  In addition, as a result of the 
conflict, many children will be disabled for life.  This will require the Government of Lebanon to 
take all necessary measures to ensure physical rehabilitation for the wounded (art. 39 of the 
Convention) and to grant special measures of protection to disabled children (art. 23 of the 
Convention). 
</p>
<p>285. Mental health and psychological recovery (art. 39 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child) are also key issues to be addressed as indicated in the Statement adopted by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child on 3 August 2006.<b>247</b>  Projections made by WHO show 
that a large percentage of the population<b>248</b> suffer from moderate or severe mental psychological 
stress, which obviously includes children.<b>249</b>  WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Public 
Health and the professional societies (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and nurses) 
launched Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergencies workshops in Saida, Tyre and 
Nabatyieh for primary health-care personnel and physicians with a view to organizing further 
trainings on a national basis is being contemplated.  NGOs are also involved in this matter, such 
as Save the Children,<b>250</b> Terre des Hommes<b>251</b> and Samidoun.<b>252</b> 
</p>
<p>286. Many children became orphans as a result of this armed conflict and the Lebanese 
Government will have to undertake all necessary efforts in order to ensure that these children are 
given special protection and assistance (art. 20 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child).  
Finally, as already mentioned earlier, the Commission is also afraid that due to the trauma 
witnessed by many families, domestic violence may increase.  To fully implement article 19 of 
the Convention, the Lebanese Government will have to pay particular attention to this issue. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>287. The extent of destruction and damage to schools and other educational establishments, in 
particular throughout southern Lebanon, gave rise to fears that education would be substantially 
at risk when the school year began again after the summer months.  The mixed system of 
education in Lebanon - public and private - meant that the families of many pupils now needed 
help in finding school fees.  Among those families who could afford it, it was mentioned to the 
Commission, a number made the decision thenceforward to send their children to school out of 
the country for reasons of security. 
</p>
<p>288. In the circumstances, the start of the school year was delayed by some three weeks, 
until 16-18 October 2006, to allow time for repair, restoration, disinfection, clearance of debris 
and refurbishment of school buildings.  The costs of this were estimated at US$ 44,000,000.  
Major support came quickly for early recovery efforts, in particular from the United Arab 
Emirates,<b>253</b> focusing on rehabilitation of schools and provision of basic equipment.  This was 
accompanied by a Back to School campaign led by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education.   
</p>
<p>289. Thus it was reported that 85 per cent of children in primary education were able to return 
to school by 18 October.<b>254</b>  As for the other 15 per cent, it is still not clear how they will 
continue with their education.  Specific problems were encountered in those areas worst hit, 
particularly along the Blue Line, where children were attending school in neighbouring villages, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>using double shifts when necessary, as their own schools had been completely destroyed.  The 
issue of displacement continued to contribute to the problem, as there were still an unknown 
number of children, and teachers, living far from their family homes; thus, some schools were 
more empty than usual, while others were overcrowded and still others were missing teaching 
staff.  The full picture would only be known as the year progressed. 
</p>
<p>290. The more serious impact would be in relation to the effects of this sudden and major 
conflict on children and young people, and how they would cope with the trauma and feelings of 
insecurity.  Thus attention was being given to the quality of education in the aftermath of the 
conflict, the management of classrooms in these circumstances and the psychosocial needs of 
children and young people.<b>255</b>  The Commission considers it essential to reinforce, notably in 
schools (art. 29 of the Convention) programmes to prepare children for responsible life in a free 
society, in the spirit of understanding, peace, and tolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Environment 
</b></p>
<p>291. The consequences of the conflict on the environment are too visible to be ignored.  
Among other things, Lebanon is still struggling with the very damaging effects of the Jiyyeh oil 
spill on the marine biodiversity of its coast.  While it is too soon to be able to establish with a 
certain degree of clarity the medium- and long-term impact of the spill on the ecosystem, there 
seems to be a general agreement among specialized scientific circles about the magnitude of the 
ecological catastrophe. 
</p>
<p>292. Without attempting to be exhaustive, the Commission finds that the consequences of the 
oil spill are manifold.  For instance, according to a Ministry of Environment survey carried out 
between 18 July and 3 August, 21 sites were identified as having been polluted.  They cover 
19.2 km of the Lebanese coastline and an area of 123,520 square metres.  On 13 October, the 
IMO/REMPEC update to the International Assistance Action Plan indicated that there were still 
more than 7,000 cubic metres (m3) of polluted sediments, around 500 m3 of oil, and almost 
600 m3 of sunken oil needing to be cleaned up.  The update also stated that significant 
accumulations of free floating oil were found in the Dalieh Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf and its adjacent 
area in Beirut.  Furthermore, in addition to the oil already fixed in sand and pebble beaches, 
changing weather conditions were revealing oil not observed earlier on.  It was estimated that 
more than 1,000 m3 of oil-contaminated debris was still scattered along the Lebanese coast.  
The Lebanese Ministry of Environment estimated the costs of cleaning up in a range of 
US$ 137-205 million.<b>256</b> 
</p>
<p>293. In sum, the Commission finds that the following effects, identified by the Lebanese 
Ministry of Environment, may become evident in the medium term: &#8220;physical and chemical 
alteration of natural habitats due to oil incorporated into sediments; physical smothering effect 
on the marine life; lethal or sub-lethal toxic effects on the marine life; changes in the marine 
ecosystem resulting from oil effects on key organisms e.g. increased abundance of inter-tidal 
algae following the death of limpets which normally eat the algae.&#8221;<b>257</b> 
</p>
<p>294. The Commission holds the view that the environmental damage in Lebanon could have a 
serious adverse effect on public health.  The spread of diseases,, a possible increase in 
respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, water contamination and the potential contamination of 
crops due to chemical spills, pose a serious threat. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Economy 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The impact on industry, agriculture, fisheries, tourism and other sectors 
</b>295. The Lebanese economy was severely affected by the conflict, with every sector 
concerned, notably, the industrial, agriculture, and fishery sectors but also the employment 
situation and public finance as a whole.  The effects of the war on the economy were even 
accentuated as it took place at the peak of the tourist, fishing and harvest season. 
</p>
<p>296. Regarding the damage to the critical infrastructure, the damage to the land transportation 
network has been provisionally estimated by the Lebanese government at US$ 337 million for 
bridges and US$ 92 million for roads.<b>258</b>  The cost of the damage to water facilities was 
estimated by the Council for Development and Reconstruction at US$ 81 million.<b>259</b>  The 
damage to TV and radio stations is also massive.<b>260</b> 
</p>
<p>297. In its document prepared for the Stockholm conference, the Lebanese Government 
estimated losses in the industrial sector at US$ 220 million.  This figure does not take into 
consideration the revenue losses incurred as a result of significant under-utilization of remaining 
capacity due to electricity shortages, immobility of workers,<b>261</b> and the lack of raw materials and 
export possibilities caused by the sea and air blockade.  These losses were estimated at up to 
US$ 30 million a day.<b>262</b>  The Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture estimated the 
direct physical damage to the manufacturing activity at some US$ 300 million.<b>263</b> 
</p>
<p>298. The agricultural sector has been just as severely affected.  Damage to the agriculture 
sector has been estimated at more than US$ 215 million.<b>264</b>  The Lebanese Government made 
reference to a rough estimate which showed that no one in the South and Nabatiye Mohafazas, 
which represent 30 per cent of the country&#8217;s agricultural holders, was spared the effects while 
60 per cent of farmers were affected to varying degrees in the Bekaa and 25 per cent affected in 
the Mohafazas of North and Mount Lebanon.<b>265</b>  This is particularly worrying considering that, 
across Lebanon, FAO estimates that agriculture provides direct employment for 9 per cent of the 
Lebanese population, but another 40 per cent of the population is involved in work that is 
indirectly related to agriculture.<b>266</b>  Major losses occurred during the conflict as farmers could 
not access their fields as they fled their village and left the crops unattended.  Mostly cited losses 
were in relation to tobacco, fruits and vegetables.<b>267</b> 
</p>
<p>299. In addition to these immediate effects, a long-term effect in the agricultural sector is that 
caused by the launch of cluster bombs.<b>268</b>  UNMACC expects the percentage of agricultural land 
contaminated to rise as new cluster bomb strike locations are identified.  Unexploded ordnance 
keeps farmers out of their fields and unable to prune their trees in preparation for next year&#8217;s 
harvest.  More than 7 per cent (35 sq. km) of grasslands, used for animal grazing, is 
contaminated.  The banks and beds of 173 streams and rivers in south Lebanon are contaminated, 
putting shepherds and farmers at risk.  It was reported to the Commission that some farmers 
desperate to get their land back into use are de-mining themselves by setting fires around UXO 
with the obvious danger that this brings with it.  The reference made earlier by the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food, clearing the land of these unexploded bombs is essential to 
enable the reconstruction of livelihoods.<b>269</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>300. The Commission was told that the tourism sector was at its record peak prior to the war, 
with 1.6 million tourists expected over the year, and with the number of tourists increasing by 
50 per cent over the first 6 months of the year.  Losses in revenues are estimated to exceed 
US$ 2 billion.  Around 15 per cent of the workers in the restaurant sector (i.e. 7,500 employees) 
have already lost their jobs because of the shut-downs, and total losses in this sector were 
estimated at around US$ 230 million.<b>270</b> 
</p>
<p>301. Fishing was also heavily disrupted.  In addition to the damage to the ports of Tyre, Saida, 
and Ouzai (with 400 boats destroyed in addition to fishing nets and accessories) fishing activity 
ground to a halt (with an estimated 5,000 fishermen unable to work) due to insecurity, the oil 
spill following the destruction of the tanks of Jiyyeh, the absence of fuel, transportation and 
export channels, and the sea blockade imposed by Israel.<b>271</b> 
</p>
<p>302. More generally, preliminary estimates indicate an increase in national unemployment 
rates from 8-10 per cent prior to the war to 25 per cent.  Furthermore people working in the 
informal sector and those engaged in seasonal and temporary jobs (tourism, agriculture and 
services), estimated at around 11 per cent (more than 122,000 persons) of total workers, have 
been out of work since the beginning of the war.<b>272</b>  
</p>
<p>303. While, prior to the war, the main public finance indicators were showing improvements 
in the one-year period spanning from June 2005 to June 2006, the loss in public finance due to 
the Israeli offensive against Lebanon is estimated at around US$ 1.6 billion until the end of 
2006, taking into consideration the Israeli blockade.<b>273</b>  The Council for Development and 
Reconstruction told the Commission that unofficial estimates for the reconstruction, based on the 
assessment done so far, are now at US$ 3.5 billion.<b>274</b> 
</p>
<p>304. The Government of Lebanon has set up an overall coordination system of the early 
recovery process.  This task will involve all key ministries and State agencies as well as 
international and local organizations with the participation of the private sector.  In that regard, 
an Early Recovery Fund was established.<b>275</b> 
</p>
<p>(<b>b) The blockade</b> 
305. The blockade clearly exacerbated the impact of the conflict on the economy of Lebanon.  
As outlined earlier, the fishermen were not able to exercise their activity for more than one 
month.  Their situation was aggravated by the magnitude of the Jiyyeh oil spill and the 
impossibility, because of the blockade, of undertaking rapid cleanup measures.  The fact that the 
air and sea blockade were maintained for more than three weeks after the end of the hostilities 
did not contribute to allaying, at least partially, the pressure on the fishing and tourism sectors. 
</p>
<p>306. The analysis of the economic impact of the blockade cannot be limited to the fishing and 
tourism industries.  As indicated by the Ministry of Finance &#8220;for the two months of July and 
August, the slide in revenues has already amounted to around US$ 314 million (&#8230;), which is 
equivalent to 1.44 per cent of GDP, and is expected to sum up to more that US$ 920 million &#8230; 
only in 2006 when compared to previous expectations, taking into account the spanning of the 
blockade for a period of two months&#8221;.<b>276</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>307. This loss in revenue does not take into account economic losses incurred by 
entrepreneurs due to the impossibility of cargo ships entering Lebanese ports to deliver their 
merchandise.  For example, in establishing the overall magnitude of the impact on the economy, 
it was pointed out to the Commission that it is necessary to take into account also the extra 
demurrage costs incurred by ships that were not allowed to enter Lebanese waters in ports.<b>277</b>  
The Commission is convinced that all of these are direct economic and financial consequences of 
the blockade that would need to be considered for the establishment of Israel&#8217;s obligation to 
repair for damages that derive from the unnecessarily inflexible way in which Israel carried out 
the blockade. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Housing 
</b></p>
<p>308. Due to the number of housing units which were partially damaged or completely 
destroyed, the reconstruction and compensation process will be a major issue over the months 
and even years to come and will require huge financial and human resources. 
</p>
<p>309. The Commission was told that the Government of Lebanon is intending to provide a 
number of prefabricated housing units which, it is feared, might have a deleterious effect on 
sustainable housing solutions for the affected.<b>278</b>  In addition, as the winter season is 
approaching, there is a real need to help people to winterize their houses and to find adequate 
housing for those who do not have so far. 
</p>
<p>310. In addition, the Commission is concerned at the discrimination which might result from 
the various approaches to the reconstruction process.  Indeed, the fact that some villages have 
been &#8220;adopted&#8221; by donor countries.<b>279</b> while others might have been left aside, may amount to 
discrimination.  Moreover, due to the number of organizations and government departments 
working on reconstruction, duplication of work will probably arise. 
</p>
<p>311. The need for cooperation among the various actors participating in the reconstruction of 
housing units is essential as some people are refusing repair works from NGOs fearing that they 
will not be eligible for compensation promised by pledging countries and the Government of 
Lebanon.  This is why, in southern Lebanon, the main actors agreed with the Council of the 
South to adopt guidelines for the procedure of work they intend to carry out in order to avoid 
duplication.<b>280</b>  These guidelines will be an essential asset in order to establish priorities, ease the 
process and ensure a better implementation of the right to adequate housing free of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>312. So far as compensation is concerned, the situation varies widely according to the area 
under consideration.  Indeed, the Commission met with individuals who informed it that they 
had received compensation from Hezbollah, mainly an amount in cash in order to allow them to 
pay their rent and to buy furniture in another building.  Others said that they had not received 
anything.<b>281</b>  The majority complained that the Government of Lebanon had not given them 
anything for the time being.  This can be explained by the extent of the work which needs to be 
done.  However, the Commission wishes to recall that non-discrimination in compensation is a 
paramount issue. 
</p>
<p>313. For both reconstruction and compensation, a central legal issue will be the dubious 
legality of many homes and commercial structures, notably in the South where there was no </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>government supervision in this area for many years.  It might be the opportune time for 
municipalities to adopt urban planning schemes for each village in order to ensure legal security 
of tenure.  The Commission was also informed that the situation is very similar in South Beirut.  
In addition, the situation of widows will have to be taken into due consideration as their 
ownership rights might differ from those of men.  Mechanisms should be devised to ensure 
appropriate consultation and participation in decisions concerning reconstruction.  Compensation 
procedures should be just, timely, accessible, free of charge, and age and gender sensitive.  More 
generally, within the process of return of people to their homes and of compensation, all relevant 
human rights standards related to the right to adequate housing<b>282</b> should be respected and 
attention should be paid to the human rights standards regarding restitution and compensation.<b>283</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Conclusions as to violations of international humanitarian law,  
human rights law and international law 
</b></p>
<p>314. As a result of its inquiry, the Commission reaches the following conclusions: The 
hostilities that took place from 12 July to 14 August 2006 constitute an international armed 
conflict to which conventional and customary international humanitarian law and human rights 
law are applicable. 
</p>
<p>315. The Commission stresses that generally respect for the principle of humanity and 
humanitarian considerations (Martens clause) was absent during the conflict. 
</p>
<p>316. The principle of military necessity cannot justify every attack or destruction.  The attacks 
on civilians, destruction of unoccupied houses, churches, mosques, shops, and so on do not 
normally contribute to defeating the enemy.  In many cases, the &#8220;military necessity&#8221; element did 
not justify the military action taken.<b>284</b>  
317. The Commission considers that the excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of 
force by IDF goes beyond reasonable arguments of military necessity and of proportionality, and 
clearly failed to distinguish between civilian and military targets, thus constituting a flagrant 
violation of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>318. The conduct of the hostilities by IDF showed an overall lack of respect for the cardinal 
principles regulating the conduct of armed conflict.  Israel did not respect its obligation to 
distinguish civilians from combatants.  Treating civilians as legitimate military targets because 
they were friends, family or sympathizers of Hezbollah goes beyond any legal interpretation of 
the principle of distinction and constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law and 
human rights obligations.  Treating as &#8220;terrorists&#8221; all members or affiliates of an official political 
party leads to an unacceptable interpretation of the law.  In addition, the deliberate attacks 
against the houses of family, friends, members or relatives - but not fighters - of Hezbollah 
contravene international humanitarian law and human rights law.   
</p>
<p>319. The number of houses and residential buildings destroyed in southern Lebanon and in 
South Beirut does not reflect an adequate application of the principles of military necessity and 
proportionality.  The deliberate and indiscriminate targeting of civilian houses constitutes a 
violation of international humanitarian law and of international human rights obligations.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>320. All attacks on civilian infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airport and ports, water 
facilities, factories, farms and shops, in particular far from the confrontations in the South, even 
in cases of &#8220;dual use&#8221;, cannot be justified in each instance under military necessity and was 
disproportionate to the military advantage they provided.  They constitute a violation of Israel&#8217;s 
obligations under international humanitarian law to distinguish between military targets and 
civilian objects. 
</p><p>321. The attack on the Jiyyeh power plant led to a massive oil spill that polluted most of the 
Lebanese coast.  The failure of IDF to take the necessary precautionary measures violated 
Israel&#8217;s international law, international humanitarian law, and human rights obligations to protect 
the natural environment and the right to health.  In particular it caused significant damage to the 
Byblos archaeological site, included in the UNESCO World Heritage list, which equally 
contravened the same international obligation.   
</p>
<p>322. The targeting of civilian convoys was indiscriminate and constitutes a disproportionate 
use of force which violates Israel&#8217;s international humanitarian law and international human 
rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>323. By targeting clearly marked LRC and civil defence ambulances and personnel carrying 
out their activities, and by the direct attacks and the collateral damage caused to medical 
facilities, IDF committed a serious violation of customary and conventional international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>324. The deliberate attacks on places of worship, churches and mosques, were unjustified and 
go beyond the requirements of distinction and military necessity.  They constituted a serious 
violation of international humanitarian law obligations. 
</p>
<p>325. IDF attacks in the vicinity of sites listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List caused 
damage to protected property, particularly to archaeological sites in Baalbeck and Tyre, as well 
as in sites of historical importance to the Lebanese population, such as Chamaa, Khiyam, Tibnin, 
and Bent J&#8217;Beil.  These attacks violate Israel&#8217;s international humanitarian law obligation to 
undertake the necessary precautionary measures to avoid direct or indirect damage to especially 
protected cultural, historical and archaeological property. 
</p>
<p>326. Concerning the direct targeting of schools, the Commission did not find any evidence as 
to the effective military contribution of attacking buildings.  These attacks constitute, therefore, a 
grave violation of international humanitarian law and human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>327. Acts of vandalism against houses, schools and religious places by IDF constitute a 
particular violation of human rights and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>328. IDF warnings to civilians directing them to evacuate their homes were largely ineffective.  
Civilians were attacked when doing so, and evacuation was physically impossible.  The principle 
of precaution aimed at sparing civilians from the effects of the conflict was not respected.  The 
use of warning leaflets of a propaganda nature does not meet international humanitarian law 
obligations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>329. The direct attacks on UNIFIL/OGL positions by IDF cannot be justified on grounds of 
military necessity.  These attacks constitute a clear violation of international law and 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>330. There is some evidence that Hezbollah used towns and villages as &#8220;shields&#8221; for their 
firings.  At the same time, evidence points to such use when most of the civilian population had 
departed the area.  The Commission found no evidence regarding the use of &#8220;human shields&#8221; by 
Hezbollah.  However, there was evidence of Hezbollah using UNIFIL and Observer Group 
Lebanon posts as deliberate shields for the firing of their rockets. 
</p>
<p>331. The Commission has formed a clear view that, cumulatively, the deliberate and lethal 
attacks on civilians and civilian objects, including protected religious property, protected cultural 
and historical property, and items essential to the survival of the civilian population; the 
collateral damage caused to protected cultural and historical properties; the attacks against 
protected personnel, including LRC and Civil Defence; the indiscriminate and disproportionate 
nature of these attacks; the wilful targeting of fleeing civilians; and the gratuitous and wanton 
destruction of civilian property and civilian infrastructure offering no clear and unambiguous 
military advantage, amount to collective punishment. 
</p>
<p>332. The abduction of civilians on Lebanese territory and their unlawful transfer and detention 
in Israeli prisons, including their subjection to cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment 
contravene international humanitarian law and human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>333. Forced displacement of almost one million persons in and outside of Lebanon as a direct 
or indirect result of the indiscriminate attacks on civilians, civilian property and infrastructure, 
threats and fear arising there from, constitutes a violation of international law and human rights. 
</p>
<p>334. Failure to provide free and uninterrupted access for humanitarian assistance to civilian 
population in need, as well as the imposition of unnecessary movement limitations on 
humanitarian convoys constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law obligations 
to ensure access to humanitarian assistance and to provide security guarantees for their effective 
deployment. 
</p>
<p>335. Israel&#8217;s blockade of Lebanese airport and ports had a significant impact on human life, 
the environment and on the Lebanese economy.  It led to great suffering for the civilian 
population, damage to the environment, and substantial economic loss.  Therefore, it is a 
violation of essential principles of international law, international humanitarian law and human 
rights law. 
</p>
<p>336. None of the weapons known to have been used by IDF are illegal per se under 
international humanitarian law.  The manner in which these weapons were used raises questions 
regarding distinction and proportionality. 
</p>
<p>337. The use of cluster munitions by IDF was of no military advantage and was in 
contradiction to the principles of distinction and proportionality.  These were part of a 
widespread and systematic targeting of civilians and their property, thus causing great suffering, 
injury and death during and after the conflict.  The extent of the use of the munitions particularly 
during the last 72 hours of the conflict, points toward a plan by IDF. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>338. The widespread and systematic nature of messages relayed and communicated to the 
Lebanese population, the timing and manner in which they were relayed, and the inflammatory 
language used, bear out that they were intended to incite or otherwise provoke inter-confessional 
violence and civil disorder in Lebanon.  Given the particular political context in Lebanon, these 
acts amount to undue interference in Lebanese internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>339. The Commission&#8217;s conclusions concerning violations of human rights have been 
formulated from a general perspective coming from a fact-finding body and not from a human 
rights monitoring body.  For this purpose, the question of human rights violations can be 
addressed from two viewpoints: particular cases concerning well-identified individuals and cases 
targeting a large group of victims or part of the population. 
</p>
<p>340. The Commission examined during its inquiry different individual incidents and situations 
of a general character, taking into account the post-conflict situation in Lebanon.  Thus the 
Commission classifies its legal evaluation on two levels: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) In some cases where the attacks against civilians or their property were direct and 
deliberate, where abductions, transfers and detentions in Israel of civilians occurred, it can be 
consider that there is a violation of the right to life, the right to property, the interdiction of 
inhuman, humiliating and degrading treatment.  Moreover, these deliberate strikes against 
civilians amount in fact to summary and extra-judicial executions of persons (suspected or 
assimilated to terrorists-enemies).  It not only violated the fundamental rights of these persons 
(right to life, right to personal security, fair trial, non-discrimination) but also constitutes a very 
negative State practice, extremely disturbing for contemporary legal culture.  The particular 
attention of the international community is drawn to this; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) In a general framework, violations of the right to life, the right to education, the 
right to property, the right to a healthy environment, the right to voluntarily return home in safety 
(without limitations), the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for individuals and 
their families, including adequate food, clothing and housing and the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of just and favorable conditions of work are at issue. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The question of international responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>341. The Commission considers that the conflict gives rise to two pertinent issues.  Namely, 
(<i>a</i>) the international responsibility of Israel under international law, international humanitarian 
law and human rights and (<i>b</i>) the accountability of individuals, for serious international 
humanitarian law and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>342. It emerges clearly from all the facts and their legal analysis that IDF actions resulted in 
civilian deaths and injuries; destruction and damage to civilian properties and protected objects; 
and direct loss, damages and injuries to the Government of Lebanon and its people, including 
environmental harm.  In certain cases, such as the deliberate attacks against civilians and civilian 
properties, attacks against Red Cross ambulances and other protected objects, and the 
indiscriminate use of cluster munitions, the violations committed by IDF could qualify as serious 
violations of the laws and customs of war and war crimes<i>. </i></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>343. The cluster munitions issue is a very particular one.  There is ample evidence that cluster 
bombs were used in an indiscriminate manner and that many towns and villages were littered 
with the bomblets as well as large tracts of agricultural land.  For example, there is evidence of 
targeting directly on Tibnin, Nabatiyeh, Yahmor, Ain Ibel, Yaroun, Bent J&#8217;beil, Qfar Tibnit and 
Swane.  The concentration of cluster attacks in the area North of the Litani in the last 72 hours of 
the conflict is particularly difficult to justify as it is out of &#8220;Katyusha&#8221; range for targets in Israel.  
It is however a rich agricultural area.  The extent of the use cluster munitions by IDF goes 
beyond that required to interdict their opponents and points more towards a punitive use of 
weapon. 
</p>
<p>344. Israel infringed its international law, international humanitarian law and human rights 
obligations.  As a consequence, the question of its international responsibility arises.  It is worth 
recalling that the obligation of a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to put an 
end to that act is well established in general international law, and the existence of such a duty 
has been reiterated by ICJ.<b>285</b> 
</p>
<p>345. The Government of Israel was required to respect and ensure respect at all times for 
international humanitarian law and human rights by its armed forces.  These violations were not 
only committed by members of IDF but were part of a plan or policy.  The declarations of high 
military commanders that &#8220;we will turn Lebanon&#8217;s clock back 20 years&#8221;, and that &#8220;once inside 
Lebanon everything is legitimate&#8221; bears this out. 
</p>
<p>346. The conduct of military operations is regulated by a universally recognized body of legal 
prescriptions.  It is also well settled that serious violations of international humanitarian law 
entail individual criminal responsibility.<b>286</b>  As underscored by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, &#8220;war crimes and crimes against humanity may be committed 
even by those who believe, accurately or not, that their combat is a just one and their cause a 
worthy pursuit&#8221;.  She adds: &#8220;When&#8230; legal obligations regulating the conduct of hostilities are 
violated, personal criminal responsibility may ensue, particularly for those in position of 
command and control&#8221;.<b>287</b> 
</p>
<p>347. In this regard, first<i>, </i>grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I 
constitute war crimes and their violations entail individual responsibility.  Second, customary 
international law also provides for individual criminal responsibility for such breaches as well as 
for violations of the laws and customs of war and other serious violations of international 
humanitarian law.  Third, it must also be underlined that violations of a number of core human 
rights equally entail under the relevant international human rights instruments and customary 
international law individual responsibility.  The Commission&#8217;s report contains many indications 
of conduct that constitute serious international humanitarian law and human rights violations for 
which individual responsibility can be imputed.  These entail an obligation on the part of Israel 
to put to an end to serious breaches of international humanitarian law and human rights 
committed and to prosecute those responsible.  In this regard, the international community has its 
part of responsibility. 
</p>
<p>348. It is important that continued attention be given and efforts be undertaken by the Human 
Rights Council to ensure justice for the victims and accountability for international humanitarian 
law and human rights violations.  If not, the culture of impunity will not be brought to an end. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL</b> 
</p>
<p>349.<b> The Commission of Inquiry submits the following recommendations to the Human 
Rights Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Humanitarian assistance and reconstruction 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Considering the consequences of the conflict in Lebanon and its effects on the 
Lebanese population, notably in the South, the Human Rights Council should promote 
initiatives and call for the mobilization of the international community to assist Lebanon 
and its people.  The Council should consider the possibility of encouraging organs, agencies 
and institutions within the United Nations system to work together in a comprehensive and 
coordinated programme of cooperation with the Lebanese Government aimed at the 
improvement of living conditions, particularly in southern Lebanon, so that the civilian 
population can fully enjoy their human rights; 
 (b) The Council should encourage the United Nations system (UNESCO, UNEP, 
UNHCR, UNICEF, WHO), and the Bretton Woods institutions in their multi-sectoral 
programmes and projects to promote and undertake precise and concrete actions, 
including with professional and technical expertise in the necessary reconstruction efforts, 
e.g. buildings, bridges, cleaning of areas affected by clusters, environment, archaeological 
sites (Byblos); 
 (c) The Council should call upon the Secretary-General of the United Nations to 
undertake an evaluation of humanitarian assistance provided to civilians by the 
United Nations system and other humanitarian and relief organizations in Lebanon with a 
view to enhancing the right to immediate and unlimited access to humanitarian assistance 
for civilians in armed conflicts.  The Cargo Movement Notification Procedure and the 
notification or &#8220;concurrence procedure&#8221; should be part of this assessment; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Council should call for the mobilization of professional and technical 
expertise necessary to cope with the ecological disaster on maritime environment on the 
Lebanese coast and beyond.  In this context, it should useful to engage the Barcelona 
Convention system covering the Mediterranean Sea and Regional Marine Pollution 
Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean based in Malta; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Council should establish a follow-up procedure on the measures to be 
taken, notably for the recovery of Lebanon and above all the reparations of victims among 
the Lebanese civilian population; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Vulnerable groups (children) 
 (f) The Council should give careful attention to the fate of child victims of the 
armed conflict.  National institutions and specialised international agencies should work 
together to effectively assist the Lebanese government in the implementation of health 
programmes, rehabilitation projects and mental health care initiatives for children; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Respect for international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Council should promote and monitor the obligation to &#8220;respect and 
ensure respect&#8221; of the international humanitarian law by all parties in a conflict, including 
non-State actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) In order to establish responsibility for human rights violations, some aspects 
of the conduct of IDF need more legal inquiry, with full cooperation from both victims and 
the perpetrator; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Council should establish a follow-up procedure to monitor the human 
rights situation in Lebanon, taking into account the conclusions and recommendations of 
this report; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Weapons 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) The Council should take the initiative to promote urgent action to include 
cluster munitions to the list of weapons banned under international law.  The Council 
should request the relevant international bodies, including the Meetings of States Parties to 
the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional 
Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate 
Effects and to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and 
Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, to address the legality of some 
weapons particularly indiscriminate to the civilian population, including weapons which 
use depleted uranium; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) The scientific research currently under way in Lebanon and abroad on the 
effects of certain weapons used during the conflict needs to be continued.  The results will 
be decisive in the examination of the lawfulness of certain &#8220;new weapons&#8221; in the light of 
international humanitarian law.  The Council should encourage these efforts and follow-up 
developments; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) The Council should strongly call upon Israel to immediately hand over to 
UNIFIL and the Government of Lebanon full and detailed information on the use, and of 
all coordinates of cluster munitions launched in Lebanon to enable timely clearance of 
unexploded ordnance (UXO), avert continued death toll and injury, enable the return of 
displaced persons to their communities and resumption of normal social and economic life; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Redress violations of humanitarian law and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) It is important to address and promote legal means for individuals to redress 
violations of human rights and humanitarian law during conflicts.  This is an urgent issue 
for particular regions and countries not covered by existing human rights mechanisms.  
Once more, the issue of individual complaints concerning violations of international 
humanitarian law arises; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (n) The Commission draws the attention of the Council to the serious lacunae in 
international law, international humanitarian and human rights as regards the possibility 
of victims to seek and obtain reparations and compensation.  In this regard, the 
Commission proposes that the Council could explore possibilities aimed at the creation of a 
commission competent to examine individual claims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) A commission of arbitration could be envisaged between the interested 
parties to examine issues of reparations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) The Commission calls upon the Council to follow closely, and the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights to grant whatever assistance it can to the 
Lebanese Parliamentary Human Rights Committee for it to complete its comprehensive 
investigation into &#8220;reported killings&#8221; and other alleged serious international humanitarian 
law and human rights violations.</b></p>

<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 in which the Assembly 
decided that the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Should address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and 
systematic violations, and make recommendations thereon; and 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Shall respond promptly to human rights emergencies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, relevant human rights instruments and 
international humanitarian law, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 on the 
Laws and Customs of War on Land which prohibit attacks and bombardment of civilian 
populations and objects and lay down obligations for general protection against dangers arising 
from military operations against civilian objects, hospitals, relief materials and means of 
transportation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the commitments of the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions 
of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that each High Contracting Party to the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) is under obligation 
to take action against persons alleged to have committed or to have ordered the commission of 
grave breaches of the Convention, and recalling the Convention on the Non-Applicability of 
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing </i>that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the right to life constitutes the most fundamental of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Condemning</i> Israeli military operations in Lebanon, which constitute gross and 
systematic human rights violations of the Lebanese people, 
</p>
<p> <i>Appalled</i> at the massive violations of the human rights of the people of Lebanon by Israel 
resulting in the massacre of thousands of civilians, injuries, extensive damage to civilian 
infrastructure, displacement of one million people, and outflows of refugees fleeing heavy 
shelling and bombardment against the civilian population, 
</p>
<p> <i>Strongly condemning</i> the indiscriminate and massive Israeli air strikes, in particular on 
the village of Qana on 30 July 2006, and the targeting of United Nations peacekeepers at the 
United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon on 25 July 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the strong condemnation by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights of the killing of civilians in Qana, her call to take measures to protect civilian 
lives and civilian objects and her reiteration of the need for independent investigation, with the 
involvement of international experts, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting the extreme concern</i> expressed by the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights of internally displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food about the continuing adverse impact on the human rights and the 
humanitarian situation of the civilian population in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that attacks and killings of innocent civilians and the destruction of houses, 
property and infrastructure in Lebanon are a breach of the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations, international law and international humanitarian law as well as flagrant 
violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the urgent need to address the dire humanitarian situation in Lebanon, 
including through the immediate lifting of the blockade of Lebanon imposed by Israel, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> the environmental degradation caused by Israeli strikes against 
power plants and their adverse impact on health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> at the targeting of the communication and media networks in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> <i>Outraged</i> at the continuing senseless killings by Israel, with impunity, of children, 
women, the elderly and other civilians in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the grave Israeli violations of human rights and breaches of 
international humanitarian law in Lebanon; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns</i> the massive bombardment of Lebanese civilian populations, especially 
the massacres in Qana, Marwaheen, Al Duweir, Al Bayadah, Al Qaa, Chiyah, Ghazieh and other 
towns of Lebanon, causing thousands of deaths and injuries, mostly among children and women, 
and the displacement of one million civilians, according to a preliminary assessment, thus 
exacerbating the magnitude of the human suffering of the Lebanese;

<p><i>&#8220;He who says he is protecting you, is really robbing you.&#8221; 
&#8220;To all citizens south of the Litani River 
Due to the terror activities being carried out against the State of Israel from within your 
villages and homes, the IDF is forced to respond immediately against these activities, even 
within your villages. 
For your safety!!! 
We call upon you to evacuate your villages and move north of the Litani River.

Read this announcement and act accordingly 
Rockets are being fired against the State of Israel from your area. 
The IDF will operate at full force against these terrorist groups effective immediately. 
For your own safety, you must leave the area immediately, and travel northwards.  Anyone 
who remains is putting himself in danger.

<p><i>&#8220;To the partisans of Hezbollah<b></b></i><b>292</b><i> 
For whom are you fighting and offering your lives? 
Is it for your leaders who have left you on your own at the time when you were not ready for 
combat, without proper equipment and in a state of starvation? 
Is it for leaders who deny the death of your comrades and do not reward them with the 
promised honour and dignity? 
Your leaders betrayed you!!! 
Many of your comrades understood that there is no one on whom they can rely on and they 
have fled the battle. 
Join them 
Surrender or flee as far away as you can to save yourself

interests. 
The only way for you is to surrender&#8221;.<b>

<p><i>&#8220;To the Lebanese citizens, 
The Hezbollah that is serving Iranian and Syrian interests has driven you to the edge.

from Lebanon against the State of Israel.

Southern Lebanon is a combat zone.  Hezbollah terrorists are operating in your area, and you

out from your area and from Lebanon against the State of Israel.</i> 
<i>All vehicles, of any type, travelling in the aforementioned area are liable to be attacked, 
endangering those travelling in the vehicles.  Any person who violates these instructions

southern Lebanon.&#8221;

<p><b>UNITED NATIONS HUMANITARIAN CARGO MOVEMENT  
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE 
</b></p>
<p>Source: OCHA - HCCC  
</p>
<p>Activities: Supply Chain  
</p>
<p>Type of document: Procedure  
</p>
<p>Country: LB LBN 422 Lebanon, Lebanese Republic  
</p>
<p>Publication date: 2006-Jul-28 
</p>
<p> Global overview of the cargo procedures to facilitate the safe delivery of humanitarian 
relief materials into and throughout Lebanon. 
</p>
<p><b>Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. To facilitate the supply of humanitarian relief materials to Lebanon, the United Nations is 
working to establish humanitarian corridors into and within Lebanon.  The management 
and movement of all United Nations humanitarian cargo on these corridors will be 
controlled by a United Nations Humanitarian Cargo Coordination Center (HCCC) in 
Beirut that will be managed by the World Food Programme (WFP) in support of the 
entire United Nations system.  The HCCC will vet all cargo movement requests and 
schedule the route and timetable of proposed convoys.  The HCCC will also consider and 
manage cargo movement requests from NGOs.  United Nations managed and chartered 
vehicles, aircraft and vessels will be used unless otherwise agreed.   
</p>
<p>2. Sea Corridors: Humanitarian corridors from the sea are envisioned into the ports of 
Beirut, Tripoli, Saida and Tyre.  For seaborne cargo, it is estimated that up to three (3) 
feeder vessels will operate from ports in the eastern Mediterranean.   
</p>
<p>3. Land and Air Corridors: Humanitarian corridors on land are envisioned from the northern 
border town of Aarida to Beirut and from Beirut to cities and towns in southern Lebanon.  
Conditions permitting, an air corridor may be established into Beirut International 
Airport.   
</p>
<p>4. Within Lebanon, deliveries to the affected areas will be carried out by a United Nations 
managed fleet comprised of one hundred (100) short haul 10 metric tonnes capacity 
trucks, capable of traversing damaged roads and difficult terrain.  United Nations 
Agencies and NGOs will hand over their cargo to WFP at five United Nations managed 
facilities (to be designated), a minimum of 48 hours prior to dispatch.  The relief cargo 
will be consolidated and prioritised for dispatch.  Deliveries will be made using 
United Nations managed and marked trucks in convoys.  Convoys will always be 
escorted by at least two (2) United Nations marked Land-cruisers. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Proposed Notification Procedure 
</b></p>
<p>5. Beirut Cell: 
</p>
<p>(a) At least 48 hours in advance of the estimated time of departure (ETD) requesting 
agencies will submit the United Nations Cargo Movement Notification to the 
HCCC.   
</p>
<p> (The HCCC points of contact in Beirut will be published soon.)  
</p>
<p>(b) Eighteen (18) hours prior to the estimated time of departure (ETD), WFP will 
notify the IDF via UNTSO and the Lebanese Government of the convoy details. 
</p>
<p>(c) WFP will provide a liaison officer to the Lebanese Army to facilitate the 
processing of cargo movement notification. 
</p>
<p>6. Jerusalem Cell: 
</p>
<p>(a) A cell will be established at UNTSO HQ in Jerusalem to be staffed by 
UNTSO/UNSCO/WFP/OCHA.  Personnel.  The cell will manage all 
United Nations-IDF communications regarding United Nations controlled 
humanitarian operations in Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>(b) The HCCC will transmit to the Jerusalem Cell all cleared Movement Notification 
requests.  The Jerusalem Cell, will acknowledge receipt and will forward these 
requests to the IDF Humanitarian Coordination Center in Tel Aviv.  This 
notification will be confirmed by telephone. 
</p>
<p>(c) Upon receipt of a response from the IDF, the Jerusalem cell will inform the 
HCCC in Beirut no later than 12 hours ahead of the ETD.  The Beirut cell will in 
turn notify the relevant United Nations agency or NGO.  No convoy will proceed 
without receiving such confirmation. 
</p>
<p>7. A request by the United Nations to provide a liaison officer to the IDF Humanitarian 
Coordination Centre in Tel Aviv is under consideration by Israeli authorities. 
</p>
<p>8. Queries should normally be made to the Beirut cell as noted above. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Annex XI 
</b></p>
<p><b>LIST OF WEAPONS USED - CLUSTER MUNITIONS 
</b></p>
<p> From the Commission&#8217;s investigations it was apparent that the IDF used the following 
main weapons systems during the conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Aircraft 
</b></p>
<p> The IDF used their full inventory of fighter, transport, helicopter and surveillance 
aircraft.  The fighter aircraft were equipped with dumb as well as smart precision guided laser 
bombs.  Helicopters were of the troop transport type or provided platforms for weapons such as 
such as the US-built Apache.  These weapons would be a combination of cannon and missiles.  
The latter were probably of the Spike-ER (Extended Range) missile, Hellfire or TOW.   
</p>
<p><b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (&#8220;drones&#8221;) 
</b> These were reported by a large number of witnesses as being employed by the IAF 
throughout the war.  It is apparent that in addition to their main role as surveillance aircraft, the 
IDF have also developed an armed UAV capability which was again reported by witnesses as 
being used on a number of occasions.  The armament of this UAV might well be compatible 
with the anti-tank variety of missile carried by their helicopters.  Informed sources suggest these 
UAVs are presently capable of carrying 2 or 3 such missiles probably of the Israeli produced 
Spike variety.  The Spike missile is small.  It weighs around 5.3 pounds and is approximately 
25 inches long.  It is capable of being flown into a target from a UAV by an operator or as a &#8216;fire 
and forget system&#8217;.  The air vehicles involved are believed to be Israeli Aircraft Industries 
Herons which have only very recently (early 2006) entered operational service.  Israel also 
operates IAI Searcher II and Elbit Hermes 450 S unmanned air vehicles both of which would be 
capable of carrying at least two Spike missiles.  Lebanese army sources told the Commission that 
the so-called MKs (translated as Mother of Kamel), the local generic name for the UAVs, carry 
3 missiles.  The UAVS are operated from a base inside Israel and on occasion from forward 
tactical sites.  Once a target is spotted, mission control would forward the coordinates back to the 
IAF command post in Tel Aviv.  From there it would be sent to one of the many fighter jets or 
attack helicopters hovering over Lebanon around the clock.   
</p>
<p><b>Artillery 
</b></p>
<p> The Israeli <b>Artillery Corps</b> is the IDF corps responsible for operating its medium and 
long-range artillery assets.  During the conflict much was heard of their 155 mm self-propelled 
guns and the Multi Launch Rocket System (MLRS) described above in the section on cluster 
bombs.  The ground based troops were also supported by <b>Naval Gun Fire</b> <b>Support</b> from Israeli 
naval assets operating off the Lebanese coast. 
</p>
<p><b>Main Battle Tanks 
</b></p>
<p> The Merkava is the main battle tank used by the Israeli armed forces.  The tank is 
equipped with a 120 mm gun and with three 7.62 mm machine guns, two roof mounted and one 
co-axial with the main gun.  The tank&#8217;s fire control system includes modern components, whose 
capabilities are very high in detection range and target acquisition.  The night vision system is </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>based on the world&#8217;s leading thermal technology.  The tank carries an ammunition store of 
50 rounds of 120 mm ammunition.  The tank carries a store of 10,000 rounds of 7.62 mm 
ammunition.  The tank also utilizes a sophisticated Battle Management System (BMS).   
</p>
<p><b>Cluster Munitions 
</b></p>
<p> Cluster munitions consist of a canister which breaks apart above the ground to release a 
large number of small bombs.  These are known as &#8220;bomblets&#8221; if delivered by air or &#8220;grenades&#8221; 
if delivered by artillery or rocket systems.  A single artillery shell disperses these grenades over 
an area as large as two football pitches.  Air-delivered cluster bombs saturate an area twice that 
size.  A range of this ammunition has been developed and is designed specifically to target 
military objectives such as tanks, artillery locations, vehicles or troops; some have an incendiary 
capability.  There is a significant &#8220;dud rate&#8221;.  Official figures place this generally at between 
1 and 5%.  However in the Lebanon conflict, dud rates as high as 40% have been reported.<b>295</b>  
In other words, many of the bomblets did not explode but, rather like anti-personnel mines, they 
litter the ground with the potential to explode at any time later.  Dud rates of 40% translate into 
approximately 250 unexploded bomblets for each MRLS rocket fired.  The number of M 85 duds 
is most striking as this ammunition has a built-in self destruct feature which apparently did not 
function correctly.   
</p>
<p> From the information made available to the Commission, Israel has in its arsenal cluster 
munitions which can be delivered by aircraft, artillery and rockets.  The following cluster 
munitions were used by Israel in Lebanon during the conflict:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Ground Based  
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>M483A1 155mm artillery shells </b>each of which deliver 88 dual-purpose (anti-material 
and anti-personnel) grenades.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>M 395 and M 396 Israeli manufactured 155 mm artillery shells</b>.  These contain 63 
and 49 M85 cluster grenades respectively.  They also have a built-in self destruct device.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)</b>.  The MLRS is a versatile weapon 
system that supplements traditional artillery.  It delivers large volumes of firepower in a 
short time against critical, time-sensitive targets.  The system consists of a tracked 
launcher capable of launching two munitions pods of six rockets.  Each rocket 
(US manufactured M26) contains 644- M77 cluster grenades, designed to detonate on 
impact.  The anti-materiel capability is provided through a shaped charge which can 
penetrate up to four inches of armour.  Its steel case fragments and produces 
antipersonnel effects with a radius of 4 m.  A volley of 6 rockets would release 
3,864 cluster bombs over an area covering a one kilometre radius. 
</p>
<p><i>Air Dropped 
</i></p>
<p> Israel also used the CBU-58 cluster bomb.  It is loaded with 650 bomblets (BLU-63).  
These bomblets contain 5-gram titanium pellets, making them incendiary and useful against 
flammable targets.   </p>

<p>  Under International law, the entitlement to resort to self-defence under article 51 of the 
United Nations Charter is subject to the conditions of necessity and proportionality.  Beyond 
these conditions, article 51 requires that measures taken by States in the exercise of the right of 
self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council.  See Military and Paramilitary

<p>  This type of bomb would have a delayed type of fuse.  It would slice through the floors of the 
house and penetrate deep below it before exploding (hence the swelling effect).  Press 
speculation, reports of such bombs being transited through the United Kingdom as well as 
informed specialist military publications (e.g. Aviation Weekly) point to the use by the IDF of 
GBU -28 munitions.  The house had been hit by a precision-guided bomb delivered from an 
aircraft, causing little immediate collateral damage to adjoining buildings.  The deep crater, 
together with the witness&#8217;s description of the ground swelling up beneath him, points to a deep 
penetration &#8220;Bunker Buster&#8221; type bomb quite possibly with a depleted uranium warhead.

<b>83
</b></p>
<p>  None of the Lebanese Red Cross or UNIFIL rescuers who first arrived at the scene, 
respectively around 6 &#189; and 8 &#189; hours after the building was attacked and who cleared the 
debris to evacuate survivors, has made any allusion to the discovery of any destroyed 
ammunition or arms cache at the site.  The information available is that all persons who were 
killed were in fact civilians, 17 of them children.  There is no reason to believe that any 
Hezbollah fighter was among the dead. 
<b>84
</b></p>
<p>  This is supported by the fact that it took Lebanese Red Cross vehicles from its Tyre Centre 
some 5 &#189; hours to reach the area and, even then, it took them another two hours to arrive at the 
site. 
<b>85
</b></p>
<p>  These findings are consistent with those reflected also in, Human Rights Watch.  Fatal 
Strikes - Israel&#8217;s Indiscriminate Attacks Against Civilians in Lebanon, Vol. 18. No. 3 (E), 
August 2006, pp. 32-34.

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>86
</b>  According to international humanitarian law, the dead must always be respected, their 
</p>
<p>remains should be recovered, and steps should be taken to prevent them from being despoiled or 
mutilated. 
<b>87
</b></p>
<p>  GC Additional Protocol I, article 52(2).  It would be very difficult, for example, for the IDF to 
claim that the whole town was a military objective and that every house was &#8220;by its nature, 
location, purpose or use making an effective contribution to military action&#8221;.  Nor could the IDF 
reasonably claim that the total or partial destruction of such buildings, in the circumstances 
ruling at the time, offered a definite military objective. 
<b>88
</b></p>
<p>  See section B.II.n, Use of weapon. 
<b>89
</b></p>
<p>  For example, heavy fighting had taken place in and around the market area.  The walls in this 
part of the town were extensively pot-marked with small and medium caliber weapons.  Press 
reports, as well as IDF statements, suggest attempts by the IDF to take the town using both the 
Golani and Paratrooper Brigades.  The fact that these two regular army units failed to take the 
town, again points to the strong resistance of the Hezbollah fighters.

Commission saw a long row of peaches, now rotten, that were outside the building and which 
had been ready to be loaded at the time of the bombing.

<p>  This difference can be explained by the fact that some of those injured died later on when

<p>  The very large crater on the road and surrounding verges points to a much larger weapon than 
a naval gun, helicopter or drone missile.  One of the cars, however, still in place had an obvious 
missile penetration hole in its roof and it was virtually destroyed by this and subsequent fire.

<p>no doubt combined initial intelligence information, probably relayed from a drone, some naval 
gun fire and final strikes from an aircraft or a helicopter.  It also clearly involved a separate 
follow-up strike on the two fleeing civilians.

<p>  Their itinerary was as follows: Ebel el Sahi - Blat Valley - Hasbaye - Kfeir - Alfordim - 
West Bekaa (Rachaya - Rafid - Jib Jenine).

<p>  The two APCS left the convoy at Hasbaye.  There was no truck other than those of the 
Lebanese Army, which were all in the front of the convoy.  Next to the bridge of Kefraya 
(about two hours after the UNIFIL APCs left the convoy). 
<b>102
</b></p>
<p>  Next to the bridge of Kefraya, just before the current checkpoint of the Lebanese Army, the 
convoy was hit by nine missiles.  The first strike hit the first vehicle, the second hit the last 
vehicle, and other missiles hit vehicles in the middle of the convoy.  The Commission was told 
that the cars had white flags on their roofs and their lights were on.  The Israeli authorities knew 
that it was a convoy as it set out on its way in front of elements of the IDF.  The 9 munitions 
were launched in a short period of time.  The 8 people who died were directly hit by the strikes.  
Once the convoy was attacked, the Lebanese Red Cross was called.  However, one of their 
ambulances was hit while the rescue workers were assisting injured persons, killing one of the 
LRC volunteers.  This happened about 20 minutes after the initial attack.

humanitarian aid and personnel be improved.  In particular, Mr. Kellenberger was extremely 
concerned about the insufficient access for the ICRC and the Lebanese Red Cross to areas most 
affected by the fighting. Since the early days of the conflict, the ICRC has been able to return to

 <p> 
</p>
<p>

<p>those areas only sporadically and always under incredibly difficult security conditions.  &#8220;The 
time for improved access is long overdue,&#8221; insisted Mr. Kellenberger. &#8220;Even life-saving, 
emergency evacuations so desperately needed are, at best, delayed for days.  We also face 
enormous obstacles to bringing in aid convoys loaded with essential foodstuffs, water and 
medicines for trapped civilians.&#8221;

<p>  According to UNIFIL and UNMACC sources. 
<b>218
</b></p>
<p>  DU gives a shell or bomb far greater penetration of armour or of hardened bunkers.  It could 
have been utilized in tank ammunition.  However, this capability was probably not required by 
the IDF as their opponents did not possess the sophisticated armour capability to warrant its use.  
It is possible that aircraft dropping precision bunker busting bombs of the Guided Bomb Unit -

<p>  The weapon can be launched from drones and is said to produce microscopic particles which 
cannot be seen by x-ray machines.  It is reputed to comprise a carbon-fiber casing filled with 
tungsten powder and explosives.  In the explosion, tungsten particles are spread at very high 
temperature causing death.

&#8220;Damage to medical facilities combined with shortages of fuel, power, water and supplies have 
had a major impact on service delivery throughout the districts affected by the conflict.  There is 
a serious gap, for example, in maternal and child care services.  Just one in four primary health 
care facilities are able to provide pre-natal care, and just one in 10 can support proper delivery

stayed in their village, along with the elderly, in order to take care of the tobacco plantations and

Environment, as well as from experts in the Lebanese Council for Scientific Research, that large 
quantities of sunken oil had affected algae and plankton that nourish migratory fish banks along 
the Lebanese coast.  Variations in the quantity of fish and in the variety of fish species will also 
affect migratory birds.  Furthermore, as indicated by the Director of the Lebanese National 
Centre of Marine Sciences, certain turtle species, typical to the Lebanese waters, were adversely 
affected and their survival may be endangered.  Moreover, a large percentage of the oil spilled 
had emulsified and solidified along the Lebanese shore, thus polluting sand, rock and stone and, 
therefore, constituting a permanent threat to the ecosystem.
