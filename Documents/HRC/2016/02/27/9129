<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development convened its ninth session 
in Geneva from 18 to 22 August 2008, in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 4/4.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group was established by the Commission on Human Rights, in its 
resolution 1998/72, and by the Economic and Social Council, in its decision 1998/269, with a 
mandate (a) to monitor and review progress made in the promotion and implementation of the 
right to development as elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, at the 
national and international levels, providing recommendations thereon and further analysing 
obstacles to its full enjoyment, focusing each year on specific commitments in the Declaration; 
(b) to review reports and any other information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, 
other relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations on the 
relationship between their activities and the right to development; and (c) to present for the 
consideration of the Commission on Human Rights a sessional report on its deliberations, 
including advice to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) with regard to the implementation of the right to development, and suggesting 
possible programmes of technical assistance at the request of interested countries with the aim of 
promoting the implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>3. The high-level task force was established by the Commission, in its resolution 2004/7, and 
the Economic and Social Council, by its decision 2004/249, at the recommendation and within 
the framework of the Working Group, in order to assist it in fulfilling its mandate. In its 
resolution 2005/4, the Commission requested the task force to examine Millennium 
Development Goal 8, on a global partnership for development, and to suggest criteria for its 
periodic evaluation with the aim of improving the effectiveness of global partnerships with 
regard to the realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>4. The Council, in its resolution 4/4, and the General Assembly, in its resolution 62/161, 
endorsed the road map for implementation of the mandate of the high-level task force, as 
outlined in the report of the Working Group on its eighth session (A/HRC/4/47, paras. 52 to 54). 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Chairperson-Rapporteur, Arjun Sengupta (India), opened the ninth session of the 
Working Group. In his statement, the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that the right to 
development was now accepted as a composite human right involving corresponding obligations 
for duty-bearers for its phased realization. The pilot application of the criteria in relation to 
Millennium Development Goal 8 represented a great opportunity to understand and decide, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The ninth session was originally scheduled for 25 to 29 February 2008, but was postponed and 
</p>
<p>rescheduled (see A/HRC/8/8). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>through consultation, the different values attached to the different rights and best possible 
methods of implementation. He believed that the Working Group and the high-level task force 
had demonstrated a pragmatic approach, which was required in helping to develop social 
consensus and infusing the process with clear goals, checklists and a road map. It was an 
approach rightly welcomed by the Council. He emphasized that the process required continuing 
political support in order to confront challenges which lay ahead, such as the extension of the 
development discourse beyond Millennium Development Goal 8 and the formulation of binding 
obligations, whether in the form of a legally binding instrument, a set of guidelines or a code of 
conduct. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Organization of work and adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>6. At its first meeting, on 18 August 2008, the Working Group adopted the agenda of the 
ninth session on the basis of the provisional agenda (A/HRC/WG.2/9/1/Rev.1) (see annex I). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>7. The list of attendance is contained in annex II. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Working Group had before it the provisional agenda (A/HRC/WG.2/9/1/Rev.1) 
and the report on the fourth session of the high-level task force, held in Geneva from 7 
to 15 January 2008 (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Consideration of the report of the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development and consideration 
of next steps  
</b></p>
<p>9. Cuba made a general statement on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, with which 
China associated itself. It stressed that the fourteenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, 
held in Havana in September 2006, called for the elevation of the right to development to the 
same level and on a par with all other human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as to its 
full operationalization through the elaboration of a convention. This concept had been repeatedly 
reaffirmed by the international community, including by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 62/161. More than 20 years have passed since the adoption of the Declaration on the 
Right to Development. Nevertheless, the gap between developed and developing countries 
continues to widen owing to the effect of a number of obstacles: the impact of globalization, 
unfair trade rules and practices, inadequate international cooperation, reductions in and failure to 
comply with official development assistance (ODA) commitments, debt burdens and lack of 
democracy in decision-making in international trade, financial and monetary institutions. These 
obstacles must be comprehensively addressed by the international community if it wants to move 
the right to development from conceptual debate to full operationalization. The Non-Aligned 
Movement believes that Millennium Development Goal 8 embodies important features of 
international cooperation and holds the key to meeting the other seven Goals. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. France made a general statement on behalf of the European Union, Turkey, Croatia, the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, 
Liechtenstein, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia. The European Union remains firmly 
committed to the realization of the right to development and fully supports the road map agreed 
to at the eighth session of the Working Group and endorsed by the Council in its resolution 4/4. 
The European Union believed that States had the responsibility to create internal conditions 
favourable to their development and to cooperate on an international level to eliminate obstacles 
to development. It welcomed the work of the high-level task force in further refining the criteria 
in the light of lessons learned from their application and with a view to making them more 
applicable and widely acceptable. Extension of the criteria to target 8.E of Millennium 
Development Goal 8 (access to affordable essential drugs in developing countries) was also 
welcomed in that it would allow a right to development review of the trade dimension of 
intellectual property rights and health. It could also incorporate the work of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health, the World Bank and public-private partnerships involved in the 
pharmaceutical industry, aiming to help around 2 billion poor people lacking access to 
life-saving and health-supporting medicines. In conclusion, the European Union supported the 
recommendations of the fourth session of the task force, which were aimed at further improving 
the quality of the criteria. 
</p>
<p>11. Egypt, speaking on behalf of the Group of African States, endorsed the statement of the 
Non-Aligned Movement. It believed that Council resolution 4/4 reaffirmed the importance and 
centrality of the right to development and made its realization and operationalization one of its 
key objectives and a fundamental part of its mandate. The resolution constituted a strong vote of 
confidence in the Working Group and its task force, recognizing the progress it has helped 
achieve in recent years in the debate on the right to development, including the definition of the 
principles underpinning the right to development, as well as the identification of the numerous 
elements covered in this right. The African Group welcomed the continued focus of both the task 
force and the Working Group on Millennium Development Goal 8. Furthermore, it made a 
number of observations with regard to the implementation and operationalization of the right to 
development, periodic evaluation of various partnerships, the need to make the criteria concrete, 
technical missions and Millennium Development Goal target 8.E. 
</p>
<p>12. Pakistan made a general statement on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference. It noted that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals was 
fundamentally a test of global partnerships for development, with a direct bearing on all other 
Goals. The Organization expressed concern that many of the Goal targets were yet to be realized, 
including those under Goal 8. The work of the Working Group was of critical importance in 
taking the right to development approach for progressive and sustainable development, as well as 
in pursuing Millennium Development Goals, to put growth and development on a long-term 
sustainable track. The need was expressed for greater participation of developing countries in 
international economic and financial decision-making, identification of new sources of financing 
for the poor and the removal of constraints arising out of aspects of intellectual property rights, 
tariff barriers and technology control regimes. By narrowing its focus on evaluating specific 
partnerships, the Working Group should not lose sight of the bigger picture. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>13. Thailand, in associating itself with the statement by the Non-Aligned Movement, 
encouraged the high-level task force to use a realistic and pragmatic approach in applying the 
criteria to various partnerships. In relation to targets 8.A to 8.F of Millennium Development 
Goal 8, it proposed that the task force obtain support from the United Nations and other 
international agencies instead of engaging in a new dialogue with other regional or subregional 
organizations. Apart from Goal 8, the global partnership should also cover other thematic areas, 
such as education, health and food. 
</p>
<p>14. China, supporting the statement of the Non-Aligned Movement, emphasized the lack of 
progress in attaining modest aspirations of achievement for development as set out in the 
Declaration on the Right to Development. It proposed a greater emphasis on the issues of trade, 
technology transfer and debt, as they were more important for developing countries and would 
target the criteria better. Furthermore, China stated that the clear aim of the right to development 
and the Millennium Development Goals was to support States and peoples by removing 
obstacles to development, both nationally and internationally. Therefore, the Working Group and 
the task force, in further enhancing the criteria, should focus on how to achieve the right globally 
and not focus on particular issues or impose human rights preconditions. 
</p>
<p>15. Switzerland supported the report of the task force in relation to its analysis of partnerships. 
In particular, it found the cooperation of relevant partners a positive indicator for the future work 
of the task force in analysing new partnerships. The delegation fully endorsed the 
recommendations of the task force at its fourth session. 
</p>
<p>16. Following these general statements, Stephen Marks, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
high-level task force, made a substantive presentation of the report on the fourth session of the 
task force (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2). The report contained the detailed conclusions of the 
evaluation of each of the identified partnerships, namely, the African Peer Review Mechanism; 
the ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness; the Paris Declaration on 
Aid Effectiveness; and the Cotonou Agreement between the European Union and African, 
Caribbean and Pacific countries. In this respect, he stressed that the task force&#8217;s approach to 
evaluation of the partnerships was not aiming at producing a &#8220;scorecard&#8221;, but rather at engaging 
in a cooperative process to test the criteria by applying them in a dialogue with partnerships. 
With regard to the evolution of the criteria, the task force had learned from experience that the 
application of the criteria provided the empirical basis for their progression and refinement. 
Mr. Marks further explained that the task force had decided to slightly revise and reorder the 
criteria in preparation for making them more analytically and methodically rigorous and capable 
of serving as empirically-based tools to be used to improve the effectiveness of global 
partnerships in the realization of the right to development. The task force required additional 
time and resources to work with the complex web of global partnerships while ensuring their 
geographical and thematic expansion. In conclusion, Mr. Marks acknowledged that the right to 
development was broader than Millennium Development Goal 8, but the task assigned to the task 
force was to work with partnerships as defined in that objective. It would therefore follow the 
guidance of the Working Group in achieving a thematic balance within Goal 8. He endorsed the 
widely shared view that, like other human rights, progress in realizing the right to development 
needed to be defined in a framework that focused on structure, process and outcome, hence the 
grouping of the criteria as they appear in annex II to the task force report. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. Following the above presentation, the Working Group made comments on (a) the work of 
the task force on the four existing partnerships; (b) additional partnerships, including geographic 
and thematic expansion; (c) the evolution of the criteria; and (d) the time frame for 
implementation of the road map. Representatives of the African Group, the African Union, 
Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Barbados, Brazil, Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned 
Movement), Egypt, Ethiopia, France (on behalf of the European Union), India, Pakistan (on 
behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference) and non-governmental organizations (3D 
and Friedrich Ebert Foundation) took the floor. 
</p>
<p>18. In relation to the task force&#8217;s review of the African Peer Review Mechanism, on which a 
number of delegations commented, Mr. Marks clarified that the references in the task force 
report to specific civil and political rights were included in order to reflect a wide range of issues 
raised in the discussions, but they must be seen in the broader context of the full examination of 
the Mechanism. On the broader issue of making judgements, Mr. Marks acknowledged that the 
mandate of the task force was ambiguous: it was assisting the Working Group in its mandate &#8220;to 
monitor and review progress (&#8230;) in promotion and implementation of the right to development&#8221; 
and developing criteria for &#8220;periodic evaluation with a view to improving the effectiveness of 
global partnerships&#8221;, which clearly involves evaluation, while at the same time its engagement 
with partnerships was not to be a basis for judging them. He recommended continuing 
assessments on the basis of dialogue and cooperation, not accusation, and welcomed suggestions 
that the task force should undertake consultations prior to any technical mission with the 
secretariat of the Mechanism or other partnerships in order to determine in advance how the 
mission could be of use to the partnership in question, while allowing the task force to test and 
improve the criteria. 
</p>
<p>19. Barbados commented that, with regard to the Cotonou Agreement, dialogue with the 
recipient countries would be useful to determine how the partnership was working, not only with 
regard to the human rights components of the agreement, but also whether issues such as access 
to technology, enhanced market access and the channelling of appropriate developmental support 
and assistance to countries and sectors, which may be affected by a loss of preferential access, 
were being addressed. It was suggested that the task force should liaise with the Caribbean 
Community secretariat or the Caribbean Regional Negotiating Machinery on this issue before 
any field visits. 
</p>
<p>20. During the discussion on thematic expansion referred to in paragraph 85 of the task force 
report, several speakers supported the proposals to expand thematically to other issues under 
Millennium Development Goal 8, such as access to affordable essential medicines, debt relief, 
trading and financial systems, the transfer of technology, and intellectual property. For thematic 
expansion, preference was expressed to evaluate global or north-south partnerships rather than 
regional, bilateral or south-south partnerships, as the former would allow the task force to 
examine the wider implications of thematic issues across the world. Comments were also made 
on the value of thematic evaluation of bilateral or regional partnerships as they also had thematic 
components. 
</p>
<p>21. At the request of the Working Group, two representatives from WHO briefed it on the 
work of the Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual 
Property and Millennium Development Goal target 8.E. It was acknowledged that target 8.E 
represented a complex thematic area in itself, as it included intellectual property, financial </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>assistance, technology transfer, procurement and pricing, research and development, 
international cooperation, local capacity-building and many issues that no one partnership 
covered. Consequently, the Working Group agreed that a desk review would be conducted of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group global strategy and plan of action, seeking clarifications 
where necessary from the Intergovernmental Working Group, with particular attention to the 
monitoring and evaluation process within the global strategy. The plan of action matrix was also 
considered a good example of a specific and consolidated approach to monitoring. The 
Working Group further agreed that more than one partnership should be studied to allow a 
broader basis for the task force to elaborate the criteria in relation to target 8.E, while taking into 
account the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. In this context, views were exchanged 
on the values of studying the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, 
the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and the Global Alliance 
for Vaccines and Immunization Alliance. 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to technology transfer, considered of particular importance in a number of 
interventions, a representative of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) gave a briefing on the work of the Commission on Science and Technology for 
Development, a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council. She outlined the 
substantive themes of the Commission for the next five years, including themes relating to the 
building of an information society, with a view to narrowing the digital divide, and to examining 
the implications of science and technology for development. Issues relating to technology 
transfer would be a part of these themes, but not the focus of the whole exercise. As potential 
partnerships for the task force to evaluate, other interventions suggested the Development 
Agenda of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which included a set of 
45 recommendations to enhance the development dimensions of the Organization&#8217;s activities, 
and the Clean Development Mechanism, which was mentioned as the most successful 
multilateral environmental agreement in the United Nations system, with a very good incentive 
mechanism. The Working Group agreed that the task force should examine first the Clean 
Development Mechanism, and then the WIPO Development Agenda, if the time frame and 
circumstances permitted, given that the workplan of WIPO might not fit in with the timeline of 
the task force&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>23. In a later discussion, in response to the remark made by Canada that technology transfer 
was not the language used in Millennium Development Goal 8, which referred instead to making 
available the benefits of technology, especially information and communications (target 8.F), the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur pointed out that it had been the understanding of the Working Group at 
its previous sessions and at the ninth session that &#8220;technology transfer&#8221; was a general term that 
included the specific references in Millennium Development Goal 8 and discussions around 
additional partnerships had been interpreted accordingly. 
</p>
<p>24. The issue of external debt was another area of global partnership that drew strong support 
in terms of thematic expansion. Reference was made to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 
Initiative, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and the Inter-American Development Bank as 
options for task force evaluation in this area. With respect to the review of the Heavily Indebted 
Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, it was suggested that the task 
force approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. With regard to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>task force&#8217;s reference to the Inter-American Development Bank, Argentina and other delegations 
expressed the view that debt should be examined as a global issue rather than a regional one, and 
that it was important to evaluate a global partnership in relation to that subject. 
25. In response to a query regarding the lack of reference in the task force report to the target 
of Millennium Development Goal 8 relating to trading and financial systems, Mr. Marks 
explained that the issue of trade was partially dealt with in the review of the Cotonou Agreement 
and in examining economic partnership agreements. Financing development was also covered by 
the task force, which hoped that the criteria developed in that respect would be relevant in 
evaluating<b> </b>trade and finance. 
</p>
<p>26. Concerning geographical expansion, the task force recommended a dialogue with 
MERCOSUR with a view to broadening the work of the task force thematically and regionally, 
as the modus operandi of this partnership combined trade, development and human rights issues. 
It was requested that the task force send a formal invitation to MERCOSUR to consider entering 
into a dialogue and the scope of such a dialogue, on the contributions of this partnership to the 
realization of the right to development and to the criteria refinement.  
</p>
<p>27. Commenting on the progressive development and refinement of the criteria, a number of 
delegations, including Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), Egypt (on behalf of the 
African Group) and Pakistan (on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference) 
expressed concern that there was too much emphasis on national obligations and responsibilities, 
while the principles of international cooperation and assistance were neglected. They requested 
an expansion of the scope to cover international cooperation, international trading and financial 
systems, including free trade agreements, official assistance for development, debt relief, 
elimination of poverty, technology transfer, capacity-building and other issues identified in 
Millennium Development Goal 8. 
</p>
<p>28. Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement) requested the task force to develop the 
criteria in a manner that reinforced the international dimension of the right to development, 
including the external obstacles to development faced by States which limit their capacity to 
ensure the full implementation of all human rights for all, notwithstanding that the lack of 
development may not be invoked to justify abridgement of international human rights law 
obligations assumed by States.  
</p>
<p>29. In response to the request by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group for 
specific comments on the criteria contained in annex II to the task force report, some delegates 
shared a view that the criteria had conceptual problems and their formulation lacked clarity. It 
was also suggested that they could be more concrete and practical so that they could help to 
measure progress. It was also noted that the criteria should not expect all partnerships to have 
been conceived to advance human rights or the right to development in particular. Some of the 
criteria, such as the extent to which a partnership establishes priorities that are responsive to the 
needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized segments of the population, with positive 
measures to realize their human rights, were said to be difficult to apply to all the partnerships. 
</p>
<p>30. The European Union, Switzerland and other delegations believed that the process and the 
work of the task force were proceeding in the right direction, and commended the work of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>task force in revising and reordering the criteria with a view to enhancing their relevance and 
applicability to global partnerships for development, both geographically and thematically. The 
European Union expressed its interest in the task force criteria expert meeting. 
</p>
<p>31. Welcoming the comments made by the delegations, Mr. Marks assured the Working Group 
that their observations would certainly be taken into account in the further refinement of the 
criteria. In relation to the perceived focus on the national dimension of the right to development, 
he made a few clarifications on the sources of the criteria, referring to the Declaration on the 
Right to Development, the priority concerns that emerged through discussions in the 
Commission on Human Rights and in the present Working Group, as well as the points raised in 
the reports of the independent expert on the right to development. Mr. Marks acknowledged that 
the methodology of drafting the criteria was reactive rather than methodical and stressed the 
need to think afresh with experts who had relevant experience in measuring progress towards 
complex development goals, through qualitative and quantitative indicators and criteria. In 
response, Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement) recalled that there were other 
important provisions of the Declaration on the Right to Development that had not yet been 
reflected in the criteria, and requested the task force to do so, especially those relating to the 
international dimension of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>32. A question was asked as to whether the criteria were meant to be generally and globally 
applicable to all partnerships or whether there was a need to devise different criteria for different 
themes and regions. Mr. Marks replied that the task force looked to the Working Group to 
address the ambiguity of whether the criteria were to be applicable to all kinds of partnerships or 
to particular areas of partnership. 
</p>
<p>33. Mr. Sengupta suggested five main themes from which the criteria could be drawn: 
(a) whether the partnership contributes to development with equity; (b) whether it promotes the 
right without violating any other right through a process of progressive realization; (c) whether 
the duty-bearers and duties are identified nationally and internationally; (d) whether there is a 
mechanism of monitoring and review, nationally and internationally, and whether appropriate 
indicators have been developed or can be developed; and (e) whether the process is consistent 
with equity, non-discrimination, participation, transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>34. At the request of Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), the secretariat provided 
the Working Group with the provisional time frame for implementation by the task force of the 
road map, which took into account the proposed additional partnerships to be evaluated by the 
task force. It was clarified that the road map, endorsed by the Council in its resolution 4/4, 
foresaw 2009 to cover the third phase, implying that the consolidated findings of the task force 
would be presented to the Working Group at its annual session in June 2010. Considering the 
explanation provided by the secretariat, the Working Group agreed to request the Council to 
extend accordingly the mandate of the task force in order to enable it to complete its tasks within 
the framework of the three-phase road map mentioned above. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Address of the acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. In her address, Kyung-wha Kang, acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, underlined the progress made by the Working Group in maintaining a sustained focus on 
the operational dimensions of the realization of the right to development through Millennium </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Development Goal 8, a framework compatible with the international responsibilities contained in 
the right to development. She underlined the importance of maintaining the consensus reached at 
the previous session of the Working Group as a demonstration of the political will of 
Member States to move the right to development from the realm of rhetoric to real practice. In 
recognizing the unique combination of the political will of Member States and the expertise of 
experts and institutional members, she expressed confidence that the Working Group would 
produce a consensus outcome towards further operationalization of the right to development, 
building on the achievements made in past sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>36. On the basis of the discussions in the Working Group, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
prepared and circulated a draft text for the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Working Group at its ninth session. The draft text was subsequently discussed, negotiated and 
amended by delegations. At its final meeting, on 22 August 2008, the Working Group adopted, 
by consensus, its conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. After the adoption of the conclusions and recommendations, several States and groups 
presented explanations of their positions with regard to the conclusions and recommendations. 
France (on behalf of the European Union) and Canada clarified that &#8220;other aspects&#8221; (para. 38) 
also included good governance, democracy and the rule of law at the domestic level. Cuba (on 
behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement) stated that &#8220;relevant provisions&#8221; in Council resolution 4/4 
(para. 41) referred to those leading to an &#8220;internationally legally binding convention&#8221;. In 
addition, it emphasized that &#8220;other aspects&#8221; referred to an ODA commitment of 0.7 per cent of 
gross national product, establishing a new international economic order and a fair economic 
system, as well as good governance and democracy at the international level, including in the 
functioning of international trade, financial and monetary institutions. Egypt, aligned with the 
Non-Aligned Movement, added that &#8220;other aspects&#8221;, such as good governance, democracy and 
the rule of law, should apply at both the national and international levels, and that &#8220;other 
instruments&#8221; also included the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Canada 
interpreted Council resolution 4/4 as in no way predetermining that the outcome of the Working 
Group&#8217;s efforts would be an international instrument on the right to development. In addition, 
Canada specified that the phrase &#8220;transfer of technology&#8221; should be interpreted as set out in 
Millennium Development Goal 8. Japan referred to the workplan as recommended by the 
Working Group and indicated that, as resources were not inexhaustible, they earnestly hoped that 
the task force would carry out its work in an appropriate manner, without any additional 
budgetary implications. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development for the work it has carried out in accordance with its 
mandate. The Working Group takes note of the report of the high-level task force and of its 
observations regarding the three development partnerships considered at its third session, and the 
preliminary assessment of the Cotonou Agreement between European Union and African, 
Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Working Group agrees that the next phase should cover 
further dialogue and follow-up with the four identified global development partnerships and pilot </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>applications of the criteria. Phases II and III should also allow the task force to examine 
additional thematic and regional areas under Millennium Development Goal 8, including 
technology transfer, debt relief, international cooperation and other aspects. 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group finds that the ongoing application of the criteria through a dialogue 
with the institutions responsible for the identified partnerships contributes to the improvement of 
the criteria and to promoting the implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group regards the present reordering of the criteria, in annex II to the task 
force report, as an intermediate stage and anticipates a significant refinement in phase III, 
including providing operational sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The Working Group recommends that the task force give priority to improving the 
criteria in the light of the lessons learned from their application and taking into account the 
Declaration on the Right to Development and other relevant international instruments as 
well as the views expressed by States at the current session, with a view to submitting, at 
the end of phase III, a revised list of criteria that serve the purposes set out in all relevant 
provisions of Council resolution 4/4. 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>In order to achieve the desired level of quality of the criteria, the Working Group 
requests the task force to draw on the necessary expertise to (a) make the criteria 
analytically and methodologically rigorous; (b) provide empirically-oriented tools to those 
involved in implementing development partnerships; and (c) ensure that they cover 
Millennium Development Goal 8, including target 8.A and other aspects not covered to 
date by the task force. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The Working Group recommends the following workplan for the task force for the 
period 2008-2010: 
</b></p>
<p><b>In phase II (2008) 
 The task force will: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Continue dialogue with the African Peer Review Mechanism, the 
ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness, the Paris Declaration on 
Aid Effectiveness and the Cotonou Agreement between African, Caribbean and Pacific 
countries and the European Union, including through technical missions, if necessary, 
subject to prior consultation; 
 (b) Give priority to the issue of access to essential medicines in developing countries 
(target 8.E). For this purpose, the Working Group recommends that the task force conduct 
a desk review of the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, 
Innovation and Intellectual Property, and apply the criteria to the Global Fund on 
HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Special Programme for Research and 
Training in Tropical Diseases. Dialogue with these partnerships would focus on health 
systems, technology transfer and other dimensions of access to affordable essential drugs 
relevant to the right to development; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Send, through OHCHR, a formal invitation to MERCOSUR to consider 
entering into a dialogue with the task force on the contributions of MERCOSUR to the 
realization of the right to development and to the development of the criteria, subject to an 
agreement between MERCOSUR and the high-level task force on the scope of the dialogue; 
</b></p>
<p><b>In phase III (2009) 
 The task force will: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Study the thematic issues of debt relief (targets 8.B and 8.D) and transfer of 
technology (target 8.F). With respect to the issue of debt relief, the Working Group 
recommends that the task force engage in a dialogue with the institutions responsible for 
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, 
subject to their agreement, and learning from the experience of these institutions how the 
criteria can be improved. Regarding technology transfer, the Working Group recommends 
that the task force examine the Clean Development Mechanism and the Development 
Agenda of WIPO; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Consolidate its findings and present a revised list of right to development 
criteria along with corresponding operational sub-criteria and outline suggestions for 
further work, including aspects of international cooperation not covered until then, for the 
consideration of the Working Group. 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>In view of their essential role and valuable contribution, the Working Group urges 
the institutional members of the task force representing international financial and 
development institutions, including the World Bank, UNDP, IMF, UNCTAD, WTO and 
WHO, as well as other relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the 
United Nations, to participate actively in the work of the task force. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>In order to implement the work programme outlined above and keeping the time 
frame in mind, the Working Group recommends that the Human Rights Council extend 
the mandate of the task force on the implementation of the right to development until the 
eleventh session of the Working Group in 2010. The Working Group also recommends that 
the Council extend its mandate until it completes the tasks entrusted to it by the Council in 
its resolution 4/4. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The Working Group appreciates the support rendered by OHCHR to the 
Working Group and the high-level task force and requests that it continue to provide all 
necessary assistance to these bodies in implementing the work programme outlined above. </b></p>
