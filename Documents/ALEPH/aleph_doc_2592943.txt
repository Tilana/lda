Board of Directors, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Segun
Omidele, the Company's then Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chief
Executive Officer.
2. Basis of Presentation and Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, and have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“U.S. GAAP”) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in
the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial
position and results of operations for the indicated periods. All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature. This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates based on certain assumptions. Estimates affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses attributable to the reporting periods. Accordingly, accounting
estimates in conformity with U.S. GAAP require the exercise of judgment. These estimates and
assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are
based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and while
management believes that the estimates and assumptions are appropriate, actual results could
differ from management's estimates.
 
Estimates that may have a significant effect on the Company’s financial position and results from
operations include share-based compensation assumptions, oil and natural gas reserve
quantities, impairments, depletion and amortization relating to oil and natural gas properties,
asset retirement obligation assumptions, and income taxes. The accounting estimates used in
the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements may change as new events
occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained and our operating
environment changes.
Capitalized Interest
The Company capitalizes interest costs for qualifying oil and gas properties. The capitalization
period begins when expenditures are incurred on qualified properties, activities begin which are
necessary to prepare the property for production, and interest costs have been incurred. The
capitalization period continues as long as these events occur. Capitalized interest is added to the
cost of

the underlying assets and is depleted using the unit-of-production method in the same manner as
the underlying assets.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company capitalized nil and $2.2
million, respectively, in interest cost as additions to property, plant and equipment related to the
Oyo field redevelopment campaign.
Treasury Stock
Treasury stock is reported at cost and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. Pursuant to the Company’s withholding tax policy with respect to vested restricted stock
awards, the Company may withhold, on a cashless basis, a number of shares needed to settle
statutory withholding tax requirements. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, 84,185
shares were withheld for taxes at a total cost of $0.2 million. The Company had no treasury stock
withheld for taxes during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the withholding and related
repurchases of our common stock during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

All shares repurchased were surrendered by employees to settle tax withholding obligations

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share
Basic net earnings or loss per common share is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the reporting
period. Diluted net earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings or loss by the
fully dilutive common stock equivalent, which consists of shares outstanding, augmented by
potentially dilutive shares issuable upon the exercise of the Company's stock options, stock
warrants, non-vested restricted stock awards, and conversion of the Convertible Subordinated
Note, calculated using the treasury stock method.
The table below sets forth the number of stock options, stock warrants, non-vested restricted
stock, and shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Subordinated Note that were
excluded from dilutive shares outstanding during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, as these securities are anti-dilutive because the Company was in a loss position
during each period.

ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or
sold (or settled) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The established framework for measuring fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on
the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and includes certain disclosure requirements.
Fair value estimates are based on either (i) actual market data or (ii) assumptions that other
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including estimates of risk.
There are three levels of valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The
valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three
different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The
three levels are defined as follows:
Level
1 -
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. The Company considers active markets as those
in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to
provide pricing information on an on-going basis.
Level
2 -
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly
or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Substantially all of these
inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the term, can be derived from
observable data, or supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in
the marketplace.
Level
3 -
Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement (including the
Company’s own assumptions in determining fair value).
The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value
measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or
liability.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, inventory, deposits, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, and debt at floating interest rates, approximate their fair values at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, principally due to the short-term nature, maturities or
nature of interest rates of the above listed items.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 consolidated financial statements to
conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications were not material to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-2 is aimed
at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all
leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and
corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU
2016-2 is effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and
interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company is still
evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments-Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. ASU No.
2016-07 eliminates the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting. ASU
No. 2016-07 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of
2017. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Consideration (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). ASU
No. 2015-08 requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2016-08 is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after

December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning
with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this standards update is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The areas of simplification
in ASU No. 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and the Company will adopt this
standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this
standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. ASU No. 2016-10 clarifies two
aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation
guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. ASU No. 2016-10 is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this
standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this
standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting
Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016
EITF Meeting. ASU No. 2016-11 rescinds SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in
Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas, effective
upon adoption of Topic 606. ASU No. 2016-11 is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this standards update, as
required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this standards update is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The core principle of ASU
No. 2016-12 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2016-12 is effective for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the Company will adopt this
standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this
standards update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
Adoption of Previously Issued ASUs
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs be
presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent
with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, the Company
recorded and presented debt issuance costs as part of prepaids and other current assets,
separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and
measurement requirement for debt issuance costs. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the
reclassification of approximately $1.6 million unamortized debt issuance costs related to the
Company's Term Loan Facility (see Note 8 - Debt) from prepaids and other current assets to
current portion of long-term debt within its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015.
Other than this reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2015-03 did not have an impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.
3. Liquidity Matters and Going Concern
The Company incurred losses from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company's total current liabilities of $275.7 million exceeded its total
current assets of $18.5 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $257.2 million. As a result
of the current low commodity prices and the Company’s low oil production volumes due to the
recent mechanical problem which was resolved earlier in the year associated with well Oyo-8,
the Company has not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain
obligations as they became due.
Well Oyo-7 is currently shut-in as a result of an emergency shut-in of the Oyo field production that
occurred in early July of this year. This has resulted in a loss of approximately 1,400 BOPD. The
Company is currently evaluating various technical options to optimize economic results from the
Oyo field, including but not limited to, attempting a nitrogen lifting exercise to bring back
production on well Oyo-7.

ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company is currently pursuing a number of actions, including (i) obtaining additional funds
through public or private financing sources, (ii) restructuring existing debts from lenders, (iii)
obtaining forbearance of debt from trade creditors, (iv) reducing ongoing operating costs, (v)
minimizing projected capital costs for the 2016 exploration and development campaign and (vi)
farming-out a portion of our rights to certain of our oil and gas properties. There can be no
assurances that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these actions or that these
actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations.
The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption
that it will continue as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of operations, the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the normal course of
business. Although the Company believes that it will be able to generate sufficient liquidity from
the measures described above, its current circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue to operate as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

All of the Company’s oilfield assets are located offshore Nigeria in the Oil Mining Leases 120
and 121 (the "OMLs"). “Work-in-progress and exploration inventory” includes suspended costs
for wells that are not yet completed, as well as warehouse inventory items purchased as part of
the redevelopment plan of the Oyo field.
The Company’s unevaluated leasehold costs include costs to acquire the rights to the
exploration acreage in its various oil and gas properties.
5. Suspended Exploratory Well Costs - Work in Progress
In November 2013, the Company achieved both its primary and secondary drilling objectives for
the well Oyo-7. The primary drilling objective was to establish production from the existing
Pliocene reservoir. The secondary drilling objective was to confirm the presence of hydrocarbons
in the deeper Miocene formation. Hydrocarbons were encountered in three Miocene intervals
totaling approximately 65 feet, as interpreted by the logging-while-drilling (“LWD”) data. Plans are
underway to secure a rig to drill at least one exploration well in the nearby G-Prospect. The
primary objective of the G-Prospect is to target the same Miocene-age sediments as the ones
found in the Oyo-7 exploratory drilling objective. Suspended exploratory well costs were $26.5
million at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for the costs related to the Miocene
exploratory drilling activities. 
In August 2014, the Company drilled well Oyo-8 to a total vertical depth of approximately 6,059
feet (approximately 1,847 meters) and successfully encountered four new oil and gas reservoirs
in the eastern fault block, with total gross hydrocarbon thickness of 112 feet, based on results
from the LWD data, reservoir pressure measurement, and reservoir fluid sampling. Management
has completed a detailed evaluation of the results and has future development plans in the area.
Suspended exploratory well costs were $6.5 million at both June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 for the costs related to the Pliocene exploration drilling activities in the eastern fault block.

7. Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company’s asset retirement obligations primarily represent the estimated fair value of the
amounts that will be incurred to plug, abandon and remediate its producing properties at the end
of their productive lives. Significant inputs used in determining such obligations include, but are
not limited to, estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, estimated future inflation rates and
changes in property lives. The inputs used in the fair value determination were based on Level 3
inputs, which were essentially management's assumptions.
On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the assumptions used to estimate the expected cash
flows required to settle the asset retirement obligations, including changes in estimated
probabilities, amounts and timing of the settlement of the asset retirement obligations, as well as
changes in the legal obligation for each of its properties. Changes in any one or more of these
assumptions may cause revisions in the estimated liabilities for the corresponding assets. The
following summarizes changes in the Company’s asset retirement obligations during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 (in thousands):
Balance at January 1, 2016$20,609

Balance at June 30, 2016 $21,522

8. Debt
Short-Term Debt:
Short-Term Borrowing - TOTSA Advance
In May 2016, the Company received $4.7 million as an advance under a prepayment agreement
with TOTSA Total Oil Trading SA ("TOTSA")(the “May Advance”). Interest accrued on the May
Advance at the rate of the 60-day LIBOR plus 5% per annum. Repayment of the May Advance
was made from proceeds received from the June crude oil lifting.
Short-Term Note Payable
In June 2016, the Company borrowed approximately $0.5 million under a 30-day Promissory
Note agreement entered into with a Nigerian bank (the “2016 Short-Term Note”), and had a
facility flat fee of 2.5%. As of June 30, 2016, the Company recognized an unrealized foreign
currency gain of $0.1 million, reducing the balance under the 2016 Short-Term Note to $0.4
million. The 2016 Short-Term Note was renewed for another 30 days in July 2016 at a flat fee
facility rate of 2.5%, and was fully repaid in July 2016.
Long-Term Debt- Term Loan Facility:
In September 2014, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary EPNL, entered into the
Term Loan Facility with Zenith Bank PLC ("Zenith"). 90.0% of the Term Loan Facility was
available in U.S. dollars, while the remaining 10% was available in
12
ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Nigerian Naira. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Term Loan Facility currently bear interest at the
rate of 11.1%. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility include a legal charge over the
OMLs and an assignment of proceeds from oil sales. The obligations of EPNL have been
guaranteed by the Company and rank in priority with all its other obligations. Proceeds from the
Term Loan Facility were used for the further expansion and development of the Oyo field offshore
Nigeria.
In June 2016, the Term Loan Facility was modified contingent upon the signing of a loan
agreement, which was signed in August 2016. The modification put in place a twelve month
moratorium on principal payments and extended the term of the Term Loan Facility until February
2021. Additionally, it reduced the funding requirement of the debt service reserve account
(“DSRA”) to an amount equal to one quarter of interest until the price of oil exceeds $55 per
barrel, at which time an amount equal to two quarters of interest will then be required.
Upon executing the Term Loan Facility, the Company paid fees totaling $2.6 million. Upon
modification of the Term Loan Facility, additional fees of $1.4 million were incurred. These fees
were recorded as debt issuance cost and are being amortized over the life of the Term Loan
Facility using the effective interest method. As of June 30, 2016, $2.6 million of the debt issuance
costs remained unamortized.
Under the Term Loan Facility, the following events, among others, constitute events of default:
EPNL failing to pay any amounts due within thirty days of the due date; bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation or dissolution of EPNL; a material breach of the Loan Agreement by EPNL that
remains unremedied within thirty days of written notice by EPNL; or a representation or warranty
of EPNL proves to have been incorrect or materially inaccurate when made. Upon any event of
default, all outstanding principal and interest under any loans will become immediately due and
payable.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company was out of compliance with the DSRA funding requirement.
This was brought into compliance in July 2016 with the Company making the required deposit.
Further, Zenith has the right to review the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Facility.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company made payments of $0.4 million and
$5.6 million for the principal repayment of the Naira portion of the loan due on March 31, 2016
and for the U.S. dollar principal that was due as of December 31, 2015, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company recognized an unrealized foreign currency gain of $3.9 million
on the Naira portion of the loan, reducing the balance under the Term Loan Facility to $87.2
million, net of debt discount. Of this amount, $83.4 million was classified as long-term and $3.8
million as short-term. Accrued interest for the Term Loan Facility was $2.5 million as of June 30,
2016. Scheduled principal repayments on the outstanding balance on the Term Loan Facility are

of $24.9 million owed under a 2011 Promissory Note, $50.0 million owed under a 2014
Convertible Subordinated Note, $46.9 million, net of discount, owed under a 2015 Convertible
Note, and $5.7 million owed under a 2016 Promissory Note.
Allied, a related party, is the holder of each of the 2011 Promissory Note, the 2014 Convertible
Subordinated Note, and the 2015 Convertible Note (collectively the "Allied Notes"). Each of the
Allied Notes contains certain default and cross-default provisions,
13
ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
including failure to pay interest and principal amounts when due and default under other
indebtedness. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was not in compliance with certain default
provisions of the Allied Notes with respect to the payment of quarterly interest. Further, the risk of
cross-default exists for each of the Allied Notes if the holder of the Term Loan Facility exercises
its right to terminate the Term Loan Facility and accelerate its maturity. Allied has agreed to
waive its rights under all default provisions of each of the Allied Notes through July 2017.
2011 Promissory Note
The Company has a $25.0 million borrowing facility under a Promissory Note (the “2011
Promissory Note”) with Allied. Interest accrues on the outstanding principal under the 2011
Promissory Note at a rate of the 30-day LIBOR plus 2% per annum, payable quarterly. In October
2015, the 2011 Promissory Note was amended to extend the maturity date by one year to July
30, 2017. The stock of the Company’s subsidiary that holds the exploration licenses in The
Gambia and Kenya were pledged as collateral to secure the 2011 Promissory Note, pursuant to
an Equitable Share Mortgage arrangement. The entire $25.0 million facility amount can be
utilized for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal and
accrued interest under the 2011 Promissory Note were $24.9 million and $1.2 million,
respectively.
2014 Convertible Subordinated Note
As partial consideration in connection with the February 2014 acquisition of the Allied Assets, the
Company issued a $50.0 million Convertible Subordinated Note in favor of Allied (the “2014
Convertible Subordinated Note”). Interest on the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note accrues at
a rate per annum of one-month LIBOR plus 5%, payable quarterly in cash until the maturity of the
2014 Convertible Subordinated Note five years from the closing of the Allied Transaction.
At the election of the holder, the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note is convertible into shares of
the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $4.2984 per share, subject to anti-
dilution adjustments. The 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note is subordinated to the Company’s
existing and future senior indebtedness and is subject to acceleration upon an Event of Default
(as defined in the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note). The following events, among others,
constitute an Event of Default under the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note: the Company
failing to pay interest within thirty days of the due date; the Company failing to pay principal when
due; bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or dissolution of the Company; a material breach of the
2014 Convertible Subordinated Note by the Company that remains unremedied within ten days
of such material breach; or a representation or warranty of the Company proves to have been
incorrect or materially inaccurate when made. Upon any event of default, all outstanding principal
and interest under any loans will become immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company owed $6.7 million in interest under the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note.
The Company may, at its option, prepay the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note in whole or in
part, at any time, without premium or penalty. Further, the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note is
subject to mandatory prepayment upon (i) the Company’s issuance of capital stock or incurrence
of indebtedness, the proceeds of which the Company does not apply to repayment of senior
indebtedness or (ii) any capital markets debt issuance to the extent the net proceeds of such
issuance exceed $250.0 million. Allied may assign all or any part of its rights and obligations
under the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note to any person upon written notice to the
Company. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal under the 2014 Convertible
Subordinated Note was $50.0 million.
2015 Convertible Note
In March 2015, the Company entered into a new borrowing facility with Allied in the form of a
Convertible Note (the “2015 Convertible Note”), allowing the Company to borrow up to $50.0
million for general corporate purposes. In March 2016, the maturity date of the 2015 Convertible
Note was extended to December 2017. Interest accrues at the rate of LIBOR plus 5%, and is
payable quarterly.
The 2015 Convertible Note is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock upon the
occurrence and continuation of an event of default, at the sole option of the holder. The number of
shares issuable upon conversion is equal to the sum of the principal amount and the accrued
and unpaid interest divided by the conversion price, defined as the volume weighted average of
the closing sales prices on the NYSE MKT for a share of common stock for the five complete
trading days immediately preceding the conversion date.

ERIN ENERGY CORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $0.5 million
under the 2015 Convertible Note and issued to Allied warrants to purchase approximately 48,291

amounting to $5.0 million based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model was recorded as a
debt discount, and is being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the note.
As of June 30, 2016, the unamortized balance of the discount was $1.6 million.
Additional warrants are issuable in connection with future borrowings, with the per share price for
those warrants determined based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the
time of such future borrowings. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 2015
Convertible Note, net of discount, was $46.9 million. Accrued interest on the 2015 Convertible

10. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
In February 2014, a long-term contract was signed for the floating, production, storage, and
offloading vessel (“FPSO”) Armada Perdana, which is the vessel currently connected to the
Company’s productive wells, Oyo-7 and Oyo-8, offshore Nigeria. The contract provides for an
initial term of seven years beginning January 1, 2014, with an automatic extension for an
additional term of two years unless terminated by the Company with prior notice. The FPSO can
process up to 40,000 barrels of liquid per day, with a storage capacity of approximately one
million barrels. The annual minimum contractual commitment per the terms of the agreement is
approximately $48.4 million per year through 2020.
The Company also has commitments related to four production sharing contracts with the
Government of the Republic of Kenya (the “Kenya PSCs”), two Petroleum Exploration,
Development & Production Licenses with the Republic of The Gambia (the “Gambia Licenses”),
and one Petroleum Agreement with the Republic of Ghana. In all cases, the Company entered
into these commitments through a subsidiary. To maintain compliance and ownership, the
Company is required to fulfill certain minimum work obligations and to make certain payments as
stated in each of the Kenya PSCs, the Gambia Licenses, and the Ghana Petroleum Agreement.
Contingencies
Legal Contingencies and Proceedings
From time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims in the
ordinary course of business. As of June 30, 2016, and through the filing date of this report, the
Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of such actions or potential actions of which
the Company is currently aware will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
On January 22, 2016, a request for arbitration was filed with the London Court of International
Arbitration by Transocean Offshore Gulf of Guinea VII Limited and Indigo Drilling Limited, as
Claimants, against the Company and its Nigerian subsidiary, Erin Petroleum Nigeria Limited (fka
CAMAC Petroleum Limited), as Respondents (the “Arbitration”). The Arbitration is in relation to a
drilling contract entered into by the Claimants and CAMAC Petroleum Limited, and a parent
company guarantee provided by the Company in relation thereto. The Claimants are seeking an
order that the Respondents pay the sum of approximately $20.2 million together with interest and
costs. The parties are in the process of trying to settle this matter and have agreed to extend
deadlines in the Arbitration pending resolution of a settlement.

who served on our Board at the time of the February 2014 Transactions and (2) our majority
shareholder, CEHL. The complaint also purports to assert a direct breach of fiduciary duty claim
on behalf of the putative class against the seven individuals who served on our Board at the time
of the February 2014 Transactions on the grounds that they purportedly caused the Company to
disseminate a false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the February 2014
Transactions, and a direct claim for aiding and abetting against Dr. Lawal. The plaintiff is
seeking, on behalf of the Company and the putative class, an undisclosed amount of
compensatory damages. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom
the plaintiff seeks no recovery.  On March 3, 2016, all of the defendants, including the Company,
filed motions to dismiss the complaint. A hearing on this motion has been set for September 21,
2016.
On May 13, 2016, CEONA Contracting (UK) Limited initiated arbitration proceedings against the
Company for $2.9 million, together with costs, expenses and interest, for work done in relation to
the Company's ordinary course of business.  The parties are in the process of finalizing a
settlement agreement.
On July 29, 2016, a judgment was entered against the Company in the amount of $2.7 million,
including $0.3 million interest claimed under contractual terms, in relation to amounts due to a
contractor (Polarcus MC Ltd.) in the ordinary course of business.
Unrecognized Loss Contingency
As of June 30, 2016, the Company has not accrued penalty and interest related to certain
outstanding transactional tax obligations in Nigeria, including withholding taxes, value-added
taxes, Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (NCD) tax, Cabotage taxes, and
Niger Delta Development Corporation taxes (NDDC). As of the date of this report, the Company
believes that, based on its experience with local practices in Nigeria, the likelihood of being
assessed penalty and interest is reasonably possible, with an estimated liability up to $11.1
million.
Contingency under the Allied Transfer Agreement
As provided for under the Transfer Agreement with Allied, the Company is required to make the
following additional payments upon the occurrence of certain future events: (i) $25.0 million cash
or the equivalent in shares of the Company’s common stock within fifteen days following the

with respect to a first new discovery of hydrocarbons in a non-Oyo field area; and (ii) $25.0
million cash or the equivalent in shares of the Company’s common stock within fifteen days
starting from the commencement of the first hydrocarbon production in commercial quantities in a
non-Oyo field area. The number of shares to be issued shall be determined by calculating the
average closing price of the Company’s common stock over a period of thirty days, counted back
from the first business day immediately prior to the approval of a development plan by DPR or the
date of the first hydrocarbon production in commercial quantities, as applicable.
Contingency under the 2015 Convertible Note
As part of the condition to the extension of the maturity date of the 2015 Convertible Note, which
extension was entered into in March 2016, the Company is required to (i) pay to Allied an amount
equal to ten percent (10%) of any successful debt fundraising event completed during the
remaining term of the 2015 Convertible Note; and (ii) pay to Allied an amount equal to twenty
percent (20%) of any successful equity fundraising event completed during the remaining term of
the 2015 Convertible Note.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our Business
Erin Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and gas exploration and
production company focused on energy resources in Africa. Our strategy is to acquire and
develop high-potential exploration and production assets in Africa, and to explore and develop
those assets through strategic partnerships with national oil companies, indigenous local
partners and other independent oil companies. We seek to build and operate a strategic portfolio
of high-impact exploration and near-term development projects with significant production,
reserves and resources growth potential.
We actively manage investments and on-going operations by limiting capital exposure through
farm-outs at various stages of exploration and development to share risks and costs. We prioritize
on building a strong technical and operational team and place an emphasis on the utilization of
modern oil field technologies that mature our assets, reduce the cost of our projects and improve
the efficiency of our operations.
Our shares are traded on both the NYSE MKT and on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
("JSE") under the symbol “ERN.”
Our asset portfolio consists of nine licenses across four countries covering an area of
approximately 10 million acres (approximately 40,000 square kilometers). We own producing
properties offshore Nigeria and conduct exploration activities as an operator offshore Nigeria and
conduct exploration activities as an operator onshore and offshore Kenya, offshore The Gambia,
and offshore Ghana.
Our operating subsidiaries include Erin Petroleum Nigeria Limited, Erin Energy Kenya Limited,
Erin Energy Gambia Ltd., and Erin Energy Ghana Limited.
We conduct certain business transactions with our majority shareholder, CAMAC Energy
Holdings Limited (“CEHL”) and its affiliates, which include CAMAC International Nigeria Limited
(“CINL”) and Allied. See Note 9 - Related Party Transactions to the Notes to Unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
In May 2016, Dr. Kase L. Lawal retired from service as a member and Executive Chairman of the
Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. John Hofmeister, a then current member of our
Board of Directors, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Segun
Omidele, our then Chief Operating Officer, succeeded Dr. Lawal as the Chief Executive Officer.
Nigeria
The Company currently owns 100% of the economic interests in the Oil Mineral Leases
("OMLs"), which include the currently producing Oyo field.
In early May 2016, with the help of a light intervention vessel, the Company successfully
completed well repair operations to resolve the mechanical problem related to well Oyo-8 and
successfully resumed production from the well. Combined daily production from both the Oyo-7
and Oyo-8 wells during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately 6,200 BOPD
(approximately 5,400 BOPD net to the Company after royalty).
Current plans include drilling a development well in the Oyo field, and drilling an exploration well
in the Miocene formation of the OMLs, subject to capital and rig availability.
Kenya
In May 2012, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into four production
sharing contracts with the Government of the Republic of Kenya, covering onshore exploration
blocks L1B and L16, and offshore exploration blocks L27 and L28 (the “Kenya PSCs”). Each
block requires specific work commitments to be completed by the end of the respective license
periods. The Company is the operator of all blocks with the Government having the right to
participate up to 20%, either directly or through an appointee, in any area subsequent to
declaration of a commercial discovery. The Company is responsible for all exploration
expenditures.
The Company is currently in the First Additional Exploration Period for both onshore blocks,
which will last through July 2017. In accordance with the Kenya PSCs, the Company is
obligated, for each block, to (i) acquire, process and interpret high density 300 square kilometer
3-D seismic data at a minimum expenditure of $12.0 million and (ii) drill one exploration well to a
minimum depth of 3,000 meters at a minimum expenditure of $20.0 million. The Company plans
to pursue completion of the work program and is considering the possibility of farming-out a
portion of its rights to both blocks to potential partners.
20
In August 2015, the Company received approval from the Kenya Ministry of Energy and
Petroleum for an 18-month extension of the Initial Exploration Period for offshore blocks L27 and
L28, which will now last through February 2017. The remaining contractual obligation under the
initial exploration period is for the Company to acquire, process and interpret 1,500 square
kilometers of 3-D seismic data over both offshore blocks. The Company plans to pursue
completion of the work program, and is also considering the possibility of farming-out a portion of
its rights to both offshore blocks to potential partners. Upon completion of the work program, the
Company has the right to apply for up to two additional two-year exploration periods, with
specified additional minimum work obligations, including the acquisition of seismic data and the
drilling of one exploratory well on each block during each additional period.
The Gambia
In May 2012, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, signed two Petroleum
Exploration, Development & Production Licenses with The Republic of The Gambia, for offshore
exploration blocks A2 and A5 (the “Gambia Licenses”). For both blocks, the Company is the
operator, with the Gambian National Petroleum Company (“GNPCo”) having the right to elect to
participate up to a 15% interest, following approval of a development and production plan. The
Company is responsible for all expenditures prior to such approval even if the GNPCo elects to
participate.
The term of the initial exploration period for both blocks A2 and A5, now extended through
December 2018, require for the Company to (i) complete the processing and interpretation of
approximately 1,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data that was acquired in September 2015
and (ii) drill one exploration well on either block A2 or A5 and evaluate the drilling results. The 3-
D seismic processing by an outside contractor is ongoing and is expected to be completed by the
third quarter of 2016. The Company intends to pursue completion of the work program, and is
also considering the possibility of farming-out a portion of its rights to both blocks to potential
partners.
Ghana
In April 2014, the Company, through an indirect 50%-owned subsidiary, signed a Petroleum
Agreement with the Republic of Ghana (the “Petroleum Agreement”) relating to the Expanded
Shallow Water Tano block offshore Ghana ("ESWT"). The Contracting Parties, which hold 90%
of the participating interest in the block, are Erin Energy Ghana Limited as the operator, GNPC
Exploration and Production Company Limited, and Base Energy (collectively the “Contracting
Parties”), holding 60%, 25%, and 15% share of the participating interest of the Contracting
Parties, respectively. The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation initially has a 10% carried
interest through the exploration phase, and will have the option to acquire an additional paying
interest of up to 10% following a declaration of commercial discovery. The Company owns 50%
of its subsidiary Erin Energy Ghana Limited. The remaining 50% interest is owned by an affiliate
of the Company’s majority shareholder.
The ESWT block contains three previously discovered fields (the "Fields") and the work program
requires the Contracting Parties to determine, within nine months of the effective date of the
Petroleum Agreement, the economic viability of developing the Fields. In addition, the Petroleum
Agreement provides for an initial exploration period of two years from the effective date of the
Petroleum Agreement, with specified work obligations during that period, including the
reprocessing of existing 2-D and 3-D seismic data and the drilling of one exploration well on the
ESWT block.
The Petroleum Agreement became effective in January 2015. Having completed the initial
technical and commercial evaluation of the Fields, the Contracting Parties concluded that certain
fiscal terms in the Petroleum Agreement had to be adjusted in order to achieve commerciality of
the Fields under current economic conditions. The Contracting Parties have presented this
conclusion to the relevant government entities. The Ghanian Government is currently reviewing
the requests for adjustment of the fiscal terms, and has granted Erin Energy an extension of the
Initial Exploration Period for eighteen months until the end of July 2018.

Results of Operations
The following discussion pertains to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity and capital resources and should be read together with our unaudited consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto contained in this report, and our audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 24, 2016 with the SEC.
Three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to three months ended June 30, 2015
Revenues
Revenue is recognized when an oil lifting occurs. Crude oil revenues for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 were $23.2 million, as compared to nil for the same period in 2015. For the three
months ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately 508,000 net barrels of oil at an
average price of $45.58/Bbl. There were no oil liftings during the three months ended June 30,
2015.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the average daily production from the
Oyo field, net of royalty, over the number of days production occurred, was approximately 5,400
BOPD and 6,700 BOPD, respectively.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Production costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $22.1 million, as compared to
$4.3 million for the same period in 2015. Production costs include costs directly related to the
production of hydrocarbons. In June 2015, the operator of the FPSO agreed to a price reduction
for the operating day rates incurred by the Company for the period of July 2014 through April
2015, which resulted in a $26.0 million reduction in production costs recognized in June 2015.
There was no such reduction in 2016. The Company matches production expenses with crude
oil sales. Any production expenses associated with unsold crude oil inventory are capitalized
with a corresponding offset to operating costs. The capitalized crude oil inventory costs are
subsequently expensed when crude oil is sold.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $7.6 million of workover
expenses, as compared to expenditures of $0.6 million for the same period in 2015. The increase
in workover expenses is due to the light intervention of well Oyo-8. During the same period 2015,
the Company spent $0.6 million to repair a control module associated with its well Oyo-4 that is
currently operating as a gas injection well.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $1.2 million of exploration
expenses, including $0.5 million spent in Kenya, $0.3 million spent in Nigeria, $0.2 million spent
in Ghana, and $0.2 million spent in The Gambia. During the three months ended June 30, 2015,
the Company incurred $1.5 million of exploration expenses, including $0.5 million spent in
Kenya, $0.3 million in The Gambia, and $0.7 million spent in Ghana for exploration activities.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, were $14.9 million, as compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2015.
DD&A expenses were higher during the three months ended June 30, 2016 because there were
no oil liftings during the same period in 2015. The average depletion rate for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 was $29.25/Bbl, as compared to nil in the same period in 2015.
Accretion of asset retirement obligations ("ARO") for the three months ended June 30, 2016, was
$0.5 million as compared to $0.3 million for the 2015 period. Increase in ARO accretion expense
in 2016 is primarily due to the addition of accretion expense related to the development of wells
Oyo-7 and Oyo-8.
There was no plug and abandonment ("P&A") activity during the three months ended June 30,
2016. In April 2015, the Company completed P&A activities for well Oyo-6 that was previously
shut-in. Actual P&A expenditures exceeded estimated P&A liabilities by $3.5 million.
Accordingly, the Company recognized a $3.5 million loss on settlement of its ARO during the
three months ended June 30, 2015.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were
$3.4 million, as compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2015. G&A decreased in 2016
mainly due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2016, primarily related to
employee costs and professional and consulting fees.
22
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $4.5 million, consisting of a $10.5
million gain on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by $6.0 million interest expense on
borrowings. Other expense for the same period in 2015 was $3.7 million consisting of $4.2
million in interest expense on borrowings, net of $1.0 million capitalized interest, partially offset
by $0.6 million gain on foreign currency transactions.
Income Taxes
Income taxes were nil for each of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The
Company did not have any taxable income from its oil and gas activities in Nigeria in these
respective periods.
Six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
Revenues
Revenue is recognized when an oil lifting occurs. Crude oil revenues for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 were $28.1 million, as compared to nil for the same period in 2015. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately 669,000 net barrels of oil at an
average price of $41.95/Bbl. There were no oil liftings during the six months ended June 30,
2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the average daily production from the Oyo
field, net of royalty, over the number of days production occurred, was approximately 3,600
BOPD and 6,700 BOPD, respectively.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Production costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $44.7 million, as compared to
expenditures of $25.6 million for the same period in 2015. Production costs include costs directly
related to the production of hydrocarbons. In June 2015, the operator of the FPSO agreed to a
price reduction for the operating day rates incurred by the Company for the period of July 2014
through April 2015, which resulted in a $26.0 million reduction in production costs recognized in
June 2015. There was no such reduction in 2016. The Company matches production expenses
with crude oil sales. Any production expenses associated with unsold crude oil inventory are
capitalized with a corresponding offset to operating costs. The capitalized crude oil inventory
costs are subsequently expensed when crude oil is sold.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $7.6 million of workover
expenses, as compared to expenditures of $0.6 million for the same period in 2015. The increase
in workover expenses is due to the light intervention of well Oyo-8. During the same period 2015,
the Company spent $0.6 million to repair a control module associated with its well Oyo-4 that is
currently operating as a gas injection well.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred $3.3 million of exploration
expenses, including $1.1 million spent in Ghana, $1.0 million spent in Kenya, $0.7 million spent
in Nigeria, and $0.5 million spent in The Gambia. During the six months ended June 30, 2015,
the Company incurred $8.0 million of exploration expenses, including $5.4 million spent onshore
Kenya primarily for the 2-D seismic acquisition and interpretation, $0.7 million offshore Kenya,
$0.7 million in The Gambia, $0.3 million in Nigeria, and $0.9 million in Ghana for exploration
activities.
DD&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, were $19.7 million, as compared to
$0.2 million for the same period in 2015. DD&A expenses were higher during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 because there were no oil liftings during the same period in 2015. The
average depletion rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $29.39/Bbl, as compared to
nil in the same period in 2015.
Accretion of ARO for both the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.9 million.
The Company recorded P&A expenses of $0.2 million during the six months ended June 30,
2016. In April 2015, the Company completed P&A activities for well Oyo-6 that was previously
shut-in. Additional P&A expenditures paid in the six months ended June 30, 2015, in relation to
well Oyo-6 P&A activities were $3.5 million. Accordingly, the Company recognized this cost as a
loss on settlement of its ARO during 2015.
23
G&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $7.4 million, as compared to $8.9
million in the same period in 2015. G&A decreased in 2016 mainly due to the cost reduction
initiatives implemented during 2016, primarily related to employee costs and professional and
consulting fees.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.1 million, consisting of an $11.3
million gain on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by $11.4 million interest expense on
borrowings. Other expense for the same period in 2015 was $4.8 million, consisting of $6.8
million in interest expense on borrowings, net of $2.2 million capitalized interest, partially offset
by $2.0 million gain on foreign currency transactions. The increase in interest expense was
mainly due to the increase in the average outstanding borrowings during 2016 as compared to
2015, and that no interest was capitalized during 2016.
Income Taxes
Income taxes were nil for each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company
did not have any taxable income from its oil and gas activities in Nigeria in these respective
periods.
Headline Earnings
In addition to the Company’s primary listing on the NYSE MKT, the Company’s common stock is
also traded on the JSE. The JSE requires for the Company to file certain documents that it files
with the SEC. The JSE requires that we calculate Headline Earnings Per Share (“HEPS”) which,
per the SEC, is considered a non-GAAP measurement.
As defined in the Circular 3/2009 of The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants,
headline earnings is an additional earnings number that excludes certain separately identifiable
re-measurements, net of related tax, and related non-controlling interest.
The number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted HEPS is the same as basic and diluted
EPS. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no separate
identifiable re-measurements required and headline earnings was the same as net loss per
share as disclosed on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. Therefore, HEPS for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was a loss of $(0.11) and $(0.04), respectively,
and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was a loss of $(0.26) and $(0.20),
respectively.
Liquidity
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $26.8
million as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a combination of higher
revenues, use of vendor financing and higher non-cash adjustments to net loss.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $9.7 million, as
compared to $56.7 million for the same period in 2015. Cash used in investing activities for both
periods was used primarily to settle outstanding liabilities associated with additions to property,
plant, and equipment for the Oyo field redevelopment campaign in the OMLs.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $8.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016,
consisted of $6.0 million principal repayment of our Term Loan Facility, $0.7 million payment for
debt issuance costs, and $0.2 million payment to settle withholding tax obligations upon vesting
of restricted stock awards, partially offset by $8.7 million funds released from restricted cash, $6.1
million inflows from short-term borrowings from a related party, $0.5 million proceeds from a
short-term note payable, and $0.2 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Net cash
provided by financing activities of $60.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015,
consisted of $1.9 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from warrant and
option exercises, $44.0 million borrowings under the 2015 Convertible Note, $13.8 million
borrowings under the Promissory Note, and $0.4 million funding received from a related party
owning a non-controlling interest in the Company's Ghana subsidiary.
24
Capital Resources
Our primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures for the continued development of the
Oyo field in Nigeria, operating expenditures for the Oyo field, exploration activities in unevaluated
leaseholds, working capital needs, and interest and principal payments under current
indebtedness.
The Company incurred losses from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company's total current liabilities of $275.7 million exceeded its total
current assets of $18.5 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $257.2 million. As a result
of the current low commodity prices and the Company’s low oil production volumes due to the
recent mechanical problem which was resolved earlier in the year associated with well Oyo-8,
the Company has not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain
obligations as they became due.
Well Oyo-7 is currently shut-in as a result of an emergency shut-in of the Oyo field production that
occurred in early July of this year. This has resulted in a loss of approximately 1,400 BOPD. The
Company is currently evaluating various technical options to optimize economic results from the
Oyo field, including but not limited to, attempting a nitrogen lifting exercise to bring back
production on well Oyo-7.
The Company is currently pursuing a number of actions, including (i) obtaining additional funds
through public or private financing sources, (ii) restructuring existing debts from lenders, (iii)
obtaining forbearance of debt from trade creditors, (iv) reducing ongoing operating costs, (v)
minimizing projected capital costs for the 2016 exploration and development campaign and (vi)
farming-out a portion of our rights to certain of our oil and gas properties. There can be no
assurances that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these actions or that these
actions can be consummated within the period needed to meet certain obligations.
In February 2016, the Company lifted and sold approximately 183,000 Bbls of crude oil
(approximately 161,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to the Company were
approximately $4.9 million.
In April 2016, the Company lifted and sold approximately 159,000 Bbls of crude oil
(approximately 140,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to the Company were
approximately $5.6 million.
In June 2016, the Company lifted and sold approximately 418,000 Bbls of crude oil
(approximately 368,000 Bbls net to the Company). Net proceeds to the Company were
approximately $17.6 million.
In August 2016, the Company received $6.0 million as an advance under a prepayment
agreement with TOTSA (the “August Advance”). Interest accrues on the August Advance at the
rate of the 60-day LIBOR plus 5% per annum. Repayment of the August Advance will be made
from proceeds to be received from the planned August 2016 crude oil lifting.
Although we believe that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity from the measures
described above, our current circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
to realize the carrying value of our assets and operate as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
From time-to-time, we may enter into arrangements that can give rise to off-balance sheet
obligations. As of June 30, 2016, material off-balance sheet obligations include operating leases
for the FPSO and certain employment contracts. Other than the material off-balance sheet
arrangements discussed above, no other arrangements are likely to have a current or future
material effect on our financial condition, results from operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All
statements, other than statements of historical fact, in this report, including, without limitation,
statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected
revenues, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are, or
may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve
assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the
actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, to be materially different from
historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected or any future results, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this
report.
25
In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,”
“goal,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “will
likely,” or similar expressions. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations
will prove to have been correct. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Important factors that could affect our
financial performance and that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially
from our expectations include, but are not limited to:
•the supply, demand and market prices of oil and natural gas;
•our current and future indebtedness;
•our ability to raise capital to fund our current and future operations;
•our ability to develop oil and gas reserves;
•competition from other companies in the energy market;
•political instability and foreign government regulations over international operations;
•our lack of diversification of production and reserves;
•compliance and enforcement of restriction on production and exports;
•compliance and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations;
•our ability to achieve profitability;
•our dependency on third parties to enable us to produce and deliver oil and gas; and
other factors disclosed under Item 1. Description of Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 2.
Properties, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and elsewhere in this
report.
•
We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions
based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We
caution you that assumptions, beliefs, expectations, intentions and projections about future
events may and often do vary materially from actual results. Therefore, we cannot assure you that
actual results will not differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking
statements.
For a detailed description of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see “Risk Factors” in
Item 1A of Part II of this report and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended March 31, 2016 and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on
our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by reference to these risks and uncertainties.
You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and, except as required by law,
we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statement.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company may be exposed to certain market risks related to changes in foreign currency
exchange, interest rates, and commodity prices.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our results of operations and financial conditions are affected by currency exchange rates. While
oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our capital and operating costs in Nigeria
are denominated in Naira, the Nigerian local currency. Similarly, portions of our exploration costs
in Kenya, The Gambia, and Ghana are denominated in each country’s respective local currency.
Historically, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies in the countries
in which we operate has fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions,
general economic conditions, and other factors beyond our control.
The weighted average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Nigerian Naira was
184.10 Naira per each U.S. dollar for the six months ended June 30, 2016. For the six months
ended June 30, 2016, a 10% fluctuation in the weighted average exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the Nigerian Naira would have had an approximate $4.4 million impact on our
capital and operating costs in Nigeria.
26
To date, we have not engaged in hedging activities to hedge our foreign currency exposure in
our foreign operations. In the future, we may enter into hedging instruments to manage our
foreign currency exchange risk or continue to be subject to exchange rate risk.
Commodity Price Risk
As an independent oil producer, our revenue, other income and profitability, reserve values,
access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices
of crude oil. Prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response
to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our
control. Prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable, and such
volatility is expected to continue.
Historically, realized commodity prices received for our crude oil sales have been tied to the
Brent oil prices. Prices received have been volatile and unpredictable. For the six months ended
June 30, 2016, a $10.00 fluctuation in the prices received for our crude oil sales would have had
an approximate $6.7 million impact on our revenues.
We do not currently engage in hedging activities to hedge our exposure to commodity price risks.
In the future, we may enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in
commodity prices.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily from possible fluctuations in the London
Interbank Borrowing Rate (“LIBOR”). The interest rates on our debt obligations are stated at
floating rates tied to the LIBOR. Currently, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to
manage exposure to interest rate changes. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the
weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 8.5%. Assuming our current level of
borrowings, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates we pay under our various debt
facilities would result in an increase of our interest expense by $2.2 million over a twelve month
period.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of June 30, 2016. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered
by this Form 10-Q, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
The disclosures required in this Item 1 are included in Note 10 - Commitments and
Contingencies in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part
I, Financial Information, Item 1, Financial Statements and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
27
The following risk factors update the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the “Annual
Report”). Except as set forth below, there have not been any material changes to the risk factors
previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report.
We have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of
indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in
our business.
As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $50.0 million outstanding in aggregate principal
under the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note, $46.9 million, net of discount, under the 2015
Convertible Note, $87.2 million, net of discount, under the Term Loan Facility, $24.9 million
under the 2011 Promissory Note, and $5.7 million under a 2016 Promissory Note, and we may
incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness has, or could have,
important consequences to our business because:
a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to interest and principal
payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures,
expansion, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;
it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions, capital
expenditures or general corporate purposes;
it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;
and
•
•
•
•
we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a
relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business,
our industry or the economy in general.
In addition, the terms of the Term Loan Facility restrict, and the terms of any future indebtedness
including any future credit facility may restrict, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and
grant liens because of debt or financial covenants we are, or may be, required to meet. Thus, we
may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to grow our business or implement our business
strategy and may lose opportunities to acquire interests in oil properties or related businesses
because of our inability to fund such growth.
Our ability to comply with restrictions and covenants, including those in the Term Loan Facility or
in any future credit facility, is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our
operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the
restrictions and covenants in the Term Loan Facility could result in a default, which could permit
the lenders to accelerate repayments and foreclose on the collateral securing such
indebtedness.
Events of default may occur under the Allied related party notes, subject to waivers entered into
by the Company and Allied in March 2016 and as subsequently amended. If events of default
occur or Allied accelerates the repayment obligations, as to matters not covered or no longer
covered by the waivers, cross-defaults will exist under the Allied related party notes, and we will
not be able to repay the obligations that become immediately due.
Allied, a related party, is the holder of the 2014 Convertible Subordinated Note, the 2015
Convertible Note, and the 2011 Promissory Note (collectively the "Allied Notes"). Each of the
Allied Notes contains certain default and cross-default provisions, including failure to pay interest
and principal amounts when due and default under other indebtedness. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company was not in compliance with the default provisions of each of the Allied Notes with
respect to the payment of quarterly interest. Further, the risk of cross-default exists for each of the
Allied Notes if the holder of the Term Loan Facility exercises its right to terminate the Term Loan
Facility and accelerate its maturity. Allied agreed to waive its rights under all default provisions of
each of the Allied Notes through July 2017. For additional information regarding defaults, cross-
defaults and potential cross-defaults, please see the discussion regarding each debt instrument
in Note 8 - Debt to the financial statements included herein. If any of our debt obligations are
accelerated due to the events of default or future cross-defaults, we may not be able to repay the
obligations that become immediately due and will have severe liquidity restraints.
Due to lack of liquidity, we may not be able to make the required principal and interest payments
under the Term Loan Facility due June 30, 2017.
As a result of the current low commodity prices and a prior history of low oil production volumes
related to mechanical problems with well Oyo-8, the Company has not been able to generate
sufficient cash from operations to satisfy certain obligations as they become due. The Company
has been relying on short-term promissory notes, such as the 2016 Promissory Note, with an
entity related to the Company’s majority shareholder to supplement its liquidity needs, but there
can be no assurances that the related party will continue to provide such short-term loans in the
future.
Pursuant to the Term Loan Facility, Zenith has the right to review the terms and conditions of the
Term Loan Facility.
28
Our failure to make the required payments under the Term Loan Facility or to comply with its
applicable debt covenants could result in a default under the Term Loan Facility and a cross-
default under the Allied Notes as described in the preceding risk factor, which could result in the
acceleration of the payment of such debt, termination of Zenith’s commitments to make further
loans to us, loss of our ownership interests in the secured properties or otherwise materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, if we are unable
to service our debt obligations generally, we cannot assure you that the Company will continue in
its current state or continue to operate as a going concern.
We may be unable to continue as a going concern.
As mentioned in the risk factors above, we have substantial debt obligations and may not be able
to maintain adequate liquidity throughout 2016. As a result, the Company’s consolidated
financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared under
the assumption that it will continue as a going concern, which assumes the continuity of
operations, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities as they come due in the
normal course of business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Although the Company believes that it will be able to
generate sufficient liquidity, its current circumstances raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue to operate as a going concern. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we
may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or
dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.
29
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we borrowed an additional $0.5 million under the
2015 Convertible Note and issued to Allied warrants to purchase approximately 48,291 shares of
the Company's common stock with an exercise price of ranging from $2.00 to $2.13 per share.

Item 5. Other Information
On August 3, 2016, Erin Petroleum Nigeria Limited entered into an agreement to modify the Term
Loan Facility (the “Modified Facility”). The Modified Facility establishes a moratorium on principal
payments due under the Term Loan Facility until June 2017 and extends the remaining term of
the Term Loan Facility until February 2021. Additionally, it reduces the funding requirement of the
debt service reserve account to an amount equal to one quarter of interest until the price of oil
exceeds $55 per barrel, at which time an amount equal to two quarters of interest will then be
required.
Further, the Modified Facility increases the interest rates for amounts borrowed in (i) U.S. dollars
to a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 9% per annum (subject to a
floor of 9.5% per annum) from LIBOR plus 7.5% per annum and (ii) Nigerian Naira to 22.75% per
annum from 18.75% annum.
