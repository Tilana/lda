<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,

participation of developing countries, particularly least developed countries, in the universal 
periodic review, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that institution-building text also requests the Council to decide on the question 
whether to resort to existing financing mechanisms or to create new ones, </p>
