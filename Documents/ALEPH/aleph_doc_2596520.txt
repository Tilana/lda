KEY POINTS 
(cid:131)
Sales revenue of $9,182.7M was higher than FY2015 due to 100% ownership of North Star from the end of October 2015, 
favourable translation impacts of a weaker AUD exchange rate and stronger domestic demand within ASP. These were partly 
offset by lower domestic and export prices, due to lower global steel prices, lower export volumes at ASP and lower despatch 
volumes from Engineered Buildings North America and Australian Distribution.
(cid:131) Reported NPAT of $353.8M was $217.5M up on FY2015 primarily due to the requirement to revalue the Company’s existing 
interest in North Star when 100% ownership was acquired at the end of October 2015, sale of McDonald’s Lime and improved 
underlying  NPAT,  partly  offset  by  Australia  and  New  Zealand  non-current  asset  carrying  value  impairment  charges  at  31 
December 2015 and New Zealand (Taharoa) impairment charges at 30 June 2016.
(cid:131) Underlying NPAT of $293.1M was $159.0M higher due to lower costs, 100% ownership of North Star from the end of October
2015 and favourable impacts of a weaker AUD:USD, partly offset by lower spreads.
(cid:131) Underlying EBIT of $570.5M was $268.7M higher than FY2015 – an 89% increase driven by company initiatives, despite the 
weakest macro conditions since 2002. Compound underlying EBIT growth over the last three years of over 90 per cent per 
annum.
(cid:131) Delivery on strategic priorities:
(cid:16) Coated & Painted: 31% per annum compound annual growth in ASEAN, North America & India underlying EBIT over last 
four years; home appliance steels (SuperDyma®) in production in Thailand; growth in Australian domestic coated product 
sales. The BlueScope Board has given in-principle approval, subject to finalisation of contracts and NS BlueScope joint 
venture  board  approval,  for  a  third  metal  coating  line  with  in-line  painting  in  Thailand;  the  new  line  will  deliver  added 
capacity to meet demand in the growing Retail/SME construction market.
(cid:16) BlueScope Buildings: continued growth in North America earnings; total China earnings turning the corner, with reduced
losses at China Buildings.
(cid:16) North Star BlueScope Steel: acquired Cargill’s 50% share on 30 October 2015 to move to full ownership; steel spreads
strengthened considerably going into FY2017.
(cid:16) Australia & New Zealand Steelmaking: delivered $235M cost savings in Australia under Plan A: saving 4,500 jobs, avoiding 
estimated $750M mothballing/closure costs and preserving benefit of exposure to higher steel prices. Good progress on 
NZ cost savings; there is still further work to be done to determine whether the Glenbrook operations can be internationally 
competitive and profitable.
(cid:16) Balance sheet: net debt at 30 June 2016 of $778.0M, being higher than 30 June 2015 due to North Star 50% acquisition, 
but  lower  than  31  December  2015  by  $595.4M  through  strong  operating  cash  flow.  Leverage  (net  debt  to  proforma 
underlying EBITDA) at 30 June 2016 of 0.8x, being below our goal of 1.0x within 12-18 months after North Star acquisition.
Segments’ performance: 
(cid:16) Australian Steel Products underlying EBIT of $361.4M, a $211.1M increase on FY2015 driven by lower costs and better
(cid:131)
domestic volumes/mix, partly offset by weaker spread.
(cid:16) New Zealand and Pacific Steel underlying EBIT loss of $53.5M, a decline of $20.3M due to lower realised iron sands and 
steel pricing reflecting lower global prices partly offset by favourable impacts from a weaker NZD:USD. Taharoa export iron 
sands operations sale process remains underway.
(cid:16) Building Products segment underlying EBIT of $149.3M, an increase of $51.0M. Higher margins across most businesses 
with lower raw material purchase prices more than offsetting lower selling prices. Favourable translation of earnings from a 
weaker AUD:USD.
(cid:131)
(cid:16) BlueScope Buildings underlying EBIT of $49.2M. An increase of $5.5M, or $16.5M excluding the $11.0M initiative to de-risk 
pension  fund  obligations  in  FY2015.  Strong  Buildings  North  America  performance  on  stronger  margins.  Buildings  Asia 
turnaround is progressing, with reduced losses in FY2016. Improved earnings from China with solid performance at coating 
and painting, and reduced losses in Engineered Buildings.
(cid:16) Hot Rolled Products North America EBIT of $146.5M, up $39.2M due to 100% consolidation of North Star from November 
2015 and favourable translation impacts from a weaker AUD:USD exchange rate, partially offset by weaker steel spreads.
Expectations for the performance of our businesses in 1H FY2017 are as follows:  
(cid:16) ASP:  expect  higher  steel  pricing  with  the  impact  of  lagged  regional  steel  pricing  from  4Q  FY2016;  expect  typical
seasonality in volumes, noting a strong 2H FY2016. Maintaining the strong cost performance delivered in 2H FY2016.
(cid:16) NZPac: expect slight improvement over 2H FY2016: (i) benefit of full Pacific Steel / billet caster economics; (ii) higher steel 
pricing with impact of lagged regional steel pricing from 4Q FY2016; (iii) one-off benefits of provision adjustments in 2H 
FY2016 not repeated.
(cid:16) BP: expect continued growth driven by volume and mix, noting 2H FY2016 delivered particularly strong margins (especially 
in  North  America  due  to  spread  expansion  in  supply  chain).  Continued  investment  in  brand,  channel  and  product 
development.
(cid:16) BB: in North America, expect seasonally stronger volumes combined with benefits from improvement programs; at Asia 
Buildings, expect benefit of improvement program combined with seasonally higher volumes, but competitive pressure on 
margins; continued strong performance expected at China Coated.
(cid:16) HRP North America: expect continued full despatch rate; strong spreads to continue in 1Q; expecting softening spreads in
2Q.
(cid:131) Group outlook:
(cid:16) We expect 1H FY2017 underlying EBIT to be around 50% higher than 2H FY2016 which was $340.4M. This is based on
assumption of average1:
-
-
-
-
-
East Asian HRC price of ~US$350/t 
62% Fe iron ore price of ~US$50/t CFR China 
Hard coking coal price of ~US$100/t FOB Australia 
U.S. mini-mill spreads in 2Q reducing by 10-20% from current spot (US$360-380/t) 
AUD:USD at US$0.75
(cid:16) Expect 1H FY2017 underlying net finance costs to be lower than 2H FY2016 due to lower average borrowings; expect
slightly higher underlying tax rate and similar profit attributable to non-controlling interests to 2H FY2016.
(cid:16) Expectations are subject to spread, FX and market conditions.

accounting impacts ($5.8M pre-tax) following the acquisition of the remaining 50% on 30 October 2015.
3)  FY2016 includes the following asset impairments:
(cid:120)  ASP: fixed assets and intangibles write off ($189.0M pre-tax) recognised in December 2015. 
(cid:120)  NZPac:
-  New Zealand Steel and Pacific Steel – fixed assets write off ($182.2M pre-tax) recognised in December 2015. 
-  Taharoa iron sands operations – fixed assets write off ($182.4M pre-tax), of which $162.7M was recognised in December 2015 and the remainder in June 2016.
4)  FY2016 reflects Corporate transaction costs associated with the acquisition of the remaining 50% share in North Star ($9.4M pre-tax), Corporate business development costs 
($1.9M pre-tax), integration costs associated with the Australian businesses acquired during 2H FY2014 ($2.4M pre-tax) and production losses incurred through commissioning 
the billet caster in New Zealand ($4.5 pre-tax). FY2015 reflects transaction and integration costs associated with the Australian businesses acquired during 2H FY2014 ($6.4M 
pre-tax) and Corporate business development costs ($2.5M pre-tax) and business development costs in New Zealand ($1.7M pre-tax).
5)  FY2015 reflects an accounting adjustment realised on the closure of the Australia defined benefit (DB) superannuation fund which impacted Australian Steel Products ($23.8M 
pre-tax) and Corporate ($3.4M pre-tax). Upon closure of the fund the difference between the accounting obligation and members’ actual benefits were required to be credited to 
P&L under Australian Accounting Standards.
6)  FY2016 reflects the impact of the Tianjin port explosion on the Engineered Buildings China site (net of insurance recoveries). FY2015 reflects the impact of the Port Kembla
Steelworks sinter plant waste gas cleaning stack fire which occurred in October 2014.
7)  FY2016 reflects staff redundancy and restructuring costs at ASP ($93.7M pre-tax) primarily relating to the cost reduction program in Australian steelmaking and restructure of 
Australian Distribution and staff redundancy and restructuring costs in New Zealand ($7.5M pre-tax) and BlueScope Buildings ($8.6M pre-tax). FY2015 reflects staff redundancy 
and restructuring costs at ASP ($30.0M pre-tax) and Indonesia ($1.2M pre-tax) partly offset by the write-back of restructuring provisions raised in FY2014 relating to restructuring 
initiatives within the China business ($2.9M pre-tax).
8)  FY2016 reflects the profit on sale of McDonald’s Lime in New Zealand ($32.9M pre-tax) and property, plant and equipment in ASP ($1.4M pre-tax). FY2015 reflects the profit on 
sale of land and buildings at the North American Buildings business ($9.4M pre-tax) and at the New Zealand business ($4.6M pre-tax) and a loss on sale in ASP ($2.7M pre-
tax).
9)  FY2016 reflects the premium on early redemption of the US$190M senior unsecured notes due in May 2018 and the write-off of unamortised borrowing costs associated with 
the senior unsecured notes and North Star acquisition bridge facilities which were refinanced within the period. FY2015 reflects the write-off of unamortised borrowing costs 
associated with the previous $675M Syndicated Bank Facility which was restructured and refinanced early.
10)  FY2016  reflects  impairment  of deferred tax  assets  in New Zealand  ($64.7M)  inclusive  of a $33.6M  impairment of  carried  forward  tax  losses.  These  were  partly  offset  by 
utilisation of previously impaired deferred tax assets in Australia arising from the favourable movement in timing differences exceeding tax losses generated during the period 
($39.8M). FY2015 reflects utilisation of previously impaired deferred tax assets in Australia arising from the favourable movement in timing differences exceeding tax losses 
generated during the period.
11)  Earnings per share are based on the average number of shares on issue during the respective reporting periods, (570.1M in FY2016 vs. 561.3M in FY2015).

GROUP-LEVEL MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS FOR FY2016 VS FY2015 
BLUESCOPE’S OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES 
BlueScope is a technology leader in metal coated and painted steel 
building products, principally focused on the Asia-Pacific region, with 
a wide range of branded products that include pre-painted 
COLORBOND® steel, zinc/aluminium alloy-coated ZINCALUME® 
steel and the LYSAGHT® range of building products.  
 
The Company has an extensive footprint of metallic coating, painting 
and steel building product operations in China, India, Indonesia, 
Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and North America, primarily servicing 
the residential and non-residential building and construction 
industries across Asia, and the non-residential construction industry 
in North America. BlueScope operates across ASEAN and in North 
America in partnership with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal 
Corporation (NSSMC) and in India with Tata Steel. Both are 50/50 
joint ventures with BlueScope controlling and therefore consolidating 
the joint venture with NSSMC, and jointly controlling and therefore 
equity accounting the joint venture with Tata Steel.  
 
BlueScope is Australia’s largest steel manufacturer, and New 
Zealand’s only steel manufacturer. BlueScope’s vertically integrated 
operations for flat steel products in Australia and New Zealand 
produce value-added metallic coated and painted products, together 
with hot rolled coil, cold rolled coil, steel plate and pipe and tube. 
BlueScope manufactures and sells steel long products in New 
Zealand through its Pacific Steel business. In Australia and New 
Zealand, BlueScope serves customers in the building and 
construction, manufacturing, automotive and transport, agricultural 
and mining industries. In Australia, BlueScope’s steel products are 
sold directly to customers from our steel mills and through a national 
network of service centres and steel distribution sites. 
 
BlueScope operates two iron sand mines in New Zealand. Waikato 
North Head primarily supplies iron sands for our New Zealand steel 
making operations and Taharoa supplies iron sands for export. 
  
BlueScope is a leading supplier of engineered building solutions 
(EBS) to industrial and commercial markets. Its EBS value 
proposition is based on speed of construction, low total cost of 
ownership and global delivery capability. Leading brands, including 
BUTLER®, VARCO PRUDEN® and PROBUILD®, are supplied from 
BlueScope’s global supply chain and major manufacturing and 
engineering centres in Asia and North America. 
 
On 30 October 2015 BlueScope acquired full ownership of North Star 
BlueScope Steel (NSBSL), previously 50% owned. The Ohio, U.S. 
mill is a low cost regional supplier of hot rolled coil. NSBSL is highly 
efficient, operates at industry leading utilisation rates and is 
strategically located near its customers and in one of the largest 
scrap markets of North America.

Finance costs 
The $32.1M increase in finance costs compared to FY2015 was 
largely due to higher average borrowings primarily due to the 
acquisition of the remaining 50% of North Star BlueScope Steel 
(FY2016 $1,462.3M, FY2015 $926.3M), costs associated with the 
redemption of US$190M senior unsecured notes due in May 2018 
and establishment costs for the two US$300M bridge facilities.

to  the  de-recognition  of  the  50%  share  in  North  Star  that 
BlueScope already owned 
$98.1M  decrease  in  inventory,  primarily  due  to  a  net  volume

$28.3M increase in deferred income 
$5.3M  reduction  in  assets  held  for  sale  with  the  sale  of  the 
equity investment in McDonald’s Lime in New Zealand.
Funding 
Financial liquidity was $1,813.1M (excludes $52M undrawn capacity 
of the off-balance sheet receivables securitisation) at 30 June 2016 
($1,276.3M at 31 December 2015 and $1,591.0M at 30 June 2015), 
comprised of committed available undrawn capacity under bank debt 
facilities of $1,263.3M, plus cash $549.8M. Liquidity in the NS 
BlueScope Coated Products JV of $487.8M is included in the group 
liquidity measure.    
 
During FY2016 two US$300M bridge facilities (one secured, one 
unsecured) were established with a one year maturity to assist in 
funding the acquisition of Cargill’s 50% interest in North Star 
BlueScope Steel. The bridge facilities were fully repaid during the 
year through a combination of: 
(cid:131) 
(cid:131)
an increase to BlueScope’s Syndicated Bank Facility by $350M   
an  off  balance  sheet  trade  receivables  securitisation  program 
established in December 2015 with a limit of $250M 
issuance  of  US$500M  of  senior  unsecured  notes  to  qualified 
institutional  buyers  in  the  United  States.  The  notes  mature  in 
May 2021 and have a coupon of 6.50% per annum. Proceeds of 
the  offering  were  also  used  to  partly  redeem  existing  senior 
unsecured  notes  due  in  May  2018  which  had  a  coupon  of 
7.125%.
(cid:131)
Following the North Star acquisition in October 2015, the Company 
indicated its intention to reduce leverage to less than 1.0 times net 
debt to EBITDA within 12 to 18 months. This goal was achieved by 
30 June 2016, at which point the leverage multiple was 0.8 (net debt 
to pro-forma EBITDA). 
 
MATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE YEAR ENDED 
30 JUNE 2016 
On 8 July 2016 BlueScope sold its 47.5% interest in Castrip LLC (a 
thin strip casting technology joint venture with Nucor and IHI Ltd) to 
Nucor for US$20.0M.
Tax  
Net tax expense of $101.4M (FY2015 $46.8M) primarily relates to 
income generated in businesses outside of Australia and New 
Zealand. FY2016 includes non-taxable gains of $739.5M arising from 
the de-recognition and fair value gain on the existing 50% equity 
investment in North Star following the acquisition of the remaining 
50% on 30 October 2015 and the sale of New Zealand Steel’s 28% 
equity investment in McDonald’s Lime. FY2016 also includes 
$553.6M of non-tax effected asset impairments in Australia and New 
Zealand. 
 
FY2016 includes a $64.7M impairment of New Zealand deferred tax 
assets, inclusive of a $33.6M write-off of previously carried forward 
tax losses. These were partially offset by a $42.2M (FY2015 $24.8M) 
utilisation of previously impaired deferred tax assets in Australia. The 
Company has deferred the recognition of any further Australian and 
New Zealand tax credits until a sustainable return to taxable profits 
has been demonstrated. Australian and New Zealand tax losses are 
able to be carried forward indefinitely. 
 
Dividend  
In February 2016 the Board of Directors approved payment of a fully 
franked interim dividend of three cents per share. 
 
The Board of Directors has approved payment of a final dividend of 
3.0 cents per share. The final dividend will have attached 100% 
franking credits and imputation credits for Australian and New 
Zealand tax purposes respectively. BlueScope’s dividend 
reinvestment plan will not be active for the final dividend. 
 
Relevant dates for the final dividend are as follows: 
(cid:131)  Ex-dividend share trading commences: 9 September 2016. 
(cid:131)  Record date for dividend: 12 September 2016. 
(cid:131)  Payment of dividend: 10 October 2016. 
 
BlueScope’s goal is to continue to reduce leverage and target net 
debt sustainably lower than 1.0 times underlying EBITDA. The 
Company may temporarily increase leverage for value adding 
opportunities, subject to seeing a clear pathway to reduce debt. 
 
FINANCIAL POSITION 
Net assets   
Net assets increased $246.2M to $4,985.3M at 30 June 2016 from 
$4,739.1M at 30 June 2015.  
 
Increases in net assets were: 
(cid:131)
$1,255.3M increase in intangible assets, primarily as a result of 
the North Star acquisition ($1,313M) partly offset by impairment 
of goodwill ($39M) and other items ($19M)  
$101.5M  increase  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  driven  by 
the North Star acquisition ($620M), capital expenditure ($351M) 
and  the  weaker  AUD:USD  ($9M),  partly  offset  by  non-current 
asset  impairment  charges  ($515M),  depreciation  ($343M)  and 
other movements ($21M)  
$70.6M increase in receivables

are as follows: 
(cid:131)  ASP:  expect  higher  steel  pricing  with  the  impact  of  lagged 
regional  steel  pricing 
typical 
seasonality in volumes, noting a strong 2H FY2016. Maintaining 
the strong cost performance delivered in 2H FY2016.
from  4Q  FY2016;  expect
(cid:131)  NZPac: expect slight improvement over 2H FY2016: (i) benefit 
of  full  Pacific  Steel  /  billet  caster  economics;  (ii)  higher  steel 
pricing  with  impact  of  lagged  regional  steel  pricing  from  4Q 
FY2016;  (iii)  one-off  benefits  of  provision  adjustments  in  2H 
FY2016 not repeated.
(cid:131)  BP: expect continued growth driven by volume and mix, noting 
2H FY2016 delivered particularly strong margins (especially in 
North  America  due  to  spread  expansion  in  supply  chain). 
Continued 
in  brand,  channel  and  product 
development.
(cid:131)  BB:  in  North  America,  expect  seasonally  stronger  volumes 
combined  with  benefits  from  improvement  programs;  at  Asia 
Buildings,  expect  benefit  of  improvement  program  combined 
with  seasonally  higher  volumes,  but  competitive  pressure  on 
margins;  continued  strong  performance  expected  at  China 
Coated.
(cid:131)  HRP North America: expect continued full despatch rate; strong
spreads to continue in 1Q; expecting softening spreads in 2Q.
Group outlook: 
(cid:131)  We  expect  1H  FY2017  underlying  EBIT  to  be  around  50% 
higher than 2H FY2016 which was $340.4M. This is based on 
assumption of average (all prices on a metric tonne basis):

(cid:16)  AUD:USD at US$0.75
(cid:131)  Expect 1H FY2017 underlying net finance costs to be lower than 
2H  FY2016  due  to  lower  average  borrowings;  expect  slightly 
higher underlying tax rate and similar profit attributable to non-
controlling interests to 2H FY2016.
(cid:131)  Expectations are subject to spread, FX and market conditions. 
 
BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND PROSPECTS  
The Company’s target is to deliver top quartile shareholder returns 
with safe operations. 
 
BlueScope’s strategy focuses on the following areas: 
(cid:131)  Growing  premium  branded  steel  businesses  with  strong
channels to market. In particular:
(cid:16)  Drive growth in premium branded coated and painted steel
markets in Asia-Pacific.
(cid:16)  For  our  engineered  buildings  segment,  drive  growth  in
North America and turn around China.
(cid:131)  Delivering  competitive  commodity  steel  supply  in  our  local
markets. Current priorities under this banner are:
(cid:16)  Maximise value of North Star. 
(cid:16)  Deliver  value
from  Australian  and  New  Zealand 
steelmaking  and  iron  sands  through  game-changing  cost 
reductions, or pursue alternative models.
(cid:131)  Ensuring  ongoing  financial  strength  by  maintaining  a  strong
balance sheet.
FUTURE PROSPECTS AND RISKS 
BlueScope’s financial performance since the global financial crisis in 
FY2009 has been impacted by slower demand for its products in 
Australia and North America, lower global commodity steel prices 
relative to raw material costs, and until late calendar year 2014, a 
stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. These are the 
external macroeconomic factors to which BlueScope is exposed. 
While there has been some improvement in external macroeconomic 
factors, there continues to be significant short-term fluctuation.   
 
The Company has undertaken significant restructuring and other 
initiatives in recent years across all its operating segments to offset 
these macroeconomic factors. This has resulted in BlueScope 
returning an underlying profit in FY2013, which has continued to 
improve through to FY2016.  
 
BlueScope has regard to a number of recognised external 
forecasters when assessing possible future operating and market 
conditions. These forecasters expect a general slow-down in steel 
demand impacting our Australian business over the next few years, 
an improvement in global commodity steel prices relative to iron ore 
and coking coal raw material costs, and a relatively stable Australian 
dollar. In addition, recognised external forecasters expect a 
continued improvement in non-residential building and construction 
activity in North America but not at the pace experienced in recent 
years. 
 
BlueScope is also exposed to a range of market, operational, 
financial, compliance, conduct and external risks common to a 
multinational company. The Company has risk management and 
internal control systems to identify material business risks and where 
possible take mitigating actions.  
 
The nature and potential impact of risks changes over time. There 
are various risks that could impact the achievement of BlueScope's 
strategies and financial prospects. These include, but are not limited 
to: 
 
(a) Continuing weak economic conditions or another economic
downturn. 
The global financial crisis in FY2009 caused a reduction in 
worldwide demand for steel, and the subsequent recovery has 
been slow and uncertain. Although the global economy has 
improved to some extent since FY2009, there is no assurance 
that this trend will continue. Another economic downturn in 
developed economies or significantly slower growth in emerging 
economies, particularly China, could have a material adverse 
effect on the global steel industry which may affect demand for 
the Company’s products and financial prospects.
(b) A significant cyclical or permanent downturn in the industries in
which the Company operates. 
The Company’s financial prospects are sensitive to the level of 
activity in a number of industries, but principally the building, 
construction and manufacturing industries. These industries are 
cyclical in nature, with the timing, extent and duration of these 
economic cycles unpredictable. Because many of the Company’s 
costs are fixed, it may not readily be able to reduce its costs in 
proportion to an economic downturn and therefore any 
significant, extended or permanent downturn could negatively 
affect the Company’s financial prospects, as would the 
permanent closure of significant manufacturing operations in 
response to a sustained weak economic outlook or loss of key 
customer relationships.

This document sets out information on the business strategies and 
prospects for future financial years, and refers to likely developments 
in BlueScope’s operations and the expected results of those 
operations in future financial years. This information is provided to 
enable shareholders to make an informed assessment about the 
business strategies and prospects for future financial years of 
BlueScope. Detail that could give rise to likely material detriment to 
BlueScope, for example, information that is commercially sensitive, 
confidential or could give a third party a commercial advantage has 
not been included. Other than the information set out in this 
document, information about other likely developments in 
BlueScope’s operations in future financial years has not been 
included.
(c) Declines in the price of steel, or any significant and sustained
increase in the price of raw materials in the absence of 
corresponding steel price increases. 
The Company’s financial prospects are sensitive to the long-term 
price trajectory of international steel products and key raw 
material prices. A significant and sustained increase in the price 
of raw materials, in particular iron ore and coking coal, with no 
corresponding increase in steel prices, would have an adverse 
impact on the Company’s financial prospects. A decline in the 
price of steel with no corresponding decrease in the price of raw 
materials would have the same effect.  
In addition to these long-term trends, the price of raw materials 
and steel products can fluctuate significantly in a reasonably 
short period of time affecting the Company’s short-term financial 
performance. In particular this relates to commodity products 
such as slab, plate, hot rolled coil, cold rolled coil, and some 
metallic coated steel products. 
The Company is monitoring the general trend of lower steel 
prices since the GFC coinciding with a slowing in Chinese 
domestic steel demand growth, increased steel exports from 
China and broader over-capacity in steelmaking globally. These 
trends, if sustained, could impact the long term competitiveness 
of supply of steel from its Australian and New Zealand 
steelmaking businesses and impact ongoing reinvestment.
(d)  The Company is exposed to the effects of exchange rate
fluctuations. 
The Company’s financial prospects are sensitive to foreign 
exchange rate movements, in particular the Australian dollar 
relative to the U.S. dollar. A strengthening of the Australian dollar 
relative to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the 
Company. This is because: 
(cid:131)  export sales are typically denominated in U.S. dollars 
(cid:131)  a strong Australian dollar makes imported steel products less 
expensive  to  Australian  customers,  potentially  resulting  in 
more imports of steel products into Australia
(cid:131)  a strong Australian dollar affects the pricing of steel products 
in some Australian market segments where pricing is linked 
to international steel prices
(cid:131)  earnings from its international businesses must be translated
into Australian dollars for financial reporting purposes
(cid:131)  these are offset in part by a significant amount of raw material
purchases being denominated in U.S. dollars.
(e) Competition from other materials and from other steel producers
could significantly reduce market prices and demand for the 
Company’s products. 
In many applications, steel competes with other materials such 
as aluminium, concrete, composites, plastic and wood. 
Improvements in the technology, production, pricing or 
acceptance of these competitive materials relative to steel could 
result in a loss of market share or margins. 
In addition, the global steel industry is currently characterised by 
significant excess capacity and the Company faces competition 
from imports into most of the countries in which it operates. 
Increases in steel imports could negatively impact demand for or 
pricing of the Company’s products. If the Company is unable to 
maintain its current market position or to develop new channels 
to market for its existing product range, its financial prospects 
could be adversely impacted.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE – FY2016 VS. FY2015 
Sales revenue 
The $354.7M decrease in sales revenue is primarily due to: 
(cid:131)
lower  domestic  and  export  prices  driven  by  lower  global  steel 
prices partly offset by the weaker AUD:USD exchange rate 
lower Australian Distribution volumes due to the restructure and 
resulting closure of unprofitable sites 
lower export volumes due to increased domestic demand
(cid:131) 
BlueScope Steel Limited – FY2016 Directors’ Report
(cid:131)
These were partly offset by: 
(cid:131)
higher  domestic  volumes  across  most  categories,  in  particular 
hot  rolled  coil,  metal  coated  steels  (ZINCALUME®  steel  and 
galvanised)  and  COLORBOND®  steel,  driven  by  residential 
construction  (new-start  and  alterations  and  additions)  and 
distributor demand.
EBIT performance 
The $211.1M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to: 
(cid:131)
lower costs driven by: 
(cid:16)
cost  reductions  realised  through  delivery  on  the  cost-out 
program 
lower unit costs with higher production volumes
(cid:16) 
favourable  volume/mix  from  higher  domestic  volumes  across 
most categories, in particular hot rolled coil, metal coated steels 
(ZINCALUME®  steel  and  galvanised)  and  COLORBOND® 
steel.
(cid:131)
These were partly offset by: 
(cid:131)
lower spread from: 
(cid:16)
lower  domestic  and  export  prices  driven  by  lower  global 
steel  prices  partly  offset  by 
the  weaker  AUD:USD 
exchange rate 
partly offset by lower USD denominated iron ore and coal 
purchase  prices  partly  offset  by  unfavourable  foreign 
exchange impact.
(cid:16)
Underlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in Tables 2A 
and 2B. 
 
FINANCIAL POSITION  
Net operating assets were $344.1M lower than at 30 June 2015 
primarily due to: 
(cid:131)
lower  fixed  assets,  mainly  due  to  an  impairment  charge  of 
$189.0M  taken  at  31  December  2015  following  the  review  of 
steel and iron ore price forecasts and discount rates in light of 
macroeconomic and global steel market changes 
lower receivables and inventories.
(cid:131) 
These were partly offset by lower provisions.  
 
MARKETS AND OPERATIONS 
Sales direct to Australian building sector  
(cid:131)  Domestic building sector direct  sales volumes strengthened in
FY2016 compared to FY2015.
(cid:131)  The  residential  construction  market  continues  to  be  a  major
driver of growth for the Australian economy. 
(cid:16)  Strong investor demand, historically low interest rates and 
robust  population  growth  has  resulted  in  growth  in  new 
residential development.
(cid:16)  Sales  of  COLORBOND®  steel  continue  to  strengthen 
supported  by  the  detached  dwelling  market,  which  has 
grown above the long term mean.
(cid:16)  New  South  Wales,  Victoria  and  Queensland  continue  to 
deliver strong sales growth. Conditions in South Australia 
have  stabilised,  whilst  other  states  remain  relatively 
subdued.
(cid:16)  Alterations  and  additions  activity  recovered  strongly  in 
FY2016  supported  by  robust  house  price  growth  and 
record low interest rates.
(cid:131)  Non-residential  construction  activity  has  been  relatively  flat  in
FY2016.

through  demand
(cid:16)  Sales
(cid:16)  Pipe  and  Tube  sales  grew  through  initiatives  to  improve 
share  competing  against  imported  finished  goods.  Sales 
volumes further benefitted by customer re-stocking activity 
in 4Q FY2016.
(cid:16)  Despite the decline in automotive manufacturer activity in 
recent years, ASP’s sales to the automotive industry grew 
slightly  in  FY2016  through  enhancements  to  its  product 
offering, with the launch of a new product called V-Coat for 
use by Toyota.
(cid:16)  Manufacturing  volumes  declined  due  to  some  customer 
closure and offshoring of production during FY2016. There 
are  however  positive  signs  of

emerging with the AiGroup Performance of Manufacturing 
Index finishing FY2016 in net expansionary territory.
Mill sales to export markets  
(cid:131)  Despatches  to  export  market  customers  in  FY2016  were 
695.5kt, 13% lower than  FY2015 due to  increased demand in 
the domestic market.
(cid:131)  Prices  in  export  markets  were  significantly  weaker  in  FY2016 
compared with FY2015 with lower global steel prices driven by 
the continued oversupply of steel in global markets.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE – FY2016 VS. FY2015 
Sales revenue 
The $84.8M decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower 
steel and iron sands prices reducing in line with global price falls and 
lower despatches of flat and long steel products. (Lower total 
despatches were in part due Pacific Steel’s move late in the FY2016 
year to billet sourced from New Zealand Steel with the 
commissioning of the billet caster). This was partly offset by the 
impact of a weaker NZD:USD and higher iron sands despatch 
volumes. 
 
EBIT performance 
The $20.3M decrease in underlying EBIT was largely due to lower 
realised iron sands and steel pricing reflecting lower global prices 
partly offset by lower costs and favourable impacts from a weaker 
NZD:USD.
These were partly offset by lower costs due to cost reduction 
initiatives. 
 
Underlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in Tables 2A 
and 2B. 
 
FINANCIAL POSITION 
Net operating assets were $448.2M lower than at 30 June 2015 
primarily due to: 
(cid:131)
lower  fixed  assets  mainly  due  to  an  impairment  charge  of 
$364.6M,  of  which  $182.4M  relates  to  the  full  write-down  of 
Taharoa  export  iron  sands  non-current  assets,  following  the 
review of steel and iron ore price forecasts and discount rates in 
light of macroeconomic and global steel market changes 
an increase in provisions   
a reduction in inventory.

MARKETS & OPERATIONS 
Steel products (flat and long) 
(cid:131)  Domestic market
(cid:16)  Flat  product  sales  volume  was  in  line  with  FY2015,  with 
higher  building  volumes  and  flat  manufacturing  offset  by 
weaker agriculture.
(cid:16)  Domestic long product steel sales were lower than FY2015,
coming off peak demand in that prior period.
(cid:16)
(cid:16)  Domestic residential building activity continues to grow. For 
the  12  months  ended  June  2016,  new  building  consents 
are up 16% on the same period in 2015.
(cid:16)  Domestic  non-residential  building  is  showing  signs  of 
recovery with the value up 14% in the 12 months to June 
2016 compared to the previous 12 month period. 
In  Canterbury,  non-residential  construction  continues  to 
grow with the total value of all new non-residential consents 
up  12.8%  in  FY2016.  Residential  consents  are  slowing, 
down 7.1% for the 12 months.
(cid:16)  Our Pacific Steel long products mills in Auckland are now 
being  supplied  with  billet  from  Glenbrook  and  the  full 
earnings run-rate potential of the Pacific Steel acquisition 
has been visible from 4Q FY2016. This results in a better 
overall domestic/export sales mix on lower overall volumes.
(cid:16)  Despite global price increases across the last half, overall 
export  markets  continue  to  be  under  significant  pricing 
pressure  due  to  weaker  regional  steel  prices  and  excess 
supply.

delivering a game-changing approach that will significantly 
reduce costs to ensure they are internationally competitive,

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE – FY2016 VS. FY2015 
Sales revenue 
The $24.0M decrease in sales revenue was mainly driven by lower 
steel prices impacting all regions. These were partly offset by 
favourable foreign exchange rate impacts (against the AUD) in all 
regions. 
 
EBIT performance 
The $51.0M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to: 
(cid:131)
higher margins across most businesses with lower raw material 
purchase prices more than offsetting lower selling prices

capability to drive painted volumes in the retail segment.
North America (Steelscape & ASC Profiles) 
(cid:131)  FY2016  despatch  volume  was  higher  than  FY2015  driven  by 
stronger  domestic  market  demand  and  an  increase  in  pre-
painted market share. Margins improved due to strong pricing, 
lower raw material cost, and tight cost control.
(cid:131)  U.S. anti-dumping duties have been imposed on the business’s 
imported  hot  rolled  coil  feed.  A  sourcing  strategy  has  been 
developed to reduce the impact on the business.
(cid:131)  The  business  continues  to  target  product

(cid:131)  FY2016  despatch  volume  grew  5%  from  FY2015.  Industrial, 
commercial  and  retail  demand  was  soft  in  1H  FY2016  but 
recovered  strongly  in  2H  FY2016  driven  by  positive  effect  of 
improved government spending and foreign direct investment.

Indonesia 
(cid:131)  FY2016  volume  was  slightly  lower  than  FY2015  amid  overall 
weak  market  demand.  This  was  offset 
through  margin

offerings and lower raw material prices.
(cid:131)  The business continues to focus efforts on  growth in strategic
market segments and strengthening brand position.
Vietnam 
(cid:131)  FY2016 despatch volume grew 1% from FY2015 on the back of 
higher domestic premium dispatches.  Margins improved due to 
reduced raw material costs and better product mix.
(cid:131)  The domestic market continues to benefit from growing foreign
direct investment and improved consumer confidence.
(cid:131)  The  business  continues  to  target  growth  through  expanding 
retail  channel  footprint,  building  brand  value  and  new  product 
development.
Malaysia 
(cid:131)  FY2016  despatch  volume  was  marginally  lower  than  FY2015 
with the backdrop of political uncertainty and weaker oil prices 
slowing  growth  in  demand.  Margins  grew  by  early  price 
leadership and increased premiums, enhanced by flat cost base 
and lower raw material costs.

(cid:131)  Volumes  increased  17%  relative  to  FY2015,  driven  by  an 
increase  in  internal  demand  from  the  Engineered  Buildings

was partly offset by a decline in rollformer demand.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE – FY2016 VS. FY2015 
Sales revenue 
The $167.8M increase in sales revenue was mainly due to favourable 
foreign exchange rate impacts (against the AUD) in all regions and 
higher despatch volumes in Engineered Buildings Asia and Building 
Products China. This was partly offset by lower steel prices across all 
regions and lower despatch volumes in North America.  
 
EBIT performance 
The $5.5M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to:

FINANCIAL POSITION  
Segment net operating assets increased from $112.8M at 30 June 
2015 to $1,862.3M at 30 June 2016 mainly due to the consolidation 
of North Star effective 30 October 2015.  At 30 June 2016, segment 
net operating assets comprised mainly: $1,248.4M intangible assets, 
$595.6M fixed assets, $109.8M inventories, $119.7M receivables, 
$204.5M creditors and $7.7M provisions. 
 
MARKETS AND OPERATIONS 
North Star BlueScope Steel 
(cid:131)  North  Star  sells  approximately  80%  of  its  production  in  the 
Midwest U.S., with its end customer segment mix being broadly 
45%  automotive,  25%  construction,  10%  agricultural  and  20% 
manufacturing/industrial applications.
(cid:131)  North Star continues to benefit from strength in the automotive 
sector as well as continued recovery in the construction sector. 
(cid:131)  High capacity utilisation rates have been maintained by NSBSL 
through  an  ability  to  retain  existing  customers  and  win  new 
customers by consistent high performance in on-time delivery, 
service and quality.
(cid:131)  On 7 May 2016 a refractory failure allowed a wash-out of molten 
steel from North Star’s south EAF shell, resulting in an explosion 
and fire. The south EAF was repaired and fully operational by 16 
May 2016. The total cost, including the value of lost production 
and capital repairs, was approximately US$5.0M.
(cid:131)  Despatches  for  FY2016  of  2,021.6kt  were  0.2%  higher  than
FY2015.
(cid:131)  Work continues on incremental expansion projects to increase
hot strip mill and caster capacity.
HOT ROLLED PRODUCTS NORTH AMERICA 
During FY2016 this segment comprised North Star BlueScope Steel 
and BlueScope’s 47.5% interest in Castrip LLC (a thin strip casting 
technology joint venture with Nucor and IHI Ltd). 
 
North Star is a single site electric arc furnace producer of hot rolled 
coil in Ohio, in the U.S. On 30 October 2015, BlueScope acquired the 
50% of North Star that was previously owned by Cargill. BlueScope’s 
50% interest in North Star was equity accounted up to 30 October 
2015 and has been consolidated in BlueScope’s accounts thereafter. 
 
Castrip LLC is a thin strip casting technology business. BlueScope 
sold its interest in Castrip to Nucor on 8 July 2016 for US$20.0M. 
 
This segment will be known as North Star BlueScope Steel from 
FY2017 onwards.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE – FY2016 VS. FY2015 
Sales revenue 
Until November 2015 the segment was comprised of two equity 
accounted investments and as such had no sales revenue recorded 
in the Group accounts. Segment revenue reflects consolidation of 
North Star from November 2015.  
 
Earnings performance 
The $39.2M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to the 
favourable impact of 100% consolidation from November 2015 and 
favourable translation impacts from a weaker AUD exchange rate. 
These were partly offset by weaker USD realised steel spreads with 
Midwest hot rolled coil prices falling more that raw material costs. 
 
Underlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in Tables 2A 
and 2B.

NEW ZEALAND EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME 
(cid:131)  The Company is a liable entity under New Zealand’s ETS.   
(cid:131)  The activity of iron and steel manufacturing from iron sands as 
undertaken  by  New  Zealand  Steel  has  been  assessed  to  be 
highly  emissions-intensive  and 
trade-exposed,  and  New 
Zealand Steel therefore qualifies for the allocation of Emission 
Units at the maximum rate (currently 90%). 
(cid:131)  The  ETS  is  a  domestic-only  scheme  from  June  2015,  but  the 
initial  scheme  transition  measures  currently  remain  in  place. 
During this period participants must surrender one emission unit 
for 
tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  emissions. 
Correspondingly the allocation of units to energy-intensive and 
trade-exposed  activities  is  halved,  but  remains  at  the  90% 
allocation rate. It is possible to buy units at market price or at a 
fixed price of NZ$25 per tonne from the government.  
(cid:131)  The Government’s 2015/16 review of the NZ ETS to assess its 
operation and effectiveness to 2020 and beyond continues, but 
the Government has announced it is phasing out the one-for-two 
transitional  measure  from  1  January  2017.  The  current  50% 
surrender obligation will increase to 67% from 1 January 2017, 
83% from 1 January 2018, and a full surrender obligation from 1 
January 2019 for all sectors in the NZ ETS. New Zealand Steel 
allocations will increase proportionally with the removal of one-
for-two.  The  Company  will  continue 
the 
Government,  seeking  acceptable  financial  outcomes  from  the 
ETS  until  the  rest  of  the  global  steel  industry  faces  the  same 
responsibilities for emissions.

REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) 
Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration and Organisation Committee 
Dear fellow Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for 2016.
BlueScope is a global company operating in 17 countries around the world with a large and successful presence throughout Asia and the United 
States, in addition to its operations in Australia and New Zealand.  During FY2016 the Company grew across its Asian and US operations in what 
continues to be challenging times for the global steel industry.  In FY2016 BlueScope delivered a $293.1M underlying net profit after tax, a $159M 
increase from FY2015 including growing underlying EBIT by 89% to $570.5M. 
BlueScope is one of the few steel companies in the world that is not only profitable but also improving its profitability.  Driving this was:  
(cid:120)  Continued growth and investment in our Asian and North American Coated and Buildings businesses. 
(cid:120)  Significant progress made in restructuring our Australian and New Zealand steel-making operations to improve cost competitiveness during a 
very difficult time in the global steel-making industry.  The restructuring was achieved with the support of our employees, the local community, 
unions and governments.  The significant progress made in the restructuring initiatives saved 4,500 direct jobs in the Illawarra by avoiding a 
closure of the Port Kembla Steelworks, and along with productivity improvements in our Buildings businesses in the United States and China, 
delivered a total of $327.5M of management initiated cost savings across the company. This is net of escalation during the year.
(cid:120)  Acquisition of the 50% share that we did not own in the North Star BlueScope Steel business based in Delta, Ohio in the United States.  The
business was acquired at a time of low industry margins. Since the acquisition, industry margins in the United States have improved 
dramatically, and as a result the business is delivering pleasing financial performance.
Recognising the profitable performance outside Australia, and the challenges in Australia and New Zealand, the compensation arrangements for 
the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO), and the other Key Management Personnel (KMP) Executives, were adjusted at the 
start of the year to ensure ongoing and close alignment with shareholders and to reflect the company’s transition.  These arrangements, detailed 
below, were approved with a 95% vote of support from shareholders at last year’s AGM: 
(cid:120)  A fixed pay freeze for FY2016 and FY2017 for the MD & CEO and KMP Executives. 
(cid:120)  Performance based incentive packages rewarded entirely in equity with no cash payments. 
(cid:120)  No Short Term Incentives (STI) for the MD & CEO in FY2016. In its place a two year equity STI program was established with
performance to be measured over the two year period to the end of FY2017.
(cid:120)  No STI for the Chief Executive BlueScope Australia & New Zealand (BANZ) for FY2016. 
(cid:120)  Other KMP participated in the same two year equity STI program as the MD & CEO with performance measured over the two year period to
the end of FY2017, with the exception of the portion related to FY2016 financial performance which is assessed at the end of FY2016.
(cid:120)  The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI) was amended to introduce a second performance condition as a response to shareholder feedback. Half
of the share rights are subject to a relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition and the other half are subject to a compound annual 
growth rate of Earnings per Share (EPS) condition.
(cid:120)  The FY2017 LTI Plan award was brought forward to coincide with the FY2016 award.  The performance period commenced one year early
on 1 September 2015, with a four year term to 31 August 2019 (plus one retest on the relative TSR component only).
As Chair of the Board’s Remuneration and Organisation Committee, I worked closely with my fellow Directors, our external advisers and 
management to ensure we have an effective remuneration program which continues to motivate our people to deliver results.  
The Board believes that the arrangements detailed above maximise the alignment of remuneration for executives with the interests of 
shareholders and are supporting the successful implementation of our two year strategy programme.  Based on the Board’s interim 
assessment against the targets set for the two year STI program, performance is currently tracking well above Target and this is likely 
to result in strong outcomes.  The final assessment will be reflected in the FY2017 Report when details of actual performance outcomes 
against the two year targets will be disclosed. 
I trust you, our shareholders, find the 2016 Remuneration Report provides clear and informative insights into our executive remuneration policies, 
practices and outcomes.

1.2  CONTEXT 
BlueScope’s remuneration structures play an important role in motivating executives to deliver the business strategy and deliver results that 
reward shareholders. The Board therefore takes great care to ensure that, as the business priorities evolve, so too do BlueScope’s remuneration 
arrangements. 
 
Over recent years, BlueScope has successfully navigated the challenges of a global steel industry undergoing fundamental change. In the years 
ahead, it will be even more critical for BlueScope to deliver game-changing cost and revenue improvements. The Board reviewed the Company’s 
remuneration arrangements, and as foreshadowed in the FY2015 Remuneration Report and Annual General Meeting, a number of special 
arrangements have been implemented for FY2016 and FY2017 to increase the alignment of executive remuneration with shareholder 
experience. 
 
The new reward arrangements have shifted the performance emphasis to strategic outcomes over a two year timeframe, linked to earnings 
growth and share price performance over four years. This provides even closer alignment with shareholder experiences.  
 
Key features of the FY2016 and FY2017 reward arrangements for the MD & CEO and other KMP Executives are outlined below: 
 
(cid:131)  The base pay of the MD & CEO was frozen at FY2015 levels for two years.  All FY2016 and FY2017 STI and LTI awards, where provided to
the MD & CEO, are equity awards with no cash incentives paid in respect of FY2016 or FY2017.
(cid:131)  The only compensation paid to the MD & CEO, solely related to FY2016, is base pay and superannuation frozen at FY2015 levels. All equity
awards disclosed were approved by shareholders at the AGM in November 2015.
(cid:131)  Fixed pay was also frozen for FY2016 and FY2017 for all KMP Executives. 
(cid:131)  The FY2016 and FY2017 STI opportunities have been merged into a single incentive and delivered entirely as share rights (no cash 
payments will be made). The rights are awarded up-front and may vest subject to performance assessed at the end of two years. The 
performance conditions are assessed 50% against Company-wide underlying Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) and Business Unit underlying 
Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) and Free Cash Flow (FCF) targets, and 50% against safety and other strategic objectives based on 
business priorities.
(cid:131)  Mark Vassella the Chief Executive of BlueScope ANZ will not receive an STI for FY2016.  This is consistent with the interventions in the
Australian and New Zealand business restructures announced in August 2015. Other KMP Executives are eligible for awards for the FY2016 
financial component of their STI (underlying NPAT / EBIT and FCF) which have a one year deferral. The remainder of their award and all of 
the MD & CEO’s award will be assessed at the conclusion of FY2017.
(cid:131)  The LTI plan has been amended to introduce a second performance condition. Half of the share rights are subject to a relative TSR
condition and the other half are subject to a compound annual growth rate of Earnings per Share (EPS) condition.
(cid:131)  The FY2017 LTI plan award has been brought forward to coincide with the FY2016 award. The performance period commenced one year
early on 1 September 2015, with a four year term to 31 August 2019 (plus one retest on the relative TSR component only).
The Board is confident these changes will enhance the alignment between shareholder and executive interests and will motivate executives to 
achieve the Company’s strategy. 
 
2.  REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK AND POLICY  
2.1  FRAMEWORK AND PURPOSE 
At BlueScope, executive remuneration packages typically comprise three elements – fixed pay, short term incentives and long term incentives, 
the purpose of which is to align executive reward with shareholder outcomes, executive performance, and the retention of key talent. Although 
these elements are described separately, they must nevertheless be viewed as part of an integrated package: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In exceptional circumstances, a further element relating to targeted retention may also be applied.  No retention awards were made to KMP 
during FY2016.
• Encourages the retention of highly capable leaders; and 
• Provides incentive to take well managed risks.

and accountability;

The mix of elements differs depending on the level in the organisation with a higher skew towards fixed pay at lower levels. Overall the aim is to 
provide executives the opportunity to earn top quartile remuneration for stretch performance. While there have been changes to BlueScope’s 
reward structure in FY2016, the reward mix has not changed. For KMP the usual mix of elements as a proportion of total remuneration at target 
in FY2016 is shown below:

2.2  FIXED PAY 
Fixed pay recognises the market value of an individual’s skills, experience, accountability and their expected sustained contribution in delivering 
the fundamental requirements of their role.  In order to attract and retain skilled leaders, BlueScope aims to maintain a competitive position for 
fixed pay – around the 60th percentile of the peer group noted at section 6.3.  Fixed pay is base pay plus superannuation. 
In FY2016, fixed pay was frozen for the MD & CEO and other KMP Executives. 
 
2.3  SHORT TERM INCENTIVE (STI) 
The following table summarises the STI plan that applied in FY2016. 
Feature
Description 
To achieve BlueScope’s overall strategic objectives by motivating executives to deliver on priority team-
based outcomes. 
All KMP Executives disclosed in this report. 
Target STI levels are set having regard to appropriate levels in the market and are: 
(cid:131) 
80% of base pay (or 70% of fixed pay) for the MD & CEO 
(cid:131) 
60% of base pay (or 53% of fixed pay) for the other KMP Executives  
Maximum STI (for outstanding results or stretch outcomes) are capped at:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
As previously flagged, changes were made to the STI plan for FY2016 and FY2017. The key changes to the 
performance conditions are as follows: 
(cid:131)  As foreshadowed at the 2015 AGM, financial and strategic STI objectives to be measured over two
120% of base pay for the MD & CEO 
90% of base pay for the other KMP Executives

(cid:131)  To retain focus on annual financial performance, financial objectives to be measured over one year for
other KMP Executives (except Mark Vassella, Chief Executive BANZ, who did not participate in the 
FY2016 STI Plan) covering both company-wide performance and Business Unit performance, with 
strategic objectives to be measured over two years

Description 
For FY2016, only the financial component of the performance conditions for other KMP Executives was 
eligible for assessment. No assessment of performance for the MD & CEO will be made until the conclusion 
of FY2017. 
Safety-related performance conditions in the STI plan 
BlueScope is proud of its world leading safety performance and safety remains its first priority and core 
value. Historically, the Company has set percentage improvement targets on Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rates (LTIFR) and Medical Treatment Injury Frequency Rates (MTIFR) to support our journey to Zero Harm 
by encouraging a safe and healthy work environment. Over time, and as performance has improved, 
targets, including performance hurdles, have been introduced to allow businesses to nominate performance 
indicators appropriate to their level of safety maturity, risk profile and priority focus.  Safety is our number 
one priority, and the Board and Management are committed to ensuring that cost savings are not 
implemented at the expense of safety.  
This approach accommodates businesses with low or zero LTIFR and MTIFR performance, where these 
metrics are no longer appropriate measures of safety improvement. It also allows our diverse businesses to 
select from a range of performance indicators the most appropriate ones for their business to measure and 
reward safety improvement.   
For KMP Executives, a performance hurdle of no fatality and a LTIFR of <1 is in place. MTIFR improvement 
targets are established against the previous year’s performance.  
For individual business units, a benchmark (Best practice LTIFR and MTIFR) is set at the highest business 
level (NS BlueScope, BlueScope Buildings, North Star BlueScope or BANZ) based on the previous year’s 
results.  Business Units whose performance is worse than the best practice benchmark are required to 
maintain improvement targets focused on output (LTIFR/MTIFR) measures. Business Units performing at or 
better than the best practice benchmark can substitute output measures with input measures better suited to 
their individual circumstances and drive improved performance   These businesses select from an approved 
list of leading indicators.
Performance targets for FY2016 have been set in the context of the specific business strategy and new 
priorities.  Performance conditions, including Threshold, Target and Stretch hurdles, are set for each plan 
and approved by the Board for all KMP Executives.  If the Threshold level is not reached, no payment is 
made in respect of that goal.  
In prior financial years, two-thirds of any STI payment was made in cash, and one third was withheld and 
awarded in restricted equity with a one year trading lock.  In FY2016, STI payment takes the form of 
equity only, and no cash payments will be made. Share rights have been awarded upfront, and will 
only vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been achieved. 
For each performance condition, the number of share rights that will vest will be determined as follows: 
Performance condition target 
Below threshold 
Threshold 
Target 
Maximum
0% 
33% 
67% 
100%
% of share rights that vest
For FY2016, the financial component of the performance conditions for KMP Executives was assessed, with 
the STI outcomes provided in section 3.1. 
The Board continues to have discretion to clawback STI equity awards in the event of serious misconduct by 
management which undermines the Company’s performance, financial soundness and reputation.  These 
events include misrepresentation or material misstatements due to errors, omissions or negligence. 
The Board retains the discretion to limit, defer or cancel any STI awards in exceptional circumstances, 
including determining that a reduced award or even no award should vest.

2.4  LONG TERM INCENTIVE (LTI) 
The following table summarises the LTI plan that applied in FY2016. 
Feature 
Purpose 
Eligibility
Description 
LTI is one of the means of aligning executives with the experience of shareholders. 
All KMP Executives disclosed in this report.  
The quantum of LTI awards is calculated based on an agreed percentage of base salary divided by the face 
value of shares using the volume weighted average price over the three months prior to the commencement 
of the performance period.  The LTI award level for the MD & CEO is 155% of base pay and for the KMP 
Executives is 80% of base pay. Fair value is used for reporting purposes as required by accounting 
standards, and is also used in benchmarking executive remuneration against the selected peer group which 
reports fair value. These levels are reviewed annually.
Value/opportunity
Instrument
Performance conditions
Share rights vest into fully paid ordinary BSL shares subject to time and performance conditions being met. 
As previously communicated, BlueScope has introduced an Earnings Per Share (EPS) hurdle to 
complement relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in FY2016. The Board has given careful consideration 
to the selection of this new second performance condition recognising some shareholders have a 
preference for EPS measures and others for capital return-based measures. EPS has been selected as the 
additional performance condition as the Board considers that return-based measures can be directly 
influenced by particular strategic decisions. EPS better measures financial results delivered by the 
Company, irrespective of particular strategy initiatives. The Board will review the appropriateness of EPS (or 
an alternative performance condition) for future awards.  
For the FY2016 LTI award: 
(cid:131)
50% is assessed against relative TSR compared to the ASX 100 over a three year period, plus a single 
retest which reflects the ongoing impact of volatility on the retention and incentive value of the LTI, and 
operates to extend the performance period from three years to four years. The re-test requires 
significant outperformance in the fourth year before any vesting.  In the absence of a relevant local or 
global peer group, the ASX 100 is considered to be appropriate given BlueScope’s relative market 
positioning and best reflects the markets where we compete for capital.  
50% is assessed against the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EPS over a three year period 
and refers to underlying EPS, and does not include a re-test.
(cid:131)
In order to further enhance the alignment of long term incentives with shareholder reward the FY2017 LTI 
award has been brought forward and granted at the same date as the FY2016 award, with the performance 
period on both the TSR and EPS hurdles increasing to four years (with one re-test on the TSR portion).  
This of course resulted in a grant of two LTIP tranches in FY2016, doubling the number in this particular 
year as shown in table 4.3. 
Relative TSR vesting schedule: 
Percentile achievement 
Less than 51st percentile 
51st percentile 
Between 51st percentile and 75th percentile 
75th percentile and above
Vesting outcome (% of award that vests) 
0% 
40% 
Straight line vesting 
100%
The EPS performance condition provides that no EPS share rights vest until the Company’s EPS CAGR 
reaches a “threshold” level. At this level, 40% of the EPS share rights vest. At a “maximum” level, 100% of 
the EPS share rights will vest. If the Company’s EPS CAGR is between the “threshold” and “maximum” 
levels, the number of EPS share rights that vest will be pro-rated on a straight-line basis. 
 
The Company has a policy not to provide earnings guidance to the market. The Board has established EPS 
CAGR targets and set the “threshold” and “maximum” levels, which will require a significant uplift in the 
Company’s earnings and will take account of the Company’s long-term business plans and financial 
projections, market practice and consensus forecasts. EPS CAGR targets were set on the basis of a starting 
point that included an assumed 100% ownership of North Star for FY2015 – in other words the earnings 
impact from the acquisition of the remaining 50% of North Star during FY2016 has been taken into account 
in establishing the starting point for the EPS targets. The Board will advise details of the specific underlying 
EPS CAGR targets and performance against the targets following the end of the performance period/s.   
Executives are not permitted to hedge (such as ‘cap and collar’ arrangements) LTI awards.

The Board considers executive shareholdings as a simple and transparent means of aligning the interests of shareholders and executives.  To 
support this principle, an executive shareholding policy has been put in place which requires the MD & CEO to build a minimum value of shares 
equivalent to 100% of base pay to be accumulated over time and for the KMP Executives a minimum of 50% of base pay.
3.  REWARD OUTCOMES - THE LINK BETWEEN REMUNERATION AND PERFORMANCE           
3.1  OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE  
FY2016 performance is being considered in the context of the delivery of significant improvements in overall Company financial performance.  
(cid:131)  Despite the weakest regional commodity steel spreads since BlueScope listed in 2002, delivery on management initiatives led to strong
growth underlying NPAT (up 119% on FY2015 to $293.1M). Underlying EBIT was up 89% on FY2015 to $570.5M
(cid:131)  Net debt at 30 June 2016 was $778.0M, up on 30 June 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of 50 per cent of North Star BlueScope Steel, 
but reduced by $595.4M from 31 December 2015. The leverage ratio (net debt to proforma underlying EBITDA) at 30 June 2016 of 0.8, was 
halved from the position at 31 December 2015 of 1.6. The Company achieved strong cash flow in the second half, driven by stronger cash 
earnings and timing of working capital reductions.
The following table outlines financial achievement for the other KMP Executives under the FY2016 STI plan. The remainder of the FY2016 award 
will be assessed at the conclusion of FY2017. All of the MD & CEO’s FY2017 award will be assessed at the conclusion of FY2017 having regard 
to performance over the two year period.

1.  Financial targets for FY2016 were set and performance was measured on the basis of an assumed 50% ownership of North Star for the
entire year.
The Board also set challenging targets for the MD & CEO to be achieved by 30 June 2017 for a range of strategic priorities.  Significant progress 
has been made during FY2016 in the delivery of these projects and the Board anticipates that the targets established at the start of FY2016 are 
likely to be exceeded by 30 June 2017.  Achievements to date include:  
(cid:131)  Coated & Painted growth in ASEAN, North America & India underlying EBIT; home appliance steels (SuperDyma®) in production in
Thailand; growth in Australian domestic coated product sales.
(cid:131)  Building Solutions: continued growth in North America earnings; total China earnings turning the corner, with reduced losses at China
Buildings.
considerably going into FY2017.
(cid:131)  North Star BlueScope Steel: acquired Cargill’s 50% share on 30 Oct 2015, to move to full ownership; steel spreads strengthened
(cid:131)  Australia & New Zealand Steelmaking: delivered $235M cost savings in FY2016: saving 4,500 jobs, avoiding an estimated $750M
mothballing/closure costs at Port Kembla and preserving benefit of exposure to higher Australian steel prices. Good progress on NZ cost 
savings.

(cid:131)  Significantly below target STI Awards were made in FY2012 with higher STI awards made in FY2013 and FY2014 reflecting the significant
improvement in performance in those years.
(cid:131)  Notwithstanding the improvements in financial performance in FY2015, STI Awards were less than 50% of target reflecting the challenging 
business circumstances faced by the Company, particularly in New Zealand, China and the lower than expected spreads in the Australian 
business.
(cid:131)  No LTI Awards vested between 2008 and 2014.  Details of awards which vested in FY2016 are included in table 3.3 below.

1)  Changes to AASB 119 Employee Benefits came into effect for BlueScope on 1 July 2013. The impact of this revised accounting standard is to increase defined benefit plan 
pension expense. Australian Accounting Standards require that comparative period financial information be adjusted to reflect the revised approach. Accordingly, each of the FY 
2013 earnings metrics are adjusted down by $28.7M pre-tax and $23.0M post-tax compared to those reported in the FY2013 financial statements. The comparative figures for 
FY2011 and FY2012 have not been restated.

2)  On 19 December 2012, the Company consolidated its share capital through the conversion of every six shares in the Company into one ordinary share in the Company.  As a
result, share prices and earnings per share for the prior periods have been restated to reflect this change.
3)  Underlying  earnings  (NPAT  and  EBIT)  are  categorised  as  non-IFRS  financial  information prepared  in  accordance with  ASIC  Regulatory  Guide  230 –  Disclosing non-IFRS 
financial information, issued in December 2011. Non-IFRS financial information while not subject to audit or review has been extracted from the financial report which has been 
audited  by  our  external  auditors.    Underlying  adjustments  have  been  considered  in  relation  to  their  size  and  nature,  to  assist  readers  to  better  understand  the  financial 
performance of the underlying business. These adjustments are assessed on a consistent basis from period to period and include both favourable and unfavourable items.
3.2  SHORT TERM INCENTIVE (STI) OUTCOMES 
Mr O’Malley and Mr Vassella are not eligible to receive an STI payment in FY2016. Consistent with the FY2016 STI plan detailed in section 
2.3, the Board has resolved that the STI outcomes for FY2016 financial performance set out in section 3.1 were achieved for the year.

1.  Consistent with the decision not to operate an STI Plan in BANZ business in FY2016, Mr Vassella did not participate in the STI programme.
Following the reintroduction of incentives in that business for FY2017, Mr Vassella will participate in the STI Plan for FY2017.

4.  EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION TABLES  
4.1  KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL – EXECUTIVES (INCLUDING MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER)  
The audited information contained in the following tables represents the annual remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2016 for the KMP.   
The changes to the BlueScope remuneration framework discussed throughout this report have given rise to a significant increase in the Share-based payments expense for each currently serving KMP in FY2016. 
This is primarily due to: 
(cid:131)  No cash STI.  All short and long term incentives are in equity. 
(cid:131)  FY2016 and FY2017 STI provided entirely in Share Rights, all of which were granted in FY2016 and amortised over two years subject to performance being achieved over the two year period. 
(cid:131)  FY2016 and FY2017 LTI being provided entirely in Share Rights, all of which were granted in FY2016 and amortised over three and four years respectively subject to performance being achieved
over three and four year performance periods respectively.
It is important to note that no further STI (other than for Mr Vassella) or LTI Share Rights grants will be made in FY2017, and that the Share-based payments expense will decrease in FY2017 as a result.

1)  There were no base pay increases during FY2016 apart from P J Finan who received a base pay increase of 8% due to his promotion to Chief Executive, BlueScope Buildings.  Exchange rate differences also affected overseas based KMPs.  
2)  Negative movement in annual and long service leave provisions indicates leave taken during the year exceeded leave accrued during the current year.  This is to be read in conjunction with column one (Salary and Fees). 
3)  There was no Short Term Incentive cash component in FY2016.  All STI is included in Rights which is included as a share based payment. The FY2015 STI represents the 2/3 of STI payable in cash. 
4)  Non-monetary includes executive health check and benefits provided under the Company's international assignment policy e.g. accommodation, tax equalisation, relocation benefits and medical coverage. 
5)  Due to changes in the superannuation legislation resulting in maximum contribution levels, members of the Defined Contribution Division can elect to receive a proportion of their superannuation as a cash allowance. 
6) 
7)  The % of remuneration that is performance related recognises LTI based on accounting values and not vested amounts actually received by executives. 
8)  S Dayal had previously been awarded only cash rights due to certain Singapore restrictions. Changes were introduced in FY2015 to enable equity rewards to be made. 
9)  R J Moore retired effective 30 November 2015. 
10)  FY2015 totals reflect the remuneration of those individuals who were KMP for both FY2015 and FY2016 – refer section 1.1.
Includes all awards of share rights including Awards under Short Term and Long Term Incentive Plans.

The number of share rights granted includes rights awarded under the FY2015 Short Term Incentive (STI) plan disclosed in the FY2015 Remuneration Report and share 
rights which are subject to Company performance hurdles, which were awarded under the FY2016/ FY2017 two year STI Award, the FY2016 and FY2017 LTI Awards 
consistent with shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM. 
The number of shares issued is equal to the number of rights exercised and no amount was paid or remains unpaid for each share issued.  Due to restrictions relating to 
awards of equity in Singapore, Mr Dayal was awarded Cash Rights in 2013 which delivers a cash payment on vesting. 
External advice from PWC Securities Limited has been used to determine the value of share rights awarded in the year ended 30 June 2016. The valuation has been made 
using the Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model (BSM) that includes a Monte Carlo simulation analysis. 
Share Rights vested during the year under the FY2014 STI Awards and FY2013 Long Term Incentive Plan.

5.  NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
5.1  OVERVIEW 
Fees are normally reviewed annually on 1 January.  Following a 
review this year, the Board decided that there would be no increase in 
Directors’ base or Committee fees for 2016.     
Non-executive Directors are expected to build a shareholding in the 
Company equivalent to one year’s base fees.  
The schedule of fees (exclusive of superannuation) effective 1 
January 2016, and which currently applies, is as follows:  
The maximum fee pool limit is currently $2,925,000 per annum 
(inclusive of superannuation) as approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting in 2008. Total fees paid to Directors for the 
year ended 30 June 2016 amounted to $1,922,708 (FY2015 
$2,229,714). 
Compulsory superannuation contributions per Director capped at 
$19,616 per annum (commencing 1 July 2016) are paid on behalf of 
each Director. Compulsory superannuation contributions for the year 
ended 30 June 2016 were $19,308 per annum. Non-executive 
Directors do not receive any other retirement benefits.

6.  REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE  
6.1  ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION AND ORGANISATION COMMITTEE 
The Board oversees the BlueScope human resources strategy, both directly and through the Remuneration and Organisation Committee of the 
Board (the Committee). The Committee consists entirely of independent Non-executive Directors.  
The Committee’s purview extends beyond remuneration matters and includes human resources strategy, policies, diversity, talent development, 
and the development and succession of executives.  With respect to remuneration specifically, the Committee has responsibility for overseeing 
and recommending to the Board remuneration strategy, policies and practices applicable to Non-executive Directors, the MD & CEO, KMP 
Executives, senior managers and employees generally, and focuses on the following activities: 
(cid:131)  An annual review of the Company’s remuneration strategy (including consultation with shareholders and proxy advisors);  
(cid:131)  Approving the terms of employment of the KMP, including determining the levels of remuneration; 
(cid:131)  Ensuring a robust approach to performance management through approval of the STI objectives and awards and reviewing performance of
KMP Executives;
(cid:131)  Considering all matters relating to the remuneration and performance of the MD & CEO prior to Board approval; 
(cid:131)  Approving awards of equity to employees; and 
(cid:131)  Ensuring the Company’s remuneration policies and practices operate in accordance with good corporate governance standards, including
approval of the Remuneration Report and communications to shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee seeks input from the MD & CEO and the Executive General Manager People & Performance, who attend Committee meetings, 
except where matters relating to their own remuneration are considered.  
6.2  INDEPENDENT REMUNERATION CONSULTANT 
The Committee engages and considers advice from independent remuneration consultants where appropriate. Remuneration consultants are 
engaged by, and report directly to, the Committee. Potential conflicts of interest are considered when remuneration consultants are selected and 
their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require independence from, BlueScope’s management. Any advice from external 
consultants is used as a guide, and is not a substitute for thorough consideration of all the issues by the Committee.  
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, also seeks the advice of expert external remuneration consultants to ensure that Director fees and 
payments reflect the duties of Board members and are in line with the market. The Chairman of the Board does not participate in any discussions 
relating to the determination of his own fees. 
BlueScope Steel Limited – FY2016 Directors’ Report
Page 36
During FY2016, the Remuneration and Organisation Committee proactively sought external perspectives on executive remuneration matters, 
employing the services of PwC to provide information and advice on remuneration strategy and structure including market practice which covers 
KMP.  No remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided.  
PwC attended selected Committee meetings during the year, providing an independent perspective on matters of quantum and structure of 
executive remuneration. The Board is satisfied that any advice provided to the Committee was made free from undue influence from any 
members of the KMP. 
6.3  BLUESCOPE STEEL REMUNERATION PEER GROUP 
The Board has selected (and reviews annually) a peer group of companies for the purposes of benchmarking remuneration that reflects the size 
and complexity of BlueScope with similarities on one or more of the following dimensions: operate in multiple geographies, have manufacturing or 
logistics operations in Australia, are involved in the building and construction industry, have similar number of employees, have similar revenue, 
or similar market capitalisation on the ASX.  
The Board believes that the more traditional reliance on market capitalisation as the sole criteria is not appropriate for establishing BlueScope’s 
remuneration benchmarks and would lead to unmanageable fluctuations in executive remuneration, and could result in an inability to attract and 
retain the skills required to manage a business operating in the complex and volatile environment in which BlueScope operates globally. 
The current peer group is listed below: 
Boral Ltd 
Adelaide Brighton Ltd 
Brambles Ltd 
Amcor Ltd 
Broadspectrum Ltd 
Arrium Ltd 
Caltex Australia Ltd 
Asciano Group 
Aurizon Holdings Ltd 
CSR Ltd

Description 
Paul O’Malley was appointed to the position of Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer effective from 1 
November 2007 and his contract is ongoing. The contract can be terminated by either party at any time on six 
months’ notice.  
If BlueScope terminates Mr O’Malley’s employment by notice, it may provide payment in lieu of notice and must 
make an additional payment of 12 months’ annual base pay. 
Mr O’Malley will be immediately terminated by BlueScope if, among other things, he wilfully breaches his Service 
Contract, is convicted of various offences for which he can be imprisoned or is disqualified from managing a 
corporation, or engages in conduct which is likely to adversely impact the reputation of BlueScope. In this 
circumstance, Mr O’Malley will only be entitled to his annual base pay up to the date of termination. 
BlueScope may terminate Mr O’Malley’s employment if he becomes incapacitated by physical or mental illness, 
accident or any other circumstances beyond his control for an accumulated period of six months in any 12 month 
period and, in this circumstance, will make payment of six months’ notice based on annual base pay. 
Mr O’Malley may resign if a fundamental change in his employment terms occurs and within three months of the 
fundamental change Mr O’Malley gives notice to BlueScope. In this event, the Company will provide Mr O’Malley 
with six months’ notice, or a payment in lieu of that notice, and a termination payment of 12 months’ annual base 
pay. 
Mr O’Malley is entitled to early vesting, subject to satisfying performance testing requirements, of LTIP awards on 
a change of control. 
Mr O’Malley is subject to a 12 month non-compete restriction after his employment ceases with BlueScope. Mr 
O’Malley cannot solicit or entice away from BlueScope any supplier, customer or employee or participate in a 
business that competes with BlueScope during the 12 month period.

Key features of the terms of employment for disclosed KMP Executives (other than the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer) include

termination will not exceed 12 month’s fixed pay. 
(cid:131)  Agreements are also in place for KMP Executives detailing the approach the Company will take with respect to payment of their termination 
payments and with respect to exercising its discretion on the vesting of Share Rights in the event of a ‘Change of Control’ of the organisation

OTHER MATTERS 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
BlueScope’s Australian manufacturing operations are subject to significant environmental regulation. Throughout its Australian operations in the 
12 months to 30 June 2016, the Company notified relevant authorities of 13 incidents resulting in statutory non-compliances.  The Company 
notified its site at Erskine Park, Sydney as a contaminated site; the EPA is currently investigating whether the contamination has migrated from 
an adjacent site not owned or operated by BlueScope.   The Company also notified its No.1 Works site (the original location of steelmaking) at 
Port Kembla and part of its Steelhaven site at Port Kembla as contaminated sites.   Boundary remediation has continued at the former Stainless 
steel manufacturing site at Port Kembla, which had been previously notified to NSW EPA and declared as ‘significantly contaminated’ by NSW 
EPA.    Investigations  at  the  Stainless  site  have  continued  pursuant  to  a  Voluntary  Management  Proposal  accepted  by  the  NSW  EPA.  In 
December 2014, the Victorian EPA served two Clean-Up Notices on BlueScope relating to its site at Sunshine, Victoria, requiring the assessment 
of  asbestos  contamination  at  the  site.   The  site  is  adjacent  to  a  former  asbestos  factory. Following  submission  of  assessment  reports  by 
BlueScope, the Clean-Up Notices were revoked and a further Clean-Up Notice issued requiring BlueScope to appoint an independent auditor to 
recommend management options for the site.  The auditor’s report was lodged with the Victorian EPA in June 2016.  During the  period there 
were no environmental prosecutions against the Company.  
 
BlueScope submits annual reports under the National Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reporting Scheme (greenhouse gas emissions and energy 
consumption and production for all Australian facilities), and the National Pollutant Inventory (substance emissions to air and water for a number 
of facilities).   
 
Each year BlueScope publishes a Community Safety and Environment Report, which is available on our website. The report provides further 
details of the Company’s environmental performance and initiatives. 
 
INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE OF OFFICERS 
BlueScope Steel has entered into directors' and officers' insurance policies and paid an insurance premium in respect of the insurance policies, 
to the extent permitted by the Corporations Act 2001. The insurance policies cover former Directors of BlueScope Steel along with the current 
Directors of BlueScope Steel (listed on page 18). Executive officers and employees of BlueScope Steel and its related bodies corporate are also 
covered. 
 
In accordance with Rule 21 of its Constitution, BlueScope Steel to the maximum extent permitted by law: 
(cid:131)  must indemnify any current or former Director or Secretary; and 
(cid:131)  may indemnify current or former executive officers, 
of BlueScope Steel or any of its subsidiaries, against all liabilities (and certain legal costs) incurred in those capacities to a person, including a 
liability incurred as a result of appointment or nomination by BlueScope Steel or its subsidiaries as a trustee or as a director, officer or employee 
of another corporation. 
 
Directors of BlueScope Steel, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary have entered into an Access, 
Insurance and Indemnity Deed with BlueScope Steel. The Deed addresses the matters set out in Rule 21 of the Constitution and includes, 
among other things, provisions requiring BlueScope Steel to indemnify an officer to the extent to which they are not already  indemnified as 
permitted under law, and to use its best endeavours to maintain an insurance policy covering the period while they are in office and seven years 
after ceasing to hold office. 
 
The Directors have not included details of the nature of the liabilities covered or the amount of the premium paid in respect of the directors' and 
officers' liability insurance contract, as (in accordance with normal commercial practice) such disclosure is prohibited under the terms of the 
contract. 
 
INDEMNIFICATION OF AUDITORS 
To the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of the terms of its audit engagement 
agreement against claims by third parties arising from the audit.  No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the 
financial year.  
PROCEEDINGS ON BEHALF OF BLUESCOPE STEEL 
As at the date of this report, there are no leave applications or proceedings brought on behalf of BlueScope Steel under section 237 of the 
Corporations Act 2001.  
 
ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS 
Amounts in the Directors' Report are presented in Australian dollars with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand dollars, or in certain 
cases,  the  nearest  dollar, 
in  accordance  with  the  Australian  Securities  and  Investments  Commission  Corporations  (Rounding  in 
Financial/Directors’ Reports) instrument 2016/91.

(a) Recognition and measurement
Sales revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is presented net of returns, trade
allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer. This is considered
to have occurred when legal title of the product is transferred to the customer and the Group is no longer responsible for the product.
The point at which title is transferred is dependent upon the specific terms and conditions of the contract of sale. The Group
recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
entity and specific criteria have been met.
Contract revenue is recognised using the percentage of completion method.
Advance payments received from customers are recognised as a liability on the Statement of Financial Position as deferred income,
until goods have been sold or services rendered.

As at 30 June 2016, $42.2M (2015: $24.8M) of Australian deferred tax liabilities generated during the period have been utilised within
tax expense. The Company has deferred the recognition of any further tax asset for the Australian tax Group until a return to taxable
profits has been demonstrated. The Australian consolidated tax Group has $2.75 billion of carried forward tax losses of which
$1,873.4M have been impaired and are not currently carried as a deferred tax asset. These past losses are able to be booked and
used in the future, as Australian tax losses are able to be carried forward indefinitely.
For the year ended 30 June 2016 $64.7M of New Zealand deferred tax assets have been impaired through tax expense, inclusive of a
$33.6M write-off of previously carried forward tax losses. The Company has deferred the recognition of any further New Zealand tax
credits until a sustainable return to taxable profits has been demonstrated. New Zealand tax losses are able to be carried forward
indefinitely.
The Group also has unrecognised tax losses arising in Vietnam of $3.5M (2015: $7.6M) and China of $31.3M (2015: $44.2M) which
are able to be offset against taxable profits within five years of being incurred. Other unrecognised tax losses can be carried forward
indefinitely but can only be utilised in the same tax group in which they are generated.

Overseas subsidiaries have undistributed earnings, which, if paid out as dividends, would be subject to withholding tax. An assessable
temporary difference exists, however no deferred tax liability has been recognised as the parent entity is able to control the timing of
distributions from their subsidiaries and is not expected to distribute these profits in the foreseeable future.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets for the Group totalling $241.8M (2015: $109.7M) in respect of temporary differences have not been
recognised as they are not probable of realisation.
(f) Recognition and measurement
Current taxes
The income tax expense for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax
rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused
tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting
period in the countries where the Company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management
periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to
interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred taxes
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if
they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor
taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by
the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred
income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable
amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for
temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Offsetting deferred tax balances
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority and there is a legally
enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.

4 Income tax (continued)
(g) Key judgements and estimates
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where
the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, these differences will impact the
current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made.
In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that
future forecast taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be
available having regard to the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.
The Australian consolidated tax group and New Zealand Steel have recognised a $84.6M and NZ$ 85.8M deferred tax asset at 30
June 2016 respectively (2015: $84.6M, NZ$ 94.7M). The Australian consolidated tax group has incurred taxable losses in the
current and preceding periods. The utilisation of the deferred tax asset amount depends upon future taxable amounts in excess of
profits arising from the reversal of temporary differences. The Group believes these amounts to be recoverable based on taxable
income projections. The Group has deferred the recognition of any further tax credits for both the Australian and New Zealand tax
groups until a sustainable return to taxable profits has been demonstrated.

(b) Past due but not impaired
None of the non-current receivables are impaired or past due.
(c) Transferred financial assets which remain recognised
BlueScope Distribution has entered into a sale of receivables securitisation program on a recourse basis. The business acts as a
servicer under the program and continues to collect cash from its customers and is able to repurchase a receivable by paying the
outstanding amount of that receivable.
The receivables securitisation program does not qualify for derecognition. The Group has retained the credit risk associated with the
trade receivables, by repurchase, and therefore the risks and rewards of the securitisation asset resides with the Group.The total
carrying amount of the trade receivables is $62.6M (2015: $156.1M) and the associated borrowing is $Nil (2015: $Nil).
(d) Transferred financial assets that are derecognised
Lysaght Australia, New Zealand Steel and North Star BlueScope Steel have entered into a sale of receivables securitisation involving
the sale of eligible trade receivables. The business acts as a servicer under the program and continues to collect cash from its
customers.
The receivables securitisation program qualifies for derecognition of trade receivables in their entirety. The Group has transferred the
significant risks and rewards of the trade receivables. In the event bad or doubtful debts exceeds a specified limit, the Group will have
to recognise the trade receivables on the balance sheet. Current experience and bad debt history is significantly below this level. The
carrying amount of the trade receivables de-recognised in entirety as at 30 June 2016 is $198.5M which is reflected by a decrease in
trade receivables of $42.9M, an increase in sundry payables of $162.2M offset by a $6.6M increase in sundry receivables.
The maximum exposure to loss for the Group from its continuing involvement in the de-recognised financial assets is $6.6M which is
determined by the amount funded by BlueScope Steel at sale date, less customer collections during the month.
(e) Recognition and measurement
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less provision for impairment. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 to 90 days.
Impairment of trade receivables
Debts which are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified. A provision for impairment is recognised when there is
objective evidence that amounts due may not be received. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade
receivable is impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term
receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial.

Write-downs of inventories to net realisable value recognised as an expense at 30 June 2016 amounted to $31.3M (2015: $45.8M) for
the Group. The expense has been included in ‘raw materials and consumables used’ in the profit and loss.
(b) Recognition and measurement
Raw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter being
allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Cost includes the transfer from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow
hedges relating to purchases of raw materials. Costs are assigned to inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Costs of
purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to sell.
Emission unit permits that are acquired as part of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are recognised at cost.
Emission unit permits that are held for trading in the ordinary course of business are classified as inventory and subsequently held at
fair value. During the year, the held for sale permits were reclassified to held for acquittal and are now disclosed as an intangible asset
at cost.

10 Provisions (continued)
(b) Recognition and measurement
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not
recognised for future operating losses. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
(c) Key judgements and estimates
Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the
passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
(d) Employee benefits
(i) Annual leave and long service leave
The liability for annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled after 12 months is measured as the present value of
expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period.
Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.
Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds other than New Zealand where
Government bonds are used, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash
outflows.
Employee benefit on-costs are recognised and included in employee benefit liabilities and costs when the employee benefits to which
they relate are recognised as liabilities.
Amounts not expected to be settled within 12 months for current leave provisions
The current provision for long service leave includes all unconditional entitlements where employees have completed the required
period of service. The entire annual leave amount and vested portion of long service leave are presented as current. Since the Group
does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement, based on past experience, the Group does not expect all employees to take
the full amount of accrued annual leave and long service leave or require payment within the next 12 months. Current annual leave
and long service leave obligation expected to be settled after 12 months is $94.1M (2015: $119.6M).
(ii) Termination benefits
Liabilities for termination benefits, not in connection with a business combination or the closure of an operation, are recognised when
the Group is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a formal plan without
possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits
falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.
The employee redundancy provision balance reflects a range of internal reorganisations. All redundancies are expected to take effect
within 12 months of the reporting date.
(iii) Short Term Incentive plans (STI)
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for STI plan payments made to employees. The Group recognises a provision where
past practice and current performance indicates that a probable constructive obligation exists.
(e) Restructuring costs
Liabilities arising directly from undertaking a restructuring program, defined as the closure of an operating site, are recognised when a
detailed plan of the restructuring activity has been developed and implementation of the restructuring program as planned has
commenced, by either entering into contracts to undertake the restructuring activities or making a detailed announcement such that
affected parties are in no doubt the restructuring program will proceed.
The restructuring provisions relate to Australian Steel Products and BlueScope Buildings segments to cover estimated future costs of
announced site closures. The provisions are to be utilised over various terms up to a maximum period of 17 years.

10 Provisions (continued)
(f) Product claims
Provision for claims is based on modelled data combining sales volumes with past experiences of repair and replacement levels in
conjunction with any specifically identified product faults.
(g) Workers compensation
In Australia and North America, the Company is a registered self-insurer for workers compensation. Provisions are recognised based
on calculations performed by an external actuary in relation to the expectation of future events. A contingent liability exists in relation
to guarantees given to various state workers compensation authorities, due to self-insurance prerequisites (refer to note 25(a)(ii)).
For the Group, an actuarially determined asset of $27.4M (2015: $27.8M) has been recognised for expected future reimbursements
associated with workers compensation recoveries from third parties. This amount is included in non-current other receivables as there
is no legal right of offset against the workers compensation provision.
(h) Restoration and rehabilitation
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions include $19.5M (2015: $13.3M) for New Zealand & Pacific Steel segment in relation to its
operation of two iron sand mines. These provisions have been classified as non-current as the timing of payments to remedy these
sites will not be made until cessation of their operations, which is not expected for many years. The balance of the provision relates to
leased sites that require rectification and restoration work at the end of their respective lease periods.
Recognising restoration, remediation and rehabilitation provisions requires assumptions to be made as to the application of
environmental legislation, site closure dates, available technologies and engineering cost estimates. These uncertainties may result in
future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.
(i) Carbon emissions
The Group is a participant in the New Zealand Government’s uncapped Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).
The emissions liability is recognised as a provision for carbon and is measured at the carrying amount of Emission Units (EUs) held
with excess units, if any, held for trading measured at the current market value of EUs. ETS costs passed through from suppliers are
included as part of the underlying cost of the good or service rendered. The liability is either included within trade creditors or recorded
as an emissions liability within the carbon provision account when an agreement has been reached with the supplier to settle the ETS
cost by transferring EUs.
When EUs are delivered to the government or a third party, the EU asset along with the corresponding carbon provision is
derecognised from the statement of financial position.
11 Retirement benefit obligations
(a) Defined contribution plan
The Group makes superannuation contributions to defined contribution funds in respect of the entity’s employees located in Australia
and other countries. As at 30 June 2016, the defined contribution expense recognised in the profit and loss amounted to $90.1M
(2015: $91.6M).
The defined contribution plans receive fixed contributions from Group companies with the Group's legal obligation limited to these
contributions. Contributions to the defined contribution fund are recognised as an expense as they become payable.

(i) The defined benefit division of the BlueScope Steel Superannuation Fund closed as at 31 December 2014. A $27.2M curtailment
gain arising from the fund closure was recognised in the profit and loss.
The North American pension plan was amended to allow one-off lump sum payouts to terminated employees with vested benefits. A
$4.9M one-off curtailment gain arising from the difference between the accounting liability (Defined Benefit Obligation) and the lump
sum payout value was recognised in the profit and loss (June 2015: $11.2M).
(ii) Coated and Building Products North America has frozen future salary increases for the purpose of contributions to the
superannuation fund as at 30 June 2013.
The net liability is not immediately payable. Any plan surplus will be realised through reduced future Group contributions.

(j) Employer contributions
Employer contributions to the defined benefit section of the Group's plans are based on recommendations by the plan’s actuaries. The
objective of funding is to ensure that the benefit entitlements of members and other beneficiaries are fully funded by the time they
become payable.
Total employer contributions expected to be paid for the year ending 30 June 2017 are $19.1M.
(k) Recognition and measurement
A liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation
less the fair value of the superannuation fund’s assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future
payments which arise from membership of the fund to the end of the reporting period, calculated half yearly by independent actuaries
using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee
departures and periods of service.
Expected future payments are discounted using market yields on government or corporate bonds where a deep market exists, with
terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in
which they occur, in other comprehensive income.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss, unless the changes to the superannuation plan are conditional on the employees
remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Future taxes that are funded by the entity and are part of the provision of the existing benefit obligation (e.g. taxes on investment
income and employer contributions) are taken into account in measuring the net liability or asset.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gains or losses
on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.
(5.3)
11.3
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. The carrying amount of a replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during
the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold
improvements and finance leases, the shorter lease term, unless there is reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at
the end of the lease term.
The useful lives of major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
Category
Land
Buildings
Iron and steel making plant and machinery
Coating lines
Building components plant and equipment
Other plant and equipment
Useful Life
Not depreciated
30-40 years
20-40 years
20-30 years
12-18 years
5-15 years
Derecognition
Property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is sold or otherwise disposed of, or when its use is expected to bring no future
economic benefits.
(d) Key estimates
The estimation of the useful lives of plant and machinery has been based on historical experience and judgement with respect to
technical obsolescence, physical deterioration and usage capacity of the asset in addition to any legal restrictions on usage. The
condition of the asset is assessed at least once per year and considered against the remaining useful life.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

13 Intangible assets (continued)
(a) Recognition and measurement
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to purchase a business less the fair market value of the tangible assets, identifiable
intangible assets and the liabilities obtained in the purchase. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets
(ii)
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business
combination is their fair market value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Intangible assets with
finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life. The amortisation period and method is reviewed at each financial
year end.
A summary of the useful lives of intangible assets is as follows:
Category
Patents, trademarks and other rights
Computer software
Customer relationships
Useful Life
Indefinite and finite (7-15 years)
Finite (3-10 years)
Finite (10-20 years)
(iii) Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. For the year ended 30 June 2016, $22.1M (2015: $20.1M) was
recognised for research and development expenditure in the profit and loss. Costs incurred on development projects are recognised
as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed
and generate future economic benefits and its costs can be measured reliably.
14 Carrying value of non-financial assets
The Group tests property, plant and equipment (note 12) and intangible assets with definite useful lives (note 13) when there is an
indicator of impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for any impairment.
(a) Allocation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to cash generating units
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment testing purposes as follows:
Cash generating units
Australian Steel Products
Building Products North America
Buildings North America
North Star BlueScope Steel LLC
Buildings China
Total goodwill
Reportable segments
Australian Steel Products
Building Products ASEAN, North America & India
BlueScope Buildings

business combination in which the goodwill arose. In addition to goodwill, the Group has other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives of $3.9M (2015: $3.8M) allocated to the Buildings North America CGU which relate to trade names recognised as part of the
IMSA Group business combination acquired in February 2008.
All of the above CGUs were tested for impairment at the reporting date.

(b) Key assumptions and estimates
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined on the basis of value-in-use (VIU), unless there is evidence to support a higher
fair value less cost to sell. The following table describes assumptions on which the Group has based its projections when
determining the recoverable amount of each CGU.

Key assumptions
Future cash flows
Growth rate
Discount rate
Basis of estimation
- VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flows, inclusive of working capital movements which are based on financial
projections approved by the Group covering a three-year period, being the basis of the Group’s forecasting and
planning processes, or up to five years where circumstances pertaining to a specific CGU support a longer period.
- Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated to provide a maximum of 30 years of cash flows with
adjustments where necessary to reflect changes in long-term operating conditions. No terminal value is calculated.
- The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows for each CGU beyond the forecast period does not exceed 2.5%
(2015:2.5%).
- The growth rate represents a steady indexation rate which does not exceed the Group's expectations of the
long-term average growth rate for the business in which each CGU operates.
- The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections has been assessed to reflect the time value of money and the
perceived risk profile of the industry in which each CGU operates.
- The base post-tax discount rates range from 8.5% to 9.7% (2015: 7.7% to 9.0%).
- Given the differing characteristics, currencies and geographical locations of the Group's CGUs, where appropriate
the base discount rate is adjusted by a country risk premium (CRP) to reflect country specific risks. Such
adjustments do not reflect risks for which cash flow forecasts have already been adjusted. The CRP is derived from
a range of externally sourced foreign country risk ratings.
- The adjusted post-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each CGU based on the specific tax rate
applicable to where the CGU operates.
Raw material costs - Based on commodity price forecasts derived from a range of external commodity forecasters.
- All foreign currency cash flows are discounted using a discount rate appropriate for that currency.
- Based on management forecasts, taking into account commodity steel price forecasts derived from a range of
external commodity forecasters.
- Based on management forecasts, taking into account external forecasts of underlying economic activity for the
market sectors and geographies in which each CGU operates.
- Based on forecasts derived from a range of external banks.

(c) Cash generating units with significant goodwill
Buildings North America
Buildings North America is tested for impairment on a VIU basis using three year cash flow projections, followed by a long-term growth
rate of 2.5% for a further 27 years. Pre-tax VIU cash flows are discounted utilising a 13.0% pre-tax discount rate (2015: 11.9%).
At 30 June 2016 the recoverable amount of this CGU is 1.6 times the carrying amount of $465.7M, including non-current assets and
net working capital. This CGU is most sensitive to assumptions in relation to North American non-residential building and construction
activity. Taking into account external forecasts, the Group expects non-residential building and construction activity to increase 5.8%
per annum from the current financial year over the three-year projection period.
However, the timing and extent of this increase is uncertain and in the absence of mitigating factors, a 0.8% per annum growth in
non-residential building and construction activity over the three-year projection period, or a five year delay to achieve the projected
increase, could reduce the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.
North Star BlueScope Steel LLC
The Company acquired a controlling interest in North Star BlueScope Steel LLC on 30 October 2015. This is tested for impairment on
a VIU basis using three year cash flow projections, followed by a long-term growth rate of 2.5% for a further 27 years. Pre-tax VIU
cash flows are discounted utilising pre-tax discount rate of 13.7%.
At 30 June 2016 the recoverable amount of the CGU is 1.2 times the carrying amount of $1,862.4M, including non-current assets and
net working capital. This CGU is most sensitive to assumptions in relation to the spread between North American hot rolled coil and
purchased scrap prices. Taking into account external forecasts, the Group expects spread to increase at 5.4% per annum from current
financial year levels over the three year projection period.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

14 Carrying value of non-financial assets (continued)
However, the timing and extent of this increase is uncertain and in the absence of mitigating factors, a 3.5% per annum growth in
spread over the three-year projection period, or a four year delay to achieve the projected spread increase, could reduce the
recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount.
(d) Sensitivity of carrying amounts
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment of the Group is most sensitive to cash forecasts for the Group's largest CGU,
Australian Steel Products (ASP) which are determined taking into the key assumptions set out above.
Recognised external forecasters estimate the US dollar relative to the Australian dollar to remain around current levels and an
increase in global commodity steel prices in excess of any increase in iron ore and coal raw material costs. The Group believes that
the long term assumptions adopted are appropriate. However, to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ
such that the expected cash flow forecasts for ASP were to decrease by 10% across the forecast period, without implementation of
mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.

The current year impairments were primarily recognised in the December 2015 interim financial results based on assumptions which
resulted in $2,202.0M and $365.1M recoverable amounts for the Australian Steel Products and New Zealand and Pacific Steel
segments respectively. This followed a review at that time of steel price assumptions and discount rates in light of ongoing
macroeconomic and global steel market challenges. A subsequent review at June 2016 resulted in a further $19.7M of property, plant
and equipment being impaired in relation to Taharoa iron sand mining assets within the New Zealand and Pacific Steel segment which
were capitalised in the second half of FY2016.

transport of iron sands.
(f) Recognition and measurement
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are consequently
recognised in profit or loss over the term.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the end of the reporting period.

(i) Share rights - Tax deduction
The tax deduction recorded in share capital represents the estimated tax deduction in excess of accounting expense recognised for
share right awards issued to employees in North America.
(c) Capital risk management
Management monitors its capital structure through various key financial ratios with emphasis on the gearing ratio (net debt/total
capital). The Group's gearing ratio is managed through the economic price cycle to ensure access to finance at reasonable cost
regardless of the point in the cycle. On occasions, the Group will take advantage of certain investment opportunities where an
increased level of gearing will be tolerated, provided there is sufficient future cash flow strength and flexibility to be confident of credit
strengthening rather than uncertainty and risk of credit weakening.
In managing equity, all methods of returning funds to shareholders outside of dividend payments or raising funds are considered
within the context of its balance sheet objectives. In managing debt, the Group seeks a diversified range of funding sources and
maturity profiles. Sufficient flexibility is maintained within committed facilities in order to provide the business with the desired liquidity
support for operations and to pursue its strategic objectives.

(b) Nature and purpose of reserves
(i) Hedging reserve
Records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge
relationship.
(ii) Share-based payments reserve
Recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including Key Management Personnel, as part of
their remuneration.
(iii) Foreign currency translation reserve
Record exchange fluctuations arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries. It is also used to record
the effect of the translation of the net investments in foreign operations. The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit and loss when
the net investment is disposed of.
(iv) Non-distributable profit reserve
In certain overseas operations local regulations require a set amount of retained profit to be set aside and not be distributed as a
dividend.
(v) Asset realisation reserve
Arises from the disposal of 50% interest in BlueScope's ASEAN and North American building product businesses.
(vi) Controlled entity acquisition reserve
Arises from the Group's acquisition of the remaining 40% non-controlling interest in BlueScope Steel (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and 5% of
Lysaght Thailand Ltd and BlueScope Steel Thailand Ltd, adjusted for the subsequent 50% disposal of their additional interests into
BlueScope and Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corporation joint venture. This item represents the difference between the amount
paid and the balance of the non-controlling interest acquired.

20 Business combinations (continued)
(d) Recognition and measurement
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition
of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement and the fair value of pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions,
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition-date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net
identifiable assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the
subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all amounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a
discount on acquisition.
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present
value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar
borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently
remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss.

All subsidiaries incorporated in Australia are members of the BlueScope Steel Limited tax consolidated group. Refer to note 30(d)(ii).
(a) These subsidiaries have been granted relief from the necessity to prepare financial reports in accordance with Class Order
98/1418 (as amended) issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. For further information refer to
note 31.
(b) These entities are part of the joint venture established between BlueScope and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation
and have been classified as controlled entities because of the Group's unilateral right to appoint the CEO (and other Key
Management Personnel), approval of the operating budget and retaining significant decision making authority.
(c) These controlled entities are audited by firms other than Ernst & Young and affiliates.
(d) The Group's ownership of the ordinary share capital in this entity represents a beneficial interest of 39% represented by its
65% ownership in BlueScope Acier Nouvelle Caledonie SA, which in turn has 60% ownership of the entity.
(e) On 30 October 2015, BlueScope acquired the remaining 50% share of North Star BlueScope Steel LLC, resulting in the
consolidation of the previous 50% held equity accounted investment. As part of this transaction two holding entities, including
BlueScope Steel Investments 2 LLC and BlueScope Steel Investments 3 LLC, were incorporated.
(f) New entities incorporated during the year.
(g) This entity is in the process of being liquidated and deregistered.
(b) Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the
Group.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

BlueScope Steel Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
22 Investment in associates (continued)
(i) On 1 July 2015, New Zealand Steel sold its 28% equity accounted investment in McDonald’s Lime for $38.1M resulting in a $32.9M
pre-tax profit.
(b) Contingent assets and liabilities relating to associates
There were no contingent assets and liabilities relating to investments in associates.
(c) Recognition and measurement
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a
shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial
statements using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.
The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition
movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted
against the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates in the consolidated financial statements reduce
the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of
the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the
associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

(c) Contingent liabilities relating to joint ventures
Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCG)
TBSL has imported goods under the Government of India's EPCG scheme at the concessional rates of duty with an obligation to fulfill
the specified exports. Failure to meet this export obligation within the stipulated time would result in payment of the aggregate
differential duty saved along with interest. TBSL is confident of meeting the obligation. BlueScope’s 50% share of this contingent
liability is $5.1M (2015: $5.2M).
Disputed rent
The Jharkhand Government has been in a land rental dispute with Tata Steel for several years and this matter impacts the rental
costs of Tata BlueScope Steel Limited (TBSL) as a sub-tenant of Tata Steel. BlueScope's 50% share of this contingent liability is
$4.5M.
Taxation
TBSL has direct and indirect tax computations which have been submitted but not agreed by the relevant authorities. TBSL has
provided for the amount of tax it expects to pay taking into account professional advice it has received. The matters currently in
dispute could result in amendments to the original computations. BlueScope’s 50% share of the potential amendments is $3.7M.
(d) Secured liabilities and assets pledged as security
The Tata BlueScope Steel borrowings are secured against property, plant and equipment.
(e)
Impairment losses
Impairment losses of $2.3M (2015: $2.5M) were recognised in relation to the Group's 47.5% investment in Castrip LLC.
(f) Recognition and measurement
Joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the joint
arrangements. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement
("joint operators") have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint
arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement ("joint venturers") have rights to the net assets of the
arrangement.
The interests in joint ventures are accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method. Under the equity method, the
share of the profits or losses of the partnerships are recognised in profit or loss, and the share of post-acquisition movements in
reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Profits or losses on transactions establishing a joint venture and transactions with a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the
Group's ownership interest until such time as they are realised by the joint venture partnership on consumption or sale. However, a
loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current
assets, or an impairment loss.

The results from discontinued operations are required to be presented on a consolidated basis. Therefore, the impact of intercompany
sales, profit in stock eliminations, intercompany interest income and expense and intercompany funding have been excluded. The
profit attributable to the discontinued segment is not affected by these adjustments. As a result of these adjustments the discontinued
operations result do not represent the operations as stand-alone entities.
Unrecognised Items
This section of the notes provides information about items that are not recognised in the financial statements as they do not yet satisfy
the recognition criteria but could potentially have an impact on the Group's financial position and performance.
25 Contingencies
(a) Contingent liabilities
The Group had contingent liabilities at 30 June 2016 in respect of:
(i) Outstanding legal matters
BlueScope has initiated legal proceeding against South32 alleging certain coal supply contract non-compliances estimated at
approximately $78 million. South32 subsequently initiated legal proceedings against BlueScope alleging certain other coal supply
contract non-compliances with a similar value.
In addition, there were a range of immaterial outstanding legal matters that were contingent on court decisions, arbitration rulings and
private negotiations to determine amounts required for settlement. The contingent liability for minor legal matters is estimated to be
$3.8M (2015: $3.5M).
(ii) Guarantees
In Australia, BlueScope Steel Limited has provided $87.6M (2015: $88.7M) in guarantees to various state workers compensation
authorities as a prerequisite for self-insurance. An amount, net of recoveries, of $55.6M (2015: $59.0M) has been recognised as
recommended by independent actuarial advice.
Bank guarantees have been provided to customers and suppliers in respect of the performance of goods and services provided and
purchases of goods and services which are immediately callable by default. Bank guarantees outstanding at 30 June 2016 totalled
$88.4M (2015: $81.8M).

25 Contingencies (continued)
(iii) Taxation
The Group operates in many countries across the world, each with separate taxation authorities, which results in significant
complexity. At any point in time there are tax computations which have been submitted but not agreed by those tax authorities and
matters which are under discussion between Group companies and the tax authorities. The Group provides for the amount of tax it
expects to pay taking into account those discussions and professional advice it has received. While conclusion of such matters may
result in amendments to the original computations, the Group does not believe that such adjustments will have a material adverse
effect on its financial position, although such adjustments may be significant to any individual year's income statement.
(b) Contingent assets
There are no material contingent assets required for disclosure as at 30 June 2016.

(c) Recognition and measurement - Lease liabilities
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date,
whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to
control the use of the asset, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease's inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower,
the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other
short-term and long-term payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is
charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
27 Events occurring after balance date
On 8 July 2016, the Group sold its 47.5% interest in Castrip for US$20M. The investment in Castrip is held at $Nil value.

28 Share-based payments
(a) Share award schemes
(i) STI share awards - Key Management Personnel
The Board approved the annual STI plans for FY16 and FY17 for the CEO and Key Management Personnel, being a two year equity
STI program. No amount will be paid in cash. Performance will be assessed at the end of FY17 against a range of financial and other
measures aligned with the returns delivered to shareholders from the implementation of initiatives under the Group's strategic plan.
(ii) The Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is a program determined annually by the Board, which awards share rights to eligible senior
management of BlueScope Steel Limited. LTIPs are designed to reward senior management for long-term value creation, and are part
of the Group's overall recognition and retention strategy. The share rights give the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date
subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria and continued employment with the Group.
The share rights available for exercise are contingent on the Group's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) percentile ranking relative to the
TSR of companies in the S&P/ASX 100 index at the reward grant date or a compound annual growth rate of Earnings per Share
(EPS) condition. Share rights that fail to meet performance vesting conditions will lapse upon the LTIP's expiry date, or sooner upon
employee resignation or termination. Plans have been granted to senior management, all at $Nil exercise price.
(iii) Retention share awards
The Board has awarded retention shares to limited Key Management Personnel and senior management throughout the Group,
where their retention is particularly critical to the successful delivery of business strategy. Retention rights have a retention hurdle of
three years from the time of award. These will lapse in circumstances of resignation or termination for cause. The Board retains
discretion in other circumstances.
(iv) Deferred Equity Award
The Board awarded deferred equity awards to senior management throughout the Group, with no performance hurdles required to be
met. The equity award gives the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to continued employment with the Group.

The carrying amount of the liability relating to share-based payment plans at 30 June 2016 is $2.7M (30 June 2015: $2.9M). This
liability represents the deferred cash amounts payable under LTIPs and Retention schemes.
(e) Recognition and measurement
Equity settled transactions
The fair value of equity settled awards are recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase to the share
based payments reserve within equity. The amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards or
share rights granted, which includes any market performance conditions but excludes the impact of non-market performance vesting
conditions.
The fair value of equity settled awards at grant date is independently determined by an external valuer using Black-Scholes option
pricing model that includes a Monte Carlo simulation analysis, which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the share right,
the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield
and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the share right.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards or share rights that are expected to
vest. The expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are
expected to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share awards and share rights that
are expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in
profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
-52-
BlueScope Steel Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
28 Share-based payments (continued)
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects the extent to which
the expected vesting period has expired and the number of rights that are expected to ultimately vest. This number is based on the
best available information at the reporting date. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest due to a performance
condition not being met, except for share rights where vesting is only conditional upon a market condition. No adjustment is made for
the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair
value at grant date.
Upon the exercise of equity settled share awards, the balance of the share-based payments reserve relating to those rights and
awards is transferred to share capital. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding rights is reflected as additional share dilution in the
computation of diluted earnings per share.
Cash settled transactions
The ultimate expense recognised in relation to cash-settled transactions will be equal to the actual cash paid to the employees, which
will be the fair value at settlement date. The expected cash payment is estimated at each reporting date and a liability is recognised to
the extent that the vesting period has expired and in proportion to the amount of the awards that are expected to ultimately vest.

(b) Guarantees entered into by the parent entity
In Australia, the parent entity has given $87.6M (2015: $88.7M) in guarantees to various state workers compensation authorities as a
prerequisite for self-insurance and has entered into a deed of cross-guarantee with certain Australian wholly-owned subsidiaries (note
31). Additionally, the parent entity has provided financial guarantees in respect to subsidiaries amounting to:

(c) Capital commitments
As at 30 June 2016, the parent entity had capital commitments of $5.2M (June 2015: $4.6M). These commitments are not recognised
as liabilities as the relevant assets have not yet been received.
(d) Recognition and measurement
The financial information for the parent entity BlueScope Steel Limited has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated
financial statements, except as set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries
(i)
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairment losses in the financial statements of BlueScope
Steel Limited.
(ii) Tax consolidation legislation
BlueScope Steel Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have entered into a tax sharing and funding agreement in
relation to their participation in the tax consolidation regime. Under the terms of this agreement, the wholly-owned entities reimburse
BlueScope Steel Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by BlueScope Steel Limited for any current tax
receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are transferred to BlueScope Steel Limited
under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the
wholly-owned entities' financial statements.
The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from BlueScope Steel
Limited, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. BlueScope Steel Limited may require payment of
interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.
The tax sharing agreement limits the joint and several liability of the wholly-owned entities in the case of a default by BlueScope Steel
Limited. At balance date, the possibility of default is considered remote.
The tax consolidated group has applied the group allocation approach in determining the appropriate amount of current taxes to
allocate to members of the tax consolidated group. Intercompany receivables of $90.2M (2015: $79.0M) and intercompany payables
of $86.9M (2015: $100.4M) of BlueScope Steel Limited have been recognised as a tax consolidated adjustment.

By entering into the deed, with the exception of Glenbrook Holdings Pty Ltd, the wholly owned subsidiaries have been relieved from
the requirement to prepare a financial report and Directors’ report under Class Order 98/1418 (as amended) issued by the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission. Glenbrook Holdings Pty Ltd continues to form part of the deed of cross-guarantee and
closed group, however is denied Class Order 98/1418 relief due to direct ownership being held from outside of the closed group.
(a) Consolidated income statement and a summary of movements in consolidated retained losses
The above companies represent a 'closed group' for the purposes of the Class Order, and as there are no other parties to the deed of
cross-guarantee that are controlled by BlueScope Steel Limited, they also represent the 'extended closed group'.

(b) Risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks, and approves policies for financial
risk management with the objective of supporting the delivery of financial targets while protecting future financial security.
The Group's Audit & Risk Committee regularly reviews the financial risk management framework to ensure it is appropriate when
considering any changes in market conditions. It reviews financial risk management controls and procedures and oversees how
management monitors compliance with these, and monitors the levels of exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates,
and foreign exchange rates.

The Group's net exposure to liquidity risk is not
significant based on available funding facilities
and cash flow forecasts. Refer to note 16(b) for a
summary of the Group's material financing
facilities. When undertaking financing facilities, the
Group takes into account a liquidity buffer which is
reviewed at least annually.
-Establish credit approvals and limits, including
the assessment of counterparty creditworthiness.
-Undertake monitoring procedures such as
periodic assessments of the financial viability of its
counterparties and reviewing terms of trade.
-Obtain letters of credit from financial institutions
to guarantee the underlying payment from trade
customers.
-Undertake debtor insurance to cover selective
receivables for both commercial and sovereign
risks.
Foreign currency payables and

International steel prices
(primarily hot rolled coil and slab),
and commodity prices including
iron ore, coal, scrap, zinc,
aluminium and electricity.
Difficulty in meeting obligations
associated with financial
liabilities.
-Possibility that counterparties to
the Group's financial assets,
including cash, receivables and
derivative financial instruments,
will fail to settle their obligations
under their contracts.
- Large number of customers
internationally dispersed with
trades in several major
geographical regions.
-Regions in which the Group has
a significant credit exposure are
Australia, USA, China,
South-East Asia and New
Zealand.
-Significant transactions with
major customers, being Arrium
Limited and Fletcher Building's
Group within the Australian
operations.

The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges relating to
foreign currency sales and purchases and hedging of net working capital exposures. For the cash flow hedges, the effective portion of
gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. The fair value hedges are being marked to market through the profit and loss in line
with the Group's risk management strategy.

(ii) Forward commodity contracts
The Group has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of electricity, iron ore and bunker fuel for its New Zealand Steel
business and iron ore purchases at Port Kembla as a means of hedging its exposure to electricity, bunker fuel and iron ore price
fluctuations. Both of these forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of gains and losses
recognised directly in equity.
(e) Fair values

Non-traded financial liabilities

Net assets (liabilities)
The above financial liability is not readily traded on organised markets in standardised form. The fair value of interest bearing financial
liabilities where no market exists is based upon discounting the expected future cash flows by the current market interest rates on
liabilities with similar risk profiles that are available to the Group.
Valuation of financial instruments
(i)
(ii)
Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
(iii) Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and
commodity forward contracts. These valuations reference forward pricing using present value calculations. The forward price
incorporates various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and forward rate
curves of the underlying commodity. The fair value of forward commodity exchange contracts ($0.1M) and forward foreign exchange
contracts ($2.8M) are considered level 2 valuations.
(f) Recognition and measurement of derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to
their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if
so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
•
•
Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges);
Hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast
transactions (cash flow hedges); or
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).
•
The relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking
hedge transactions, are documented at the inception of the hedge transaction. The effectiveness of the derivatives in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items is assessed and documented on an ongoing basis.
(i) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss, together
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.

BlueScope Steel Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
32 Financial instruments and risk (continued)
(ii) Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the hedging reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, whilst ineffective portions are recognised immediately in profit or loss within other
income or other expenses.
Amounts accumulated in the hedging reserve are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or
loss. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory
or fixed assets) the gains and losses previously deferred in the hedging reserve are reclassified from equity and included in the initial
measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as cost of goods sold in the
case of inventory, or as depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
(iii) Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign
currency translation reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss
within other income or other expenses. Gains and losses accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to
profit or loss when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
(iv) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in other income or other expenses.
(v) Discontinuation of hedge accounting
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any
cumulative gain or loss existing in the hedging reserve at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction
is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that
was reported in the hedging reserve is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

34 Other accounting policies
(a) New and amended Standards and Interpretations adopted by the Group
(i) AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 101
(effective 1 July 2016)
The standard makes amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements arising from the IASB's Disclosure Initiative
project. The amendments are designed to further encourage companies to apply professional judgement in determining what
information to disclose in the financial statements.
The Group has early adopted this standard and streamlined the financial report as per the recommendations of the IASB's Disclosure
Initiative project.
(b) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet adopted by the Group
Certain new Accounting Standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 30 June 2016 reporting
period. The Group's assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.
(i) AASB 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 July 2018)
This standard addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets in addition to new hedge accounting
requirements, including changes to hedge effectiveness testing, treatment of hedging costs, risk components that can be hedged and
disclosures.
An assessment of the impact of the amendments to the standard have been carried out and it is not expected to result in a material
change to the financial statements and disclosures of the Group.
(ii) AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 July 2018)
AASB 15 replaces AASB 118 Revenue which covers contracts for goods and services, and AASB 111 Construction Contracts, which
covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of good or service
transfers to a customer, so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risk and rewards. This standard will change the timing
and in some cases the quantum of revenue recognised.
Management has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new standard and expects that it will not have a material

(iii) AASB 16 Leases (effective 1 July 2019)
IFRS16, the new lease accounting standard was released in January 2016. The standard eliminates the classification of leases as
either operating leases or finance leases as required by the current lease accounting standard and, instead, introduces a single lessee
accounting model. A lessee is required to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the
underlying asset is of low value, and depreciate lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement.
Management has carried out a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new standard and expects that it will have a material
impact on the Group's financial statements and disclosures. This will involve an increase in assets and liabilities, change in the timing
in which lease expenses are recognised, a switch in earnings categories from operating expense to depreciation and interest expense
and an increase in gearing levels. Further assessment of the impact will be carried as part of the adoption of the new standard.
(iv) AASB 2016-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107
(effective 1 July 2017)
This standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows to require entities preparing financial statements in accordance with Tier 1
reporting requirements to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from
financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.
The Group will apply this amendment from 1 July 2017.
(v)
IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share based payment transactions (effective 1 July 2018)
This standard makes amendments to IFRS 2 Share based Payments, clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment
transactions.
An assessment of the amendments to the standard has been carried out and it is not expected to result in any change to the financial
statements and disclosures of the Group.
(c) Foreign currency translation
(i) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except
when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the
net investment in a foreign operation.
(ii) Foreign operations
The results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•
•
Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that
statement of financial position;
Income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and
expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
•
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a
foreign operation is sold, a proportionate share of such exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss
on sale where applicable.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entities and translated at the closing rate.

(d) Other taxes
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable
from the taxation authority. In this case, it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from,
or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which is
recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are presented as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.

Independent auditor's report to the members of BlueScope Steel Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of BlueScope Steel Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true

such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The directors also state, in
accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial
statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and
fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
