<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The independent expert on minority issues, Gay McDougall visited Ethiopia from 
28 November to 12 December 2006, in pursuance of her mandate.  During her visit, she held 
numerous consultations in Addis Ababa, and undertook a visit to the Gambella region.  She met 
with senior government officials at both the federal and state level, with civil society, academics 
and members of political opposition groups, with students, and with members of minority 
communities themselves.  She held discussion forums, including with women from ethnic groups 
affected by conflict in the Gambella region. 
</p>
<p> The Constitution of Ethiopia provides a comprehensive foundation for rights, freedoms, 
and equality.  It offers a significant departure from the political visions of previous 
Governments, in which a single ethnic group dominated all others.  The current constitutional 
scheme brings to the fore the civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights of 
the diverse &#8220;nations, nationalities and peoples&#8221; of Ethiopia.  The rights of all ethnic communities 
to political representation in federal structures are established via the House of Federation, in 
which each ethnic group is guaranteed a seat.  However, in some fundamental respects the true 
promise of the Constitution - equal and effective participation of members of minority ethnic 
groups within a system of democratic decision-making - remains unfulfilled. 
</p>
<p> Self-determination is provided for in the creation of nine ethnically-based regional states 
of the federation, with the right to draft regional constitutions, to promulgate laws, to establish 
and administer government functions and to secede.  The system has enabled the use of minority 
languages, as official languages of the regional states, to be used in public education and by 
regional governmental institutions.  Ethnically-based federalism has served, however, to 
politicize ethnicity as the most salient individual and group marker, leading to new arenas, 
dynamics and dimensions of ethnic division, discrimination and exclusion.  Crucial checks and 
balances are required to ensure the democratic functioning of the federal system and to guarantee 
the rights of highly disadvantaged communities experiencing political, social and economic 
inequality. 
</p>
<p> Continuing ethnic conflicts, often caused by land, water and resource issues, or due to 
political factors, are damaging prospects of regional stability, and a unified, democratic and 
prosperous Ethiopia.  Concerted conflict prevention and resolution efforts are required, but to 
date have been inadequate.  Minority communities that are discriminated against, excluded and 
marginalized are frequently victims of conflict, may be forcibly displaced from their traditional 
territories and lack opportunities and capacity to promote and protect their rights.  Some 
communities, including pastoralist groups, face severe survival issues, extreme poverty and food 
and water insecurity on a daily basis.  Some of the smallest communities in Ethiopia may 
disappear as distinct groups, due to environmental, social and political pressures and processes of 
assimilation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3

</p>
<p> The independent expert is concerned by widespread perceptions, enhanced since the 
May 2005 elections and subsequent actions of the federal authorities, that a democratic deficit 
exists in Ethiopia that may lead to growing tensions and potential instability.  Efforts are 
required on the part of the Government and at the state level to build confidence in democratic 
processes, ensure good governance, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.  In this respect, 
credible guarantees that political parties can function freely, re-establishment of independent 
media freedoms and the release or fair trial of opposition members, academics, journalists and 
students currently detained, are essential measures that must be taken immediately. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on minority issues visited Ethiopia from 28 November 
to 12 December 2006, in pursuance of her mandate.  During her visit, she conducted extensive 
consultations with senior government representatives, civil society organizations, academic 
institutions and representatives of political parties.  She consulted with the Ministers of Justice, 
Women&#8217;s Affairs, Education and Federal Affairs and other senior government officials, in order 
to assess the government perspective on minority issues in Ethiopia.  She also obtained the views 
of members of minority communities themselves, elders and women from different ethnic 
communities, through consultations and open discussion forums.<b>1</b>  She undertook a visit to the 
Gambella region of southwest Ethiopia and consulted directly with community members, local 
regional government representatives and others in order to gain their views and opinions. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert takes this opportunity to thank the Government of Ethiopia for 
extending an invitation to her, and for their assistance and cooperation during the conduct of her 
mission.  She also greatly appreciates the assistance of numerous civil society organizations and 
institutions within Ethiopia and internationally, and the cooperation of United Nations agencies 
in Ethiopia, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF). 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of the situation of minorities in Ethiopia is based on 
the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities and other relevant international standards.  She identifies four broad areas 
of concern relating to minorities globally.  These are:  (a) protecting the existence of a minority, 
including through protection of the physical integrity of its people and the prevention of 
genocide; (b) protecting and promoting cultural and social identity, and the right of national, 
ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to affirm and protect their collective identity and to reject 
forced assimilation; (c) ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality, including ending 
structural or systemic discrimination; and (d) ensuring effective participation of members of 
minorities in public life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert notes that in using the term minorities, the focus of her work is 
on distinct groups within societies that have faced long-term discrimination and disadvantage on 
the basis of identity as belonging to a national, ethnic, religious or linguistic group.  Under her 
mandate, minority status is not defined by numerical factors alone.  She acknowledges that 
distinct groups that are numerically a minority in society may at the same time have dominance 
over the economy, political structures, or other sectors.  The present report focuses on ethnic and 
religious groups of varying sizes in a society of numerous distinct ethnicities.<b>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  RECOGNITION OF MINORITIES IN ETHIOPIA 
</b></p>
<p>5. According to the Parliament of Ethiopia:  &#8220;Ethiopia is a land of enormous ethnic 
diversity, with people of Semitic, Cushitic, Nilotic and Omotic stock.  There are more than 
80 ethnic groups and as many languages.  In terms of religion, Christians and Muslims make up 
approximately 80 per cent of the population (Christians being slightly more preponderant), the 
remaining 20 per cent animists and others.  Under the Constitution of 1995, religious rights, and 
the cultural and political rights of all ethnic groups are guaranteed.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. Government census statistics from 1994 reveal that the Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups 
each comprise about 30 per cent of the population, while the Somali and Tigrayan ethnic groups 
each comprise circa 6 per cent.  Numerous other groups make up the remainder of the Ethiopian 
population of over 70 million, with only the Afar, the Gedeo, the Gurage, the Hadiya, the Keffa, 
the Sidama, and the Wolaita officially constituting more than 1 per cent of the overall 
population.  The populations of some of the smallest ethnic groups can be counted in the 
hundreds and research is still required to fully document all communities.  Some have estimated 
that the true number of ethnic groups, including subgroups and &#8220;caste-groups&#8221; is far higher. 
</p>
<p>7. The Constitution recognizes all distinct ethnic groups as sovereign &#8220;nations, nationalities 
and peoples&#8221; defined as:  &#8220;a group of people who have or share a large measure of a common 
culture or similar customs, mutual intelligibility of language, belief in a common or related 
identity, a common psychological make-up, and who inhabit an identifiable, predominantly 
contiguous territory&#8221;.  The Constitution does not articulate a distinction between the three 
categories or explicitly recognize national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minority or indigenous 
status. 
</p>
<p>8. In contrast to the policies of previous Governments, all languages and cultures are given 
equal recognition under the Constitution, and each national group has the right to develop and 
promote its own culture and preserve its own history (art. 39, para. 2).  Each &#8220;nation&#8221; has an 
opportunity to govern within a defined territory.  Each state government may promulgate its own 
regional constitution and laws, as long as these are consistent with the federal Constitution, 
declare its own official and working languages, and organize life within its territory in 
accordance with local customs and traditions. 
</p>
<p>9. Research demonstrates a high degree of ethnic mixing, interaction and geographical 
mobility amongst Ethiopia&#8217;s ethnic groups, which have variously been voluntary (economic 
migration to other regions, inter-marriage between communities), or involuntary (including 
forced relocation or displacement due to conflict).  This has resulted in regions in which 
numerous ethnic groups are present, often in significant numbers.  Complex identity issues were 
demonstrated by a number of people who complained that the Government now requires 
everyone, for the purpose of national identity cards, to state a single ethnic status rather than 
identify themselves as of mixed ethnic origin, or as Ethiopian.  In response, the Government 
states that identity remains a self-definitional exercise.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>10. The current Government, the Ethiopian People&#8217;s Revolutionary Democratic Front 
(EPRDF) took office in May 1991 following a protracted war against the Provisional Military </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>Administrative Council (PMAC) Government, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Derg&#8221;.<b>2</b>  The Derg 
had overthrown Emperor Haile-Selassie in 1974, and continued a process of Marxist 
centralization of power and &#8220;nation-building&#8221;.  Under both previous Governments, Amharic was 
imposed as the single official language of Ethiopia.  An Amhara-dominated official State culture 
was promoted, alongside institutional reforms to extend the authority of the central State 
apparatus.  The Tigrayan People&#8217;s Liberation Front (TPLF) successfully liberated the Tigray 
region from Derg control by 1989 and established the EPRDF as a coalition of ethnically-based 
opposition groups to continue the war against the Derg.  The objectives of the EPRDF, later 
articulated in the Constitution, were to establish a democratic Ethiopia and relative cultural and 
political autonomy for its ethnic groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, drafted and adopted 
in 1994 following a period of transitional government, is the supreme law within Ethiopia with 
which all other laws, practices and decisions must conform.  The independent expert welcomed 
the Constitution as a comprehensive and valuable foundation for rights, freedoms, and equality 
in Ethiopia.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution provides detailed provisions for the protection and promotion of 
human and democratic rights in chapter 3, and article 13 states that:  &#8220;The fundamental rights 
and freedoms &#8230; shall be interpreted in a manner conforming to the principles of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, international covenants on human rights and international 
instruments adopted by Ethiopia.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>13. Article 39 of the Constitution establishes a unique and elaborate federal governmental 
structure under which ethnic groups are entitled to self-determination or self-government, 
including the establishment of regional government institutions within ethnically defined 
territories.  Uniquely, the Constitution provides the ultimate right of secession for a nation, 
nationality or people, under certain conditions and following a clearly defined process. 
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution establishes the system of ethnically-based federalism, which marks a 
significant departure from the political visions of previous Governments, and crucially brings to 
the fore the civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights of all Ethiopia&#8217;s 
diverse groups. 
</p>
<p>15. Nine states were established according to chapter 4 of the Constitution,<b>4</b> which states in 
article 46 that these states:  &#8220;shall be delimited on the basis of the settlement patterns, language, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  &#8220;Derg&#8221; is Amharic for Council or Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The Independent expert noted that senior government representatives with whom she met, at 
</p>
<p>both the national and regional levels, commonly had copies of the Constitution on their desks, 
and demonstrated knowledge of its provisions appropriate to their positions. 
<b>4
</b>  Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somalia, Benshangul/Gumuz, the State of the 
</p>
<p>Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP), the State of the Gambella Peoples, and the 
State of the Harari People. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>identity and consent of the peoples concerned&#8221;.  While in six states one ethnic group has a clear 
majority of the population or is politically dominant, as reflected in the name of the state, the 
other states do not give primacy to one particular group.  The State of the Southern Nations, 
Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP), for example, is acknowledged to accommodate over 
45 different ethnic groups within its territory.  Within regions, smaller administrative territories, 
called &#8220;waredas&#8221; and &#8220;zones&#8221;, operate to allow a degree of self-determination to specific groups 
that may be the numerical majority within those units. 
</p><p>16. The independent expert received a variety of opinions regarding the system of 
ethnically-based federalism.  Some felt that it had been imposed without an adequate process of 
consultation, national debate or dialogue that could have ensured a more gradual introduction 
and avoided subsequent problems.  Others felt that in demarcating particular territories as 
effectively belonging to designated ethnic groups, members of other ethnic groups became 
de facto minorities within that regional state, consequently making the protection of minority 
rights as crucial at the state level as it is at the federal level. 
</p>
<p>17. Some issues have caused increased tensions between communities and remain persistent 
problems.  Imposition of local or regional languages as the official language of regional states 
has reportedly resulted in members of some communities of differing ethnic origin effectively 
becoming functionally illiterate overnight.  Some of those living outside their &#8220;natural ethnic 
enclaves&#8221; faced attempts to evict them or claim their land and property, based on the perception 
that under the system only certain native groups were entitled to land.  Some groups have been 
effectively excluded from participation in the public life of the regions in which they live, as they 
are not recognized as native to the region, or do not speak official local languages, and so cannot 
hold certain public offices including regional president or cabinet member. 
</p>
<p>18. The system of ethnically-based federalism has undoubtedly been useful in terms of its 
greater recognition of different ethnic groups, cultures and languages.  Nonetheless, deeper 
analysis reveals the true costs of the system with respect to the protection and promotion of the 
rights of minorities.  However, it may be too soon to make a comprehensive evaluation of its full 
merits.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III.  ENSURING GROUP SURVIVAL 
</b></p>
<p>19. Some smaller minority communities in Ethiopia are considered to be in danger of 
disappearing completely as distinct ethnic groups and cultures, due to factors including 
resettlement, displacement, conflict, assimilation, cultural dilution, environmental factors and 
loss of land.  National experts suggested that the number of endangered communities, some of 
which have less than 300 members, could be as high as 16 out of some 80 identified 
communities.  An unknown number of minority communities are believed to have already 
disappeared completely.  Adequate political representation of some of the smallest groups</p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>at the regional and national level, vital to their continued existence, is hard to achieve for some 
groups.<b>5</b>  For the smallest groups, lacking political awareness and capacity and unable to meet 
thresholds for representation, this remains inaccessible. 
</p>
<p>20. Decline in numbers is partially the result of voluntary cultural dilution through 
inter-ethnic marriage, voluntary relocation or assimilation.  However, every effort is required to 
protect those small groups that wish to maintain their distinct characteristics yet are vulnerable to 
factors beyond their control, such as the impact of conflict or forced displacement from their 
traditional lands.  Further research into such highly vulnerable groups is required to enable 
effective policy responses to protect their existence and preserve their cultures, also for the wider 
benefit of Ethiopia generally. 
</p>
<p>21. The protection of minorities, including protection of their physical integrity, must also be 
considered with respect to larger ethnic groups affected by conflict, and reported targeting or 
forced displacement of particular groups.  Numerous inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic conflicts were 
reported, including in the regions of Gambella, Oromia, SNNP and Somali. 
</p>
<p>22. Ongoing conflicts amongst groups within Oromia region and with groups in 
neighbouring states were highlighted as requiring urgent measures to protect the security of 
vulnerable communities.  The causes of conflict require urgent investigation, and if solutions are 
deemed to fall beyond the capacity of the regional authorities, the federal Government should 
take immediate action to provide solutions and security.  It is alleged that conflicts in Oromia 
and between Oromo clans have been neglected or even orchestrated as a means of destabilizing 
effective political opposition in the region. 
</p>
<p>23. Conflicts, including between neighbouring Gabra clans of Oromo, between Guji and 
Borana, and between Oromo and neighbouring ethnic groups in Somali, Afar and Sidama, have 
allegedly resulted in the displacement of some 300,000 people.  Policies of forced relocation of 
Oromo communities without compensation were claimed to have affected thousands, to make 
way for developments such as cut flower plantations.  The independent expert welcomes the 
intervention of the House of Federation in issues which fall within its jurisdiction. 
</p><p>24. Interviews suggest a deteriorating situation in regard to religious tolerance and between 
those of Christian and Muslim faith.  Tensions in some regions have reportedly been heightened 
by security and &#8220;counter-terrorist&#8221; operations against &#8220;Jihadists&#8221; and Ethiopian military activities 
in Somalia against the Union of Islamic Courts.  In Afar and Somali, which has a porous border 
with Somalia and shared ethnic and religious clans, Islam is dominant.  The Government should 
ensure that State activities do not impact on the legitimate rights and freedoms of religious 
communities under international human rights law and the Constitution of Ethiopia.  Steps 
should be taken publicly by the Government to build confidence amongst Ethiopia&#8217;s Muslim 
communities and to maintain historically good inter-religious relations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  According to national experts interviewed by the independent expert, studies suggest that some 
</p>
<p>minority nationalities had a maximum of 700 members and a minimum of only 200. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25. Targeted attacks against particular communities can result in high loss of life and have a 
devastating social impact, including on the continuing livelihood and residence of particular 
groups in localities where attacks have been perpetrated.  One example is the situation of the 
Anuak and other communities in Gambella region. 
</p>
<p><b>Case study of Gambella State 
</b></p>
<p>26. Recognizing that different social, economic and ethno-religious conditions prevail in 
different regions of Ethiopia, the independent expert nevertheless considers that Gambella, as an 
ethnically diverse, historically marginalized and underdeveloped region, illuminates minority 
issues common to other regions.  Focusing on Gambella allows an examination of the 
effectiveness of the ethnically-based federal model, the challenges encountered, and the degree 
to which it facilitates the identification of solutions by regional and federal authorities. 
</p>
<p>27. Five officially recognized nations, nationalities and peoples are considered native to 
Gambella State.  The Anuak and the Nuer constitute the largest ethnic groups, while Komo, 
Majangir and Opo are smaller groups.  Relocation of some 60,000 people referred to as 
&#8220;highlanders&#8221; (i.e. those of other ethnicity from highland regions of Ethiopia, including Amhara, 
Oromo and Tigrayans) to the region under the Derg Government, following severe droughts, has 
impacted significantly on the demographic make-up of the region, and caused tensions since 
settlements were established on land claimed by the Anuak.  The border with Sudan means that 
some communities such as the Nuer have historical ethnic connections with groups in Sudan.  
Serious conflicts have emerged in the region over the period of the present Government. 
</p>
<p>28. Elders of the Anuak and Nuer communities described to the independent expert historic 
harmony between the pastoralist Nuer and the settled agriculturalist Anuak.  Land, water and 
resource sharing arrangements were traditionally negotiated peacefully, and when specific 
incidents of violence, ethnic tension, or low-level conflicts emerged, traditional and customary 
processes of conflict resolution and reconciliation were implemented to prevent confrontation 
and resolve such issues. 
</p>
<p>29. Elders described deterioration in this traditional harmony over the period of the current 
Government, culminating in what some have called genocide, when in December 2003, 
according to local sources and international human rights investigators, 424 Anuak were killed in 
Gambella town by federal military forces and other ethnic groups.  The Government has claimed 
that 65 Anuak were killed.  The killings followed an attack on a convoy of local United Nations 
workers, blamed on Anuak rebels but without a full investigation being carried out at the time.<b>6</b>  
The events of December 2003 were the low point in ongoing ethnic clashes which have seen 
victims amongst all groups and a serious deterioration in security generally.  An Anuak 
community elder in Gambella town stated that:  &#8220;When the Anuak are killed, that is called 
&#8216;development&#8217; by some people.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  The subsequent final report of a commission of inquiry established by the Government to look 
</p>
<p>into the Gambella massacre differed from the facts as described by elders, community leaders, 
and international NGOs. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>30. Important contributing factors include the relocation into the Gambella region of 
highlanders and a porous border with troubled Southern Sudan, which has had a major impact on 
the region.  Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army (SPLA) fighters have used Gambella and there has 
been an influx of refugees from the Sudanese conflict.  The Oromo Liberation Front has been 
accused of infiltrating fighters into Ethiopia via Gambella&#8217;s Sudanese border.  Heavily armed 
Sudanese Nuer groups (the Lou Nuer) have migrated into the region resulting in conflict with 
local Nuer groups, who have been forced from their traditional lands into Anuak areas, resulting 
in a breakdown of traditional land-sharing arrangements.  Armed Anuak groups active prior to 
December 2003 were blamed for ambushes and killings of highlanders. 
</p>
<p>31. Most elders articulated the underlying problems behind the conflict as being about land 
issues and the encroachment on weaker groups by stronger or better armed groups.  Regional 
politicians were accused of being too concerned with power struggles and achieving political 
power, and of working only for the interests of their own people.  Despite warning signs and 
rising tensions, regional authorities failed to act to avert the incidents of December 2003.  An 
influx of small arms contributed to rapidly escalating violence as previously unarmed groups 
also sought to protect themselves.  An Anuak community elder in Gambella town stated that:  
&#8220;Many highlanders came and many SPLA from Sudan.  Lots of people were killed.  Since then 
we have not felt protected by the Ethiopian Government.  We do not think that they are our 
Government.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>32. Gambella region is uniquely impacted by events and the civil war in Southern Sudan, 
which have had a significant role in its relative instability.  Under the Derg, it was claimed that 
regional police and military bases protected the border, stopping groups such as the Lou Nuer 
entering from Sudan and preventing escalation of ethnic tensions.  The present Government, 
however, has reportedly abandoned regional police stations and evacuated military bases, 
resulting in the free movement of people and rising tensions that have been allowed to escalate 
unchecked. 
</p>
<p>33. Lack of investment in roads in the region makes it difficult to prevent or remedy 
problems in remote areas, even for the military.  Community elders pointed out that development 
in the region had been seriously underfunded or neglected, or that money had disappeared.  
Gambella remains desperately in need of roads, infrastructure, schools, hospitals and clinics, 
electricity provision, and numerous other services which would contribute to peace and stability 
in the region.  Such developments would provide much needed jobs that could benefit all 
communities.  These issues demonstrate a strong developmental component to the ongoing 
conflicts in Gambella. 
</p>
<p>34. Interviews revealed perceptions that highlanders are politically and economically 
dominant, despite an ethnically mixed regional government.  There was also a strong sense of 
skin colour bias, as highlanders demonstrated racist attitudes and used derogatory names toward 
Anuaks, Nuers and others.  The independent expert was informed that if members of &#8220;black 
groups&#8221; wish to open a shop or business &#8220;it will be closed down&#8221;.  The events of December 2003 
have heightened such perceptions and also led to claims that the military is dominated by 
highlanders, and present in the region to protect only highlander communities.  The belief was 
commonly expressed that the military and political actors have provoked inter-ethnic conflict to 
safeguard highlander interests, divide political opposition, and clear communities from land for 
oil exploration. </p>

</p>
<p>35. A forum for Anuak and Nuer women to talk about their lives, issues and concerns 
highlighted the massive impact on individuals, families and communities, and on women in 
particular, of the ethnic conflicts, and the incidents of December 2003.  The women talked of 
their despair over the fact that their Anuak sons and other male family members had either been 
killed or fled to avoid the killing and had not returned.  They asked for help to convince their 
sons that it was safe to return to their communities.  Many women face severe practical problems 
of daily survival, personal security, including the threat of rape, and loss of property in the 
absence of male members of their families.  They spoke of the continuing trauma of their 
experiences and how their loss has left them in deep despair. 
</p>
<p>36. The regional president noted efforts by the Government<b>7</b> to address inequalities and 
prevent conflict, and that it strives to achieve equal treatment in such fields as employment and 
education, and participation of all groups in government.  When asked about the events in 2003, 
the Gambella president blamed &#8220;lack of good governance&#8221; as the major issue contributing to the 
problems and conflict.  The previous regional government had failed to address the root causes 
of problems.  Contrary to community representatives, the regional government did not consider 
land and resource issues to be a major factor in conflicts, but considered competition for political 
power a crucial motivating factor.  A Nuer community leader stated that:  &#8220;This Gambella 
government is working for peace, and local ethnic groups have made conferences &#8230; but we also 
need education, clinics, electricity and development.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>37. Representatives of the regional government noted that the granting of title to land was 
planned in Gambella through a new proclamation and law.  While potentially providing greater 
security of land tenure, the independent expert cautioned that this should be sensitively 
conceived and implemented, to ensure fairness and avoid tensions over disputed lands and 
territories.  It should not be a means to increase government revenues by imposing &#8220;title fees&#8221; 
upon those who have traditionally inhabited the land. 
</p>
<p>38. Since the 2003 events, the Gambella President had expanded his cabinet to include 
members of five different ethnic groups in key posts.  The Anuak and the Nuer each hold seven 
cabinet posts, while the Majangir have three.  In addition the number of seats on the regional 
council was increased from 55 to 82, to allow greater representation by different groups and 
reduce political competition.  The Anuak and Nuer are allocated over 30 seats each.  Local 
languages (Anuak, Nuer and Majangir) are taught in schools alongside Amharic and English, 
with some financial and technical support from the federal Government.  The languages of 
smaller groups (Komo and Opo) are not commonly taught in Gambella schools. 
</p>
<p>39. The President noted that training and recruitment had been put in place to promote an 
ethnic balance in the regional police force.  He noted that there are currently 480 Anuak, 
400 Nuer and 100 highlander police officers, correcting a previous imbalance.  Attempts to 
create similar balance in the regional judiciary had been initiated, although some communities, 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  The independent expert held consultations with the Gambella regional President and senior 
</p>
<p>members of the Council, including the regional Supreme Court President, the head of the Justice 
Bureau, the Minister of Women&#8217;s Affairs, the Commissioner of Police (informal meeting) and 
representatives of the Bureau of Education, amongst others. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3

</p>
<p>notably the Nuer, are reluctant to become judges.  Independent non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) noted that the Government had engaged with community-led conflict prevention and 
reconciliation projects and made efforts to listen to the concerns of different groups.  They 
described &#8220;improved space&#8221; for civil society activities supported by international NGOs and 
agencies. 
</p>
<p>40. The Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) had been called for by the state cabinet 
prior to 2003 to address &#8220;anti-peace&#8221; elements and assist the regional government.  It was 
acknowledged that individual ENDF members may have committed crimes, and some had been 
arrested and convicted, although details were unavailable.  Reports of ongoing violations by the 
ENDF, including killings and rape in rural areas, were described as &#8220;allegations to be dealt with 
by the courts&#8221;.  The military presence in the region was described as necessary for peace and 
security in the region, particularly in view of the porous border with Sudan, used by elements 
that wished to create instability.  The security situation generally was said to have improved 
although recent reports from rural areas contradict this claim. 
</p>
<p>41. The independent expert expressed her serious concern to regional authorities over the fact 
that many individuals, largely of Anuak ethnicity, had been held in prison without trial since 
December 2003, in contravention of the constitutional guarantee of speedy trials.  Subsequently 
during her visit, she was informed that the mobile federal court would be visiting Gambella the 
following week to conduct hearings into such cases.  Since leaving the region, she has been 
informed of the release of six individuals due to lack of any evidence or witnesses against them.  
The mobile court is due to return to Gambella in January 2007 to recommence hearings. 
</p>
<p>42. The independent expert welcomed efforts on the part of the Government to promote 
stability, engage with communities and respond to their issues.<b>8</b>  Efforts must be greatly 
enhanced, however, to ensure security for all communities and to safeguard against future 
serious incidents.  In view of the prevailing circumstances in Gambella and continuing tensions, 
there remains a significant risk that such incidents could occur, and priority should be given to 
reducing tensions and building confidence among and between ethnic groups.  Reports were 
provided of killings and other grave human rights violations that could have escalated rapidly, 
but which were contained, including through timely interventions of the federal police. 
</p>
<p>43. Military forces active in the region must be appropriate for, and sensitive to local 
conditions, including in regard to their ethnic composition, their distribution and the location of 
their barracks, their duties, and discipline.  The military should be located in barracks outside 
Gambella town and restricted from entering it.  Measures must be taken to ensure and 
demonstrate that communities such as the Anuak can be confident of protection by the military 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  In addition, the President of the regional Supreme Court expressed an interest regarding the 
</p>
<p>provision of human rights information and documentation, and possibilities for technical 
assistance by OHCHR.  The independent expert noted that she would investigate possibilities 
and provide relevant materials to enable the Supreme Court to undertake human rights and 
minority rights awareness-raising initiatives within the judiciary.  A similar request was made by 
the Commissioner of Police of Gambella regarding relevant materials relating to policing, 
security and criminal justice in multi-ethnic societies. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>and the police, following the well-documented role of military personnel in the 2003 massacre, 
and lack of police protection at that time.  Given highly volatile conditions following large-scale 
killings and reprisals, all communities must be equally protected.  While a commission of 
inquiry was set up into the events in Gambella, there is widespread distrust as to the integrity of 
the published commission report and a belief that not all soldiers who committed crimes have 
been prosecuted.  Widows interviewed by the independent expert stated that they had never had 
an opportunity to tell their stories.  This may be a situation which would benefit from adapting a 
model of a truth commission. 
</p>
<p>44. The use of local and federal police, is considered preferable to the use of military forces 
in most instances relating to internal regional peace and stability.  The military should however 
have an enhanced role in securing the border with Sudan and in protection of communities 
threatened and displaced by armed groups who originate from Sudan.  Measures to peacefully 
disarm and repatriate Sudanese groups should be undertaken as soon as possible, with 
subsequent measure to allow native communities to return to the territories from which they 
were displaced.  Such measures would greatly help to ease tensions related to land. 
</p>
<p>45. Oil exploration in Gambella is considered by some observers to be a factor in the 
increasing tensions in the region and in the displacement of some communities.  Such activities 
may impact negatively on vulnerable communities, for example, in regard to environmental 
damage or the possibility of evictions from their land or other violations of their rights.  The 
Government is urged at an early stage to consider programmes and policies that ensure that all 
local communities benefit appropriately from such activities, for example, in regard to 
employment opportunities and an equitable share of the newly generated wealth. 
</p>
<p>46. Numerous international agencies, NGOs and faith-based organizations<b>9</b> promote 
inter-ethnic cooperation, conflict prevention and peaceful development in Gambella alongside 
local civil society.  The work of such organizations is extremely valuable, and their continued 
presence is considered essential to addressing the immediate and long-term needs of 
communities in the region, and to promoting peace and stability. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  LANGUAGE AND CULTURE 
</b></p>
<p>47. Article 39, paragraph 2 of the Constitution states:  &#8220;Every Nation, Nationality and People 
in Ethiopia has the right to speak, to write and to develop its own language; to express, to 
develop and to promote its culture; and to preserve its history.&#8221;  In many respects the 
re-establishment of local languages has been a major success of the EPRDF Government. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  International organizations and agencies including the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association, 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations 
World Food Programme (WFP), International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Pact, and 
M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) amongst others are active in Gambella State.  The Salesian 
Don Bosco organization is noted for its establishment of educational, vocational training and 
recreational facilities for children and young people from all communities in Gambella town. </p>

</p>
<p>48. An estimated 89 different languages, belonging to several different language groups, are 
spoken throughout Ethiopia.  Language is however a highly politicized issue and historical 
dominance of Amharic under successive Amhara-led Governments saw decline in other 
languages with resulting tensions.  The current language policy was established in the 
Constitution under articles 5 and 39.  The federal system has been beneficial in terms of 
re-establishing minority languages that are fully recognized and promoted under the Constitution 
as working languages within schools and the various regional state administrations. 
</p>
<p>49. Amharic remains the official working language of choice in some states, including 
Amhara, the SNNP and Afar.  Under previous Governments, Amharic was the language of 
primary school education nationwide and thus children from other ethnic groups had little 
possibility to learn their native language within the formal school system.  Under article 5, 
paragraph 1 of the Constitution, all languages are given equal recognition by the State, and 
Amharic is recognized as the official working language of the federal Government.  However 
each member state of the Federation may determine its own working language. 
</p>
<p>50. The situation in terms of the languages of smaller minority groups within a state is less 
certain and a number of minority languages are considered extinct.<b>10</b>  Limited resources mean 
that not all languages can be represented in the school system, which in many regions is 
burdened by severe resource and access problems.<b>11</b>  Under-resourced states may be unable to 
devote resources to minority languages in states with a dominant ethnic group.  At the wareda or 
zone level, local education solutions should be encouraged, although these may require 
Government support.  Guidelines may be required to ensure that the gap between constitutional 
recognition and practical realization of language rights does not result in conflict between 
groups, or arbitrary decisions that elevate certain languages over others. 
</p>
<p>51. Those speaking only their mother tongue may be disadvantaged beyond the regional 
level, and thus in all regions there is education in both Amharic and English, which are also 
commonly the languages of instruction in secondary and higher education.  The independent 
expert strongly supports the opinion that a common language, learned by all in Ethiopia, is an 
effective mechanism contributing to national unity and equal opportunity.  A unifying national 
language (a lingua franca) means that no groups should be disadvantaged nationally, or face 
restrictions on their geographical or socio-economic mobility due to issues of language 
proficiency.  However, for minority groups in rural and disadvantaged regions, lacking basic 
access to education, language and literacy remains a serious barrier to full realization of their 
rights.  A human rights advocate in Addis Ababa stated that:  &#8220;People want to study English or 
Amharic &#8230; they don&#8217;t want to commit suicide by only knowing their own language.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  Ethnologue:  Languages of the world (2005) www.ethnologue.com/web.asp states that there

Rer Bare and Weyto) are extinct. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  According to the UNDP Human Development Index, net primary school enrolment in 2004 in 
Ethiopia was 46 per cent.  The Government contests this and estimates that this figure was more 
than 70 per cent in 2004. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. Interviews in Gambella revealed that:  many children were not in school; the security 
situation had led to the effective suspension of education for two years in some waredas; schools 
had been destroyed and lacked materials; teachers had left or were poorly qualified; and there 
was little information available to the regional government about the functioning of the 
education system in rural areas, administered by the waredas.  While some communities were 
felt to have adequate access to education, due in part to their disproportionate residence in 
relatively urban areas, inequalities in access to education for groups including Anuak, Nuer, 
Majangir, Komo and Opo residing in rural areas were cause for concern. 
</p><p>53. The Civic and Ethical Education Policy has been designed for the Ethiopian school 
system to promote core values and principles and assist in &#8220;developing a culture based on 
tolerance of different cultures&#8221;.  The values highlighted within the programme are:  democracy; 
rule of law; equality; justice; patriotism; responsibility; industriousness; self-reliance; saving; 
active community participation; and the pursuit of wisdom.  This extensive programme is in the 
curriculum of both primary and secondary schools.  The civic and ethical education syllabus was 
established by the federal Ministry of Education, however regional governments have the right to 
make their own decisions regarding its adoption. 
</p>
<p>54. The independent expert welcomed the civic and ethical education syllabus as an example 
of good practice in promoting understanding and tolerance amongst Ethiopia&#8217;s ethnic groups.  
She encouraged its vigorous promotion and endorsement at the federal and regional level, taking 
into account specific regional ethnic demographics, and including information about and relevant 
to different cultures, their histories and their contributions to wider society.  The independent 
expert noted that she is promoting such positive practices in her work on minority issues in 
education globally and will use the example of Ethiopia.  A representative of the federal Ministry 
of Education in Addis Ababa said that:  &#8220;Our history of conflict has given us a combat culture 
under which &#8216;patriotism&#8217; is equated with fighting.  Now we say patriotism must transcend this 
combat culture.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>55. The duties of the State in regard to cultural rights are set out in article 91, paragraph 1 of 
the Constitution which states that:  &#8220;Government shall have the duty to support, on the basis of 
equality, the growth and enrichment of cultures and traditions that are compatible with 
fundamental rights, human dignity, democratic norms and ideals, and the provisions of the 
Constitution.&#8221;  Efforts to promote cultural awareness and celebrate diversity through events such 
as the Day of Nations, Nationalities and Peoples, inaugurated in December 2006, are welcome.  
However, such initiatives must be underpinned by substantive investment and legislative and 
policy development, with the aim of ensuring the promotion and protection of cultural rights in 
practice. 
</p>
<p><b>Pastoralists 
</b></p>
<p>56. Pastoralists are distinct groups with traditional nomadic herding lifestyles, that are 
increasingly coming into conflict with settled farmers and the agro-industry.  Their traditional</p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>territories often cross State boundaries, and they suffer greatly from the effects of drought, 
flooding and conflict over land, resources and water.  Pastoralists commonly face high and 
disproportionate levels of poverty, food insecurity and low educational enrolment levels.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>57. The Government reportedly favours a policy to settle nomadic pastoralist groups.  For 
many pastoralists this is a denial of the right to their culture and lifestyle and contrary to the 
Constitution, which extends guarantees regarding cultural preservation, and grants the right not 
to be evicted from traditional lands.  Pastoralist ethnic groups are present in the House of 
Federation and the House of Peoples&#8217; Representatives.<b>13</b>  However, pastoralist representatives 
working for NGOs<b>14</b> are concerned that their opinions are not accurately represented and believe 
that the federal Government must play a more constructive role in reaching solutions to conflicts 
involving land use, that respect traditional lifestyles, land occupancy and usage. 
</p>
<p>58. The situation of the Karayu pastoralists, an Oromo tribal group inhabiting the Fantalle 
district of Oromia, and neighbouring pastoralist groups was highlighted.  Allegations state that 
the Karayu have been forcibly displaced from their lands and denied access to the Awash River 
(their only natural water source), due to the establishment of the Awash National Park, Upper 
Awash Agro-industry Enterprise and Methara Sugar Factory in the area.  Displacement has 
allegedly taken place without compensation, and brought them into conflict with neighbouring 
pastoralist groups including the Argoba, the Afar, the Ittu and the Arsi, since all must compete 
for pastureland, resources and water.  Community representatives claim that conflicts have 
intensified and that traditional conflict resolution mechanisms are unable to resolve this situation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUALITY 
</b>59. Article 25 of the Constitution states that:  &#8220;All persons are equal before the law and are 
entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law.  In this respect, the law 
shall guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection without discrimination on grounds of 
race, nation, nationality, or other social origin, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, property, birth or other status.&#8221;
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  Pastoralist enrolment in education in Ethiopia is 24 per cent compared with a national average 
</p>
<p>estimated by the Government to be 70 per cent.  Pastoralists fall far behind national averages in 
regard to most human development indicators. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  In addition there is a Pastoralist Standing Committee at the House of Peoples&#8217; 
Representatives, which coordinates the role of the legislature in the enforcement of the rights of 
pastoral groups, and a Pastoralist Affairs Development Department. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  Pastoralist Forum Ethiopia states that 29 ethnic groups in 6 states in Ethiopia are pastoralist 
members of the Forum, which represents 11 NGOs working on 13 projects in areas such as good 
governance, best practice, and conflict prevention. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>60. The Criminal Code of Ethiopia (Proclamation No. 414/2004) establishes equality before 
the law under article 4, noting that:  &#8220;Criminal law applies to all alike without discrimination as 
regards persons, social conditions, race, nation, nationality, social origin, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, property, birth or other status.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>61. The consultations she undertook led the independent expert to believe that discrimination 
is a serious problem within wider Ethiopian society.  Discrimination along ethnic lines may have 
been further exacerbated under the ethnically-based federal system, which has created a new 
awareness of ethnic identity and increasingly politicized ethnicity.  Ethnically-based federalism 
has also created new contexts, arenas and dimensions of racism and discrimination, as ethnic 
groups and ethnically-based regions have been forced to cope with new dynamics of 
minority/majority relations at the regional and even local administrative levels.  A university 
student in Addis Ababa said:  &#8220;The problem is that we are dividing more than ever before rather 
than uniting as Ethiopians.  We are working against ourselves.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>62. The causes and dynamics of discrimination are complex in Ethiopia.  Historical factors 
and unequal power relations between different groups have further complicated the picture of 
discrimination.  Ethnicity has emerged as the most salient aspect of individual and group 
identification.  By allocating territories to the political control of particular ethnic groups, many 
people observed to the independent expert that ethnic divisions have become more deeply 
entrenched and discrimination has manifested itself amongst previously harmonious 
communities, as particular groups have emerged as numerically or politically dominant within 
new regional administrations. 
</p>
<p>63. Numerous consultations established that certain ethnic groups are more commonly 
subjected to discrimination and exclusion, both on the interpersonal and institutional levels, 
based on skin colour and other physical features.  Reportedly, derogatory terms such as &#8220;slave&#8221;, 
are commonly used in reference to certain ethnic groups, alluding to their historic dominance by 
other groups, and patterns of exploitation during the slave trade.  Such overt discrimination may 
be the case, even in regions where those targeted for abuse are numerically in the majority and 
have the constitutional right to political power in regional government, such as is the case in 
Gambella. 
</p>
<p>64. Anti-discrimination provisions in specific laws relating, for example, to labour and the 
family are considered to be poorly implemented and not enforced nationally.  In theory, 
international human rights instruments can be invoked directly before national courts, however 
they have not been published in the official Gazette, leaving lawyers and judges with the 
impression that they have no independent judicial force.  Ethiopia currently lacks separate, 
comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, which would greatly assist in elaborating upon 
standards and their application, requirements for compliance, and penalties for violation. 
</p>
<p>65. The Constitution guarantees the right to equality in employment (art. 35, para. 8).  
Equally the Labour Proclamation (No. 377/2003) which revised the Labour Law in 2004, in 
article 14, paragraph 1 (f) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate on the basis of 
nationality, sex, religion, political outlook &#8220;or any other conditions&#8221;.  Civil service employment</p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>is regulated by the Federal Civil Servant Proclamation (No. 262/2002) which also protects 
against discrimination and under section 13, paragraph 3 authorizes preferential recruitment of 
women and members of ethnic groups underrepresented in the civil service.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Ethiopia&#8217;s revised Labour Law is a national law, which governs employment relations 
throughout the country.  It is applicable to both public and private sector employment but not to 
the agricultural and informal sector in which the majority, some 80 per cent of people, are 
employed.  Although the Constitution recognizes historical disparities, an obligation on 
employers to implement affirmative action measures, for example to advance women&#8217;s 
participation, is not imposed. 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p>67. While women generally face discrimination in Ethiopian society due to patriarchal 
systems and traditional gender roles and practices, women from different ethnic communities 
may face multidimensional obstacles, based on the particularities of the customary or religious 
practices of their communities and the relative status of their ethnic group within the ethnic 
hierarchy in their region and nationally.  As such, protection of their rights requires legislative 
measures enforceable at both federal and regional levels, and practical policy initiatives. 
</p>
<p>68. The revised Family Code of Ethiopia was adopted in 2000 (Proclamation 213/2000) and 
is highlighted by the independent expert as a valuable addition to legislation that seeks to protect 
and promote the rights of women and conditions of equality.  Unfortunately, as a federal law it is 
not compulsory at the regional level since regions maintain autonomy in cultural and social 
affairs.<b>16</b>  Regions can choose to adopt it or to adopt their own family codes, which take into 
account cultural and regional particularities, so long as they do not contravene the Constitution.<b>17</b>  
While welcomed by civil society groups, serious problems with implementation and enforcement 
of the Code have been highlighted. 
</p>
<p>69. In rural areas, traditional or customary law practices and patriarchal family and 
community structures are prevalent and often incompatible with non-discrimination legislation.  
Cultural or religious practices, such as polygamy and male-only ownership of property, are still 
unofficially sanctioned in some states.  Some states are, however, reportedly attempting to revise 
the law in a way that conforms with the Constitution yet recognizes the status of customary 
courts and laws and non-discriminatory traditional practices. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations 
</p>
<p>noted in 2005 that this had been used on only rare occasions and that women remained 
particularly underrepresented. 
<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  The Code is only compulsory in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa administrations (federal cities), 
unless otherwise adopted by regions. 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  Five regions have reportedly adopted the revised Family Code (the first being Tigray), 
although some including Gambella continue to act according to previous legislation considered 
incompatible with the Constitution and international human rights standards. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>70. Since over 40 per cent of the population is Muslim, sharia courts are used widely in the 
area of family disputes.  In theory both parties should consent to adjudication by either the 
religious or local court system.  In practice men often favour sharia courts because they are more 
likely to be successful in them, and women may feel pressured to accept this.  Under the sharia 
court system, which has its own appellate level, there is no possibility of appealing a sharia court 
decision in a federal court.  However, a landmark 2004 decision of the House of Federation 
upheld the right of women not to be judged by a sharia court without their full consent. 
</p><p>71. In Gambella, for example, local tribal customary courts are commonly used, and the 
rights of women are often not well protected; however there is an avenue of appeal to the formal 
local court system.  Even within the regional court system, women are poorly represented as 
judges and may face discrimination by male judges who may be influenced by traditional 
practices and gender perceptions.  The effects of discrimination on ethnic grounds were also 
mentioned, a clear example of the potential for multiple discrimination against minority women. 
</p>
<p>72. The Gambella Bureau for Women&#8217;s Affairs noted that surveys had established that 
women and children had been significant victims of conflict.  They were unable to flee and 
suffered from secondary effects, including loss of property and the support of male family 
members.  In many regions, women traditionally have no customary rights to own or inherit 
property.  Even where males have fled violence, property is commonly appropriated by 
remaining male members of the husband&#8217;s family.  In cases of divorce, property is generally 
retained by the husband, despite chapter 5 of the Family Code which establishes shared 
ownership of common property.  The property rights of women generally were highlighted by 
the independent expert as an area requiring urgent legislative and practical protection. 
</p>
<p>73. The federal Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs works directly with regional women&#8217;s affairs 
offices to assist in issues of gender inequality and is responsible for implementation of a national 
Women&#8217;s Policy.  All Ministries have departments on gender issues, a mainstreaming initiative 
which is extended to the regional level.  Such attention to gender issues is considered a positive 
practice by the independent expert, although she notes that the federal Ministry of Women&#8217;s 
Affairs is relatively new, having been elevated within the past year from an advisory office to the 
Prime Minister.  Its structures and methods of work are new and untested and its focus appears to 
be primarily on public education rather than implementation of the law.  Dedicated attention is 
required to address the situation of women from the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups 
in the most outlying regional states.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>74. The independent expert considers that a crucial test of government efforts is whether 
minority groups feel that they have an effective voice in political decision-making.  The vast 
majority of civil society actors interviewed spoke of being excluded from genuine political 
participation, or representation by authentic community leaders.  This perceived exclusion, 
however, is relatively invisible, since representatives of diverse ethnic groups do hold office, 
often at a senior level, within federal and state administrations.  There is a broadly held view that 
independent, ethnically-based political parties have been excluded in favour of others created by 
the Tigray People&#8217;s Liberation Front (TPLF) and subordinate to it.  The view is that ethnic 
political figure-heads have emerged and that senior officials, or advisors who hold the real 
power, are drawn from only one politically dominant ethnic group and party. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>75. The independent expert considers that it is crucial that the Government takes steps to 
instil in all population groups true confidence that they have genuine, effective participation in 
decision-making through authentic representatives of their communities.  Measures should be 
taken to guarantee and implement democratic governance, as provided in the Constitution, 
through free and fair elections in which the legitimate and peaceful rights of all political parties 
and individuals to stand for election and hold elected office without interference are fully 
respected.  She equally highlights the need for a free and independent media which reflects a 
plurality of opinions, including those of minority groups and political opposition parties. 
</p>
<p>76. Prisoners, including those held in detention since the May 2005 elections, must be 
brought speedily to trial under international standards of fair trial, including in regard to the 
independence of judges and lawyers, or released if no evidence exists against them.  In 
discussions with the Minister of Justice the independent expert raised questions regarding the 
appropriateness of charging those who opposed the conduct of the May 2005 elections with 
&#8220;attempted genocide&#8221;.  The Government states that these charges reflect attempts to organize 
armed opposition to oust the current Government.  Civil society groups consider these charges 
and government action against opposition as politically motivated, repressive, unlawful and 
undemocratic. </p>
<p>77. Sources claim that Oromo people are disproportionately represented amongst prison 
inmates and are often held and convicted based on politically motivated charges.  
Representatives of the Oromo allege widespread violation of their civil and political rights, 
including killings and imprisonment of political leaders, journalists and students; restrictions on 
independent political parties; exclusion of students from universities; and discrimination against 
Oromo who fail to support the EPRDF ruling party. 
</p>
<p>78. The independent expert encourages the state and federal Governments to take all possible 
practical measures to ensure justice and the rule of law, security, and to promote peace and 
stability in Oromia and all other regions.  The Government must fulfil its commitments in this 
respect under international human rights treaties to which it is voluntarily a party, and under the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p><b>The House of Federation 
</b></p>
<p>79. The independent expert consulted with senior administrators of the House of Federation, 
the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Ethiopia.  It is composed of representatives of 
nations, nationalities and peoples, each of which can be represented by at least one member.  
Groups with a population of over 1 million are entitled to one additional member for each 
million of their population.  Members of the House are appointed by state councils, which can 
directly elect representatives, or can hold elections in order to have representatives elected by the 
people.  In December 2006, it was noted that there were 112 seats in the House of Federation,</p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>representing 69 nations, nationalities or peoples.<b>18</b>  The House does not have the authority to 
initiate laws or check the powers of the House of Peoples&#8217; Representatives or the Executive.  
However, it is intended to act as an assurance mechanism for the rights of different ethnic 
groups. 
</p>
<p>80. The functions and powers of the House are established in article 62 of the Constitution.  
It has the authority to interpret the Constitution via the Council of Constitutional Inquiry, which 
is composed of expert members of the House.  It is empowered to &#8220;decide on issues relating to 
the rights of Nations, Nationalities and Peoples to self-determination&#8221;, including ultimately the 
constitutionally established right to secession.  It is called upon to &#8220;promote the equality of the 
Peoples of Ethiopia &#8230; and promote and consolidate their unity based on their mutual consent&#8221;.  
While regional states have initial responsibility for resolving border disputes between 
themselves, where they fail, the House can be called upon to intervene and find a solution. 
</p>
<p>81. In practice, the House has deliberated on few cases.  These include a decision relating to 
the promulgation of family law; a decision regarding a claim for recognition of identity by the 
Selti community<b>19</b> resident in SNNP; a decision on the rights of members of particular 
communities to elect and be elected in Benshangul/Gumuz State; and an appeal by an individual 
woman against being judged by sharia court.  These few cases highlight the potentially valuable 
role of the House, which seems not to have been fully exploited to date.  The independent expert 
commends the Five Year Strategic Plan drawn up by the House, and a detailed programme of 
work for the period 2006 to 2010 aimed at strengthening the performance of the House.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>The House of Peoples&#8217; Representatives 
</b></p>
<p>82. The House of Peoples&#8217; Representatives is the highest authority of the federal 
Government.  It has full legislative authority in all matters assigned by the Constitution to 
federal jurisdiction.  Members of the House are elected for a term of five years.  Currently there 
are 548 members from different parties and independent members.  Out of the 548 seats the 
TPLF/EPRDF has 496, the rest being held by minority parties and independent members.  The 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  Gambella, for example, has 4 members of the House representing 4 different ethnic groups, 
</p>
<p>while SNNP has 54 members representing 48 nations, nationalities and peoples.  Communities 
not represented in the House can apply for representation, a recent example being the successful 
application of the Argoba community.  A total of 21 of these seats are held by women. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  The Selti were successful in their claim for recognition and their own administrative zone in 
SNNP having claimed separate identity from the larger Gurage group of which they had been 
considered a part. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  Of particular relevance to her mandate, the independent expert welcomes the objectives of the 
House to better promote equality, non-discrimination, and unity between all nations, nationalities 
and peoples; to be more proactive in the field of conflict prevention and dispute resolution 
(including conducting conflict assessments in two regions annually); to initiate research and 
events to promote cultures and cultural diversity; to raise awareness of the Constitution; and to 
develop its capacity to reach decisions on issues under its jurisdiction. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>House has 20 seats reserved for minorities; however it is unclear which groups qualify for 
representation under this &#8220;set-aside&#8221; provision.  There are nine standing committees in the 
House, of which two are chaired by members of minority parties. 
</p>
<p>83. Despite devolution of power to ethnic groups under article 39 of the Constitution, the 
independent expert encountered persistent criticism that the TPLF/EPRDF central party is 
undermining democratic processes and exerting undue influence and control over state and 
federal affairs.  Accusations that peaceful and democratic rights and activities of independent 
political parties are being restricted, including via arbitrary detention of political opponents and 
other illegal measures, require an immediate response from the Government in order to 
re-establish confidence in democratic processes amongst diverse ethnic constituencies.  A human 
rights advocate in Addis Ababa stated that:  &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s hope to go against something has died.  
The Government has achieved its aim.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>84. The Government is commended for attention to and data on women&#8217;s participation in 
political structures.<b>21</b>  While the total percentage of seats on regional councils held by women 
in all regions is 27.61 per cent, it is notable that there is a marked difference between states.  
While in Tigray 48.68 per cent of council seats are held by women, in Gambella the figure is 
14.63 per cent, and in Somali it is only 3.27 per cent.  While traditional gender and family roles 
and cultural practices help to explain low levels of female participation in some regions, it is 
evident that attention is required to ensure the adequate representation of all ethnic groups on 
state and federal political bodies, and that the participation of minority women in particular is 
promoted. 
</p>
<p>85. The independent expert expressed concern that members of ethnic groups who have 
migrated to a region or been relocated, often in large numbers, may be excluded from political 
office due to not being native to the region and/or lack of knowledge of local official languages.  
Tensions may result from resentment over de facto exclusion from political processes, since 
ethnically-based political parties are unlikely to fully represent the interests of other ethnic 
communities.  The independent expert encourages mechanisms which ensure wider 
representation of politically excluded groups.  A constitutional expert in Addis Ababa said:  
&#8220;Other groups are just migrants to the region and so have less rights.  If you are an Anuak in 
Harari you cannot wield power, you have to go back to Gambella.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Civil society and the national human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>86. Civil society groups have reflected some difficulties in pursuing aspects of work relating 
to particular ethnic groups or issues that are perceived as overly political or politically motivated.
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  The website of the House of Federation (www.hofethiopia.org) provides information on the 
</p>
<p>gender and ethnicity of members of the House according to region and also details of female 
participation in regional state councils.  Of the 548 seats of the House of Peoples&#8217; 
Representatives, 116 are currently occupied by women. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Detention of NGO workers or expulsion of international employees has been reported.  The 
independent expert notes, however, the constructive nature of some government engagement 
with a number of national and international NGOs.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>87. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission<b>23</b> started functioning during 2005.  The 
Commission has to date not filed for accreditation with the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC).  It 
is therefore not currently considered to be set up in accordance with the Paris Principles, for 
example regarding its independence from Government.<b>24</b>  The mandate of the Commission is 
threefold:  to promote the concept of human rights amongst the public; to monitor human rights 
violations; and to take measures to remedy violations.  A human rights ombudsman was 
appointed in June 2004. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  POVERTY 
</b></p>
<p>88. Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world and ranks 170 out of 177 nations in 
the UNDP Human Development Index.<b>25</b>  Additionally, the Human Poverty Index for developing 
countries (HPI-1) looks beyond income deprivation to consider severe deprivation in, for 
example, health, education and access to clean water and sanitation.  Ethiopia ranks 98 
among 102 developing countries for which the index is calculated. 
</p>
<p>89. Minority communities uniquely affected by racism, discrimination, exclusion and often 
violence, suffer high and disproportionate levels of poverty.<b>26</b>  Ethiopia gives some attention to 
regional disparities in its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) report and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper (PRSP) and it was noted that pastoralist issues are included in the second phase of 
the PRSP.  However Ethiopia does not provide data disaggregated by ethnicity that would reveal 
inequalities across ethnic and religious groups and allow policies and programmes to be designed 
for and targeted at particularly disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  Pastoralist Forum Ethiopia cooperated with the Government to establish Ethiopian Pastoralist 
</p>
<p>Day (declared a National Day) to raise awareness of pastoralist culture and issues, and bring 
pastoralist groups together to advocate for their rights. 
<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  The Commission was established in 2000 by Proclamation 210/2000. 
<b>24
</b></p>
<p>  In 2006 the Commission sought assistance and technical support from OHCHR and bilateral 
donors and the independent expert encourages such initiatives and early accreditation with the 
ICC. 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  The Index is a comparative measure based on indicators in such fields as life expectancy, 
literacy, education, health and general standard of living for countries worldwide, and offers a 
broad consideration of &#8220;well-being&#8221;. 
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  The independent expert highlights the thematic focus established in her initial report on 
minorities to the Human Rights Council in the context of poverty alleviation and the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), further developed in her 2007 annual report (A/HRC/4/9). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>90. The Poverty Action Network Ethiopia (PANE) was established in March 2004.  PANE 
has over 70 institutional members and aims to coordinate the involvement of civil society groups 
and to empower citizens for active participation in the design, implementation and monitoring of 
poverty reduction policies including the Government&#8217;s Sustainable Development and Poverty 
Reduction Programme (SDPRP).<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>91. Ethiopia&#8217;s enhanced agricultural programme, food security and rural area safety net 
programme are valuable initiatives by the Government.  However measures are required to 
ensure that such programmes meet the needs of minorities, often the poorest and most 
disadvantaged communities in all regions, including through awareness-raising initiatives, needs 
assessments and monitoring mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>92. The official recognition of distinct groups, cultures and languages has been a major 
success of the current Government and Constitution.  Under the Constitution there is a clear 
acknowledgement that all groups have a place in Ethiopian society at both the regional and 
federal level.  Reforms have given renewed status to many more languages and enabled their use 
in public education and government administration. 
</p>
<p>93. The independent expert considers the Constitution to be exemplary in its human 
rights provisions, and welcomes explicit references to international human rights law.  
Anti-discrimination provisions established in article 25 provide a valuable constitutional basis 
for promoting non-discrimination and equality. 
</p>
<p>94. Commendable efforts to recognize the diverse nations, nationalities and peoples of 
Ethiopia should go hand in hand with equally necessary policies to promote unity in diversity in 
a nation with historic ethnic divisions, tensions and unequal power relationships.  The promotion 
of a common Ethiopian identity, shared by all groups, and underpinning the democratic 
functioning of the ethnic federal system, is considered a necessary component of a stable, 
peaceful and inclusive Ethiopia. 
</p>
<p>95. To date, however, the promise of the Constitution and the aspiration of ethnic groups for 
empowerment and a sense of full participation in decision-making have not been achieved and 
remain largely unfulfilled.  The independent expert was deeply concerned that discussions with 
non-governmental actors commonly included expressions of lack of faith in political processes, 
domination by a political and ethnically-based elite, despair, hopelessness and fear.  Events 
following the May 2005 elections, including well-documented killing of protesters and 
imprisonment of opposition leaders, have deeply undermined confidence in democratic processes 
and the democratic legitimacy of the current Government.  Many remain in jail awaiting trial on 
charges of &#8220;attempted genocide&#8221; and &#8220;treason&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  They have elaborated a system of citizen report cards to monitor and evaluate the Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development and Poverty Reduction Programme (SDPRP).  The success of the initiative is 
recognized in the Government&#8217;s invitation to PANE to comment on the draft SDPRP II. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>96. It is clear that the continued imprisonment without trial according to international 
standards of opposition leaders, economists, scholars and university students, represents a 
violation of human rights obligations and a breach of trust between Government and citizens.  
Continuation of this situation will contribute to denying the full realization of the admirable 
initiatives represented in the Constitution regarding equal rights among all ethnic groups in 
Ethiopia and consequent recognition and protection of language, cultural and religious rights. 
</p>
<p>97. There is a widespread perception that ethnicity is being manipulated and used as a 
political tool.  While the Government is said to favour and encourage the establishment of 
ethnically-based political parties over multi-ethnic parties, some consider this is a means of 
entrenching ethnic divisions.  In a nation that has faced long and bitter ethnically-based conflict, 
domination by particular ethnic groups, and decades of authoritarian rule, a process of national 
dialogue and reconciliation seems required - one that enables all groups to build confidence in 
democratic processes, to disassociate politics from ethnicity, and to break down the perception 
that independent political opposition equates to armed resistance. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>As a matter of priority the federal Government should: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Take measures to depoliticize ethnicity and promote policies of inclusion, shared 
power and cooperation.  Such measures could include urging political parties to 
develop non-ethnic policies and programmes, opening membership to those of 
different ethnicity and facilitating greater participation and membership of 
women from all ethnic groups; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Treat those political opposition leaders, journalists, students and human rights 
defenders currently detained according to international law and standards of 
fair and speedy trial, and where no evidence exists for conviction release them 
immediately; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Guarantee freedom of opinion, speech and the right of peaceful assembly at all 
times, in accordance with its obligations under international law; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Take urgent and culturally appropriate security measures for all communities in 
high-risk areas, including Gambella State, to ensure protection of all 
communities and to promote the safe return of those who have fled their homes 
or lands due to violence and conflict; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Address the needs of historically marginalized ethnic groups in the least 
developed regions in urgent need of infrastructure, sanitation, health-care 
services, and education facilities, with appropriate resources and development 
policies; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Urgently address ongoing inter-ethnic tensions and conflict with conflict 
prevention and resolution measures.  Community-led conflict prevention and  </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/9/Add.3 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p><b>management initiatives and Government-sponsored initiatives that include 
respect for traditional and customary conflict prevention and resolution 
mechanisms should be encouraged; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that civil society groups are free to function without interference, 
harassment, undue restrictions on their registration, activities, or ability to seek 
and accept funding.  The establishment of civil society groups representing the 
interests of marginalized or disadvantaged communities should be encouraged 
as a means to ensure representation of their issues; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that the activities of the Ethiopian National Defence Forces acting in any 
region are appropriate for and sensitive to local conditions, including in regard 
to their ethnic composition; their distribution and the location of their barracks; 
their duties; and their disciplinary standards.  Military forces should be 
deployed in border areas only and not utilized for policing functions. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Additionally the Government should take the following measures: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>A national conference on the functioning of the system of ethnic federalism 
should be convened, open to the participation of all political parties, regional 
authorities, civil society and nations, nationalities and peoples; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To ensure effective implementation and application of the international human 
rights instruments to which Ethiopia is a party and that are incorporated into 
the federal Constitution, the texts of the treaties should be published in the 
official Gazette.  Awareness-raising and training initiatives should be 
undertaken to educate public officials and the judiciary; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure the independence of judges and lawyers and the impartiality of the 
judiciary.  The right to a speedy trial should be guaranteed in fact as well as in 
law; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Federal authorities must ensure that regional state constitutions and laws 
conform fully with the federal Constitution and with international human rights 
law.  In particular, the activities of regional public bodies, and traditional 
customary and religious courts must be regulated to ensure such compliance; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Without undermining or circumventing the authority or jurisdiction of the 
regional governments, the federal Government should provide enhanced 
assistance, training and support appropriate to ensuring the effective 
functioning of regional authorities; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Make every effort to fulfil its responsibilities to report to United Nations treaty 
monitoring bodies according to the obligations voluntarily undertaken by 
Ethiopia; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/9/Add.3

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Ensuring group survival 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Take urgent steps to protect the existence of some of the small minority groups 
in Ethiopia.  Research should be undertaken into the situation of such 
communities and measures adopted to protect disadvantaged groups and those 
facing external threats to their existence; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Grant land title in recognition of historic usage in order to ensure security of 
land tenure for all communities, including minorities facing encroachment on 
traditional lands.  The recognized system of land tenure should include 
protection of the use of land by pastoralist groups, and recognize individual and 
a variety of collective ownership arrangements; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure that communities are secure from forced displacement or eviction from 
their lands and that measures are undertaken to effectively consult with 
communities regarding decisions that affect them and their respective 
territories.  Communities relocated according to the law must be consulted 
regarding appropriate compensation and relocation arrangements, including 
land of comparable quality.  Communities receiving relocated populations must 
also consent; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Language and culture 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Make available adequate funding and resources to assist teaching of and 
instruction in minority languages in public schools at the regional level.  Such 
mother tongue language provision should be available to all communities, to the 
fullest extent possible;

<p>&#8722; <b>Maintain the principle of free choice in language education, and the opportunity 
to study and be instructed in both the mother tongue and the official national 
working language of Ethiopia (Amharic) at the regional level, to the fullest 
extent possible; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Enhance its efforts to eradicate harmful traditional and cultural practices that 
are contrary to international human rights standards.  In addition to legal 
prohibition, culturally appropriate education and public awareness programmes 
to this end are required;

monitoring and enforcing anti-discrimination legislation, and with the authority 
to receive complaints and issue legally binding decisions in cases of

</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Undertake targeted policy initiatives at the federal and state level to address the 
unique circumstances of multidimensional discrimination experienced by 
minority women due to their gender and their status as members of 
disadvantaged ethnic groups; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Require the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs to undertake a survey in each region 
of the traditional customary and religious laws and practices of all ethnic groups 
that impact on the constitutional guarantee of equality to women; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure, in legislation and in practice, that protection of the property rights of 
women are equal to those of men, including rights to own and inherit property.  
In particular the rights to property of widows, divorced women, and those

</b></p>
<p><b>Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Ensure the representation of smaller and/or migrant communities from other 
states within regional councils, including through constitutional review.  At the
