<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/28, requested the Secretary-General to 
submit a comprehensive report on missing persons before its tenth session. The 
Secretary-General submitted a report dated 18 August 2008 on missing persons to the 
General Assembly (A/63/299). That report covered the thematic subjects of (a) measures to 
prevent persons from going missing; (b) the right of families to know; (c) the use of forensic 
methods and DNA forensic sciences in searching for and identifying missing persons; and 
(d) missing persons and the issue of impunity. The contents of the report were essentially based 
on responses to a note verbale addressed to States and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>2. The General Assembly took note with appreciation of the above-mentioned report and 
adopted resolution 63/183<b> </b>on missing persons without a vote. In the resolution, the Assembly 
called on States parties to an armed conflict to take measures to prevent persons from going 
missing in connection with the conflict and to account for persons reported missing as a result of 
such situations. It also called on those States to determine the identity and fate of persons 
reported missing in connection with the armed conflict and, to the greatest extent possible, 
provide their family members with information on their fate. It urged States to encourage 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to provide appropriate assistance as 
requested by concerned States, and welcomed the establishment and efforts of commissions and 
working groups on missing persons. Without prejudice to States&#8217; efforts to determine the fate of 
missing persons in connection with armed conflicts, the Assembly requested States to take 
appropriate steps in terms of the legal situation of missing persons and the needs of their family 
members. It also stressed the need for the issue of missing persons to be part of peacebuilding 
processes, with reference to all justice and rule of law mechanisms. The Assembly also 
welcomed the panel discussion on the question of missing persons held by the Human Rights 
Council at its ninth session. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  EXPERT PANEL DISCUSSION ON MISSING PERSONS 
</b></p>
<p>3. The present report builds on the developments since the report of the Secretary-General on 
missing persons, submitted to the General Assembly in August 2008, taking into account the 
contents and requests made by the Council in its resolution 7/28. The Council decided, in its 
resolution 7/28, to hold a panel discussion on the question of missing persons and to invite 
prominent experts. The panel discussion was held on 22 September 2008 during the ninth session 
of the Council.  
</p>
<p>4. The panel was composed of Cordula Droege, Legal Adviser, Legal Division of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); Vefaeddin Ibayev, Judge of the Supreme 
Court of Azerbaijan; Karyne Minasyan, Director of the Human Rights Center for Prisoners of 
Wars, Hostages and Missing in Action and Coordinator in Armenia of the International Working 
Group for prisoners of wars, hostages and people missing in action; Marco Sassoli, Professor, 
Geneva Academy on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law; Michel Veuthey, 
Professor and Vice-President of the International Institute of Humanitarian Law (San Remo 
Institute); and Kathryine Bomberger, Director-General of the International Commission on </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Missing Persons. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) was represented by the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights. The panel was 
moderated by the Permanent Representative of Mexico to the United Nations Office and other 
International Organizations in Geneva, Luis Alfonso de Alba. 
</p>
<p>5. The panel&#8217;s main objective was to raise awareness of the issue of persons reported missing 
in connection with armed conflicts, highlighting the human rights aspects and their implications. 
Several important issues were discussed, in particular, the need for all parties to a conflict to 
cooperate with each other and to establish adequate mechanisms, institutions, laws and 
capacities, while taking into account that civil societies, families and supporting associations and 
national human rights commissions have a role to play in these mechanisms and institutions. The 
need to pay special attention to the legal status of the relatives of persons reported missing, in 
particular, on issues relating to their civil status, inheritance or pension rights, and the obligation 
of States to provide necessary assistance to those affected by the issue in order to reintegrate 
them into social life was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>6. The panel also aimed to identify practical recommendations to address the issue of missing 
persons, as well as best practices. A report providing a summary of the contents of the panel 
discussion on the question of missing persons has been submitted to the Council (A/HRC/10/10). 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE RIGHT OF FAMILIES TO KNOW THE FATE OF  
THEIR RELATIVES REPORTED MISSING DURING  
AN ARMED CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p>7. As highlighted during the expert panel discussion, any debate on the issue of missing 
persons should benefit from the conclusions and recommendations of the International 
Conference of Governmental and Non-Governmental Experts, organized in 2003 by ICRC, 
entitled &#8220;The missing: action to resolve the problem of people unaccounted for as a result of 
armed conflict or internal violence and to assist their families&#8221;. The Conference elaborated on 
issues relating to information-management and the processing of files on persons reported 
missing, the management of human remains and support for families. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Information-management and the processing of files 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Conference observed that coordination of the activities of all those involved and the 
sharing of information would increase the effectiveness of any action taken to ascertain the fate 
of unaccounted persons. Measures proposed included ensuring that the information collected on 
persons unaccounted for is comprehensive, yet limited to that which is necessary for the purpose 
identified and is impartially collected and processed; sharing information on the methods and 
objectives of the data collection and processing procedure by those involved; exchanging the 
information collected among those involved, without endangering victims, the persons collecting 
the information or the sources of information; centralizing the information collected to increase 
the possibility of informing the families on the fate of their members; and respecting the relevant 
standards and principles with regard to the protection of personal information whenever 
information, including medical and genetic information, is managed and processed. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>B.  Management of human remains 
</b></p>
<p>9. With regard to the management of human remains and information on the dead, the 
Conference observed that the main responsibility for the proper handling of all the dead and for 
providing information to the families with a view to preventing anxiety and uncertainty lies with 
Government authorities and armed groups. Measures that could be taken include ensuring that all 
feasible steps are taken to identify the human remains of those who died and to record their 
identity; avoiding obstruction of, interference with or impediment to the identification of human 
remains; issuing death certificates; ensuring that all those involved respect the legal rules and 
professional ethics applicable to the management, exhumation and identification of human 
remains; ensuring that forensic specialists, whenever possible follow standard procedures when 
exhuming and identifying human remains; ensuring adequate training for all persons collecting 
information on the dead and handling human remains; and beginning a process of exhumation 
and identification only once a framework has been agreed upon by all those concerned. Such a 
framework includes the establishment of protocols for exhumation; ante-mortem data collection; 
autopsies; identification based on scientifically valid and reliable methods and technologies 
and/or customary, clinical or circumstantial evidence that is deemed appropriate and has been 
previously adopted by the scientific community; and appropriate means of involving 
communities and families in exhumation, autopsy and identification procedures. </p>
<p><b>C.  Support for families 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Conference also recommended that measures to respond to the material, financial, 
psychological and legal needs faced by families awaiting clarification of their family members&#8217; 
fate be taken. Those measures include the provision of targeted assistance with the aim, as soon 
as circumstances allow, of promoting the self-sufficiency of families; addressing the legal 
situation of persons unaccounted for and the consequences for family members, including in 
terms of property administration, guardianship and parental authority; ensuring children receive 
special support and protection and, in particular, taking measures to reunite unaccompanied 
children with their families; ensuring that the needs of single heads of families are given special 
attention, taking into consideration the specific needs faced by women in such situations; 
ensuring that the families of persons unaccounted for benefit from support programmes in order 
to adapt to their situations and come to terms with the events; and psychological support, and, 
whenever necessary and feasible psychiatric treatment, to be provided to those in need. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. MEASURES TO CLARIFY THE IDENTITY AND FATE OF PERSONS 
REPORTED MISSING DURING ARMED CONFLICTS 
</b></p>
<p>11. As highlighted by the Council in its resolution 7/28, necessary measures should be taken, 
in a timely manner, to determine the identity and fate of persons reported missing in connection 
with armed conflict. This responsibility is borne by States authorities and armed groups and 
entails, first of all, a commitment to implement international legal instruments, including the four 
Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto, the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. That commitment could also be demonstrated by the signing and 
ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Tracing activities 
</b></p>
<p>12. Efforts made in this regard by ICRC and the International Commission on Missing Persons 
should be noted. The tracing activities carried out by ICRC during armed conflict and other 
situations of violence include collecting information about people unaccounted for and the 
circumstances under which they disappeared from their families, direct witnesses, the authorities 
and any other reliable sources. This information is crucial when tracing a person and establishing 
his or her fate. Such searches are made in places of detention, camps for internally displaced 
persons and refugees, morgues and remote areas. 
</p>
<p>13. Tracing activities also include supplying the authorities with lists of people unaccounted 
for, together with information on the circumstances in which they disappeared, requesting 
information on the location of graves and asking the authorities to allow for the recovery and 
identification of bodies. The tracing process also involves maintaining a constant dialogue with 
the authorities or armed groups in order to clarify the fate of missing persons. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Collection, protection and management of data on missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>14. In its resolution 7/28, the Council recognized the need for the collection, protection and 
management of credible and reliable data on missing persons according to international and 
national legal norms and standards, and urged States to cooperate with each other and with other 
concerned actors working in this area, inter alia, by providing all relevant and appropriate 
information related to missing persons. In this regard, ICRC manages information and processes 
files on missing persons in many of the situations in which it operates. A standard software 
application that can be adapted to various situations allows ICRC to store, process and consult 
information on missing persons while ensuring a high level of data security and confidentiality 
of information. 
</p>
<p>15. OHCHR is in the process of developing a publication on the subject of human rights and 
archives. In this regard, a draft rule of law tool for post-conflict States on the subject of archives 
has been prepared with a view to its eventual publication. The publication will cover, inter alia, 
issues relating to truth-seeking and the right to know, including information relating to locating 
missing persons. 
</p>
<p>16. Locating missing persons and/or finding information about them requires searches of all 
possible records. Those of local government units, such as the police, are important, as is 
information that can be derived from cemetery and morgue records. The above-mentioned draft 
emphasizes that it is important to hypothesize about what happened to the person before, during 
and after the disappearance; if the working assumption is that the government was responsible 
for the disappearance, which government structure was probably involved at each stage of the 
process and what kinds of records were created should be determined. The draft notes that 
databases developed and maintained by non-government organizations during the conflicts, as 
well as by other organizations, such as ICRC or United Nations organizations, may also contain 
useful leads. 
</p>
<p>17. The issue of data management is also relevant to exhumation projects in the search for 
missing persons. While oral reports may provide information about possible sites of grave or 
mass graves, records of military or other government personnel who may have been assigned to, </p>

 <p></p>
<p>for example, digging graves or who were involved in transportation to or from the site, may also 
provide or corroborate information. The draft notes that, while the identification of remains 
currently tends to be based on DNA testing, medical and dental records are nevertheless helpful 
in the identification of remains of missing persons if there is no known DNA from the missing 
person or there is no living survivor to provide DNA for comparison.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE TO CONCERNED STATES 
</b></p>
<p>18. In its resolution 7/28, the Council urged States and encourages intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations to take all necessary measures at the national, regional and 
international levels to address the problem of persons reported missing in connection with armed 
conflicts and to provide appropriate assistance as requested by the concerned States. In terms of 
provision of appropriate assistance, the model law on missing persons, developed by ICRC, 
offers a framework legislation that is suited and sufficiently extensive to help national authorities 
to bring legislation into line with the requirements of international law. The framework is based 
on principles of international humanitarian law and other branches of international law, and 
international human rights law treaties, applicable in all circumstances. The model law is not 
meant to be exhaustive, but simply to present a framework tool providing the basis for 
identifying the areas in which measures have to be taken. Depending on the context and the 
legislative situation, some of the measures may already have been taken, while others may need 
to be developed. The model law could therefore be used in its entirety or in part by national 
authorities seeking to enhance the legal framework preventing people from going missing and to 
solve the problems of relatives and to uphold their rights. 
</p>
<p>19. The purpose of the model law is to aid in the development of proposals and 
recommendations with the aims of better preventing disappearances and of protecting the rights 
of missing persons and their relatives. References to provisions of international humanitarian law 
are included in an annex to the document. 
</p>
<p>20. The model law is accompanied by an article by article commentary to help the lawmaker in 
his work. As with any framework legislation or proposal for action, adjustments will need to be 
made in accordance with national needs. The model law proposal is organized into a number of 
chapters, covering the following areas: 
</p>
<p> (a) General provisions, which include the objective of the legislation and definitions of 
terms, such as missing person and relative of the missing person; 
</p>
<p> (b) Basic rights and measures relating to the rights of persons deprived of their liberty, 
the rights of relatives of persons deprived of their liberty and the rights of relatives to know what 
happened to the missing person; 
</p>
<p> (c) The legal status of missing persons and the rights associated thereto, issues involved 
in declaring a person to be missing, the rights of relatives in terms of civil status and any 
entitlement to financial assistance or social benefits; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  See also A/63/299, sect. IV. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p> (d) Issues relating to the tracing of missing persons, provisions pertaining to the issuing 
of identity cards or similar documents, determining the authority in charge of tracing missing 
persons, setting up a national information bureau to work with the national missing persons 
authority and the registry of information on missing persons, submitting tracing requests, 
beginning and ending tracing, access to information on missing persons and protecting data; 
</p>
<p> (e) The rights of the deceased, covering such matters as the obligation to search for and 
recover the dead, the registration of deaths, the handling of mortal remains, burials and 
exhumations, and the handling of unidentified remains; 
</p>
<p> (f) A chapter on criminal liability setting out the acts that must be recognized as 
criminal offences under national legislation, and a mechanism for prosecutions; 
</p>
<p> (g) A section devoted to specifying the authority in charge and another to final 
provisions. 
</p>
<p>21. The model legislation comprises 27 articles accompanied by commentaries and 
three annexes: a model certificate of absence, a model certificate of death, and references to 
provisions of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to assistance to States, the Secretariat of the Directorate General of Human 
Rights and Legal Affairs of the Council of Europe has produced a draft recommendation on 
principles concerning missing persons and the presumption of death, according to which, a fair 
balance must be struck between the interests of missing persons and of those left behind as well 
as others with a legitimate interest, particularly with regard to the latter&#8217;s legitimate interests 
relating to property and inheritance rights, pension and life insurance rights, the right to enter 
into a new union (marriage, registered partnership or similar union), parentage and parental 
rights, and so on. Furthermore, the introduction of the concepts of disappearance and of 
presumption of death or, as the case may be, the improvement of the existing legislation on this 
topic, is considered to be of great benefit, in particular for family members who are left behind, 
as it would clarify their legal position and status. 
</p>
<p>23. According to the Council of Europe draft recommendation, death is the precondition for 
the application of the law of succession, for the existence of an inheritance, a testator and an heir, 
and also for the payment of a survivor&#8217;s pension or a life insurance policy. Death also 
automatically terminates marriage (including registered partnerships or similar unions in some 
Member States) and the corresponding system of marital/partnership property, enabling the 
survivor to enter into a new relationship without any risk of bigamy. 
</p>
<p>24. The draft recommendation aims at providing Governments of Member States with 
assistance in dealing with cases of missing persons. The text is without prejudice to legal 
obligations of Member States under international humanitarian law or international human rights 
law and should not be construed as a pretext for easily declaring someone dead. Its principles 
could be of use in a post-conflict situation, particularly for those with a legitimate interest in 
declaring someone dead. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b>VI. RECENT MEASURES TO ADDRESS THE  
PROBLEM OF MISSING PERSONS 
</b></p>
<p>25. In its resolution 7/28, the Council urged States and encourages intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations to take all necessary measures at the national, regional and 
international levels to address the problem of persons reported missing in connection with armed 
conflicts and to provide appropriate assistance as requested by the concerned States. Although a 
great deal of information in this regard is contained in the report of the Secretary-General on 
missing persons (A/63/299), there have been subsequent developments. 
</p>
<p>26. In Nepal, on the International Day of the Disappeared on 30 August 2008, ICRC and the 
Nepal Red Cross Society published the names of more than 1,200 people reported missing by 
their relatives between 1996 and 2006. ICRC appealed to the Government of Nepal to clarify the 
fate of those who went missing during the country&#8217;s 10-year armed conflict. In February 2007, 
ICRC published a list of 812 names of missing persons, which resulted in 33 families learning 
the fate of their loved ones. It also organized two seminars, beginning on 14 December 2008 at 
the Institute of Medicine in Kathmandu, to enhance forensic skills for the accurate identification 
of human remains. 
</p>
<p>27. On 3 October 2008, ICRC and the State Commission on Prisoners of War, Hostages and 
Missing Persons of Armenia signed a framework agreement to help clarify the fate of thousands 
of people who went missing in connection with the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The agreement 
will provide a basis for the collection of detailed data on the missing persons from their families. 
Ante-mortem data typically include photographs and details of the physical characteristics of 
missing persons, as well as personal effects and clothing they may have been wearing at the time 
of their disappearance. The information is transmitted to the authorities to assist with future 
identification of remains. Similar agreements were signed, in April 2008 with the State 
Commission on Prisoners of War, Hostages and Missing Persons of Azerbaijan, and with an 
equivalent body in Nagorny Karabakh, on 20 October 2008. It has been estimated that more 
than 4,000 families are still waiting for news of relatives missing in connection with the 
Nagorny Karabakh conflict. 
</p>
<p>28. On 16 October 2008, ICRC reported that a memorandum of understanding aimed at 
clarifying the fate of persons reported missing in connection with the 1980-1988 war had been 
signed by the Government of Iraq, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and ICRC. 
Although both Governments had already attempted to determine what happened to those still 
unaccounted for, it was the first time a document of this nature was signed by both countries 
with ICRC. The document establishes a clear framework for collecting information and for 
sharing it between the two countries, and for handing over mortal remains, tasks to be performed 
by experts from both countries with the support of ICRC. Following the signature of the 
memorandum on 16 October 2008, 41 Iranian human remains in Iraq and 200 Iraqi human 
remains in Iran were transferred to their respective homelands on 30 November 2008. 
</p>
<p>29. Since the beginning of the conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation in 
August 2008, ICRC has been providing assistance to approximately 500 people who have  </p>
<p>approached it in Tblisi, seeking its help in searching for missing relatives. In October 2008, 
ICRC continued to receive tracing requests from people trying to locate missing family 
members. It reported some progress in its efforts; from 30 August to December 2008, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>over 300 individuals had been reunited with their loved ones, in the Tbilisi, Gori and Tskhinvali 
areas. No progress was made during the period in solving the fate of 2,250 missing persons since 
the previous conflicts in Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia). 
</p>
<p>30. On 9 December 2008, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ICRC and the Red Cross 
Society launched a campaign to speed up the identification of children separated from their 
parents and to facilitate family reunification. The head of the ICRC Central Tracing Agency for 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that the initial results had been positive. The 
efforts were in response to concerns that, among the 250,000 persons displaced in North Kivu as 
a result of the fighting there since August 2008, many children could have been separated from 
their parents. ICRC reported that it had registered 134 children since the end of October 2008, 
but expressed concern that the actual number could be considerably higher. The vast Red Cross 
network is being used in the country both to register stranded children and to receive the tracing 
requests of families having lost contact with their children. The details are then broadcast 
throughout North Kivu on four local radio stations, three times a day. Explanatory posters are 
displayed in Red Cross offices in the field and in various public places to inform families about 
the service. In addition, ICRC displays photographs of lost children in areas with a high 
concentration of displaced people, such as schools, churches and childcare centres, as well as 
camps for the displaced. 
</p>
<p>31. ICRC also reported that the International Tracing Service, which opened its archives 
of 50 million documents on Nazi persecution to the public in November 2007, had, as at 
November 2008, received 1,<footnote name="3">8. A study published in 2006 in the International Review of the Red Cross entitled &#8220;The 
missing and transitional justice: the right to know and the fight against impunity&#8221;, could 
constitute a useful basis for an analysis of the relationships between the issues of missing persons 
and transitional justice. The study looks at the ways in which transitional justice mechanisms 
may support the right of families to know the fate of their relatives, and how the issue of missing 
persons can be reconciled with an effective fight against impunity. The study concludes that 
clarification of the fate of persons unaccounted for, as a result of an armed conflict or other 
situations of violence, is an important issue that needs to be considered in any multidimensional 
and multi-stakeholder effort to address societies in transition. When peace or other settlements 
are negotiated, they should receive at least as much attention as other issues, such as refugees 
and displaced persons, land and property, or human rights and conflict resolution, in parties&#8217; 
efforts to repair their past. The opening of mass graves, the identification of bodies, the 
establishment of the circumstances that led to death and clarification of the facts are all necessary 
steps for families to complete their mourning process, for victims to obtain reparation and, in the 
long term, for peoples and communities to come to terms with their past and move forward in 
peace. </footnote>00 visitors from 24 countries, including 330 researchers, 
100 journalists and 290 victims of Nazi persecution and members of their families. It was also 
reported that the Service, located in Bad Arolsen in Germany, had in the same period received a 
total of 11,<footnote name="3">7. On the issue of impunity, the International Commission on Missing Persons suggests that 
the human rights, rule of law and transitional justice dimensions of the missing persons issue be 
taken into account more fully. In this regard, the Commission cooperates with national and 
international criminal tribunals through regular progress updates and, if requested, by written 
depositions and testimony, in certain cases. The Commission&#8217;s assistance in judicial proceedings 
is subject to data protection and other procedural safeguards. It also provides seminars and 
presentations on its work to investigators, prosecutors and judges to inform them of the 
assistance it provides to Governments on the issue of missing persons, and on how that 
assistance can contribute to the process of criminal justice in the field of war crimes, crimes 
against humanity and genocide. The last such event was held on 18 December 2008.

Service is governed by the 11-nation International Commission for the International Tracing 
Service under the 1955 Bonn Agreements and the amendments thereto of 2006. ICRC manages 
the Service on behalf of the International Commission, serving victims and families. 
</p>
<p>32. ICRC is also working jointly with the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on a manual 
designed for parliamentarians for the implementation of the resolution adopted by IPU at 
its 115th Assembly on Missing Persons. 
</p>
<p>33. ICRC also organized the first and second meetings of medico-legal institutes from the 
Iberoamerican and the Asia-Pacific regions respectively, to promote communication, 
coordination and cooperation between those institutions for improved management and 
identification of human remains, including for disaster response. The meetings were organized 
jointly with medico-legal institutes of Peru and of Melbourne, Australia, respectively. 
34. The International Commission on Missing Persons hosted a conference in Belgrade 
from 28 to 30 November 2008, where more than 100 representatives of associations of families 
of missing persons, Government institutions from the region, and parliamentarians and human 
rights organizations met to discuss issues pertinent to determining the fate of missing persons 
from the armed conflicts of the 1990s in South-East Europe. It was estimated that over 
17,000 persons are still missing from these armed conflicts. Key conclusions from the 
conference included a call for Governments in the region to ratify the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to sign agreements on the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>exchange of information concerning missing persons and to cooperate in the search for them; for 
prosecutors and courts at all levels in countries in the region, to do their utmost to ascertain the 
whereabouts of mass graves; that the removal of human remains from a primary clandestine 
burial site to a secondary one be made an indictable offence; and that the protection of witnesses 
at all stages of any investigation be ensured. 
</p>
<p>35. The Commission also received a high-level delegation of 19 experts working on the 
issue of enforced disappearances in Colombia at its headquarters in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
from 20 to 25 November 2008. The Colombian delegation attended presentations relating to the 
Commission&#8217;s experiences and expertise in strengthening institutional capacity, creating viable 
legislation and enhancing the technical means to locate, recover and identify missing persons. It 
also stressed the importance of including civil society in all aspects of the process and ensuring 
that family associations of missing persons are fully informed. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  MISSING PERSONS AND THE RULE OF LAW 
</b></p>
<p>36. In its resolution 63/183, the General Assembly stressed the need to address the issue of 
missing persons as part of peacebuilding processes, with reference to all justice and rule of law 
mechanisms, on the basis of transparency, accountability and public involvement and 
participation. 
</p>
 <p></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. In order to deal properly with the issue of missing persons, the various bodies and 
institutions involved in transitional justice should endeavour to cooperate. Ad hoc international 
tribunals or truth and reconciliation commissions, which have a limited lifespan, should give 
thought from the outset to means and methods of gathering and classifying information and 
evidence that could make it readily exploitable for both judicial proceedings and attempts to 
trace the missing. They should allow for effective and practical means of passing on their legacy 
once their work has ended, and in particular give families and their representatives access to their 
archives. Similarly, forensic activities deployed by international tribunals should be carried out 
not only for the purposes of collecting evidence with criminal prosecution in mind, but also to 
find answers for the families of missing persons. Finally, national authorities should be 
encouraged and supported through capacity-building initiatives in their resolve to address 
genuinely the issue of missing persons and thus comply with the requirements of international 
humanitarian law. Only then can there be hope that families will finally fulfil their right to know 
the fate of missing relatives and receive appropriate reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>It is essential that additional measures be taken by States, intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations to prevent persons from going missing, to establish the 
right to know, collect, protect and manage credible and reliable data on missing persons, to 
develop their forensic science capacities and to address impunity. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The issue of missing persons is particularly severe in the context of armed conflict. 
Measures should be taken to minimize this phenomenon, which should be addressed at the 
national, regional and international levels, as well as in peacebuilding processes, with 
reference to all justice and rule of law mechanisms, including the judiciary, parliamentary 
commissions and truth-seeking mechanisms, on the basis of transparency, accountability 
and public involvement and participation. 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The right of families to know the fate of missing persons should be respected at all 
times. Such families, victims groups and civil society should be involved in mechanisms or 
institutions aiming at solving issues related to missing persons. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>Support should be provided for forensic sciences as a component in investigations of 
human rights violations. Access to independent forensic investigations of violations of 
human rights and humanitarian law should also be improved. Appropriate mechanisms 
should be created to continue the recovery and identification process beyond the mandate 
of judicial and non-judicial mechanisms. 
</b>44. <b>Contacts between independent forensic experts and judges, prosecutors and lawyers 
should be enhanced. Technical assistance and training of forensic experts in States where 
this expertise is not available or not developed sufficiently should be increased. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>The collection, protection and management of credible and reliable data on missing 
persons, in accordance with international and national standards, should be encouraged, 
and technical assistance and training should be made available as needed.
