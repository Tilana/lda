NATURAL RESOURCE PARTNERS L.P.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
The historical information for Natural Resource Partners L.P. (the "Partnership" or "NRP") is
derived from the historical financial statements of the Partnership. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 is presented to illustrate the estimated
effects of selling the Partnership's non-operated oil and gas working interest assets to Lime Rock
Resources IV-A, L.P. ("Lime Rock") as if the transaction had occurred on March 31, 2016. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income are presented for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as if the
sale transaction had occurred at January 1, 2013, the beginning of the earliest period presented.
 
The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions management
believes are factually supportable and for income statement purposes are recurring in
•
nature. The pro forma adjustments to reflect the sale of the Partnership's non-operated oil and
gas working interest assets to Lime Rock include:
the associated assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses associated with the assets sold to Lime
Rock;
collection of anticipated cash proceeds in the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance
sheet as if the sale had occurred on March 31, 2016, net of transaction fees; and
the costs of effecting the sale of assets to Lime Rock that are factually supportable (primarily
legal and lender fees).
•
•
Note 2. Adjustments to Pro Forma Financial Statements
Reclassification adjustments reflect prior period amounts that have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on the
Partnership’s overall consolidated financial statements.
The following pro forma adjustments are based on our preliminary estimates and assumptions
that are subject to change:
(1)
(2)
(a)
Reflects $116.1 million of gross sales proceeds less $75.0 million cash used to pay off the
NRP Oil and Gas RBL Facility in full and less $0.5 million cash used to pay accrued
interest on the RBL Facility, legal costs and lender fees directly related to the sale
transaction.
(b)Reflects the assets to be acquired by Lime Rock.
(c)
(d)
Reflects accrued interest related to the RBL Facility paid using a portion of the proceeds
from the asset sale as well as removal of short-term asset retirement obligations assumed
by Lime Rock.
Reflects the payment in full of the NRP Oil and Gas RBL Facility using a portion of asset
sale proceeds, partially offset by the write off of the associated debt issuance costs. The
RBL Facility was secured by a first priority lien and security interest in the non operated oil
and gas working interest assets and NRP Oil and Gas was required to use the net proceeds
of any asset sale to repay the RBL Facility.
(e)Reflects removal of long-term asset retirement obligations assumed by Lime Rock.
(f) Reflects the estimated net gain on asset sale had the transaction closed on March 31, 2016.
Reflects the removal of revenue and costs directly associated with the non-operated oil and
gas working interests assets sold to Lime Rock.
