SANDSTONE EXPLORATION UPDATE
Induced  Polarisation  (IP)  surveys  to  better  define  drill  targets  associated 
with known unmined gold mineralisation to commence in early September 
Lord  Nelson  mineral  resource  [JORC  2012  compliant]  being  estimated  by 
Snowdens  
Tenements expected to be granted on or about 18 September 2016 
Planned  Programs  of  Work  (PoW)  for  follow  up  drill  testing  of  prospects 
with  known  high  grade  gold  mineralisation  to  be  lodged  after  grant  of 
tenements 
RC drilling to commence mid-October following approval of PoW’s by DMP
SANDSTONE 2016 INDUCED POLARISATION SURVEY  
The  Company  has  now  planned  IP  surveys  over  areas  of  gold  mineralisation  identified  in 
historical wide spaced drilling, to better define and extend targets for drill testing in the oxidised 
and primary (fresh – sulphide) zones. 
This work is based on a review of historical IP data collected by Troy Resources NL (2004/2005) 
and  Western  Areas  NL  (2011)  which  shows  gold  mineralisation  to  be  associated  with 
chargeability  and resisitivity  (“high”)  anomalism.    The data  showed that  IP  can  used to detect 
both oxide and primary mineralisation.  The known gold mineralisation at Lord Nelson and Lord 
Henry is associated with zones of high resistivity and chargeability values.   
The  proposed  IP  surveys  are  is  shown  in  Figure  1  overleaf.    A  total  of  27  lines  (61  km)  100m 
dipole-dipole are planned.   
Priority areas are Lord Henry and Lady Hamilton.  The Lord Henry area includes surveying at the 
Lord Henry deposits and the Horatio, Maninga Marley and Havilah prospects.  The Lady Hamilton 
area includes Indomitable (north and south), Tigermoth, Piper and Musketeer (north and south).   
IP  is  also  planned  over  gold  mineralisation  at  the  Vanguard,  Ladybird  and  Sandstone  North 
prospects. 
In 2011 IP data was collected by Western Areas to identify anomalous chargeable sources which 
may be associated with accumulations of matrix to disseminated nickel sulphide mineralisation.  
This data was not used to target gold mineralisation.  
Alto  has  reviewed  this  data  and  has  completed  2D  inversion  modelling,  and  has  identified  a 
number  of  new  target  areas  and  extensions  to  known  mineralisation,  that  are  considered 
prospective for both oxide and primary gold mineralisation.  This work is on-going.

Figure  2  below  shows  depth  slice  of  the  2D  model  chargeability  (350m  RL)  which  highlights 
primary  mineralisation  targets  in  the  basement north  and  south  of  Lord  Nelson,  and  north  of 
Lord  Henry,  plus other targets.   The  red  colours  represent  areas  of high  chargeability and  the 
blue areas represent areas of low chargeability.   
Target areas are shown in black ovals.  These targets also have associated higher resistivity.

Competent Person statement 
 
All geophysical exploration data referred to in this Report were previously reported by Troy Resources NL pursuant to 
JORC 2004. Alto Metals Limited understands that this information has not been updated since to comply with the 
JORC Code 2012, but believes the information has not materially changed since it was last reported. 
 
The  information  in  this  report  that  relates  to  interpretation  of  Geophysical  Exploration  Results  is  based  on 
information compiled by Mr William Robertson, who is an employee of Value Adding Resources Pty Ltd and a Director 
and  security  holder  of  the  Company.   Mr  Robertson  is  a  member  of  the  Australian  Society  of  Exploration 
Geophysicists  and  has  sufficient  experience  of  relevance  to  the  styles  of  mineralisation  and  the  types  of  deposits 
under consideration, and activities undertaken, to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of 
the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources 
and Ore Reserves.  Mr Robertson consents to the inclusion in the report of matters based on information in the form 
and context in which it appears.
