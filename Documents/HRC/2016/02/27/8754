<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventh 
session from 8 February to 19 February 2010.  The review of Egypt was held at the 15th

Minister of State for legal and Parliamentary Councils. At its 17th meeting held on 19 
February 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Egypt. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Egypt: China, Italy, Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation, Mufid Shihab, Minister of State for Legal and Parliamentary 
Councils, reaffirmed the high appreciation of Egypt for the universal periodic review and 
its confidence in its value. The Egyptian national report was prepared through an integrated 
institutional process and a widespread consultation with the civil society, which is due to 
continue after the review. 
</p>
<p>6. The Constitution contained the fundamental rights of citizens which are inderogable 
and set the principle that sovereignty lies solely with the people. The multiparty system was 
introduced in 1981 and the president is elected through direct elections among multiple 
candidates. 
</p>
<p>7. International human rights conventions, most of them having been ratified by Egypt, 
constituted an essential element of the legislative framework. Periodic reviews were being 
undertaken to review the very few reservations made upon ratification. 
</p>
<p>8. The judiciary was considered the most effective mechanism to protect human rights, 
such as the State Council and the supreme constitutional court. 
</p>
<p>9. Egypt attached special importance to human rights monitoring mechanism, as 
demonstrated by the recent submission of various national reports to treaty bodies and the 
visit to Egypt of several Special Rapporteurs. </p>


<p>10. In 2007, the Constitution was amended to further strengthen the notion of 
citizenship, as the only source for the enjoyment of citizens of their rights without 
discrimination. Egypt mentioned the numbers of torture cases brought to justice. Police 
staff received human rights training during initial trainings and periodically thereafter. 
</p>
<p>11. Freedom of opinion and expression was constitutionally guaranteed and has been 
widened over recent years. There was no censorship or liability, except as provided by law. 
Freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Constitution and was not limited by law. 
Personal status was ruled by provisions related to the religion of each individual. Freedom 
of worship was guaranteed as demonstrated by the construction/reconstruction, repair of 
many churches over recent years. 
</p>
<p>12. Economic, social and cultural rights enjoyed a high priority and Egypt developed 
plans and policies notably relating to the rights to food, to adequate housing, and to access 
to social services. Regarding the right to health, Egypt notably doubled public spending on 
health and a draft law for health insurance for all was under preparation. Access to drinking 
water is guaranteed to all Egyptian cities. Egypt is committed to provide free education at 
basic and higher education. 
</p>
<p>13. Women&#8217;s empowerment was enhanced through a law allocating 64 seats at least in 
the People&#8217;s Assembly. Egypt was also able to take significant steps towards eradicating 
female genital mutilation including by criminalizing it. Trials had already started for those 
involved in trafficking in persons and a draft law to combat this phenomenon was currently 
discussed. 
</p>
<p>14. Egypt responded to some advance questions. It recalled that the state of emergency 
was established in 1981 after President Sadat&#8217;s assassination, followed by further 
assassinations and, more recently, by terrorist operations against foreigners. The President 
pledged to lift it as soon as the new anti-terrorism law will be adopted. The new law will 
strike the balance between human rights and security imperatives. 
</p>
<p>15. Recently only very few civilians were referred to military or emergency courts and 
the normal criminal code was applied. These courts did not present substantive differences 
with civil courts. 
</p>
<p>16. In answering advance questions, the Egyptian delegation said that the ratification of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Torture raises legal issues, as the legislation 
limits the right to visit detention centres to public prosecutors. Egypt was ready however to 
reconsider this issue in the future. 
</p>
<p>17. Human rights training was provided to 16000 administration of justice officials 
during the four past years within the framework of a capacity building programme. 
</p>
<p>18. Over decades, relations between Muslims and Copts have been healthy and positive. 
Recent tensions were mainly associated to radicalism and extremism and Egypt was 
looking at their reasons. Whenever violent incidents occur, the law is to implemented in 
full. 
</p>
<p>19. Egypt witnessed in the recent years an unprecedented increase in the freedom of 
expression. In 2006, penalty of imprisonment was repealed for a large number of 
publication offences and consideration was currently given to the remaining ones. 
</p>
<p>20. Monitoring of elections was performed by the judiciary and the civil society. The 
latter played an important role in the 2005 elections and will do so for the 2010 and 2011 
elections. 
</p>
<p>21. Since the adoption of the Code of conduct for Special Procedures, Egypt 
demonstrated its willingness to cooperate more with them and did not exclude addressing a 
standing invitation to them in the future. </p>


<p>22. Egypt provided examples of many judgments protecting human rights. Civil society 
organisations were partners of the State in promoting human rights, as demonstrated during 
the consultation process within the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>23. Egypt had about 4 millions refugees on its territory. They are granted full right of 
asylum, a situation that UNHCR commended. The situation of illegal migrants who 
infiltrate Egypt to enter Israel was very sensitive. Self defence and proportionality were 
duly considered by law enforcement officials while protecting this border. 
</p>
<p>24. Egypt withdrew its reservation on article 9(2) of the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and has taken the necessary steps to seek 
the withdrawal of its general reservation, while that on article 16 is requested due to 
national law. In the past decade, Egypt has disseminated information on violence against 
women and has notably developed many programmes and drafted a law on sexual 
harassment. Egypt recalled that many women are in senior position in the civil service. 
</p>
<p>25. The death sentence only applied for very serious crimes and there had been a 
reduction of cases where it was issued and applied. In the past 20 years, there have been 
only 18 cases of enforced disappearances and there has been full cooperation with the 
relevant UN Working Group. 
</p>
<p>26. The Law of civil society organisations is under revision in order to reduce the role of 
administration and give them greater independence. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 53 delegations made statements. Additional 
statements by 44 countries that could not be delivered during the dialogue owing to time 
constraints are posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when available.1 A 
number of delegations commended Egypt for its active participation in and commitment to

promotion and protection and the legislative reforms undertaken were also commended. 
The establishment, active functioning, and numerous efforts of the National Council for 
Women, the National Council for Human Rights and the National Council for Childhood 
and Motherhood were particularly welcomed by many delegations. Egypt&#8217;s continuous 
efforts in the area of the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights were 
praised by a number of countries. Steps undertaken to combat female genital mutilation and 
to mainstream gender budgeting in economic and social development plans were 
particularly welcomed. Also achievements accomplished by Egypt in the domain of social, 
economic and cultural rights, especially with regard to the right to health, education and 
access to safe drinking water, were highlighted and appreciated. Egypt&#8217;s active role in the 
Human Rights Council and its constructive engagement with the United Nations human

assassinations and terrorist attacks, emphasizing that it was only applied in relation to 
terrorism and drug related crimes and within the framework of constitutional guarantees.  In </p>


<p>preparation for repealing the emergency laws, Egypt was in the process of elaborating a 
counter-terrorism law, which would provide for a limited number of exceptional measures,
