  1P Reserves of 3.8 mmboe as at 1 July, 2016 
 
  Net Present Value (NPV10) for 1P Reserves of US$29.2m
AusTex Oil Limited (ASX: AOK, OTCQX: ATXDY, AusTex or the Company), is pleased to provide 
shareholders  with  a  summary  of  its  independent  half-year  reserves  estimates.  The 
independent reserves estimates were evaluated and prepared by Pinnacle Energy Services LLC 
in Oklahoma City in the United States. 
 
The NPV10 for 1P Reserves is US$29.281m, based on the July 1st, 2016 NYMEX strip pricing. 
These  reserves  are  consistent  with  the  Reserves  Reports  since  at  least  early  2015,  with  a 
number  of  contributing  factors  which  have  again  caused  the  Company’s  reserves  to 
moderately decline since those reported on March 1st of this year. Some of these factors are 
merely notional factors and not indicative of the geology of the Company’s acreage but a result 
of low oil prices. These include: 
 

A  sustained  low  oil  price  environment  which  impacts  the  profitability  of  all  future 
unhedged sales; 
Lower oil and natural gas  price projections  which  means that, for the purposes  of 
assessing reserves, wells are notionally taken to reach the end of their economic life 
earlier than in a higher priced environment; 
Notwithstanding the Company’s significant reduction in non-essential field staff and 
other  cost  reduction  efforts  in  the  field,  there  is  a  deemed  increase  in  Lease 
Operating Expenses (LOE) as the fixed and partially variable costs of operating are 
spread  over  fewer  barrels,  thereby  shortening  the  reserve  life  and  reducing  the 
apparent economic value per well; 
The fact that only one new well was drilled since the last Reserve Report in March 
means there is limited new well data that could be used to support a more robust 
assessment of proved undeveloped reserve locations;  
Moreover,  the  natural  decline  of  our  existing  wells  is  intentionally  being  allowed 
without an effort to replace that with new drilling in order to conserve our oil in place, 
and as a result, the natural declines in our producing reserves should be expected; 
Proved but Undeveloped reserve locations are evaluated at the July 1st strip pricing 
without any consideration for the Company’s strong hedge position, and 
There  has  once  again  been  no  assessment  of  any  2P  reserves  due  to  current  oil 
economics.

At current oil prices, there is  only residual economic value in the Sweet Prospect area near 
Tulsa in Oklahoma of US$48,000 (refer table 3) and in Kansas of US$326,000 (refer table 4).  
The Company’s strategy over the past two and a half years has been to focus on Snake River 
and allow its acreage in Kansas to expire where not currently held by production. The purpose 
of  showing  the  reserves  for  all  3  areas  is  to  highlight  the  embedded  value  in  Snake  River 
compared to Kansas and other areas around Tulsa in Oklahoma which are not the Company’s 
operational or strategic focus. 
 
Executive Commentary 
 
Co-Managing Director, Richard Adrey, commented:  
 
“As the Company has witnessed over the past 18 months, there remain a number of significant 
and sustained headwinds which have not abated in recent times and need to be considered in 
the assessment undertaken by the independent Reserve Engineer. It is of no surprise that, while
the oil price environment over the past 6 months has not been as harsh as the 12 months’ prior, the continued decline in oil and gas 
prices has had a moderately detrimental impact on our Company’s reserves.  
 
“Many of these factors are macro in nature, not reflective of the Company’s geology and, we believe, largely temporary.  We do not 
believe prices for oil and gas can last at the depressed levels predicted in our reserve report for years to come.  While we cannot 
predict the timing of a recovery, we do believe the full-cycle cost of a marginal barrel of oil in the US is meaningfully above current 
spot pricing, which suggests that over time the market should return to balance. 
 
“We remain confident in the embedded value of our assets at Snake River and will continue with our current strategy to operate as 
an efficient allocator of capital, to limit our production and to rely on our strong balance sheet for value accretive opportunities when 
they arise. We are confident that these factors will continue to position AusTex well in circumstances that are currently unfavourable 
for many less well positioned oil and gas producers.”

Based on an evaluation of actual oil prices received by the Company from January 2016 to June 2016, differentials to NYMEX prices 
were applied to each lease. The calculated oil price differential was $(2.43) per barrel and the calculated gas price differential was -
14% per mcf. These differentials were used for all Proven Undeveloped locations.
Taxes  
 
Oklahoma severance tax rate used for existing producing wells is 7.095% for both oil and gas. All new wells drilled in Oklahoma have 
a severance tax of 2% for 36 months which increases to 7.095% thereafter. Kansas severance taxes used are 4.33% for both oil and 
gas. Any ad valorem tax is assumed to be included in lease operating expenses. 
 
Expenses 
 
Fixed operating expenses of $594/well/month and variable expenses of $7.67/Bbl oil produced are being used for Snake River. For 
the  Sweet  Prospect  area,  fixed  operating  expenses  being  used  are  $313/well/month  with  variable  expenses  of  $32.87/Bbl  oil 
produced. In the Kansas Prospect area, fixed operating expenses are $172/well/month and variable expenses are $21.81/Bbl oil 
produced. Capital expenditures used for future wells is $475,000 per well which includes costs for drilling the required saltwater 
disposal wells. 
 
Future Development Timeline 
 
Future wells were assumed to be drilled one well per month starting in June 2017. All Proven Undeveloped locations will be drilled 
by April 2019. 
 
Methodology and Assumptions 
 
Information  used  in  the  report  was  provided  by  AusTex  Oil  Limited’s  US  based  subsidiary  entities  and  supplemented  by  data 
gathered from public sources. The evaluation was performed using SEC reserve standards and the NYMEX strip pricing as of 1 July, 
2016 and includes 61 PDP properties, 9 PNP properties and 23 PUD locations.
