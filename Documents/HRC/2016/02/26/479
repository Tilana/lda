<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/31, 
</p>
<p>in which the Council called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>The Council recalled in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which it 
</p>
<p>decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
</p>
<p>administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and without international 
</p>
<p>legal effect, and demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 25/31, the Human Rights Council also requested the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>to bring the resolution to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations 
</p>
<p>organs, specialized agencies, international and regional intergovernmental organizations 
</p>
<p>and international humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it as widely as possible and to 
</p>
<p>report thereon to the Council at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 25/31 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 3 September 2014, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR), on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note verbale to 
</p>
<p>the Government of Israel referring to Human Rights Council resolution 25/31 and 
</p>
<p>requesting information on any steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the said resolution. No reply was received.  
</p>
<p>4. On the same day, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note 
</p>
<p>verbale to all permanent missions in Geneva to draw their attention to Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 25/31 and to request the Governments of Member States to provide 
</p>
<p>information on any steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the relevant provisions of the resolution. The permanent missions of the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic, Cuba and Denmark responded by means of notes verbales to that request. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition, on behalf of the Secretary-General, OHCHR, pursuant to the request of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council, brought resolution 25/31 to the attention of the competent 
</p>
<p>United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international and regional intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and international humanitarian organizations. No reply was received. 
</p>
<p>6. In a note verbale dated 16 October 2014, the Syrian Arab Republic referred to the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;continuing illegal occupation of the Syrian Golan by Israel&#8221;. According to the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic, Israel continued to build illegal settlements, confiscate land owned by Syrian 
</p>
<p>citizens, prevent the reunification of Syrian families and illegally explore and exploit 
</p>
<p>natural resources, including water, gas and oil resources by Israeli and foreign-owned 
</p>
<p>companies such as Genie Energy, as well as its ill-treatment of Syrian prisoners illegally 
</p>
<p>held in Israeli jails.  
</p>
<p>7. According to the Syrian Arab Republic, the Israeli occupying authority in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan, represented by the Israel Land Administration, did not allow the 
</p>
<p>issuance of building permits for Syrian citizens in the village of Masa&#8217;da to build homes on 
</p>
<p>their ancestral properties, but also confiscated parts of this land. In addition, the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic stated that the Israeli occupying authority continued to harass owners of the 
</p>
<p>land comprising collectively owned plots of 354 <i>dunums</i> legally registered by the relevant 
</p>
<p>Syrian authorities in 1946. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that the Israeli occupying 
</p>
<p>authority had brought illegally more than 90 Syrian citizens to court in the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan under the pretext that they had not received proper building permits, which the 
</p>
<p>Israeli authorities refused to grant. </p>


<p>8. In its response, the Syrian Arab Republic condemned the continued violation of the 
</p>
<p>cultural rights of Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan. It stated that the Israeli 
</p>
<p>authorities of occupation had recently organized its third archaeological conference in the 
</p>
<p>Israeli illegal settlement of &#8220;Katzrin&#8221; in the occupied Syrian Golan on the theme &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>Golan and Galilee, the nucleus for settlements&#8221;, which concluded that the preservation of a 
</p>
<p>Jewish presence in the Golan depended on the &#8220;excavation of ancient Jewish history&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>According to the Syrian Arab Republic, the conference and similar activities were used as a 
</p>
<p>pretext to erase Syrian and Arab culture in the occupied Syrian Golan by falsifying facts 
</p>
<p>about archaeological findings. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that a case in point was the 
</p>
<p>attempt to erase the identity of the Syrian village of Um al Qanater in the south of the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan by illegally changing its name to &#8220;Kshatot Rehavam&#8221;, and had 
</p>
<p>issued in April 2014 an Israeli stamp with the Israeli name illegally given to the village. 
</p>
<p>9. The Syrian Arab Republic condemned Israel, as the occupying Power, for illegally 
</p>
<p>imposing its law, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, and for 
</p>
<p>disregarding all relevant United Nations resolutions pertaining to the illegal occupation of 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Golan. 
</p>
<p>10. The Permanent Mission of Denmark, in a note verbale dated 17 September 2014, 
</p>
<p>stated that the Government of Denmark was pursuing a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-
</p>
<p>Arab conflict, including between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic. The conflict 
</p>
<p>contributed to the destabilization of the overall security situation in the Middle East and had 
</p>
<p>to be resolved. As a member of the European Union, Denmark associated itself fully with 
</p>
<p>the policies and initiatives undertaken by the European Union as a whole and the various 
</p>
<p>efforts made by the European External Action Service and the Commission of the European 
</p>
<p>Union with regard to furthering peace and justice in the conflict. In July 2014, Denmark 
</p>
<p>introduced to the members of the public common messages from the European Union 
</p>
<p>aimed at raising awareness among European Union citizens and businesses regarding 
</p>
<p>involvement in financing and economic activities in the settlements, including in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>11. On 15 September 2014, the Permanent Mission of Cuba addressed a note verbale to 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in which it expressed its full support for Human Rights Council resolution 25/31. 
</p>
<p>It reiterated that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel in 
</p>
<p>the past 46 years were null and without juridical validity. 
</p>
<p>12. Cuba also referred to attempts made by Israel to modify the legal status, physical 
</p>
<p>character, demographic composition and institutional structure of the occupied 
</p>
<p>Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>13. In its note verbale, Cuba called upon Israel to withdraw immediately from the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan to the lines existing on 4 June 1967, in compliance with Security Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It also noted that Israel should renounce its unrestrained 
</p>
<p>attempts to take over the occupied Syrian Golan. According to Cuba, foreign occupation, 
</p>
<p>policies of expansion and aggression, the creation of settlements and of facts on the ground 
</p>
<p>and the acquisition of territory by force were practices that violated international 
</p>
<p>instruments and norms.  
</p>
<p>14. Cuba vehemently condemned violations of international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>committed by Israeli authorities in relation to Syrian detainees in the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan, reiterated its profound concern at the continuing brutal practices, expressing also its 
</p>
<p>concern at the inhumane conditions created by the State of Israel.  
</p>
<p>15. Cuba rejected the Israeli practices aimed at the control and exploitation of natural 
</p>
<p>resources of the Syrian Golan in what it described as the flagrant violation of Security 
</p>
<p>Council and General Assembly resolutions in relation to the sovereignty of the Arab 
</p>
<p>population in the Syrian Golan. </p>


<p>16. Cuba added that the 120 States Members of the Non-Aligned Movement had 
</p>
<p>expressed their unconditional support for and solidarity with the legitimate demand of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic to fulfil its sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan, based on the 
</p>
<p>Arab Peace Initiative and the Madrid peace process, as well as the principle of land for 
</p>
<p>peace, in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions. According to Cuba, the 
</p>
<p>ongoing occupation of the Syrian Golan and its de facto annexation constituted an obstacle 
</p>
<p>to achieving fair, comprehensive and long-lasting peace in the region.
