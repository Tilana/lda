PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT
(To Prospectuses dated October 10, 2014 and January 29, 2013)
Filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5)
Registration No. 333-186011 and 333-199280
Common Units Representing Limited Partner Interests
Having an Aggregate Offering Price of Up to $1,500,000,000
3,990,878 Common Units Representing Limited Partner Interests Offered by the Selling Unitholder
This prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectuses relate to the issuance and sale from time to time of common units representing limited
partner interests in us ("Common Units") having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,500,000,000 through one or more of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC or UBS Securities LLC ("the sales agents"). Additionally, this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
base prospectuses relate to the sale from time to time by M&R MWE Liberty, LLC (the "Selling Unitholder") of up to 3,990,878 Common Units representing limited
partner interests in us through one or more of the sales agents. Such sales will be made concurrently with our sales. These sales by us and by the Selling
Unitholder, if any, will be made pursuant to the terms of an equity distribution agreement among us, the Selling Unitholder and the sales agents, which is included
as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Our Common Units trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "MWE." On November 18, 2014, the last reported sales price of
our Common Units on the NYSE was $74.34 per unit. Sales of Common Units under this prospectus supplement, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers'
transactions through the facilities of the NYSE, any other national securities exchange or facility thereof, a trading facility of a national securities association or an
alternate trading system, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a "dark pool" or any similar market venue, at
market prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and any sales agent. Under the terms of the equity distribution agreement, we and the
Selling Unitholder also may sell Common Units to any sales agent as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of the sale. If we and the
Selling Unitholder sell Common Units to any such sales agent as principal, we will enter into a separate terms agreement on our own behalf and on behalf of the
Selling Unitholder with such sales agent and we will describe that agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement. The Selling Unitholder has
granted us a stock power (the "Stock Power") relating to all of the Common Units it owns to which this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base
prospectuses relate. Pursuant to this Stock Power, up to 20% of the Common Units disposed of in any sale will be sold on behalf of the Selling Unitholder, and the
remaining Common Units disposed of in any such sale will be sold on our own behalf.
Limited partnerships are inherently different from corporations. You should carefully consider each of the factors
described under "Risk Factors," which begin on page S-6 of this prospectus supplement, before you make an investment in
our securities.
The compensation of each of the sales agents for sales of units shall be a fixed commission rate of up to 2% of the gross sales price per common unit,
depending on the number of Common Units sold. The net proceeds from any sales under this prospectus supplement will be used as described under "Use of
Proceeds" in this prospectus supplement.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities offered
hereby or determined if this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is
a criminal offense.

ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT
This prospectus supplement contains information with respect to a public offering of Common Units pursuant to two effective registration statements.
Registration Statement No. 333-199280, dated October 10, 2014, relates to sales of securities by us. Registration Statement No. 333-186011, dated January 29,
2013, relates to sales of securities for the benefit of the Selling Unitholder set forth therein. Each of the registration statements contains a separate base
prospectus which is included herein. The base prospectuses contain general information, some of which may not apply to this offering of Common Units. Generally,
when we refer only to the "prospectus," we are referring to both base prospectuses and this prospectus supplement combined.
Any statement made in the accompanying base prospectuses or in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference into this prospectus
will be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of this prospectus to the extent that a statement contained in this prospectus or in any other
subsequently filed document that is also incorporated by reference into this prospectus modifies or supersedes that statement. Any statement so modified or
superseded will not be deemed, except as so modified or superseded, to constitute a part of this prospectus. Please read "Where You Can Find More Information"
on page S-14 of this prospectus supplement.
You should rely only on the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, the accompanying base prospectuses and
any free writing prospectus relating to this offering of Common Units. We, the Selling Unitholder and the sales agents have not authorized anyone to provide you
with additional or different information. If anyone provides you with additional, different or inconsistent information, you should not rely on it. We and the Selling
Unitholder are offering to sell the Common Units, and seeking offers to buy the Common Units, only in jurisdictions where offers and sales are permitted. You
should not assume that the information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying base prospectuses or any free writing prospectus is accurate
as of any date other than the dates shown in these documents or that any information we have incorporated by reference herein is accurate as of any date other
than the date of the document incorporated by reference. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since such
dates.
Statements included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. We use words
such as "could," "may," "predict," "should," "expect," "hope," "continue," "potential," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "project," "believe," "estimate," and similar
expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a
number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the
forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We do not update publicly any forward-looking statement with new information or future events.
Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements as many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Please read "Risk
Factors."

This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectuses. It does not contain all of
the information that you should consider before making an investment decision. For a more complete understanding of this offering of Common Units, you should
read this entire prospectus supplement, the accompanying base prospectuses and the documents incorporated herein by reference, including our historical financial
statements and the notes thereto, which are incorporated herein by reference from our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and any
subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A incorporated herein by reference. Please read "Where You Can Find More Information" on page S-14
of this prospectus supplement. Please read "Risk Factors" beginning on page S-6 of this prospectus supplement and Part I—Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A incorporated herein by reference
for information regarding risks you should consider before investing in our Common Units.
For purposes of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectuses, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, "we," "us," "our" and
the "Partnership" refer to MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. and, when applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries; and "MarkWest Hydrocarbon" refers to MarkWest
Hydrocarbon, Inc. and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries.
MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P.
We are a publicly traded master limited partnership engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation,
fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids, or NGLs; and the gathering and transportation of crude oil. We have a leading presence in many
unconventional gas plays including the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Huron/Berea Shale, Haynesville Shale, Woodford Shale and Granite Wash Formation. We
conduct our operations in the following operating segments: Marcellus, Utica, Northeast and Southwest. Further description of these segments is included in the
periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), which are incorporated herein by reference.
Our primary business strategy is to provide top-tier midstream services by developing and operating high-quality, strategically-located assets in the liquids-rich
areas of six core natural gas producing resource plays in the United States.
Execution of our business strategy has allowed us to grow substantially since our inception. The majority of our growth since 2007 has focused on the
development of midstream services to support the increase in NGL production and natural gas supply in liquids-rich resource plays. As a result, we now have a
strong presence in the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Huron/Berea Shale, Haynesville Shale, Woodford Shale and Granite Wash formation, six critical resource
plays that we believe constitute a significant source of domestic natural gas and NGL production.
Ongoing Acquisition Activities
Consistent with our business strategy, we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase of assets and
operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. In addition, we have in the past evaluated and pursued, and intend in the future to
evaluate and pursue, other energy-related assets that have characteristics and opportunities similar to our existing business lines and enable us to leverage our
asset base, knowledge base and skill sets. Such acquisition efforts may involve participation by us in processes that have been made public and involve a number
of potential buyers, commonly referred to as "auction" processes, as well as situations in which we believe we are the only party or one of a limited number of
potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller. These acquisition efforts often involve assets which, if acquired, could have a material effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.
Table of Contents
S-1
We typically announce a transaction after we have executed a definitive acquisition agreement. However, in certain cases in order to protect our business
interests or for other reasons, we may defer public announcement of an acquisition until closing or a later date. Past experience has demonstrated that discussions
and negotiations regarding a potential acquisition can advance or terminate in a short period of time. Moreover, the closing of any transaction for which we have
entered into a definitive acquisition agreement will be subject to customary and other closing conditions, which may not ultimately be satisfied or waived.
Accordingly, we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful. Although we expect the acquisitions we make to be accretive
in the long term, we can provide no assurance that our expectations will ultimately be realized.

decision.

RISK FACTORS
Limited partnerships are inherently different from corporations. Before you invest in our securities, you should carefully consider those risk factors and all of
the other information included in, or incorporated by reference into, this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectuses, including those in our
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-Q/A incorporated herein by
reference, in evaluating an investment in our Common Units.
If any of the risks discussed in the incorporated documents were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
adversely affected. In that case, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, the trading price of our Common Units could decline and you
could lose all or part of your investment.

partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, paying or refinancing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and funding working capital, our

Affiliates of certain sales agents are lenders under our Credit Facility. To the extent we use proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness under our Credit
Facility, such affiliates may receive proceeds from this offering. Please read "Plan of Distribution" in this prospectus supplement for further information.
As of November 18, 2014, we and our wholly owned subsidiaries had $421.2 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility (excluding

SELLING UNITHOLDER
We and the Selling Unitholder are parties to a registration rights agreement dated December 29, 2011, pursuant to which we have granted the Selling
Unitholder the right to include in this offering certain of the Common Units it owns. We are required to pay all registration expenses, other than underwriting
discounts and selling commissions, of the Selling Unitholder. We granted these registration rights to the Selling Unitholder in connection with our acquisition of all
the equity interests in MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C. ("Liberty") previously held by the Selling Unitholder and its affiliates.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Selling Unitholder's beneficial ownership of our Common Units before and after this offering, and
the number of Common Units to be sold by the Selling Unitholder in this offering. The percentages of common units outstanding have been calculated based on
184,036,767 Common Units outstanding as of November 18, 2014. Beneficial ownership as shown in the table below has been determined in accordance with the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
We and the Selling Unitholder have entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "Equity Distribution Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as our sales agents (the "sales agents"), under which, from time to time, we may
offer and sell on our own behalf Common Units having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,500,000,000 and on behalf of the Selling Unitholder up to 3,990,878
Common Units. We have filed the Equity Distribution Agreement as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference in this
prospectus supplement. The sales, if any, of Common Units made under the Equity Distribution Agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions
through the facilities of the NYSE, any other national securities exchange or facility thereof, a trading facility of a national securities association or an alternate
trading system, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a "dark pool" or any similar market venue, at market
prices, in block transactions or as otherwise agreed between us and any sales agent. The sales agents will not engage in any transactions that stabilize the price of
our Common Units.
Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we and the Selling Unitholder may sell Common Units to a sales agent as principal for its own account
at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. If we and the Selling Unitholder sell Common Units to a sales agent as principal, we will enter into a separate terms
agreement on our own behalf and on behalf of the Selling Unitholder with the sales agent and we will describe that agreement in a separate prospectus supplement
or free writing prospectus. The Selling Unitholder has granted us a Stock Power relating to all Common Units to which this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying base prospectuses relate. Pursuant to this Stock Power, up to 20% of the Common Units disposed of in any sale will be sold on behalf of the Selling
Unitholder and the remaining Common Units disposed of in any such sale will be sold on our own behalf.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the sales agents will use their reasonable efforts to sell on our behalf, and on the
behalf of Selling Unitholder, all of the designated Common Units. We may instruct the sales agents not to sell any Common Units if the sales cannot be effected at
or above the price designated by us. We or the sales agents may suspend the offering of Common Units at any time by notifying the other party.
The sales agents will provide to us written confirmation following the close of trading on the NYSE each day on which Common Units are sold under the
Equity Distribution Agreement. Each confirmation will include the number of Common Units sold on that day, the gross sales proceeds and the net proceeds to us
(after regulatory transaction fees, if any, but before other expenses). We will report at least quarterly the number of Common Units sold through the sales agents
under the Equity Distribution Agreement, the net proceeds to us (before expenses) and the commissions of the sales agents paid by us in connection with the sales
of the Common Units.
We will pay the sales agents a fixed commission of up to 2% of the gross sales price per Common Unit sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement. We
have agreed to reimburse the sales agents for certain of their expenses in an amount not to exceed (1) $75,000 with respect to the expenses incurred by the sales
agents prior to commencement of this offering and (2) $10,000 quarterly (not to exceed $100,000 in the aggregate) with respect to expenses incurred by the sales
agents during the term of this offering. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the sales agents and their affiliates may make or hold a broad
array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours and our affiliates.
S-10
Table of Contents
Settlement for sales of Common Units will occur on the third business day following the date on which any sales are made in return for payment of the net
proceeds to us. There is no arrangement for funds to be received in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement.
If we or any of the sales agents have reason to believe that our Common Units are no longer an "actively-traded security" as defined under Rule 101(c)(l) of
Regulation M under the Exchange Act, that party will promptly notify the other and sales of Common Units hereunder will be suspended until in our collective
judgment Rule 101(c)(1) or another exemptive provision has been satisfied.
The offering of Common Units pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of all Common Units subject to the
Equity Distribution Agreement or (2) the termination of the Equity Distribution Agreement by us or by each of the sales agents.
In connection with the sale of the Common Units on our behalf, each of the sales agents will be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the compensation paid to the sales agents may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or
discounts. We have agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to the sales agents against certain liabilities, including civil liabilities under the Securities
Act.
Relationships
The sales agents and/or their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and commercial and
investment banking services for us and our affiliates, for which they have received and in the future may receive customary compensation and expense
reimbursement. Affiliates of the sales agents are lenders under our Credit Facility. To the extent we use proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness under our
Credit Facility, such affiliates may receive proceeds from this offering.
FINRA
Because FINRA views the Common Units offered hereby as interests in a direct participation program, this offering is being made in compliance with
Rule 2310 of the FINRA rules.

WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION
We have filed a registration statement with the SEC under the Securities Act that registers the offer and sale from time to time of our Common Units and debt
securities, including the Common Units covered by this prospectus supplement. The registration statement, including the attached exhibits, contains additional

file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for

You also can obtain information about us at the offices of the New York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005.

ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS
This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") using a "shelf' registration
process. Under this shelf registration process, we may offer from time to time our common units described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. Each time
we offer securities, we will provide you with a prospectus supplement that will describe, among other things, the specific amounts and prices of the securities being
offered and the terms of the offering. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. Therefore, before you
invest in our securities, you should read this prospectus, any attached prospectus supplements and the additional information described below under "Where You
Can Find More Information."
For purposes of this prospectus, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, "we," "us," "our" and the "Partnership" refer to MarkWest Energy
Partners, L.P. and, when applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries; and "MarkWest Hydrocarbon" refers to MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. and its direct and indirect
consolidated subsidiaries.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. We use words such as
"could," "may," "predict," "should," "expect," "hope," "continue," "potential," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "project," "believe," "estimate," and similar expressions to
identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting
us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those
expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We do not update publicly any forward-looking statement with new
information or future events. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements as many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or

USE OF PROCEEDS
Unless we specify otherwise in any prospectus supplement, we will use the net proceeds we receive from the sale of securities covered by this prospectus for
general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things:
paying or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness outstanding at the time; and
•
•
funding working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions.
The actual application of proceeds from the sale of any particular offering of securities using this prospectus will be described in the applicable prospectus
supplement relating to such offering. The precise amount and timing of the application of these proceeds will depend upon our funding requirements and the
availability and cost of other funds. Pending any specific application, we may initially invest the funds in short term marketable securities.
Table of Contents
The Units
6
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON UNITS
The common units, the Class A units and the Class B units represent limited partner interests in us. The holders of units (other than the Class B units) are
generally entitled to participate in partnership distributions and exercise the rights or privileges available to limited partners under the Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement (as defined under "Partnership Agreement" below). For a description of the relative rights and preferences of holders of common units,
Class A units and Class B units in and to partnership distributions, please read "Cash Distribution Policy." For a description of the rights and privileges of limited
partners under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, including voting rights, please read "Partnership Agreement."
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Duties
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. serves as registrar and transfer agent for the common units. We pay all fees charged by the transfer agent for transfers of common
units, except the following that must be paid by unitholders:
•
•
•
surety bond premiums to replace lost or stolen certificates, taxes and other governmental charges;
special charges for services requested by a holder of a common unit; and
other similar fees or charges.
There is no charge to unitholders for disbursements of our cash distributions. We will indemnify the transfer agent, its agents and each of their stockholders,
directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any
liability due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity.
Resignation or Removal
The transfer agent may resign, by notice to us, or be removed by us. The resignation or removal of the transfer agent will become effective upon our
appointment of a successor transfer agent and registrar and its acceptance of the appointment. If no successor has been appointed and accepted the appointment
within 30 days after notice of the resignation or removal, our general partner may act as the transfer agent and registrar until a successor is appointed.
Transfer of Common Units
The transfer of the common units to persons that purchase directly from the underwriters will be accomplished through the completion, execution and delivery
of a transfer application by the investor. Any later transfers of a common unit will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by us unless the transferee
executes and delivers a transfer application. By executing and delivering a transfer application, the transferee of common units:
•
•
•
becomes the record holder of the common units and is an assignee until admitted into our partnership as a substituted limited partner;
automatically requests admission as a substituted limited partner in our partnership;
agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of, and executes, the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
7
Table of Contents
represents that the transferee has the capacity, power and authority to enter into the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
grants powers of attorney to officers of our general partner and any liquidator of us as specified in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
and
•
•
•
makes the consents and waivers contained in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement.
An assignee will become a substituted limited partner of our partnership for the transferred common units upon the consent of our general partner and the
recording of the name of the assignee on our books and records. Our general partner may withhold its consent in its sole discretion. A transferee's broker, agent or
nominee may complete, execute and deliver a transfer application. We are entitled to treat the nominee holder of a common unit as the absolute owner. In that
case, the beneficial holder's rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and
the nominee holder.
Common units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing the transfer of securities. In addition to other rights acquired upon transfer,
the transferor gives the transferee the right to request admission as a substituted limited partner in our partnership for the transferred common units. A purchaser or
transferee of common units who does not execute and deliver a transfer application obtains only:
the right to assign the common unit to a purchaser or other transferee; and
•
•
the right to transfer the right to seek admission as a substituted limited partner in our partnership for the transferred common units.
Thus, a purchaser or transferee of common units who does not execute and deliver a transfer application:
will not receive cash distributions or federal income tax allocations, unless the common units are held in a nominee or "street name" account and the
nominee or broker has executed and delivered a transfer application; and
•
•
may not receive some federal income tax information or reports furnished to record holders of common units.
The transferor of common units has a duty to provide the transferee with all information that may be necessary to transfer the common units. The transferor
does not have a duty to insure the execution of the transfer application by the transferee and has no liability or responsibility if the transferee neglects or chooses
not to execute and forward the transfer application to the transfer agent. Please read "Partnership Agreement—Status as Limited Partner or Assignee."
Until a common unit has been transferred on our books, we and the transfer agent may treat the record holder of the unit as the absolute owner for all
purposes, except as otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
Table of Contents
Distributions of Available Cash General.
8
CASH DISTRIBUTION POLICY
General.    Within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders of record on the applicable record date. We
will make distributions of available cash to all common unitholders and Class A unitholders, pro rata and we will make distributions of Hydrocarbon Available Cash
(as defined below) pro rata to our common unitholders. Class B unitholders are not entitled to participate in our distributions of available cash or of Hydrocarbon
Available Cash prior to their conversion into common units. For a description of the conversion of Class B units to common units, please read "Partnership
Agreement—Partnership Class B Units."
Definition of Available Cash.    We define available cash in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, and it generally means, for each fiscal quarter:
all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter (excluding cash at MarkWest Hydrocarbon);
less the amount of cash that our general partner determines in its reasonable discretion is necessary or appropriate to:
•
•
•
provide for the proper conduct of our business;
comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments, or other agreements; or
provide funds for distributions to our unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters;
•
•
•
plus all cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings
made after the end of the quarter. Working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under our revolving credit facility and in all cases
are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners.
Hydrocarbon Available Cash.    Generally, Hydrocarbon Available Cash is defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand derived from or attributable to our
ownership of, or sale or other disposition of, the shares of common stock of MarkWest Hydrocarbon.
Contractual Restrictions on Our Ability to Distribute Available Cash.    Our ability to distribute available cash is contractually restricted by the terms of our
credit agreement and by the terms of our indentures governing our outstanding notes. Our credit agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain
financial ratios and a minimum net worth. We are prohibited from making any distribution to unitholders if such distribution would cause an event of default or
otherwise violate a covenant under our credit agreement or our indentures governing our outstanding notes. There is no guarantee that we will pay a quarterly
distribution.
Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation
If we dissolve in accordance with the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process called
liquidation. We will first apply the proceeds of liquidation to the payment of our creditors. We will distribute any remaining proceeds to our unitholders, including the
holders of Class B units that convert to common units upon liquidation, in accordance with their capital account balances, as adjusted to reflect any gain or loss
upon the sale or other disposition of our assets in liquidation.

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement dated February 21, 2008, as amended by
the Amendment No. 1 dated December 29, 2011, which is referred to herein as the "Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement."
We summarize the following provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement elsewhere in this prospectus:
with regard to cash available for distribution, please read "Cash Distribution Policy."
with regard to the transfer of Partnership common units, please read "Description of the Common Units—Transfer of Common Units."
•
•
•
with regard to allocations of taxable income and taxable loss, please read "Material Tax Consequences."
Organization and Duration
We were organized on January 25, 2002 and will have a perpetual existence, unless dissolved in accordance with Article XII of the Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement.
Purpose
Our purpose under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement is limited to serving as a member of our operating company, MarkWest Energy
Operating Company, L.L.C., which we refer to as "Opco," and engaging in any business activities that may be engaged in by Opco or that are approved by
MarkWest Energy GP, L.L.C. (the "General Partner"). All of our operations are conducted through Opco and its subsidiaries or MarkWest Hydrocarbon. We own
100% of the outstanding membership interest of Opco and 100% of the outstanding common stock of MarkWest Hydrocarbon. The limited liability company
agreement of Opco provides that Opco may, directly or indirectly, engage in:
its operations as conducted immediately before our initial public offering;
any other activity approved by the General Partner but only to the extent that the General Partner reasonably determines that, as of the date of the
acquisition or commencement of the activity, the activity generates "qualifying income" as this term is defined in Section 7704 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); or
•
•
•
any activity that enhances the operations of an activity that is described in either of the two preceding clauses or any other activity provided such
activity does not affect our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
The General Partner is authorized in general to perform all acts deemed necessary to carry out our purposes and to conduct our business.
Power of Attorney
Each limited partner, and each person who acquires one of our common units from one of our unitholders and executes and delivers a transfer application,
grants to the General Partner and, if appointed, a liquidator, a power of attorney to, among other things, execute and file documents required for our qualification,
continuance or dissolution. The power of attorney also grants the General Partner the authority to amend, and to make consents and waivers under, the Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement subject to the terms thereof.
10
Table of Contents
Capital Contributions
Our unitholders are not obligated to make additional capital contributions, except as described below under "—Limited Liability."
Partnership Class A Units
Class A units represent limited partner interests in us and have identical rights and obligations of our common units except that Class A units (a) do not have
the right to vote on, approve or disapprove, or otherwise consent to or not consent to any matter (including mergers, share exchanges and similar statutory
authorizations) except as otherwise required by any non-waivable provision of law and (b) do not share in any cash and cash equivalents on hand, income, gains,
losses, deductions and credits that are derived from or attributable to our ownership of, or sale or disposition of, the shares of MarkWest Hydrocarbon common
stock.
Partnership Class B Units
Class B units represent limited partner interests in us that will convert into common units in five annual installments. The first and second installments of
Class B units converted into common units on July 1, 2013 and July 1, 2014, respectively, and the remaining installments will convert into common units on July 1
of the next three succeeding years. Further, prior to the conversion of the Class B units into common units, the Class B units are not entitled to vote on any
matters on which the holders of common units are entitled to vote, other than those matters that disproportionately and adversely affect the rights and preferences
of the Class B units in relation to other classes of interests in the Partnership. In such cases, the holders of Class B units are entitled to vote together as a single
class. Class B units are not entitled to participate in any distributions of available cash prior to their conversion.
Limited Liability
Assuming that a limited partner does not participate in the control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act
(the "Delaware LP Act") and that he or she otherwise acts in conformity with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, his or her liability
under the Delaware LP Act will be limited, subject to possible exceptions, to the amount of capital he or she is obligated to contribute to us for his or her common
units in us plus his or her share of any undistributed profits and assets. If it were determined, however, that the right, or exercise of the right, by the limited partners
as a group:
to approve some amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement; or
•
•
to take other action under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement
constituted "participation in the control" of our business for the purposes of the Delaware LP Act, then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our
obligations under the laws of Delaware, to the same extent as the General Partner. This liability would extend to persons who transact business with us who
reasonably believe that a limited partner is a general partner based on the limited partner's conduct. Neither the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement nor
the Delaware LP Act specifically provides for legal recourse against the General Partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of the
General Partner. While this does not mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse, we know of no precedent for this type of a claim in Delaware case
law.
Under the Delaware LP Act, a limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if, after the distribution, all liabilities of the limited partnership, other
than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to
11
Table of Contents
specific property of us, would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited partnership. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited
partnership, the Delaware LP Act provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited will be included in the assets of
the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the nonrecourse liability. The Delaware LP Act provides that a limited partner
who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Delaware LP Act will be liable to the limited
partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of distribution. Under the Delaware LP Act, an assignee who becomes a substituted
limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of his assignor to make contributions to us, except the assignee is not obligated for liabilities
unknown to him at the time he became a limited partner and that could not be ascertained from the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement.
Our subsidiaries conduct business in multiple states. Maintenance of our limited liability as a member of Opco may require compliance with legal requirements
in the jurisdictions in which Opco conducts business, including qualifying our subsidiaries to do business there. Limitations on the liability of members for the
obligations of a limited liability company have not been clearly established in many jurisdictions. If, by virtue of our membership interest in Opco or otherwise, it
were determined that we were conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership or limited liability company statute, or
that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group to remove or replace the General Partner, to approve some amendments to the Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement, or to take other action under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement constituted "participation in the control" of
our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction, then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the law of that
jurisdiction to the same extent as the General Partner under the circumstances. We will operate in a manner that the General Partner considers reasonable and
necessary or appropriate to preserve the limited liability of the limited partners.
Table of Contents
Voting Rights
The following matters specified below require a vote of our common unitholders.
12
Election of directors of the General Partner
Amendment of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement
Merger or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets
Dissolution of us
Amendment of the limited liability company agreement and other action taken
by us as sole member of Opco
Plurality of the votes cast at meetings of the limited partners.
Certain amendments may be made by the General Partner without the
approval of our unitholders. Other amendments generally require the approval
of a majority of our outstanding common units. Please read "—Amendment of
the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement."
Majority of our outstanding common units. Please read "—Merger, Sale or
Other Disposition of Assets."
Majority of our outstanding common units. Please read "—Termination and
Dissolution."
Majority of our outstanding common units if such amendment or other action
would adversely affect our limited partners (or any particular class of limited
partners as compared to other classes of limited partners) in any material
respect. Please read "—Action Relating to the Operating Company."
Additionally, the holders of the Class B units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter that disproportionately and adversely affects the rights or
preferences of the Class B units in relation to other classes of interests in the Partnership. The approval of a majority of the Class B units shall be required to
approve any matter for which the holders of the Class B units are so entitled to vote as a separate class.
Issuance of Additional Securities
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities and rights to buy
partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by the General Partner in its sole discretion without the approval of our
unitholders.
It is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the issuance of additional common units in us or other equity securities. Holders of any additional common
units in us that we issue will be entitled to share equally with the then-existing holders of our common units in distributions of available cash. In addition, the
issuance of additional partnership interests may dilute the value of the interests of the then-existing holders of our common units in our net assets.
In accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, we may also issue additional partnership interests
that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, have special voting rights to which holders of our common units are not entitled.
Table of Contents
Amendment of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement
13
General.    Amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of the General Partner, which
consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion, except as discussed below. In order to adopt a proposed amendment, other than the amendments
discussed below, the General Partner must seek written approval of the holders of the number of our common units required to approve the amendment or call a
meeting of the limited partners to consider and vote upon the proposed amendment. Except as described below, an amendment must be approved by a majority of
our outstanding common units.
Prohibited Amendments.    No amendment may be made that would:
enlarge the obligations of any limited partner without its consent, unless approved by a majority of the type or class of limited partner interests so
affected;
enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise
payable by us to the General Partner or any of its affiliates without the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
discretion;
change the term of the Partnership;
provide that we are not dissolved upon an election to dissolve us by the General Partner that is approved by a majority of outstanding common units;
give any person the right to dissolve us other than the General Partner's right to dissolve us with the approval of a majority of our outstanding
common units; or
•
•
•
•
•
•
have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any class of limited partner interests in relation to other classes of limited partner
interests.
The provision of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement preventing the amendments having the effects described in any of the clauses above can
be amended upon the approval of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding common units voting together as a single class.
In addition, any amendment that disproportionately and adversely affects the rights and preferences of the Class B units in relation to other classes of
interests in the Partnership would require the vote of the holders of the Class B units, voting as a separate class.
No Partnership Unitholder Approval.    The General Partner may generally make amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement without
the approval of any limited partner or assignee to reflect:
•
•
•
•
a change in our name, the location of our principal place of business, our registered agent or our registered office;
the admission, substitution, withdrawal, or removal of partners, as applicable, in accordance with the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
a change that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, is necessary or advisable for us to qualify or to continue our qualification as a limited

In addition, the General Partner may make amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement without the approval of any limited partner or
assignee if those amendments, in the discretion of the General Partner:

Opinion of Counsel and Partnership Unitholder Approval.    The General Partner will not be required to obtain an opinion of counsel that an amendment will not
result in a loss of limited liability to the limited partners or result in us being treated as an entity for federal income tax purposes if one of the amendments described
above under "—No Partnership Unitholder Approval" should occur. No other amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement will become
effective without the approval of holders of at least 90% of the outstanding Partnership common units unless we obtain an opinion of counsel to the effect that the
amendment will not affect the limited liability under applicable law of any of our limited partners or cause us, Opco or any of our or Opco's subsidiaries to be taxable
15
Table of Contents
as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously taxed as such).
Any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any type or class of outstanding units in relation to other classes of
units will require the approval of a majority of the type or class of units so affected. Any amendment that reduces the voting percentage required to take any action
must be approved by the affirmative vote of limited partners constituting not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced.
Amendments requiring 80% of the Outstanding Partnership Common Units.    Any amendments (except prohibited amendments as discussed above)
regarding provisions dealing with amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, limited partner meetings and related to election of the
directors of the General Partner board at annual meetings, quorum, action without a meeting and voting rights cannot be amended without 80% of our outstanding
common units voting in favor of such amendments.
Action Relating to the Operating Company
Without the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units, the General Partner is prohibited from consenting on our behalf, as the sole
member of Opco, to any amendment to the limited liability company agreement of Opco or taking any action on our behalf permitted to be taken by a member of
Opco in each case that would adversely affect our limited partners (or any particular class of limited partners) in any material respect.
Merger, Sale or Other Disposition of Assets
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement generally prohibits the General Partner, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of our
outstanding common units, from causing us to, among other things, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation or other combination, or approving on our behalf the sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of our subsidiaries as a whole. The General Partner may, however, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in all or substantially all of our assets without that approval. The General Partner may also sell all or substantially all of our assets under a
foreclosure or other realization upon those encumbrances without such approval.
If conditions specified in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement are satisfied, the General Partner may merge us or any of our subsidiaries into, or
convey some or all of our assets to, a newly formed entity if the sole purpose of that merger or conveyance is to change our legal form into another limited liability
entity. Our unitholders are not entitled to appraisal rights under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement or applicable Delaware law in the event of a
merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event for such purpose.
Termination and Dissolution
We will continue as a limited partnership until terminated under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. We will dissolve upon:
•
•
the election of the General Partner to dissolve us, if approved by the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units;
the sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets and properties and our subsidiaries;
16
Table of Contents
the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of us; or
•
•
the withdrawal of the General Partner in violation of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and the successor general partner is not
admitted.
Liquidation and Distribution of Proceeds
Upon our dissolution, the liquidator authorized to wind up our affairs will, acting with all of the powers of the General Partner that the liquidator deems
necessary or desirable in its judgment, liquidate our assets and apply the proceeds of the liquidation as provided in "Cash Distribution Policy—Distributions of Cash
Upon Liquidation." The liquidator may defer liquidation of our assets for a reasonable period or distribute assets to partners in kind if it determines that a sale would
be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners.
No Withdrawal or Removal of the General Partner
The General Partner cannot withdraw and cannot be removed at any time for any reason. Any attempt of withdrawal or removal of the General Partner will be
null and void. Nonetheless, if the General Partner withdraws in violation of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement:
the withdrawing General Partner must give 90 days' notice to the limited partners;
the successor general partner will be elected by a plurality of the votes of our unitholders at a special meeting or an annual meeting;
the successor general partner elected will be admitted to the Partnership as the general partner effective immediately prior to the withdrawal of the
predecessor general partner;
the successor general partner elected will automatically become the successor general partner or managing member of our subsidiaries; and
•
•
•
•
•
if the successor general partner is elected, we will not be dissolved and the successor general partner will continue the business of us.
Transfer of General Partner Interests
The General Partner interests cannot be transferred to any person for any reason. So long as we are a limited partnership, 100% of the General Partner
interests will be owned by the Partnership or one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Change of Management Provisions
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement contains specific provisions that are intended to discourage a person or group from attempting to remove
the General Partner or otherwise attempting to change our management. If any person or group other than the General Partner and its affiliates acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of any class of units, that person or group loses voting rights on all of its units. This loss of voting rights does not apply to any person or
group who acquires the units with the prior approval of the board of directors of the General Partner.
Meetings; Voting
Except as described below regarding a person or group owning 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding and except for Class A units and Class B
units as described above, unitholders or assignees who are record holders of our common units on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
meetings of our limited partners and to act upon matters for which approvals may be solicited. Our common units that are owned by an assignee who is a record
holder, but who has not yet
17
Table of Contents
been admitted as a limited partner, will be voted by the General Partner at the written direction of the record holder. Absent direction of this kind, our common units
will not be voted.
Any action that is required or permitted to be taken by unitholders may be taken either at a meeting of our unitholders or without a meeting if consents in
writing describing the action so taken are signed by holders of the number of units necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting. Meetings of our
unitholders may be called by the General Partner or by our unitholders owning at least 20% of our outstanding common units. Our unitholders may vote either in
person or by proxy at meetings. The holders of a majority of the outstanding common units, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum unless any
action by our unitholders requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of our common units, in which case the quorum will be the greater percentage.
However, if at any time any person or group, other than the General Partner and its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of the General
Partner or its affiliates, or any person or group who acquires the units with the prior approval of the General Partner, acquires, in the aggregate, beneficial ownership
of 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, that person or group will lose voting rights on all of its units and the units may not be voted on any matter
and will not be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or
for other similar purposes. Our common units held in nominee or street name account will be voted by the broker or other nominee in accordance with the
instruction of the beneficial owner unless the arrangement between the beneficial owner and his nominee provides otherwise.
Any notice, demand, request, report or proxy material required or permitted to be given or made to record holders of our common units under the Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement will be delivered to the record holder by us or by the transfer agent.
The annual meeting of the limited partners holding our common units will be held in June each year or on such other date and time as may be fixed from time
to time by the General Partner. Notice of the annual meeting will be given between ten days and 60 days prior to the meeting date. The limited partners holding our
common units will vote together as a single class. The limited partners entitled to vote will elect by plurality of the votes cast at such meeting the directors of the
General Partner. Each of our common units is entitled to one vote for each of our common units that is registered in the name of the limited partner on the record
date for the meeting. The General Partner, the Partnership or their affiliates cannot vote their units that they are otherwise entitled to vote, and those units are not
considered to be outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum.
Board of Directors
The number of directors of the General Partner board of directors will be between seven and eleven, but the number of the directors may be changed by the
majority of the directors of the General Partner board of directors so long as the decrease in number does not shorten the term of any incumbent director. Unless
otherwise previously elected at a special meeting, at each annual meeting of the limited partners, the directors will be elected to hold office until the next annual
meeting. Each director will hold office for the term for which such director is elected or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. Any vacancies may
be filled, until the next annual meeting, by a majority of the remaining directors then in office. A director may be removed only for cause and only upon a vote of the
majority of the remaining directors then in office. If the SEC promulgates a rule that provides for nominations by the stockholders or the unitholders of publicly
traded companies of persons for election to the board of directors, the Partnership and the General Partner will adopt such rule as applied to a corporation without
regard to any exemptions provided to limited partnerships.

Status as Limited Partner or Assignee
Except as described above under "—Limited Liability," our common units will be fully paid, and our unitholders will not be required to make additional
contributions.
An assignee of one of our common units, after executing and delivering a transfer application, but pending its admission as a substituted limited partner, is
entitled to an interest equivalent to that of a limited partner for the right to share in allocations and distributions from us, including liquidating distributions. The
General Partner will vote and exercise other powers attributable to our common units owned by an assignee that has not become a substitute limited partner at the
written direction of the assignee. Please read "—Meetings; Voting" above. Transferees that do not execute and deliver a transfer application will not be treated as
assignees nor as record holders of our common units, and will not receive cash distributions, federal income tax allocations or reports furnished to holders of our
common units. Please read "Description of the Common Units—Transfer of Common Units."
Non-citizen Assignees; Redemption
If we are or become subject to federal, state or local laws or regulations that, in the reasonable determination of the General Partner, create a substantial risk
of cancellation or forfeiture of any property that we have an interest in because of the nationality, citizenship or other related status of any limited partner or
assignee, we may redeem the units held by the limited partner or assignee at their current market price. In order to avoid any cancellation or forfeiture, the General
Partner may require each limited partner or assignee to furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or related status. If a limited partner or assignee fails to
furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or other related status within 30 days after a request for the information or the General Partner determines, with
the advice of counsel, after receipt of the information that the limited partner or assignee is not an eligible citizen, the limited partner or assignee may be treated as
a non-citizen assignee and the General Partner will be substituted for such non-citizen assignee as the limited partner in respect of his limited partner interests. In
addition to other limitations on the rights of an assignee that is not a substituted limited partner, a non-citizen assignee does not have the right to direct the voting
of his units and may not receive distributions in kind upon our liquidation.
Indemnification
Under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, in most circumstances, we will indemnify the following persons, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, from and against all losses, claims, damages or similar events:
the General Partner;
any person who is or was an affiliate of the General Partner;
any person who is or was a member, partner, officer, director, employee, agent or trustee of us, Opco, any of our or its subsidiaries, the General
Partner or any affiliate of us, Opco or any of our or its subsidiaries; and
•
•
•
•
any person who is or was serving at the request of the General Partner or any affiliate of the General Partner as an officer, director, employee,
member, partner, agent, fiduciary or trustee of another person.
Any indemnification under these provisions will only be out of our assets. The General Partner and its affiliates will not be personally liable for, or have any
obligation to contribute or loan funds or assets to us to enable us to effectuate indemnification. We may purchase insurance against liabilities asserted against and
expenses incurred by persons in connection with our activities, regardless of
19
Table of Contents
whether we would have the power to indemnify the person against liabilities under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement.
Books and Reports
The General Partner is required to keep appropriate books and records of our business at our principal offices. The books will be maintained for both tax and
financial reporting purposes on an accrual basis. For tax and financial reporting purposes, our fiscal year is the calendar year.
We will furnish or make available to record holders of common units, within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, an annual report containing audited
financial statements and a report on those financial statements by our independent public accountants. Except for our fourth quarter, we will also furnish or make
available summary financial information within 90 days after the close of each quarter.
We will furnish each record holder of a unit with information reasonably required for tax reporting purposes within 90 days after the close of each calendar year.
This information is expected to be furnished in summary form so that some complex calculations normally required of partners can be avoided. Our ability to furnish
this summary information to unitholders will depend on the cooperation of unitholders in supplying us with specific information. Every unitholder will receive
information to assist him or her in determining his or her federal and state tax liability and filing his or her federal and state income tax returns, regardless of whether
he or she supplies us with information.
Right to Inspect the Partnership's Books and Records
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement provides that a limited partner can, for a purpose reasonably related to his or her interest as a limited
partner, upon reasonable written demand and at his or her own expense, have furnished to him or her:
a current list of the name and last known address of each limited partner;
a copy of our tax returns;
information as to the amount of cash, and a description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or services, contributed or to be
contributed by each limited partner and the date on which each became a limited partner;
copies of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, our certificate of limited partnership, related amendments and powers of attorney under
which they have been executed;
information regarding the status of our business and financial condition; and
•
•
•
•
•
•
any other information regarding our affairs as is just and reasonable.
The General Partner may, and intends to, keep confidential from the limited partners trade secrets or other information the disclosure of which the General
Partner believes in good faith is not in our or our subsidiaries' best interests, could damage us or our subsidiaries or which we or our subsidiaries are required by law
or by agreements with third parties to keep confidential.

MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
This section summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to prospective unitholders and is based upon current
provisions of the Code, existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change. Changes in these authorities may cause the federal income tax consequences to a prospective unitholder to vary
substantially from those described below. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to "we" or "us" are references to MarkWest Energy
Partners, L.P. and our subsidiaries.
Legal conclusions contained in this section, unless otherwise noted, are the opinion of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. and are based on the accuracy of
representations made by us to them for this purpose. However, this section does not address all federal income tax matters that affect us or our unitholders and
does not describe the application of the alternative minimum tax that may be applicable to certain unitholders. Furthermore, this section focuses on unitholders who
are individual citizens or residents of the United States (for federal income tax purposes), who have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and who hold units
as capital assets (generally, property that is held for investment). This section has limited applicability to corporations, partnerships (including entities treated as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), estates, trusts, non-resident aliens or other unitholders subject to specialized tax treatment, such as tax-
exempt institutions, non-U.S. persons, individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), employee benefit plans, real estate investment trusts or mutual funds. Accordingly,
we encourage each unitholder to consult the unitholder's own tax advisor in analyzing the federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences particular
to that unitholder resulting from ownership or disposition of units and potential changes in applicable tax laws.
We are relying on opinions and advice of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. with respect to the matters described herein. An opinion of counsel represents only that
counsel's best legal judgment and does not bind the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or a court. Accordingly, the opinions and statements made herein may not
be sustained by a court if contested by the IRS. Any such contest of the matters described herein may materially and adversely impact the market for our common
units and the prices at which our common units trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our General
Partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution. Furthermore, the tax consequences of an investment in us may be significantly modified
by future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions, which may be retroactively applied.
For the reasons described below, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has not rendered an opinion with respect to the following federal income tax issues: (1) the treatment
of a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a short seller to cover a short sale of units) (please read "—Tax Consequences of
Unit Ownership—Treatment of Securities Loans"); (2) whether our monthly convention for allocating taxable income and losses is permitted by existing Treasury
Regulations (please read "—Disposition of Units—Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees"); and (3) whether our method for taking into account
Section 743 adjustments is sustainable in certain cases (please read "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—Section 754 Election" and "—Uniformity of Units").
Taxation of the Partnership
Partnership Status
We expect to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, generally will not be liable for entity-level federal income taxes.
Instead, as described below, each of our unitholders will take into account its respective share of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its
federal income tax liability as if the unitholder had earned such income
21
Table of Contents
directly, even if we make no cash distributions to the unitholder. Distributions we make to a unitholder generally will not give rise to income or gain taxable to such
unitholder unless the amount of cash distributed exceeds the unitholder's adjusted tax basis in its units.
Section 7704 of the Code generally provides that publicly traded partnerships will be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes. However, if 90%
or more of a partnership's gross income for every taxable year it is publicly traded consists of "qualifying income," the partnership may continue to be treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes (the "Qualifying Income Exception"). Qualifying income includes income and gains derived from the exploration and
production, refining, transportation, storage, processing and marketing of certain natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, and products thereof. Other
types of qualifying income include interest (other than from a financial business), dividends, gains from the sale of real property and gains from the sale or other
disposition of capital assets held for the production of qualifying income. We estimate that less than 2% of our current gross income is not qualifying income;
however, this estimate could change from time to time.
Based upon factual representations made by us and our General Partner regarding the composition of our income and the other representations set forth
below, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is of the opinion that we will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and each of our operating subsidiaries will be
disregarded as an entity separate from us for federal income tax purposes. In rendering its opinion, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has relied on factual representations
made by us and our General Partner. The representations made by us and our General Partner upon which Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has relied include, without
limitation:
(a)   Neither we nor any of our operating subsidiaries has elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes;
(b)   For each taxable year, since and including the year of our initial public offering, more than 90% of our gross income has been and will be income of
a character that Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has opined is "qualifying income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code; and
(c)   Each hedging transaction that we treat as resulting in qualifying income has been and will be appropriately identified as a hedging transaction
pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations, and has been and will be associated with oil, natural gas, or products thereof that are held or to be held by us in
activities that Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P. has opined or will opine result in qualifying income.
We believe that these representations are true and will be true in the future.
If we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, other than a failure that is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable
time after discovery (in which case the IRS may also require us to make adjustments with respect to our unitholders or pay other amounts), we will be treated as
transferring all of our assets, subject to liabilities, to a newly formed corporation, on the first day of the year in which we fail to meet the Qualifying Income
Exception, in return for stock in that corporation and then as distributing that stock to our unitholders in liquidation. This deemed contribution and liquidation should
not result in the recognition of taxable income by our unitholders or us so long as our liabilities do not exceed the tax basis of our assets. Thereafter, we would be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by
administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider substantive
changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. One such legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income
exception upon
22
Table of Contents
which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any such changes will ultimately be
enacted. However, it is possible that a change in law could affect us and may be applied retroactively. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an
investment in our common units.
If for any reason we are taxable as a corporation in any taxable year, our items of income, gain, loss and deduction would be taken into account by us in
determining the amount of our liability for federal income tax, rather than being passed through to our unitholders. Our taxation as a corporation would materially
reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders and thus would likely substantially reduce the value of our common units. Any distribution made to a
unitholder at a time we are treated as a corporation would be (i) a taxable dividend to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, then (ii) a
nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the unitholder's tax basis in its units, and thereafter (iii) taxable capital gain.
The remainder of this discussion is based on the opinion of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. that we will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership
Limited Partner Status
Unitholders who are admitted as limited partners of the Partnership will be treated as partners of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes. Also:
(a)   assignees who have executed and delivered transfer applications, and are awaiting admission as limited partners, and
(b)   unitholders whose common units are held in street name or by a nominee and who have the right to direct the nominee in the exercise of all
substantive rights attendant to the ownership of their common units,
will be treated as partners of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes.
As there is no direct or indirect controlling authority addressing the federal tax treatment of assignees of common units who are entitled to execute and deliver
transfer applications and thereby become entitled to direct the exercise of attendant rights, but who fail to execute and deliver transfer applications, the opinion of
Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. does not extend to these persons. Furthermore, a purchaser or other transferee of common units who does not execute and deliver a
transfer application may not receive some federal income tax information or reports furnished to record holders of common units unless the common units are held
in a nominee or street name account and the nominee or broker has executed and delivered a transfer application for those common units.
For a discussion related to the risks of losing partner status as a result of securities loans, please read "—Treatment of Securities Loans." Unitholders who
are not treated as partners of the partnership as described above are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences applicable to
them under the circumstances.
Flow-Through of Taxable Income
Subject to the discussion below under "—Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder Taxes" with respect to payments we may be required to make on behalf of our
unitholders, we will not pay any federal income tax. Rather, each unitholder will be required to report on its federal income tax return each year its share of our
income, gains, losses and deductions for our taxable year or years ending with or within its taxable year. Consequently, we may allocate income to a unitholder
even if that unitholder has not received a cash distribution.
23
Table of Contents
Basis of Units
A unitholder's tax basis in its units initially will be the amount paid for those units increased by the unitholder's initial allocable share of our liabilities. That
basis generally will be (i) increased by the unitholder's share of our income and any increases in such unitholder's share of our liabilities, and (ii) decreased, but not
below zero, by the amount of all distributions to the unitholder, the unitholder's share of our losses, and any decreases in its share of our liabilities. The IRS has
ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate transactions must combine those interests and maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all of
those interests.
Treatment of Distributions
Distributions made by us to a unitholder generally will not be taxable to the unitholder, unless such distributions exceed the unitholder's tax basis in its units,
in which case the unitholder generally will recognize gain taxable in the manner described below under "—Disposition of Units."
Any reduction in a unitholder's share of our liabilities will be treated as a distribution by us of cash to that unitholder. A decrease in a unitholder's percentage
interest in us because of our issuance of additional units may decrease the unitholder's share of our liabilities. For purposes of the foregoing, a unitholder's share of
our nonrecourse liabilities (liabilities for which no partner bears the economic risk of loss) generally will be based upon that unitholder's share of the unrealized
appreciation (or depreciation) in our assets, to the extent thereof, with any excess liabilities allocated based on the unitholder's share of our profits. Please read "—
Disposition of Units."
A non-pro rata distribution of money or property (including a deemed distribution as a result of the reallocation of our liabilities as described above) may cause
a unitholder to recognize ordinary income, if the distribution reduces the unitholder's share of our "unrealized receivables," including depreciation recapture and
substantially appreciated "inventory items," both as defined in Section 751 of the Code ("Section 751 Assets"). To the extent of such reduction, the unitholder
would be deemed to receive its proportionate share of the Section 751 Assets and exchange such assets with us in return for a portion of the non-pro rata
distribution. This deemed exchange generally will result in the unitholder's recognition of ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of (1) the non-pro rata
portion of that distribution over (2) the unitholder's tax basis (generally zero) in the Section 751 Assets deemed to be relinquished in the exchange.
Limitations on Deductibility of Losses
A unitholder may not be entitled to deduct the full amount of loss we allocate to it because its share of our losses will be limited to the lesser of (i) the
unitholder's tax basis in its units, and (ii) in the case of a unitholder that is an individual, estate, trust or certain types of closely-held corporations, the amount for
which the unitholder is considered to be "at risk" with respect to our activities. In general, a unitholder will be at risk to the extent of its tax basis in its units,
reduced by (1) any portion of that basis attributable to the unitholder's share of our liabilities, (2) any portion of that basis representing amounts otherwise protected
against loss because of a guarantee, stop loss agreement or similar arrangement and (3) any amount of money the unitholder borrows to acquire or hold its units, if
the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in us, is related to another unitholder or can look only to the units for repayment. A unitholder subject to the at
risk limitation must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions (including distributions deemed to result from a reduction in a
unitholder's share of nonrecourse liabilities) cause the unitholder's at risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year.
Losses disallowed to a unitholder or recaptured as a result of the basis or at risk limitations will carry forward and will be allowable as a deduction in a later
year to the extent that the unitholder's tax basis or at risk amount, whichever is the limiting factor, is subsequently increased. Upon a taxable
24

disposition of units, any gain recognized by a unitholder can be offset by losses that were previously suspended by the at risk limitation but not losses suspended
by the basis limitation. Any loss previously suspended by the at risk limitation in excess of that gain can no longer be used, and will not be available to offset a
unitholder's salary or active business income.
In addition to the basis and at risk limitations, a passive activity loss limitation generally limits the deductibility of losses incurred by individuals, estates,
trusts, some closely held corporations and personal service corporations from "passive activities" (generally, trade or business activities in which the taxpayer does
not materially participate). The passive loss limitations are applied separately with respect to each publicly-traded partnership. Consequently, any passive losses
we generate will be available to offset only passive income generated by us. Passive losses that exceed a unitholder's share of passive income we generate may
be deducted in full when the unitholder disposes of all of its units in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party. The passive loss rules generally are applied
after other applicable limitations on deductions, including the at risk and basis limitations.
Limitations on Interest Deductions
The deductibility of a non-corporate taxpayer's "investment interest expense" generally is limited to the amount of that taxpayer's "net investment income."
Investment interest expense includes:
interest on indebtedness properly allocable to property held for investment;
interest expense allocated against portfolio income; and
•
•
•
the portion of interest expense incurred to purchase or carry an interest in a passive activity to the extent allocable against portfolio income.
The computation of a unitholder's investment interest expense will take into account interest on any margin account borrowing or other loan incurred to
purchase or carry a unit. Net investment income includes gross income from property held for investment and amounts treated as portfolio income under the
passive loss rules, less deductible expenses, other than interest, directly connected with the production of investment income. Net investment income generally
does not include qualified dividend income (if applicable) or gains attributable to the disposition of property held for investment. A unitholder's share of a publicly
traded partnership's portfolio income and, according to the IRS, net passive income will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest
expense limitation.
Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder Taxes
If we are required or elect under applicable law to pay any federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax on behalf of any current or former unitholder or our General
Partner, we are authorized to treat the payment as a distribution of cash to the relevant unitholder or General Partner. Where the tax is payable on behalf of all the
unitholders or we cannot determine the specific unitholder on whose behalf the tax is payable, we are authorized to treat the payment as a distribution to all current
unitholders. Payments by us as described above could give rise to an overpayment of tax on behalf of a unitholder, in which event the unitholder may be entitled to
claim a refund of the overpayment amount. Unitholders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the consequences to them of any tax payment we make
on their behalf.
Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction
In general, our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will be allocated amongst our unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in us.
However, in addition to allocations with respect to any Book-Tax Disparities, as described below, our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement provides for
special allocations to achieve economic uniformity between the Class B Units and the
25
Table of Contents
common units and allocate a portion of the partnership's income away from the Class B Units to the extent that the common units receive distributions to which the
Class B Units are not entitled.
Specified items of our income, gain, loss and deduction will be allocated under Section 704(c) of the Code (or the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code) to
account for any difference between the tax basis and fair market value of our assets at the time such assets are contributed to us and at the time of any
subsequent offering of our common units (a "Book-Tax Disparity"). As a result, the federal income tax burden associated with any Book-Tax Disparity immediately
prior to an offering generally will be borne by our partners holding interests in us prior to such offering. In addition, items of recapture income will be specially
allocated to the extent possible to the unitholder who was allocated the deduction giving rise to that recapture income in order to minimize the recognition of
ordinary income by other unitholders.
An allocation of items of our income, gain, loss or deduction, other than an allocation required by the Code to eliminate a Book-Tax Disparity, will generally be
given effect for federal income tax purposes in determining a partner's share of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction only if the allocation has "substantial
economic effect." In any other case, a partner's share of an item will be determined on the basis of the partner's interest in us, which will be determined by taking
into account all the facts and circumstances, including (i) his relative contributions to us, (ii) the interests of all the partners in profits and losses, (iii) the interest of
all the partners in cash flow and (iv) the rights of all the partners to distributions of capital upon liquidation. Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is of the opinion that, with the
exception of the issues described in "—Section 754 Election" and "—Disposition of Units—Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees," allocations of
income, gain, loss or deduction under our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement will be given effect for federal income tax purposes.
Treatment of Securities Loans
A unitholder whose units are loaned (for example, a loan to a "short seller" to cover a short sale of units) may be treated as having disposed of those units. If
so, such unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss
from the disposition. As a result, during this period (i) any of our income, gain, loss or deduction allocated to those units would not be reportable by the lending
unitholder and (ii) any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units may be treated as ordinary taxable income.
Due to a lack of controlling authority, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has not rendered an opinion regarding the tax treatment of a unitholder that enters into a
securities loan with respect to its units. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of income recognition from a loan of their units are
urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing and lending their units. The IRS has announced that it is
studying issues relating to the tax treatment of short sales of partnership interests. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss."
Tax Rates
Under current law, the highest marginal federal income tax rates for individuals applicable to ordinary income and long-term capital gains (generally, gains from
the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) are 39.6% and 20%, respectively. These rates are subject to change by new
legislation at any time.
26
Table of Contents
In addition, a 3.8% net investment income tax ("NIIT") applies to certain net investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts. For these
purposes, net investment income generally includes a unitholder's allocable share of our income and gain realized by a unitholder from a sale of units. In the case
of an individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) the unitholder's net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the amount by which the unitholder's
modified adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 (if the unitholder is married and filing jointly or a surviving spouse), $125,000 (if married filing separately) or
$200,000 (if the unitholder is unmarried or in any other case). In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) undistributed net
investment income, or (ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins.
Section 754 Election
We have made the election permitted by Section 754 of the Code that permits us to adjust the tax bases in our assets as to specific purchasers of our
common units under Section 743(b) of the Code. That election is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. The Section 743(b) adjustment separately applies to
each purchaser of units based upon the values and bases of our assets at the time of the relevant purchase, and the adjustment will reflect the purchase price paid.
The Section 743(b) adjustment does not apply to a person who purchases units directly from us.
Under our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, we are authorized to take a position to preserve the uniformity of units even if that position is not
consistent with applicable Treasury Regulations. A literal application of Treasury Regulations governing a 743(b) adjustment attributable to properties depreciable
under Section 167 of the Code may give rise to differences in the taxation of unitholders purchasing units from us and unitholders purchasing from other unitholders.
If we have any such properties, we intend to adopt methods employed by other publicly traded partnerships to preserve the uniformity of units, even if inconsistent
with existing Treasury Regulations, and Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P. has not opined on the validity of this approach. Please read "—Uniformity of Units."
The IRS may challenge the positions we adopt with respect to depreciating or amortizing the Section 743(b) adjustment we take to preserve the uniformity of
units due to lack of controlling authority. Because a unitholder's tax basis for its units is reduced by its share of our items of deduction or loss, any position we take
that understates deductions will overstate a unitholder's basis in its units, and may cause the unitholder to understate gain or overstate loss on any sale of such
units. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss." If a challenge to such treatment were sustained, the gain from the sale of units may be
increased without the benefit of additional deductions.
The calculations involved in the Section 754 election are complex and will be made on the basis of assumptions as to the value of our assets and other
matters. The IRS could seek to reallocate some or all of any Section 743(b) adjustment we allocated to our assets subject to depreciation to goodwill or non-
depreciable assets. Goodwill, as an intangible asset, is generally amortizable over a longer period of time or under a less accelerated method than our tangible
assets. We cannot assure any unitholder that the determinations we make will not be successfully challenged by the IRS or that the resulting deductions will not be
reduced or disallowed altogether. Should the IRS require a different tax basis adjustment to be made, and should, in our opinion, the expense of compliance exceed
the benefit of the election, we may seek permission from the IRS to revoke our Section 754 election. If permission is granted, a subsequent purchaser of units may
be allocated more income than it would have been allocated had the election not been revoked.

Tax Treatment of Operations
Accounting Method and Taxable Year
We will use the year ending December 31 as our taxable year and the accrual method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. Each unitholder will be
required to include in its tax return its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction for each taxable year ending within or with its taxable year. In addition, a
unitholder who has a taxable year ending on a date other than December 31 and who disposes of all of its units following the close of our taxable year but before the
close of its taxable year must include its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction in income for its taxable year, with the result that it will be required to
include in income for its taxable year its share of more than one year of our income, gain, loss and deduction. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Allocations
Between Transferors and Transferees."
Tax Basis, Depreciation and Amortization
The tax bases of our assets will be used for purposes of computing depreciation and cost recovery deductions and, ultimately, gain or loss on the disposition
of those assets. If we dispose of depreciable property by sale, foreclosure or otherwise, all or a portion of any gain, determined by reference to the amount of
depreciation deductions previously taken, may be subject to the recapture rules and taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Similarly, a unitholder who
has taken cost recovery or depreciation deductions with respect to property we own will likely be required to recapture some or all of those deductions as ordinary
income upon a sale of its interest in us. Please read "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction" and "—Disposition
of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss."
The costs we incur in offering and selling our common units (called "syndication expenses") must be capitalized and cannot be deducted currently, ratably or
upon our termination. While there are uncertainties regarding the classification of costs as organization expenses, which may be amortized by us, and as
syndication expenses, which may not be amortized by us, the underwriting discounts and commissions we incur will be treated as syndication expenses. Please
read "Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss."
Valuation and Tax Bases of Our Properties
The federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of units will depend in part on our estimates of the relative fair market values and the
tax bases of our assets. Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we will make many of the relative fair
market value estimates ourselves. These estimates and determinations of tax basis are subject to challenge and will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. If the
estimates of fair market value or basis are later found to be incorrect, the character and amount of items of income, gain, loss or deduction previously reported by
unitholders could change, and unitholders could be required to adjust their tax liability for prior years and incur interest and penalties with respect to those
adjustments.
Disposition of Units
Recognition of Gain or Loss
A unitholder will be required to recognize gain or loss on a sale of units equal to the difference between the unitholder's amount realized and tax basis in the
units sold. A unitholder's amount realized generally will equal the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property it receives plus its share of our
liabilities with respect to the units sold. Because the amount realized includes a
28
Table of Contents
unitholder's share of our liabilities, the gain recognized on the sale of units could result in a tax liability in excess of any cash received from the sale.
Except as noted below, gain or loss recognized by a unitholder on the sale or exchange of a unit held for more than one year generally will be taxable as long-
term capital gain or loss. However, gain or loss recognized on the disposition of units will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under
Section 751 of the Code to the extent attributable to Section 751 Assets, such as depreciation recapture and our "inventory items," regardless of whether such
inventory item is substantially appreciated in value. Ordinary income attributable to Section 751 Assets may exceed net taxable gain realized on the sale of a unit
and may be recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on the sale of a unit. Thus, a unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and capital gain or
loss upon a sale of units. Net capital loss may offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year.
For purposes of calculating gain or loss on the sale of units, the unitholder's adjusted tax basis will be adjusted by its allocable share of our income or loss in
respect of its units for the year of the sale. Furthermore, as described above, the IRS has ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate
transactions must combine those interests and maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all those interests. Upon a sale or other disposition of less than all of those
interests, a portion of that tax basis must be allocated to the interests sold using an "equitable apportionment" method, which generally means that the tax basis
allocated to the interest sold equals an amount that bears the same relation to the partner's tax basis in its entire interest in the partnership as the value of the
interest sold bears to the value of the partner's entire interest in the partnership.
Treasury Regulations under Section 1223 of the Code allow a selling unitholder who can identify units transferred with an ascertainable holding period to elect
to use the actual holding period of the units transferred. Thus, according to the ruling discussed in the paragraph above, a unitholder will be unable to select high or
low basis units to sell as would be the case with corporate stock, but, according to the Treasury Regulations, it may designate specific units sold for purposes of
determining the holding period of units transferred. A unitholder electing to use the actual holding period of the units transferred must consistently use that
identification method for all subsequent sales or exchanges of our common units. A unitholder considering the purchase of additional units or a sale of units
purchased in separate transactions is urged to consult its tax advisor as to the possible consequences of this ruling and application of the Treasury Regulations.
Specific provisions of the Code affect the taxation of some financial products and securities, including partnership interests, by treating a taxpayer as having
sold an "appreciated" financial position, including a partnership interest with respect to which gain would be recognized if it were sold, assigned or terminated at its
fair market value, in the event the taxpayer or a related person enters into:
a short sale;
an offsetting notional principal contract; or
•
•
•
a futures or forward contract with respect to the partnership interest or substantially identical property.
Moreover, if a taxpayer has previously entered into a short sale, an offsetting notional principal contract or a futures or forward contract with respect to the
partnership interest, the taxpayer will be treated as having sold that position if the taxpayer or a related person then acquires the partnership interest or substantially
identical property. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue Treasury Regulations that treat a taxpayer that enters into transactions or positions that
have substantially the same effect as the preceding transactions as having constructively sold the financial position.

Table of Contents
Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees
In general, our taxable income or loss will be determined annually, will be prorated on a monthly basis and will be subsequently apportioned among the
unitholders in proportion to the number of units owned by each of them as of the opening of the applicable exchange on the first business day of the month (the
"Allocation Date"). However, gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets or, in the discretion of the General Partner, any other extraordinary
item of income, gain, loss or deduction will be allocated among the unitholders on the Allocation Date in the month in which such income, gain, loss or deduction is
recognized. As a result, a unitholder transferring units may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized after the date of transfer.
Although simplifying conventions are contemplated by the Code and most publicly traded partnerships use similar simplifying conventions, the use of this
method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. Recently, however, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued proposed Treasury
Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among
transferor and transferee unitholders, although such tax items must be prorated on a daily basis. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize
the use of the proration method we have adopted. Accordingly, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is unable to opine on the validity of this method of allocating income and
deductions between transferee and transferor unitholders. If this method is not allowed under the final Treasury Regulations, or only applies to transfers of less than
all of the unitholder's interest, our taxable income or losses could be reallocated among our unitholders. We are authorized to revise our method of allocation
between transferee and transferor unitholders, as well as among unitholders whose interests vary during a taxable year, to conform to a method permitted under
future Treasury Regulations.
A unitholder who disposes of units prior to the record date set for a cash distribution for that quarter will be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and
deduction attributable to the month of disposition but will not be entitled to receive a cash distribution for that period.
Notification Requirements
A unitholder who sells or purchases any of its units is generally required to notify us in writing of that transaction within 30 days after the transaction (or, if
earlier, January 15 of the year following the transaction in the case of a seller). Upon receiving such notifications, we are required to notify the IRS of that
transaction and to furnish specified information to the transferor and transferee. Failure to notify us of a transfer of units may, in some cases, lead to the imposition
of penalties. However, these reporting requirements do not apply to a sale by an individual who is a citizen of the United States and who effects the sale through a
broker who will satisfy such requirements.
Constructive Termination
We will be considered to have "constructively" terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes upon the sale or exchange of 50% or more of the
total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For such purposes, multiple sales of the same unit are counted only once. A constructive
termination results in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than the calendar year, the
closing of our taxable year may result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in such unitholder's taxable income for the year of
termination.
A constructive termination occurring on a date other than December 31 generally would require that we file two tax returns for one fiscal year, thereby
increasing our administration and tax preparation costs. However, pursuant to an IRS relief procedure, the IRS may allow a constructively terminated partnership to
provide a single Schedule K-1 for the calendar year in which a termination
30
Table of Contents
occurs. Following a constructive termination, we would be required to make new tax elections, including a new election under Section 754 of the Code, and the
termination would result in a deferral of our deductions for depreciation. A termination could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the
termination had occurred. Moreover, a termination may either accelerate the application of, or subject us to, any tax legislation enacted before the termination that
would not otherwise have been applied to us as a continuing partnership, as opposed to a terminating partnership.
Uniformity of Units
Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of units and for other reasons, we must maintain uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of
the units to a purchaser of these units. In the absence of uniformity, we may be unable to completely comply with a number of federal income tax requirements.
Any non-uniformity could have a negative impact on the value of the units. Please read "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—Section 754 Election."
Our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement permits our General Partner to take positions in filing our tax returns that preserve the uniformity of our
common units. These positions may include reducing the depreciation, amortization or loss deductions to which a unitholder would otherwise be entitled or reporting
a slower amortization of Section 743(b) adjustments for some unitholders than that to which they would otherwise be entitled. Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is unable to
opine as to the validity of such filing positions.
A unitholder's basis in units is reduced by its share of our deductions (whether or not such deductions were claimed on an individual income tax return) so that
any position that we take that understates deductions will overstate the unitholder's basis in its units, and may cause the unitholder to understate gain or overstate
loss on any sale of such units. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss" above and "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—
Section 754 Election" above. The IRS may challenge one or more of any positions we take to preserve the uniformity of units. If such a challenge were sustained,
the uniformity of units might be affected, and, under some circumstances, the gain from the sale of units might be increased without the benefit of additional
deductions.
Tax-Exempt Organizations and Other Investors
Ownership of units by employee benefit plans and other tax-exempt organizations, as well as by non-resident alien individuals, non-U.S. corporations and
other non-U.S. persons (collectively, "Non-U.S. Unitholders") raises issues unique to those investors and, as described below, may have substantially adverse tax
consequences to them. Prospective unitholders that are tax-exempt entities or Non-U.S. Unitholders should consult their tax advisors before investing in our
common units.
Employee benefit plans and most other tax-exempt organizations, including IRAs and other retirement plans, are subject to federal income tax on unrelated
business taxable income. Virtually all of our income will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to a tax-exempt unitholder.
Non U.S. Unitholders are taxed by the United States on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business ("effectively connected income") and on
certain types of U.S.-source non-effectively connected income (such as dividends), unless exempted or further limited by an income tax treaty, and will be treated
as engaged in business in the United States because of their ownership of our common units. Furthermore, it is probable that they will be deemed to conduct such
activities through permanent establishment in the United States within the meaning of any applicable tax treaty. Consequently, they will be required to file federal
tax returns to report their share of our income, gain, loss or deduction and pay federal income tax on their share of our net income or gain. Moreover, under rules
applicable to publicly traded partnerships, distributions to Non-U.S. Unitholders are subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. Each Non-U.S.
Unitholder must obtain a
31
Table of Contents
taxpayer identification number from the IRS and submit that number to our transfer agent on a Form W-8BEN or applicable substitute form in order to obtain credit
for these withholding taxes.
In addition, because a Non-U.S. Unitholder classified as a corporation will be treated as engaged in a United States trade or business, that corporation may be
subject to the U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, in addition to regular federal income tax, on its share of our income and gain as adjusted for changes in the
foreign corporation's "U.S. net equity" to the extent reflected in the corporation's earnings and profits. That tax may be reduced or eliminated by an income tax
treaty between the United States and the country in which the foreign corporate unitholder is a "qualified resident." In addition, this type of unitholder is subject to
special information reporting requirements under Section 6038C of the Code.
A Non-U.S. Unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will be subject to federal income tax on gain realized from the sale or disposition of that unit to
the extent the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Unitholder. Under a ruling published by the IRS interpreting the scope of
"effectively connected income," gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Unitholder from the sale of its interest in a partnership that is engaged in a trade or business in the
United States will be considered to be "effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business. Thus, part or all of a non-U.S. unitholder's gain from the sale or other
disposition of units may be treated as effectively connected with a unitholder's indirect U.S. trade or business constituted by its investment in us. Moreover, under
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, a non-U.S. unitholder generally will be subject to federal income tax upon the sale or disposition of a unit if (i) it
owned (directly or indirectly constructively applying certain attribution rules) more than 5% of our common units at any time during the five-year period ending on the
date of such disposition and (ii) 50% or more of the fair market value of our real property interests and other assets used or held for use in a trade or business
consisted of U.S. real property interests (which include U.S. real estate, including land, improvements, and associated personal property, and interests in certain
entities holding U.S. real estate) at any time during the shorter of the period during which such unitholder held the units or the 5-year period ending on the date of
disposition. More than 50% of our assets may consist of U.S. real property interests. Therefore, non-U.S. unitholders may be subject to federal income tax on gain
from the sale or disposition of their units.
Administrative Matters
Information Returns and Audit Procedures
We intend to furnish to each unitholder, within 90 days after the close of each taxable year, specific tax information, including a Schedule K-1, which
describes its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year. In preparing this information, which will not be reviewed by counsel, we
will take various accounting and reporting positions, some of which have been mentioned earlier, to determine each unitholder's share of income, gain, loss and
deduction. We cannot assure our unitholders that those positions will yield a result that conforms to all of the requirements of the Code, Treasury Regulations or
administrative interpretations of the IRS.
The IRS may audit our federal income tax information returns. Neither we nor Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. can assure prospective unitholders that the IRS will not
successfully challenge the positions we adopt, and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of the units. Adjustments resulting from an IRS audit may
require each unitholder to adjust a prior year's tax liability, and may result in an audit of the unitholder's own return. Any audit of a unitholder's return could result in
adjustments unrelated to our returns.
Publicly traded partnerships generally are treated as entities separate from their owners for purposes of federal income tax audits, judicial review of
administrative adjustments by the IRS, and tax settlement proceedings. The tax treatment of partnership items of income, gain, loss and deduction are
Table of Contents
32
determined in a partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings of the partners. The Code requires that one partner be designated as the "Tax Matters
Partner" for these purposes, and our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement designates our general partner.
The Tax Matters Partner can extend the statute of limitations for assessment of tax deficiencies against unitholders for items in our returns. The Tax Matters
Partner may bind a unitholder with less than a 1% profits interest in us to a settlement with the IRS unless that unitholder elects, by filing a statement with the IRS,
not to give that authority to the Tax Matters Partner. The Tax Matters Partner may seek judicial review, by which all the unitholders are bound, of a final partnership
administrative adjustment and, if the Tax Matters Partner fails to seek judicial review, judicial review may be sought by any unitholder having at least a 1% interest
in profits or by any group of unitholders having in the aggregate at least a 5% interest in profits. However, only one action for judicial review may go forward, and
each unitholder with an interest in the outcome may participate in that action.
A unitholder must file a statement with the IRS identifying the treatment of any item on its federal income tax return that is not consistent with the treatment of
the item on our return. Intentional or negligent disregard of this consistency requirement may subject a unitholder to substantial penalties.
Nominee Reporting
Persons who hold an interest in us as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us:
(1)   the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee;
(2)   a statement regarding whether the beneficial owner is:
(a)   a non-U.S. person;
(b)   a non-U.S. government, an international organization or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing; or
(c)   a tax-exempt entity;
(3)   the amount and description of units held, acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner; and
(4)   specific information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers, means of acquisitions and transfers, and acquisition cost for purchases, as
well as the amount of net proceeds from sales.
Brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information, including whether they are U.S. persons and specific information on units they
acquire, hold or transfer for their own account. A penalty of $100 per failure, up to a maximum of $1.5 million per calendar year, is imposed by the Code for failure to
report that information to us. The nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner of the units with the information furnished to us.
Accuracy-Related Penalties
Certain penalties may be imposed as a result of an underpayment of tax that is attributable to one or more specified causes, including negligence or disregard
of rules or regulations, substantial understatements of income tax and substantial valuation misstatements. No penalty will be imposed, however, for any portion of
an underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for the underpayment of that portion and that the taxpayer acted in good faith regarding the
underpayment of that portion. We do not anticipate that any accuracy-related penalties will be assessed against us.

Table of Contents
State, Local and Other Tax Considerations
In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, and
estate, inheritance or intangibles taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future or in
which the unitholder is a resident. We currently conduct business or own property in several states, many of which currently impose an income tax on nonresident
partners of partnerships doing business within the state. We may also own property or do business in other states in the future that impose income or similar taxes
on nonresident persons owning an interest in us. Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective unitholder should consider
their potential impact on its investment in us.
While you may not be required to file a return and pay taxes in some jurisdictions because your income from that jurisdiction falls below the filing and payment
requirement, you will be required to file income tax returns and pay income taxes in many of the jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and may be
subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. Some of the jurisdictions may require us, or we may elect, to withhold a percentage of income
from amounts to be distributed to a unitholder who is not a resident of the jurisdiction. Withholding, the amount of which may be greater or less than a particular
unitholder's income tax liability to the jurisdiction, generally does not relieve a nonresident unitholder from the obligation to file an income tax return.
It is the responsibility of each unitholder to investigate the legal and tax consequences, under the laws of pertinent jurisdictions, of his investment
in us. We strongly recommend that each prospective unitholder consult, and depend upon, its own tax counsel or other advisor with regard to those
matters. Further, it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all state, local and non-U.S., as well as U.S. federal tax returns that may be required of
it. Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has not rendered an opinion on the state, local, alternative minimum tax or non-U.S. tax consequences of an investment in us.

CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of our common units by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I
of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are
subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other
laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, "Similar Laws"), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to
include "plan assets" (as defined in Section 3(42) of ERISA or any applicable Similar Laws, "Plan Assets") of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a
"Plan").
This summary is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code (and related regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations) as of the date of this
prospectus and is intended to be general in nature. This summary does not purport to be complete and future legislation, court decisions, administrative regulations,
rulings or administrative pronouncements could significantly modify the requirements summarized below. Any of these changes may be retroactive and, therefore,
may apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release.
General Fiduciary Matters
ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an "ERISA
Plan") and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person
who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA
Plan.
In considering an investment in our common units of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance
with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary's duties to the
Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Similar Laws.
Prohibited Transaction Issues
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or
entities who are "parties in interest," within the meaning of ERISA, or "disqualified persons," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption
is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are "governmental plans" (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain "church plans" (as defined
in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar prohibitions under other applicable Similar Laws.
The acquisition and/or holding of the securities by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the initial purchasers are considered a party in interest or a
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued
35
Table of Contents
prohibited transaction class exemptions, or "PTCEs," that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the securities. These class exemptions include, without
limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23
respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from
the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its
affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan
involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no
assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.
Because of the foregoing, our common units should not be purchased or held by any person investing Plan Assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and
holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.
Plan Assets Regulation
The U.S. Department of Labor has issued a regulation, 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, the "Plan Assets Regulation") which
provides that if an ERISA Plan acquires an "equity interest" in an entity that is neither a "publicly offered security" nor a security issued by an investment company
registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the ERISA Plan's assets are deemed, for purposes of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code, to include both the equity interest itself and an undivided interest in each of the entity's underlying assets, unless it is established that the entity is an
"operating company" or that equity participation by benefit plan investors is not "significant." Under the Plan Assets Regulation, an equity interest is defined as any
interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which laws substantial equity features.
If for any reason the underlying assets of the issuers were deemed to be Plan Assets by reason of its investment in our common units, certain transactions
that the issuers might enter into, or may have entered into, in the ordinary course of its business might constitute non-exempt "prohibited transactions" under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded and other provisions of ERISA could be implicated as well.
We do not believe that our common units will be considered Plan Assets for purposes of the Plan Assets Regulation.
Representation
Accordingly, by acceptance of our common units, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of the securities will be deemed to have represented and
warranted that either (i) it is not a Plan and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the securities constitutes Plan Assets
or (ii) the purchase and holding of the common units or securities by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.
The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the
securities on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any
Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the securities.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Under this prospectus, we intend to offer our securities to the public:
•
•
•
through one or more broker-dealers;
through underwriters; or
directly to investors.
We will fix a price or prices of our securities at:
•
•
market prices prevailing at the time of any sale under this registration statement;
prices related to market prices; or
•
negotiated prices.
We may change the price of the securities offered from time to time.
We will pay or allow distributors' or sellers' commissions that will not exceed those customary in the types of transactions involved. Broker-dealers may act as
agent or may purchase securities as principal and thereafter resell the securities from time to time:
•
•
•
•
in or through one or more transactions (which may involve crosses and block transactions) or distributions;
on the NYSE;
in the over-the-counter market; or
in private transactions.
Broker-dealers or underwriters may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and may receive commissions from
purchasers of the securities for whom they may act as agents. If any broker-dealer purchases the securities as principal, it may effect resales of the securities from
time to time to or through other broker-dealers, and other broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of concessions or commissions from the purchasers
of securities for whom they may act as agents.
To the extent required, the names of the specific managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, as well as other important information, will be set forth in
prospectus supplements. In that event, the discounts and commissions we will allow or pay to the underwriters, if any, and the discounts and commissions the
underwriters may allow or pay to dealers or agents, if any, will be set forth in, or may be calculated from, the prospectus supplements. Any underwriters, brokers,
dealers and agents who participate in any sale of the securities may also engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us or our affiliates in the ordinary
course of their businesses. We may indemnify underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents against specific liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
Offers to purchase securities may be solicited directly by us and the sale thereof may be made by us directly to institutional investors or others, who may be
deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any resale thereof. The terms of any such sales will be described in the
prospectus supplement relating thereto.
We may offer our common units into an existing trading market on the terms described in the prospectus supplement relating thereto. Underwriters and
dealers who may participate in any at-the-market offerings will be described in the prospectus supplement relating thereto.
37
Table of Contents
The aggregate maximum compensation the underwriters will receive in connection with the sale of any securities under this prospectus and the registration
statement of which it forms a part will not exceed 10% of the gross proceeds from the sale.
Because Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") views our common units as interests in a direct participation program, any offering of
common units under the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part will be made in compliance with Rule 2310 of the FINRA Rules.
To the extent required, this prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. The place and time of
delivery for the securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered will be set forth in the accompanying prospectus supplement.
In connection with offerings under this shelf registration and in compliance with applicable law, underwriters, brokers or dealers may engage in transactions
which stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at levels above those which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Specifically, underwriters,
brokers or dealers may over-allot in connection with offerings, creating a short position in the securities for their own accounts. For the purpose of covering a
syndicate short position or stabilizing the price of the securities, the underwriters, brokers or dealers may place bids for the securities or effect purchases of the
securities in the open market. Finally, the underwriters may impose a penalty whereby selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other brokers or
dealers for distribution of the securities in offerings may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed securities in transactions
to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities,
which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market, and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

Representing Limited Partner Interests
Up to 19,954,389 of our common units may be offered from time to time by the selling unitholder named in this prospectus. We are registering the offer and

selling any common units under this prospectus and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common units by the selling unitholder. The common units
offered hereby will be issued to the selling unitholder upon conversion of its Class B units which were issued to the selling unitholder on December 29, 2011 to be

described under "Risk Factors," which begin on page 3 of this prospectus, before you make an investment in our securities.
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities or determined if this
prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON UNITS
The Units
The common units, the Class A units and the Class B units represent limited partner interests in us. The holders of units (other than the Class B units) are
generally entitled to participate in partnership distributions and exercise the rights or privileges available to limited partners under the Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement (as defined under "Partnership Agreement" below). For a description of the relative rights and preferences of holders of common units,
Class A units and Class B units in and to partnership distributions, please read "Cash Distribution Policy." For a description of the rights and privileges of limited
partners under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, including voting rights, please read "Partnership Agreement."
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Duties
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. serves as registrar and transfer agent for the common units. We pay all fees charged by the transfer agent for transfers of common
units, except the following that must be paid by unitholders:
•
•
•
surety bond premiums to replace lost or stolen certificates, taxes and other governmental charges;
special charges for services requested by a holder of a common unit; and
other similar fees or charges.
There is no charge to unitholders for disbursements of our cash distributions. We will indemnify the transfer agent, its agents and each of their stockholders,
directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any
liability due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity.
Resignation or Removal
The transfer agent may resign, by notice to us, or be removed by us. The resignation or removal of the transfer agent will become effective upon our
appointment of a successor transfer agent and registrar and its acceptance of the appointment. If no successor has been appointed and accepted the appointment
within 30 days after notice of the resignation or removal, our general partner may act as the transfer agent and registrar until a successor is appointed.
Transfer of Common Units
The transfer of the common units to persons that purchase directly from the underwriters will be accomplished through the completion, execution and delivery
of a transfer application by the investor. Any later transfers of a common unit will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by us unless the transferee
executes and delivers a transfer application. By executing and delivering a transfer application, the transferee of common units:
becomes the record holder of the common units and is an assignee until admitted into our partnership as a substituted limited partner;
automatically requests admission as a substituted limited partner in our partnership;
agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of, and executes, the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
5
represents that the transferee has the capacity, power and authority to enter into the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
grants powers of attorney to officers of our general partner and any liquidator of us as specified in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
and
•
•
•
•
•
•
makes the consents and waivers contained in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement.
An assignee will become a substituted limited partner of our partnership for the transferred common units upon the consent of our general partner and the
recording of the name of the assignee on our books and records. Our general partner may withhold its consent in its sole discretion. A transferee's broker, agent or
nominee may complete, execute and deliver a transfer application. We are entitled to treat the nominee holder of a common unit as the absolute owner. In that
case, the beneficial holder's rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and
the nominee holder.
Common units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing transfer of securities. In addition to other rights acquired upon transfer, the
transferor gives the transferee the right to request admission as a substituted limited partner in our partnership for the transferred common units. A purchaser or
transferee of common units who does not execute and deliver a transfer application obtains only:
the right to assign the common unit to a purchaser or other transferee; and
•
•
the right to transfer the right to seek admission as a substituted limited partner in our partnership for the transferred common units.
Thus, a purchaser or transferee of common units who does not execute and deliver a transfer application:
will not receive cash distributions or federal income tax allocations, unless the common units are held in a nominee or "street name" account and the
nominee or broker has executed and delivered a transfer application; and
•
•
may not receive some federal income tax information or reports furnished to record holders of common units.
The transferor of common units has a duty to provide the transferee with all information that may be necessary to transfer the common units. The transferor
does not have a duty to insure the execution of the transfer application by the transferee and has no liability or responsibility if the transferee neglects or chooses
not to execute and forward the transfer application to the transfer agent. Please read "Partnership Agreement—Status as Limited Partner or Assignee."
Until a common unit has been transferred on our books, we and the transfer agent may treat the record holder of the unit as the absolute owner for all
purposes, except as otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.

CASH DISTRIBUTION POLICY
Distributions of Available Cash
General.    Within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders of record on the applicable record date. We
will make distributions of available cash to all common unitholders and Class A unitholders, pro rata and we will make distributions of Hydrocarbon Available Cash
(as defined below) pro rata to our common unitholders. Class B unitholders are not entitled to participate in our distributions of available cash or of Hydrocarbon
Available Cash prior to their conversion into common units. For a description of the conversion of Class B units to common units, please read "Partnership
Agreement—Partnership Class B Units."
Definition of Available Cash.    We define available cash in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and it generally means, for each fiscal quarter:
all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter (excluding cash at MarkWest Hydrocarbon);
less the amount of cash that our general partner determines in its reasonable discretion is necessary or appropriate to:
•
•
•
provide for the proper conduct of our business;
comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments, or other agreements; or
provide funds for distributions to our unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters;
•
•
•
plus all cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings
made after the end of the quarter. Working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under our revolving credit facility and in all cases
are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners.
Hydrocarbon Available Cash.    Generally, Hydrocarbon Available Cash is defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand derived from or attributable to our
ownership of, or sale or other disposition of, the shares of common stock of MarkWest Hydrocarbon.
Contractual Restrictions on Our Ability to Distribute Available Cash.    Our ability to distribute available cash is contractually restricted by the terms of our
credit agreement. Our credit agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. We are prohibited from making
any distribution to unitholders if such distribution would cause an event of default or otherwise violate a covenant under our credit agreement or our indentures
governing our outstanding notes. There is no guarantee that we will pay a quarterly distribution.
Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation
If we dissolve in accordance with the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process called
liquidation. We will first apply the proceeds of liquidation to the payment of our creditors. We will distribute any remaining proceeds to our unitholders, including the
holders of Class B units that convert to common units upon liquidation, in accordance with their capital account balances, as adjusted to reflect any gain or loss
upon the sale or other disposition of our assets in liquidation.
This prospectus covers the offering for resale of up to 19,954,389 common units by the selling unitholder, subject to any appropriate adjustment as a result of
any subdivision, split, combination, or
SELLING UNITHOLDER

reclassification of any common units. The selling unitholder acquired Class B units representing limited partnership interests convertible into common units on
December 29, 2011, to be effective December 31, 2011, pursuant to a contribution agreement in connection with our acquisition of the selling unitholder's interest in
MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C. (See "Item I. Business—Organizational Structure" and "—Acquisition of Non-controlling Interest in MarkWest
Liberty Midstream," incorporated by reference in this prospectus from our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011). We are registering
the common units into which the Class B units convert described below pursuant to registration rights agreements entered into by us and the selling unitholder in
connection with such transaction. The common units offered hereby will be issued to the selling unitholder upon conversion of its Class B units. The Class B units
convert to common units on a one for one basis in five installments beginning on July 1, 2013 (with 3,990,877 Class B units converting on such date) and each of
the first four anniversaries of such date (with 3,990,878 Class B units converting on each such anniversary). Upon the election of the Partnership or the holders of
the Class B units, the Class B units will convert to common units in the event of certain fundamental changes or the liquidation of the Partnership.
No offer or sale may be made by a unitholder unless that unitholder is listed in the table below. The selling unitholder may sell all, some or none of the
common units covered by this prospectus. Please read "Plan of Distribution." We will bear all reasonable costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
registration of the common units offered by this prospectus. Brokerage commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of common units
will be borne by the selling unitholder.
No such sales may occur unless this prospectus has been declared effective by the SEC, and remains effective at the time such selling unitholder offers or
sells such common units. We are required to update this prospectus to reflect material developments in our business, financial position and results of operations.
The following table sets forth, the name of the selling unitholder, the amount of common units owned and the percentage of outstanding common units owned
by the selling unitholder prior to the offering (assuming the conversion of all Class B units into common units), the number of common units being offered for the
selling unitholder's account, and the amount to be owned and the percentage of common units outstanding owned by the selling unitholder following the completion
of the offering (assuming the selling unitholder sells all of the common units covered by this prospectus). The percentages of common units outstanding have been
calculated based on 117,594,365 common units outstanding as of September 30, 2012, and assumes the conversion of all 19,954,389 Class B units into common
units.
We have prepared the table and the related notes based on information supplied to us by the selling unitholder. We have not sought to verify such information.

On December 29, 2011, to be effective December 31, 2011, the selling unitholder, an affiliate of The Energy & Minerals Group, sold its equity interests in
MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C. to the Partnership in exchange for the Class B units, as well as other cash consideration. The Class B
Units automatically convert on a one for one basis into Partnership common units in five installments beginning on July 1, 2013 (with 3,990,877 Class B
units converting on such date) and each of the first four anniversaries of such date (with 3,990,878 Class B units converting on each such anniversary). The
members of the selling unitholder are NGP Midstream &
8
Resources, LP ("NGP MR"), NGP M&R Offshore Holdings, LP ("NGP MR Offshore"), Midstream & Resources Follow-on Fund, LP ("MR FOF"), Liberty M&R
SPV, LP ("Liberty") and Liberty M&R SPV II, LP ("Liberty II"), all of which are affiliates of The Energy & Minerals Group. The general partner of NGP MR and
NGP MR Offshore is NGP MR, LP ("MR GP"). The general partner of MR FOF, Liberty and Liberty II is M&R FOF GP, LP ("FOF GP" and, together with
MR GP, the "General Partners"). John Raymond is chief executive officer of the General Partners. The General Partners and Mr. Raymond may be deemed
to beneficially own the Class B units held by M&R MWE Liberty, LLC. Each of the General Partners and Mr. Raymond disclaim beneficial ownership of such
Class B units, except to the extent of any pecuniary interest therein.
The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement dated February 21, 2008, as
amended by the Amendment No. 1 dated December 29, 2011, which is referred to herein as the "Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement."
We summarize the following provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement elsewhere in this prospectus:
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
with regard to cash available for distribution, please read "Cash Distribution Policy."
with regard to the transfer of Partnership common units, please read "Description of the Common Units—Transfer of Common Units."
•
•
•
with regard to allocations of taxable income and taxable loss, please read "Material Tax Consequences."
Organization and Duration
We were organized on January 25, 2002 and will have a perpetual existence, unless dissolved in accordance with Article XII of the Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement.
Purpose
Our purpose under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement is limited to serving as a member of our operating company, MarkWest Energy
Operating Company, L.L.C., which we refer to as "Opco," and engaging in any business activities that may be engaged in by Opco or that are approved by
MarkWest Energy GP, L.L.C. (the "General Partner"). All of our operations are conducted through Opco and its subsidiaries or MarkWest Hydrocarbon. We own
100% of the outstanding membership interest of Opco and 100% of the outstanding common stock of MarkWest Hydrocarbon. The limited liability company
agreement of Opco provides that Opco may, directly or indirectly, engage in:
its operations as conducted immediately before our initial public offering;
any other activity approved by the General Partner, but only to the extent that the General Partner reasonably determines that, as of the date of the
acquisition or commencement of the activity, the activity generates "qualifying income" as this term is defined in Section 7704 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); or
•
•
•
any activity that enhances the operations of an activity that is described in either of the two preceding clauses or any other activity provided such
activity does not affect our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
The General Partner is authorized in general to perform all acts deemed necessary to carry out our purposes and to conduct our business.
9
Power of Attorney
Each limited partner, and each person who acquires one of our common units from one of our unitholders and executes and delivers a transfer application,
grants to the General Partner and, if appointed, a liquidator, a power of attorney to, among other things, execute and file documents required for our qualification,
continuance or dissolution. The power of attorney also grants the General Partner the authority to amend, and to make consents and waivers under, the Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement subject to the terms thereof.
Capital Contributions
Our unitholders are not obligated to make additional capital contributions, except as described below under "—Limited Liability."
Partnership Class A Units
Class A units represent limited partner interests in us and have identical rights and obligations of our common units except that Class A units (a) do not have
the right to vote on, approve or disapprove, or otherwise consent to or not consent to any matter (including mergers, share exchanges and similar statutory
authorizations) except as otherwise required by any non-waivable provision of law and (b) do not share in any cash and cash equivalents on hand, income, gains,
losses, deductions and credits that are derived from or attributable to our ownership of, or sale or disposition of, the shares of MarkWest Hydrocarbon common
stock.
Partnership Class B Units
Class B units represent limited partner interests in us that will convert into common units in five annual installments beginning on July 1, 2013 (with 3,990,877
Class B units converting on such date) and each of the first four anniversaries of such date (with 3,990,878 Class B units converting on each such anniversary).
Further, prior to the conversion of the Class B units into common units, the Class B units are not entitled to vote on any matters on which the holders of common
units are entitled to vote, other than those matters that disproportionately and adversely affect the rights and preferences of the Class B units in relation to other
classes of interests in the Partnership. In such cases, the holders of Class B units are entitled to vote together as a single class. Class B units are not entitled to
participate in any distributions of available cash prior to their conversion.
Limited Liability
Assuming that a limited partner does not participate in the control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware Act and that he otherwise acts in
conformity with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, his liability under the Delaware Act will be limited, subject to possible
exceptions, to the amount of capital he is obligated to contribute to us for his common units in us plus his share of any undistributed profits and assets. If it were
determined, however, that the right, or exercise of the right, by the limited partners as a group:
to approve some amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement; or
•
•
to take other action under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement
constituted "participation in the control" of our business for the purposes of the Delaware Act, then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our
obligations under the laws of Delaware, to the same extent as the General Partner. This liability would extend to persons who transact business with us who
reasonably believe that a limited partner is a general partner based on the limited partner's conduct. Neither the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement nor
the Delaware Act specifically provides for legal recourse against the General Partner if a limited partner were to lose
10
limited liability through any fault of the General Partner. While this does not mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse, we know of no precedent for
this type of a claim in Delaware case law.
Under the Delaware Act, a limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if, after the distribution, all liabilities of the limited partnership, other
than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of us, would
exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited partnership. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited partnership, the Delaware Act
provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited will be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the
extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the nonrecourse liability. The Delaware Act provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at
the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Delaware Act will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three
years from the date of distribution. Under the Delaware Act, an assignee who becomes a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the
obligations of his assignor to make contributions to us, except the assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a limited partner
and that could not be ascertained from the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement.
Our subsidiaries conduct business in multiple states. Maintenance of our limited liability as a member of Opco may require compliance with legal requirements
in the jurisdictions in which Opco conducts business, including qualifying our subsidiaries to do business there. Limitations on the liability of members for the
obligations of a limited liability company have not been clearly established in many jurisdictions. If, by virtue of our membership interest in Opco or otherwise, it
were determined that we were conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership or limited liability company statute, or
that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group to remove or replace the General Partner, to approve some amendments to the Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement, or to take other action under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement constituted "participation in the control" of
our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction, then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the law of that
jurisdiction to the same extent as the General Partner under the circumstances. We will operate in a manner that the General Partner considers reasonable and
necessary or appropriate to preserve the limited liability of the limited partners.
Voting Rights
The following matters specified below require a vote of our common unitholders.
11
Election of directors of the General Partner
Amendment of the Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement
Merger or the sale of all or substantially all of our
assets
Dissolution of us
Amendment of the limited liability company
agreement and other action taken by us as sole
member of Opco
Plurality of the votes cast at meetings of the limited partners.
Certain amendments may be made by the General Partner without the approval of our unitholders. Other
amendments generally require the approval of a majority of our outstanding common units. Please read
"—Amendment of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement."
Majority of our outstanding common units. Please read "—Merger, Sale or Other Disposition of Assets."
Majority of our outstanding common units. Please read "—Termination and Dissolution."
Majority of our outstanding common units if such amendment or other action would adversely affect our
limited partners (or any particular class of limited partners) in any material respect. Please read "—
Action Relating to the Operating Company."
Additionally, we are prohibited from taking action that would disproportionately and adversely affect the rights and preferences of the Class B units in relation
to other classes of interests in the Partnership without the consent of the holders of the Class B units.
Issuance of Additional Securities
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities and rights to buy
partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by the General Partner in its sole discretion without the approval of our
unitholders.
It is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the issuance of additional common units in us or other equity securities. Holders of any additional common
units in us that we issue will be entitled to share equally with the then-existing holders of our common units in distributions of available cash. In addition, the
issuance of additional partnership interests may dilute the value of the interests of the then-existing holders of our common units in our net assets.
In accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, we may also issue additional partnership interests
that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, have special voting rights to which holders of our common units are not entitled.
Amendment of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement
General.    Amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of the General Partner, which
consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion, except as discussed below. In order to adopt a proposed amendment, other than the
12
amendments discussed below, the General Partner must seek written approval of the holders of the number of our common units required to approve the
amendment or call a meeting of the limited partners to consider and vote upon the proposed amendment. Except as described below, an amendment must be
approved by a majority of our outstanding common units.
Prohibited Amendments.    No amendment may be made that would:
•
enlarge the obligations of any limited partner without its consent, unless approved by at least a majority of the type or class of limited partner interests
so affected;
enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise
payable by us to the General Partner or any of its affiliates without the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
discretion;
change the term of the Partnership;
provide that we are not dissolved upon an election to dissolve us by the General Partner that is approved by a majority of outstanding common units;
or
•
•
•
•
give any person the right to dissolve us other than the General Partner's right to dissolve us with the approval of a majority of our outstanding
common units.
The provision of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement preventing the amendments having the effects described in any of the clauses above can
be amended upon the approval of the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding common units voting together as a single class.
No Partnership Unitholder Approval.    The General Partner may generally make amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement without
the approval of any limited partner or assignee to reflect:
a change in our name, the location of our principal place of business, our registered agent or our registered office;
the admission, substitution, withdrawal, or removal of partners, as applicable, in accordance with the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
a change that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, is necessary or advisable for us to qualify or to continue our qualification as a limited
partnership or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability under the laws of any state or to ensure that none of us, Opco and its
subsidiaries will be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes;
an amendment that is necessary, in the opinion of our counsel, to prevent us or the General Partner or its directors, officers, agents, or trustees from
in any manner being subjected to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or plan asset
regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, whether or not substantially similar to plan asset regulations
currently applied or proposed;
subject to the limitations on the issuance of additional partnership securities described above, an amendment that in the discretion of the General
Partner is necessary or advisable for the authorization of additional partnership securities or rights to acquire partnership securities;
any amendment expressly permitted in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement to be made by the General Partner acting alone;
an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a redemption and merger agreement that has been approved in accordance with the terms
of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
13
any amendment that, in the discretion of the General Partner, is necessary or advisable for the formation by us of, or our investment in, any
corporation, partnership or other entity, as otherwise permitted by the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement;
a merger or conveyance the sole purpose of which is to effect a change in the legal form of us to another limited liability entity;
a change in our fiscal year or taxable year and related changes; or
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
any other amendments substantially similar to any of the matters described in the clauses above.
In addition, the General Partner may make amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement without the approval of any limited partner or
assignee if those amendments, in the discretion of the general partner:
•
•
•
•
do not adversely affect the limited partners (or any particular class of limited partners) in any material respect;
are necessary or advisable to satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of any
federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained in any federal or state statute;
are necessary or advisable to facilitate the trading of limited partner interests or to comply with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any
securities exchange on which the limited partner interests are or will be listed for trading, compliance with any of which the General Partner deems to
be in our best interest and the best interest of the limited partners;
are necessary or advisable for any action taken by the General Partner relating to splits or combinations of units under the provisions of the Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement; or
•
are required to effect the intent of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement or are otherwise contemplated by the Amended
and Restated Partnership Agreement.
Opinion of Counsel and Partnership Unitholder Approval.    The General Partner will not be required to obtain an opinion of counsel that an amendment will not
result in a loss of limited liability to the limited partners or result in us being treated as an entity for federal income tax purposes if one of the amendments described
above under "—No Partnership Unitholder Approval" should occur. No other amendments to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement will become
effective without the approval of holders of at least 90% of the outstanding Partnership common units unless we obtain an opinion of counsel to the effect that the
amendment will not affect the limited liability under applicable law of any of our limited partners or cause us, Opco or its subsidiaries to be taxable as a corporation
or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously taxed as such).
Any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any type or class of outstanding units in relation to other classes of
units will require the approval of at least a majority of the type or class of units so affected. Any amendment that reduces the voting percentage required to take
any action must be approved by the affirmative vote of limited partners constituting not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced.
Amendments requiring 80% of the Outstanding Partnership Common Units.    Any amendments regarding provisions dealing with amendments to the
Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, limited partner meetings and related to election of the directors of the General Partner board at annual meetings,
quorum, action without a meeting and voting rights cannot be amended without 80% of our outstanding common units voting in favor of such amendments.
14
Action Relating to the Operating Company
Without the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units, the General Partner is prohibited from consenting on our behalf, as the sole
member of Opco, to any amendment to the limited liability company agreement of Opco or taking any action on our behalf permitted to be taken by a member of
Opco in each case that would adversely affect our limited partners (or any particular class of limited partners) in any material respect.
Merger, Sale or Other Disposition of Assets
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement generally prohibits the General Partner, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of our
outstanding common units, from causing us to, among other things, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation or other combination, or approving on our behalf the sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of our subsidiaries as a whole. The General Partner may, however, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in all or substantially all of our assets without that approval. The General Partner may also sell all or substantially all of our assets under a
foreclosure or other realization upon those encumbrances without such approval.
If conditions specified in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement are satisfied, the General Partner may merge us or any of our subsidiaries into, or
convey some or all of our assets to, a newly formed entity if the sole purpose of that merger or conveyance is to change our legal form into another limited liability
entity. Our unitholders are not entitled to appraisal rights under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement or applicable Delaware law in the event of a
merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event for such purpose.
Termination and Dissolution
We will continue as a limited partnership until terminated under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. We will dissolve upon:
the election of the General Partner to dissolve us, if approved by the holders of a majority of our outstanding common units;
the sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets and properties and our subsidiaries;
the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of us; or
•
•
•
•
the withdrawal of the General Partner in violation of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and the successor general partner is not
admitted.
Liquidation and Distribution of Proceeds
Upon our dissolution, the liquidator authorized to wind up our affairs will, acting with all of the powers of the General Partner that the liquidator deems
necessary or desirable in its judgment, liquidate our assets and apply the proceeds of the liquidation as provided in "Cash Distribution Policy—Distributions of Cash
Upon Liquidation." The liquidator may defer liquidation of our assets for a reasonable period or distribute assets to partners in kind if it determines that a sale would
be impractical or would cause undue loss to the partners.
15
No Withdrawal or Removal of the General Partner
The General Partner cannot withdraw and cannot be removed at any time for any reason. Any attempt of withdrawal or removal of the General Partner will be
null and void. Nonetheless, if the General Partner withdraws in violation of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement:
•
•
•
•
•
the withdrawing General Partner must give 90 days' notice to the limited partners;
the successor general partner will be elected by a plurality of the votes of our unitholders at a special meeting or an annual meeting;
the successor general partner elected will be admitted to the Partnership as the general partner effective immediately prior to the withdrawal of the
predecessor general partner;
the successor general partner elected will automatically become the successor general partner or managing member of our subsidiaries; and
if the successor general partner is elected, we will not be dissolved and the successor general partner will continue the business of us.
Transfer of General Partner Interests
The General Partner interests cannot be transferred to any person for any reason. So long as we are a limited partnership, 100% of the General Partner
interests will be owned by the Partnership or one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Change of Management Provisions
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement contains specific provisions that are intended to discourage a person or group from attempting to remove
MarkWest Energy GP, L.L.C. as the general partner or otherwise change management. If any person or group other than the General Partner and its affiliates
acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of any class of units, that person or group loses voting rights on all of its units. This loss of voting rights does not
apply to any person or group who acquires the units with the prior approval of the board of the General Partner.
Meetings; Voting
Except as described below regarding a person or group owning 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding and except for Class A units and Class B
units as described above, unitholders or assignees who are record holders of our common units on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
meetings of our limited partners and to act upon matters for which approvals may be solicited. Our common units that are owned by an assignee who is a record
holder, but who has not yet been admitted as a limited partner, will be voted by the General Partner at the written direction of the record holder. Absent direction of
this kind, our common units will not be voted.
Any action that is required or permitted to be taken by unitholders may be taken either at a meeting of our unitholders or without a meeting if consents in
writing describing the action so taken are signed by holders of the number of units necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting. Meetings of our
unitholders may be called by the General Partner or by our unitholders owning at least 20% of our outstanding common units. Our unitholders may vote either in
person or by proxy at meetings. The holders of a majority of the outstanding common units, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum unless any
action by our unitholders requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of our common units, in which case the quorum will be the greater percentage.
However, if at any time any person or group, other than the General Partner and its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of the General
Partner or its affiliates, or any person or
16
group who acquires the units with the prior approval of the General Partner, acquires, in the aggregate, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of any class of units
then outstanding, that person or group will lose voting rights on all of its units and the units may not be voted on any matter and will not be considered to be
outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes. Our
common units held in nominee or street name account will be voted by the broker or other nominee in accordance with the instruction of the beneficial owner unless
the arrangement between the beneficial owner and his nominee provides otherwise.
Any notice, demand, request, report or proxy material required or permitted to be given or made to record holders of our common units under the Amended and
Restated Partnership Agreement will be delivered to the record holder by us or by the transfer agent.
The annual meeting of the limited partners holding our common units will be held in June each year or on such other date and time as may be fixed from time
to time by the General Partner. Notice of the annual meeting will be given between ten days and 60 days prior to the meeting date. The limited partners holding our
common units will vote together as a single class. The limited partners entitled to vote will elect by plurality of the votes cast at such meeting the directors of the
General Partner. Each of our common units is entitled to one vote for each of our common units that is registered in the name of the limited partner on the record
date for the meeting. The General Partner, the Partnership or their affiliates cannot vote their units that they are otherwise entitled to vote, and those units are not
considered to be outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum.
Board of Directors
The number of directors of the General Partner board will be between seven and eleven, but the number of the directors may be changed by the majority of the
directors of the General Partner board so long as the decrease in number does not shorten the term of any incumbent director. Unless otherwise previously elected
at a special meeting, at each annual meeting of the limited partners, the directors will be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting. Each director will hold
office for the term for which such director is elected or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. Any vacancies may be filled, until the next annual
meeting, by a majority of the remaining directors then in office. A director may be removed only for cause and only upon a vote of the majority of the remaining
directors then in office. If the SEC promulgates a rule that provides for nominations by the stockholders or the unitholders of publicly traded companies of persons
for election to the board of directors, the Partnership and the General Partner will adopt such rule as applied to a corporation without regard to any exemptions
provided to limited partnerships.
Status as Limited Partner or Assignee
Except as described above under "—Limited Liability," our common units will be fully paid, and our unitholders will not be required to make additional
contributions.
An assignee of one of our common units, after executing and delivering a transfer application, but pending its admission as a substituted limited partner, is
entitled to an interest equivalent to that of a limited partner for the right to share in allocations and distributions from us, including liquidating distributions. The
General Partner will vote and exercise other powers attributable to our common units owned by an assignee that has not become a substitute limited partner at the
written direction of the assignee. Please read "—Meetings; Voting" above. Transferees that do not execute and deliver a transfer application will not be treated as
assignees nor as record holders of our common units, and will not receive cash distributions, federal income tax allocations or reports furnished to holders of our
common units. Please read "Description of the Common Units—Transfer of Common Units."
17
Non-citizen Assignees; Redemption
If we are or become subject to federal, state or local laws or regulations that, in the reasonable determination of the General Partner, create a substantial risk
of cancellation or forfeiture of any property that we have an interest in because of the nationality, citizenship or other related status of any limited partner or
assignee, we may redeem the units held by the limited partner or assignee at their current market price. In order to avoid any cancellation or forfeiture, the General
Partner may require each limited partner or assignee to furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or related status. If a limited partner or assignee fails to
furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or other related status within 30 days after a request for the information or the General Partner determines, with
the advice of counsel, after receipt of the information that the limited partner or assignee is not an eligible citizen, the limited partner or assignee may be treated as
a non-citizen assignee and the General Partner will be substituted for such non-citizen assignee as the limited partner in respect of his limited partner interests. In
addition to other limitations on the rights of an assignee that is not a substituted limited partner, a non-citizen assignee does not have the right to direct the voting
of his units and may not receive distributions in kind upon our liquidation.
Indemnification
Under the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, in most circumstances, we will indemnify the following persons, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, from and against all losses, claims, damages or similar events:
•
the General Partner;
any person who is or was an affiliate of the General Partner or any departing general partner;
any person who is or was a member, partner, officer, director, employee, agent or trustee of us, Opco, any of their subsidiaries, the General Partner or
any affiliate of us, Opco or any of their subsidiaries; or
•
•
•
any person who is or was serving at the request of a general partner or any departing general partner or any affiliate of a general partner or any
departing general partner as an officer, director, employee, member, partner, agent or trustee of another person.
Any indemnification under these provisions will only be out of our assets. The General Partner and its affiliates will not be personally liable for, or have any
obligation to contribute or loan funds or assets to us to enable us to effectuate indemnification. We may purchase insurance against liabilities asserted against and
expenses incurred by persons in connection with our activities, regardless of whether we would have the power to indemnify the person against liabilities under the
Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement.
Books and Reports
The General Partner is required to keep appropriate books and records of our business at our principal offices. The books will be maintained for both tax and
financial reporting purposes on an accrual basis. For tax and financial reporting purposes, our fiscal year is the calendar year.
We will furnish or make available to record holders of common units, within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, an annual report containing audited
financial statements and a report on those financial statements by our independent public accountants. Except for our fourth quarter, we will also furnish or make
available summary financial information within 90 days after the close of each quarter.
We will furnish each record holder of a unit with information reasonably required for tax reporting purposes within 90 days after the close of each calendar year.
This information is expected to be furnished in summary form so that some complex calculations normally required of partners can be
18
avoided. Our ability to furnish this summary information to unitholders will depend on the cooperation of unitholders in supplying us with specific information. Every
unitholder will receive information to assist him in determining his federal and state tax liability and filing his federal and state income tax returns, regardless of
whether he supplies us with information.
Right to Inspect the Partnership's Books and Records
The Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement provides that a limited partner can, for a purpose reasonably related to his interest as a limited partner,
upon reasonable written demand and at his own expense, have furnished to him:
•
•
•
•
•
•
a current list of the name and last known address of each limited partner;
a copy of our tax returns;
information as to the amount of cash, and a description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or services, contributed or to be
contributed by each limited partner and the date on which each became a limited partner;
copies of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, our certificate of limited partnership, related amendments and powers of attorney under
which they have been executed;
information regarding the status of our business and financial condition; and
any other information regarding our affairs as is just and reasonable.
The General Partner may, and intends to, keep confidential from the limited partners trade secrets or other information the disclosure of which the general
partner believes in good faith is not in our or our subsidiaries' best interests, could damage us or our subsidiaries or which we or our subsidiaries are required by law
or by agreements with third parties to keep confidential.
19
MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
This section summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to prospective unitholders and is based upon current
provisions of the Code, existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and current administrative rulings and court
decisions, all of which are subject to change. Changes in these authorities may cause the federal income tax consequences to a prospective unitholder to vary
substantially from those described below. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to "we" or "us" are references to MarkWest Energy
Partners, L.P. and our subsidiaries.
Legal conclusions contained in this section, unless otherwise noted, are the opinion of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. and are based on the accuracy of
representations made by us to them for this purpose. However, this section does not address all federal income tax matters that affect us or our unitholders and
does not describe the application of the alternative minimum tax that may be applicable to certain unitholders. Furthermore, this section focuses on unitholders who
are individual citizens or residents of the United States (for federal income tax purposes), who have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and who hold units
as capital assets (generally, property that is held for investment). This section has limited applicability to corporations, partnerships (including entities treated as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), estates, trusts, non-resident aliens or other unitholders subject to specialized tax treatment, such as tax-
exempt institutions, non-U.S. persons, individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"), employee benefit plans, real estate investment trusts or mutual funds. Accordingly,
we encourage each unitholder to consult the unitholder's own tax advisor in analyzing the federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences particular
to that unitholder resulting from ownership or disposition of units and potential changes in applicable tax laws.
We are relying on opinions and advice of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. with respect to the matters described herein. An opinion of counsel represents only that
counsel's best legal judgment and does not bind the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or a court. Accordingly, the opinions and statements made herein may not
be sustained by a court if contested by the IRS. Any such contest of the matters described herein may materially and adversely impact the market for our common
units and the prices at which our common units trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general
partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution. Furthermore, the tax consequences of an investment in us may be significantly modified by
future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions, which may be retroactively applied.
For the reasons described below, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has not rendered an opinion with respect to the following federal income tax issues: (1) the treatment
of a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a short seller to cover a short sale of units) (please read "—Tax Consequences of
Unit Ownership—Treatment of Securities Loans"); (2) whether our monthly convention for allocating taxable income and losses is permitted by existing Treasury
Regulations (please read "—Disposition of Units—Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees"); and (3) whether our method for taking into account
Section 743 adjustments is sustainable in certain cases (please read "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—Section 754 Election" and "—Uniformity of Units").
Taxation of the Partnership
Partnership Status
We expect to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, generally will not be liable for entity-level federal income taxes.
Instead, as described below, each of our unitholders will take into account its respective share of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its
federal income tax liability as if the unitholder had earned such income
20
directly, even if we make no cash distributions to the unitholder. Distributions we make to a unitholder generally will not give rise to income or gain taxable to such
unitholder unless the amount of cash distributed exceeds the unitholder's adjusted tax basis in its units.
Section 7704 of the Code generally provides that publicly traded partnerships will be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes. However, if 90%
or more of a partnership's gross income for every taxable year it is publicly traded consists of "qualifying income," the partnership may continue to be treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes (the "Qualifying Income Exception"). Qualifying income includes income and gains derived from the exploration and
production, refining, transportation, storage, processing and marketing of certain natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, and products thereof. Other
types of qualifying income include interest (other than from a financial business), dividends, gains from the sale of real property and gains from the sale or other
disposition of capital assets held for the production of qualifying income. We estimate that less than 2% of our current gross income is not qualifying income;
however, this estimate could change from time to time.
Based upon factual representations made by us and our general partner regarding the composition of our income and the other representations set forth below,
Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is of the opinion that we will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and each of our operating subsidiaries will be
disregarded as an entity separate from us for federal income tax purposes. In rendering its opinion, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has relied on factual representations
made by us and our general partner. The representations made by us and our general partner upon which Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has relied include, without
limitation:
(a)   Neither we nor any of our operating subsidiaries has elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes;
(b)   For each taxable year, since and including the year of our initial public offering, more than 90% of our gross income has been and will be income of
a character that Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has opined is "qualifying income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code; and
(c)   Each hedging transaction that we treat as resulting in qualifying income has been and will be appropriately identified as a hedging transaction
pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations, and has been and will be associated with oil, natural gas, or products thereof that are held or to be held by us in
activities that Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P. has opined or will opine result in qualifying income.
We believe that these representations are true and will be true in the future.
If we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, other than a failure that is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable
time after discovery (in which case the IRS may also require us to make adjustments with respect to our unitholders or pay other amounts), we will be treated as
transferring all of our assets, subject to liabilities, to a newly formed corporation, on the first day of the year in which we fail to meet the Qualifying Income
Exception, in return for stock in that corporation and then as distributing that stock to our unitholders in liquidation. This deemed contribution and liquidation should
not result in the recognition of taxable income by our unitholders or us so long as our liabilities do not exceed the tax basis of our assets. Thereafter, we would be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by
administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider substantive
changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. One such recent legislative proposal would eliminate the qualifying income
exception
21
upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any such changes will be reintroduced
or will ultimately be enacted. However, it is possible that a change in law could affect us and may be applied retroactively. Any such changes could negatively
impact the value of an investment in our common units.
If for any reason we are taxable as a corporation in any taxable year, our items of income, gain, loss and deduction would be taken into account by us in
determining the amount of our liability for federal income tax, rather than being passed through to our unitholders. Our taxation as a corporation would materially
reduce the cash available for distribution to unitholders and thus would likely substantially reduce the value of our common units. Any distribution made to a
unitholder at a time we are treated as a corporation would be (i) a taxable dividend to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, then (ii) a
nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the unitholder's tax basis in its units, and thereafter (iii) taxable capital gain.
The remainder of this discussion is based on the opinion of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. that we will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership
Limited Partner Status
Unitholders who are admitted as limited partners of the Partnership will be treated as partners of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes. Also:
assignees who have executed and delivered transfer applications, and are awaiting admission as limited partners, and
(a)
(b)
unitholders whose common units are held in street name or by a nominee and who have the right to direct the nominee in the exercise of all
substantive rights attendant to the ownership of their common units,
will be treated as partners of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes.
As there is no direct or indirect controlling authority addressing the federal tax treatment of assignees of common units who are entitled to execute and deliver
transfer applications and thereby become entitled to direct the exercise of attendant rights, but who fail to execute and deliver transfer applications, the opinion of
Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. does not extend to these persons. Furthermore, a purchaser or other transferee of common units who does not execute and deliver a
transfer application may not receive some federal income tax information or reports furnished to record holders of common units unless the common units are held
in a nominee or street name account and the nominee or broker has executed and delivered a transfer application for those common units.
For a discussion related to the risks of losing partner status as a result of securities loans, please read "—Treatment of Securities Loans." Unitholders who
are not treated as partners of the partnership as described above are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences applicable to
them under the circumstances.
Flow-Through of Taxable Income
Subject to the discussion below under "—Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder Taxes" with respect to payments we may be required to make on behalf of our
unitholders, we will not pay any federal income tax. Rather, each unitholder will be required to report on its federal income tax return each year its share of our
income, gains, losses and deductions for our taxable year or years ending with or within its taxable year. Consequently, we may allocate income to a unitholder
even if that unitholder has not received a cash distribution.
22
Basis of Units
A unitholder's tax basis in its units initially will be the amount paid for those units plus the unitholder's share of our liabilities. That basis generally will be
(i) increased by the unitholder's share of our income and any increases in such unitholder's share of our liabilities, and (ii) decreased, but not below zero, by the
amount of all distributions, the unitholder's share of our losses, and any decreases in its share of our liabilities.
Treatment of Distributions
Distributions made by us to a unitholder generally will not be taxable to the unitholder, unless such distributions exceed the unitholder's tax basis in its units,
in which case the unitholder generally will recognize gain taxable in the manner described below under "—Disposition of Units."
Any reduction in a unitholder's share of our liabilities will be treated as a distribution by us of cash to that unitholder. A decrease in a unitholder's percentage
interest in us because of our issuance of additional units may decrease the unitholder's share of our liabilities. For purposes of the foregoing, a unitholder's share of
our nonrecourse liabilities (liabilities for which no partner bears the economic risk of loss) generally will be based upon that unitholder's share of the unrealized
appreciation (or depreciation) in our assets, to the extent thereof, with any excess liabilities allocated based on the unitholder's share of our profits. Please read "—
Disposition of Units."
A non-pro rata distribution of money or property (including a deemed distribution as a result of the reduction in a unitholder's share of our liabilities as
described above) may cause a unitholder to recognize ordinary income, if the distribution reduces the unitholder's share of our "unrealized receivables," including
depreciation recapture and substantially appreciated "inventory items," both as defined in Section 751 of the Code ("Section 751 Assets"). To the extent of such
reduction, the unitholder would be deemed to receive its proportionate share of the Section 751 Assets and exchange such assets with us in return for a portion of
the non-pro rata distribution. This deemed exchange generally will result in the unitholder's recognition of ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of
(1) the non-pro rata portion of that distribution over (2) the unitholder's tax basis (generally zero) in the Section 751 Assets deemed to be relinquished in the
exchange.
Limitations on Deductibility of Losses
A unitholder may not be entitled to deduct the full amount of loss we allocate to it because its share of our losses will be limited to the lesser of (i) the
unitholder's tax basis in its units, and (ii) in the case of a unitholder that is an individual, estate, trust or certain types of closely-held corporations, the amount for
which the unitholder is considered to be "at risk" with respect to our activities. In general, a unitholder will be at risk to the extent of its tax basis in its units,
reduced by (1) any portion of that basis attributable to the unitholder's share of our liabilities, (2) any portion of that basis representing amounts otherwise protected
against loss because of a guarantee, stop loss agreement or similar arrangement and (3) any amount of money the unitholder borrows to acquire or hold its units, if
the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in us, is related to another unitholder or can look only to the units for repayment. A unitholder subject to the at
risk limitation must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions (including distributions deemed to result from a reduction in a
unitholder's share of nonrecourse liabilities) cause the unitholder's at risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year.
Losses disallowed to a unitholder or recaptured as a result of the basis or at risk limitations will carry forward and will be allowable as a deduction in a later
year to the extent that the unitholder's tax basis or at risk amount, whichever is the limiting factor, is subsequently increased. Upon a taxable disposition of units,
any gain recognized by a unitholder can be offset by losses that were previously suspended by the at risk limitation but not losses suspended by the basis
limitation. Any loss previously
23
suspended by the at risk limitation in excess of that gain can no longer be used, and will not be available to offset a unitholder's salary or active business income.
In addition to the basis and at risk limitations, a passive activity loss limitation generally limits the deductibility of losses incurred by individuals, estates,
trusts, some closely held corporations and personal service corporations from "passive activities" (generally, trade or business activities in which the taxpayer does
not materially participate). The passive loss limitations are applied separately with respect to each publicly-traded partnership. Consequently, any passive losses
we generate will be available to offset only passive income generated by us Passive losses that exceed a unitholder's share of passive income we generate may be
deducted in full when the unitholder disposes of all of its units in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party. The passive loss rules generally are applied
after other applicable limitations on deductions, including the at risk and basis limitations.
Limitations on Interest Deductions
The deductibility of a non-corporate taxpayer's "investment interest expense" generally is limited to the amount of that taxpayer's "net investment income."
Investment interest expense includes:
interest on indebtedness properly allocable to property held for investment;
interest expense allocated against portfolio income; and
•
•
•
the portion of interest expense incurred to purchase or carry an interest in a passive activity to the extent allocable against portfolio income.
The computation of a unitholder's investment interest expense will take into account interest on any margin account borrowing or other loan incurred to
purchase or carry a unit. Net investment income includes gross income from property held for investment and amounts treated as portfolio income under the
passive loss rules, less deductible expenses, other than interest, directly connected with the production of investment income. Net investment income generally
does not include qualified dividend income (if applicable) or gains attributable to the disposition of property held for investment. A unitholder's share of a publicly
traded partnership's portfolio income and, according to the IRS, net passive income will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest
expense limitation.
Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder Taxes
If we are required or elect under applicable law to pay any federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax on behalf of any current or former unitholder or our general
partner, we are authorized to treat the payment as a distribution of cash to the relevant unitholder or general partner. Where the tax is payable on behalf of all the
unitholders or we cannot determine the specific unitholder on whose behalf the tax is payable, we are authorized to treat the payment as a distribution to all current
unitholders. Payments by us as described above could give rise to an overpayment of tax on behalf of a unitholder, in which event the unitholder may be entitled to
claim a refund of the overpayment amount. Unitholders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the consequences to them of any tax payment we make
on their behalf.
Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction
In general, our items of income, gain, loss and deduction will be allocated amongst our unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in us.
However, in addition to allocations with respect to any Book-Tax Disparities, as described below, our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement provides for
special allocations to achieve economic uniformity between the Class B units and the common units and allocate a portion of the Partnership's income away from
the Class B units to the extent that the common units receive distributions to which the Class B units are not entitled.
24
Specified items of our income, gain, loss and deduction will be allocated under Section 704(c) of the Code (or the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code) to
account for any difference between the tax basis and fair market value of our assets at the time such assets are contributed to us and at the time of any
subsequent offering of our common units (a "Book-Tax Disparity"). As a result, the federal income tax burden associated with any Book-Tax Disparity immediately
prior to an offering generally will be borne by our partners holding interests in us prior to such offering. In addition, items of recapture income will be specially
allocated to the extent possible to the unitholder who was allocated the deduction giving rise to that recapture income in order to minimize the recognition of
ordinary income by other unitholders.
An allocation of items of our income, gain, loss or deduction, other than an allocation required by the Code to eliminate a Book-Tax Disparity, will generally be
given effect for federal income tax purposes in determining a partner's share of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction only if the allocation has "substantial
economic effect." In any other case, a partner's share of an item will be determined on the basis of the partner's interest in us, which will be determined by taking
into account all the facts and circumstances, including (i) his relative contributions to us, (ii) the interests of all the partners in profits and losses, (iii) the interest of
all the partners in cash flow and (iv) the rights of all the partners to distributions of capital upon liquidation. Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is of the opinion that, with the
exception of the issues described in "—Section 754 Election" and "—Disposition of Units—Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees," allocations under our
Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement will be given effect for federal income tax purposes in determining a partner's share of an item of income, gain, loss
or deduction.
Treatment of Securities Loans
A unitholder whose units are loaned (for example, a loan to a "short seller" to cover a short sale of units) may be treated as having disposed of those units. If
so, such unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss
from the disposition. As a result, during this period (i) any of our income, gain, loss or deduction allocated to those units would not be reportable by the lending
unitholder and (ii) any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units may be treated as ordinary taxable income.
Due to a lack of controlling authority, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has not rendered an opinion regarding the tax treatment of a unitholder that enters into a
securities loan with respect to its units. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of income recognition from a loan of their units are
urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing and lending their units. The IRS has announced that it is
studying issues relating to the tax treatment of short sales of partnership interests. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss."
Tax Rates
Beginning January 1, 2013, the highest marginal federal income tax rates for individuals applicable to ordinary income and long-term capital gains (generally,
gains from the sale or exchange of certain investment assets held for more than one year) are 39.6% and 20%, respectively. These rates are subject to change by
new legislation at any time.
In addition, a 3.8% Medicare tax on certain net investment income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts applies for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2012. For these purposes, net investment income generally includes a unitholder's allocable share of our income and gain realized by a unitholder
from a sale of units. In the case of an individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i) the unitholder's net investment income from all investments, or (ii) the
amount by which the
25
unitholder's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 (if the unitholder is married and filing jointly or a surviving spouse), $125,000 (if married filing
separately) or $200,000 (if the unitholder is unmarried or in any other case). In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of
(i) undistributed net investment income, or (ii) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an
estate or trust begins.
Section 754 Election
We have made the election permitted by Section 754 of the Code that permits us to adjust the tax bases in our assets as to specific purchasers of our
common units under Section 743(b) of the Code. The Section 743(b) adjustment separately applies to each purchaser of units based upon the values and bases of
our assets at the time of the relevant purchase, and the adjustment will reflect the purchase price paid. The Section 743(b) adjustment does not apply to a person
who purchases units directly from us.
Under our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, we are authorized to take a position to preserve the uniformity of units even if that position is not
consistent with applicable Treasury Regulations. A literal application of Treasury Regulations governing a 743(b) adjustment attributable to properties depreciable
under Section 167 of the Code may give rise to differences in the taxation of unitholders purchasing units from us and unitholders purchasing from other unitholders.
If we have any such properties, we intend to adopt methods employed by other publicly traded partnerships to preserve the uniformity of units, even if inconsistent
with existing Treasury Regulations, and Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P. has not opined on the validity of this approach. Please read "—Uniformity of Units."
The IRS may challenge the positions we adopt with respect to depreciating or amortizing the Section 743(b) adjustment we take to preserve the uniformity of
units due to lack of controlling authority. Because a unitholder's tax basis for its units is reduced by its share of our items of deduction or loss, any position we take
that understates deductions will overstate a unitholder's basis in its units, and may cause the unitholder to understate gain or overstate loss on any sale of such
units. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss." If a challenge to such treatment were sustained, the gain from the sale of units may be
increased without the benefit of additional deductions.
The calculations involved in the Section 754 election are complex and will be made on the basis of assumptions as to the value of our assets and other
matters. The IRS could seek to reallocate some or all of any Section 743(b) adjustment we allocated to our assets subject to depreciation to goodwill or
nondepreciable assets. Goodwill, as an intangible asset, is generally nonamortizable or amortizable over a longer period of time or under a less accelerated method
than our tangible assets. We cannot assure any unitholder that the determinations we make will not be successfully challenged by the IRS or that the resulting
deductions will not be reduced or disallowed altogether. Should the IRS require a different tax basis adjustment to be made, and should, in our opinion, the expense
of compliance exceed the benefit of the election, we may seek permission from the IRS to revoke our Section 754 election. If permission is granted, a subsequent
purchaser of units may be allocated more income than it would have been allocated had the election not been revoked.

Tax Treatment of Operations
Accounting Method and Taxable Year
We will use the year ending December 31 as our taxable year and the accrual method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. Each unitholder will be
required to include in income its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction for each taxable year ending within or with its taxable year. In addition, a unitholder
who has a taxable year ending on a date other than December 31 and who disposes of all of its units following the close of our taxable year but before the close of
its taxable year must include its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction in income for its taxable year, with the result that it will be required to include in
income for its taxable year its share of more than one year of our income, gain, loss and deduction. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Allocations Between
Transferors and Transferees."
Tax Basis, Depreciation and Amortization
The tax bases of our assets will be used for purposes of computing depreciation and cost recovery deductions and, ultimately, gain or loss on the disposition
of these assets. If we dispose of depreciable property by sale, foreclosure or otherwise, all or a portion of any gain, determined by reference to the amount of
depreciation deductions previously taken, may be subject to the recapture rules and taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Similarly, a unitholder who
has taken cost recovery or depreciation deductions with respect to property we own will likely be required to recapture some or all of those deductions as ordinary
income upon a sale of its interest in us. Please read "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction" and "—Disposition
of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss."
The costs we incur in offering and selling our common units (called "syndication expenses") must be capitalized and cannot be deducted currently, ratably or
upon our termination. While there are uncertainties regarding the classification of costs as organization expenses, which may be amortized by us, and as
syndication expenses, which may not be amortized by us, the underwriting discounts and commissions we incur will be treated as syndication expenses.
Valuation and Tax Bases of Our Properties
The federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of units will depend in part on our estimates of the relative fair market values and the
initial tax bases of our assets. Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we will make many of the
relative fair market value estimates ourselves. These estimates and determinations of tax basis are subject to challenge and will not be binding on the IRS or the
courts. If the estimates of fair market value or basis are later found to be incorrect, the character and amount of items of income, gain, loss or deduction previously
reported by unitholders could change, and unitholders could be required to adjust their tax liability for prior years and incur interest and penalties with respect to
those adjustments.
Disposition of Units
Recognition of Gain or Loss
A unitholder will be required to recognize gain or loss on a sale of units equal to the difference between the unitholder's amount realized and tax basis in the
units sold. A unitholder's amount realized generally will equal the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property it receives plus its share of our liabilities
with respect to such units. Because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our liabilities, the gain recognized on the sale of units could result in a tax
liability in excess of any cash received from the sale.
27
Except as noted below, gain or loss recognized by a unitholder on the sale or exchange of a unit held for more than one year generally will be taxable as long-
term capital gain or loss. However, gain or loss recognized on the disposition of units will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under
Section 751 of the Code to the extent attributable to Section 751 Assets, such as depreciation recapture. Ordinary income attributable to Section 751 Assets may
exceed net taxable gain realized on the sale of a unit and may be recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on the sale of a unit. Thus, a unitholder
may recognize both ordinary income and capital gain or loss upon a sale of units. Net capital loss may offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to
$3,000 of ordinary income per year.
The IRS has ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate transactions must combine those interests and maintain a single adjusted
tax basis for all those interests. Upon a sale or other disposition of less than all of those interests, a portion of that tax basis must be allocated to the interests sold
using an "equitable apportionment" method, which generally means that the tax basis allocated to the interest sold equals an amount that bears the same relation to
the partner's tax basis in its entire interest in the partnership as the value of the interest sold bears to the value of the partner's entire interest in the partnership.
Treasury Regulations under Section 1223 of the Code allow a selling unitholder who can identify units transferred with an ascertainable holding period to elect
to use the actual holding period of the units transferred. Thus, according to the ruling discussed above, a unitholder will be unable to select high or low basis units
to sell as would be the case with corporate stock, but, according to the Treasury Regulations, it may designate specific units sold for purposes of determining the
holding period of units transferred. A unitholder electing to use the actual holding period of units transferred must consistently use that identification method for all
subsequent sales or exchanges of our common units. A unitholder considering the purchase of additional units or a sale of units purchased in separate transactions
is urged to consult its tax advisor as to the possible consequences of this ruling and application of the Treasury Regulations.
Specific provisions of the Code affect the taxation of some financial products and securities, including partnership interests, by treating a taxpayer as having
sold an "appreciated" financial position, including a partnership interest with respect to which gain would be recognized if it were sold, assigned or terminated at its
fair market value, in the event the taxpayer or a related person enters into:
a short sale;
an offsetting notional principal contract; or
•
•
•
a futures or forward contract with respect to the partnership interest or substantially identical property.
Moreover, if a taxpayer has previously entered into a short sale, an offsetting notional principal contract or a futures or forward contract with respect to the
partnership interest, the taxpayer will be treated as having sold that position if the taxpayer or a related person then acquires the partnership interest or substantially
identical property. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue regulations that treat a taxpayer that enters into transactions or positions that have
substantially the same effect as the preceding transactions as having constructively sold the financial position.
Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees
In general, our taxable income or loss will be determined annually, will be prorated on a monthly basis and will be subsequently apportioned among the
unitholders in proportion to the number of units owned by each of them as of the opening of the applicable exchange on the first business day of the month (the
"Allocation Date"). However, gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets or, in the discretion of the general partner, any other extraordinary item
of income, gain, loss or
28
deduction will be allocated among the unitholders on the Allocation Date in the month in which such income, gain, loss or deduction is recognized. As a result, a
unitholder transferring units may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized after the date of transfer.
Although simplifying conventions are contemplated by the Code and most publicly traded partnerships use similar simplifying conventions, the use of this
method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. Recently, however, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued proposed Treasury
Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among
transferor and transferee unitholders, although such tax items must be prorated on a daily basis. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize
the use of the proration method we have adopted. Accordingly, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is unable to opine on the validity of this method of allocating income and
deductions between transferee and transferor unitholders. If this method is not allowed under the final Treasury Regulations, or only applies to transfers of less than
all of the unitholder's interest, our taxable income or losses could be reallocated among our unitholders. We are authorized to revise our method of allocation
between transferee and transferor unitholders, as well as among unitholders whose interests vary during a taxable year, to conform to a method permitted under
future Treasury Regulations.
A unitholder who disposes of units prior to the record date set for a cash distribution for that quarter will be allocated items of our income, gain, loss and
deduction attributable to the month of disposition but will not be entitled to receive a cash distribution for that period.
Notification Requirements
A unitholder who sells or purchases any of its units is generally required to notify us in writing of that transaction within 30 days after the transaction (or, if
earlier, January 15 of the year following the transaction in the case of a seller). Upon receiving such notifications, we are required to notify the IRS of that
transaction and to furnish specified information to the transferor and transferee. Failure to notify us of a transfer of units may, in some cases, lead to the imposition
of penalties. However, these reporting requirements do not apply to a sale by an individual who is a citizen of the United States and who effects the sale through a
broker who will satisfy such requirements.
Constructive Termination
We will be considered to have "constructively" terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes upon the sale or exchange of 50% or more of the
total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For such purposes, multiple sales of the same unit are counted only once. A constructive
termination results in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than the calendar year, the
closing of our taxable year may result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in such unitholder's taxable income for the year of
termination.
A constructive termination occurring on a date other than December 31 generally would require that we file two tax returns for one fiscal year, and the cost of
the preparation of these returns will be borne by all unitholders. However, pursuant to an IRS relief procedure, the IRS may allow a constructively terminated
partnership to provide a single Schedule K-1 for the calendar year in which a termination occurs. Following a constructive termination, we would be required to make
new tax elections, including a new election under Section 754 of the Code, and the termination would result in a deferral of our deductions for depreciation. A
termination could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred. Moreover, a termination may either accelerate the
application of, or subject us to, any tax legislation enacted before the termination that would not otherwise have been applied to us as a continuing partnership, as
opposed to a terminating partnership.
29
Uniformity of Units
Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of units and for other reasons, we must maintain uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of
the units to a purchaser of these units. In the absence of uniformity, we may be unable to completely comply with a number of federal income tax requirements.
Any non-uniformity could have a negative impact on the value of the units. Please read "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—Section 754 Election."
Our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement permits our general partner to take positions in filing our tax returns that preserve the uniformity of our
common units. These positions may include reducing the depreciation, amortization or loss deductions to which a unitholder would otherwise be entitled or reporting
a slower amortization of Section 743(b) adjustments for some unitholders than that to which they would otherwise be entitled. Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. is unable to
opine as to validity of such filing positions.
A unitholder's basis in units is reduced by its share of our deductions (whether or not such deductions were claimed on an individual income tax return) so that
any position that we take that understates deductions will overstate the unitholder's basis in its units, and may cause the unitholder to understate gain or overstate
loss on any sale of such units. Please read "—Disposition of Units—Recognition of Gain or Loss" above and "—Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership—
Section 754 Election" above. The IRS may challenge one or more of any positions we take to preserve the uniformity of units. If such a challenge were sustained,
the uniformity of units might be affected, and, under some circumstances, the gain from the sale of units might be increased without the benefit of additional
deductions.
Tax-Exempt Organizations and Other Investors
Ownership of units by employee benefit plans, other tax-exempt organizations, non-resident aliens, non-U.S. corporations and other non-U.S. persons raises
issues unique to those investors and, as described below, may have substantially adverse tax consequences to them. Prospective unitholders that are tax-exempt
entities or non-U.S. persons should consult their tax advisors before investing in our common units.
Employee benefit plans and most other tax-exempt organizations, including IRAs and other retirement plans, are subject to federal income tax on unrelated
business taxable income. Virtually all of our income will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to a tax-exempt unitholder.
Non-resident aliens and non-U.S. corporations, trusts or estates that own units will be treated as engaged in business in the United States because of their
ownership of our common units. Consequently, they will be required to file federal tax returns to report their share of our income, gain, loss or deduction and pay
federal income tax at regular rates on their share of our net income or gain. Moreover, under rules applicable to publicly traded partnerships, distributions to non-
U.S. unitholders are subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate. Each non-U.S. unitholder must obtain a taxpayer identification number from
the IRS and submit that number to our transfer agent on a Form W-8BEN or applicable substitute form in order to obtain credit for these withholding taxes.
In addition, because non-U.S. corporation that owns units will be treated as engaged in a United States trade or business, that corporation may be subject to
the U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, in addition to regular federal income tax, on its share of our income and gain to the extent reflected in earnings and
profits, and as adjusted for changes in the foreign corporation's "U.S. net equity." That tax may be reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty between the
United States and the country in which the foreign corporate unitholder is a "qualified resident." In addition, this type of unitholder is subject to special information
reporting requirements under Section 6038C of the Code.
30
A non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will be subject to federal income tax on gain realized from the sale or disposition of that unit to
the extent the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. unitholder. Under a ruling published by the IRS interpreting the scope of
"effectively connected income," part or all of a non-U.S. unitholder's gain may be treated as effectively connected with that unitholder's indirect U.S. trade or
business constituted by its investment in us. Moreover, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, a non-U.S. unitholder generally will be subject to
federal income tax upon the sale or disposition of a unit if (i) it owned (directly or constructively applying certain attribution rules) more than 5% of our common units
at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of such disposition and (ii) 50% or more of the fair market value of all of our assets consisted of U.S. real
property interests at any time during the shorter of the period during which such unitholder held the units or the 5-year period ending on the date of disposition. More
than 50% of our assets may consist of U.S. real property interests. Therefore, non-U.S. unitholders may be subject to federal income tax on gain from the sale or
disposition of their units.
Administrative Matters
Information Returns and Audit Procedures
We intend to furnish to each unitholder, within 90 days after the close of each taxable year, specific tax information, including a Schedule K-1, which
describes its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year. In preparing this information, which will not be reviewed by counsel, we
will take various accounting and reporting positions, some of which have been mentioned earlier, to determine each unitholder's share of income, gain, loss and
deduction. We cannot assure our unitholders that those positions will yield a result that conforms to all of the requirements of the Code, Treasury Regulations or
administrative interpretations of the IRS.
The IRS may audit our federal income tax information returns. Neither we nor Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. can assure prospective unitholders that the IRS will not
successfully challenge the positions we adopt, and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of the units. Adjustments resulting from an IRS audit may
require each unitholder to adjust a prior year's tax liability, and may result in an audit of the unitholder's own return. Any audit of a unitholder's return could result in
adjustments unrelated to our returns.
Publicly traded partnerships generally are treated as entities separate from their owners for purposes of federal income tax audits, judicial review of
administrative adjustments by the IRS, and tax settlement proceedings. The tax treatment of partnership items of income, gain, loss and deduction are determined
in a partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings of the partners. The Code requires that one partner be designated as the "Tax Matters Partner" for
these purposes, and our Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement designates our general partner.
The Tax Matters Partner can extend the statute of limitations for assessment of tax deficiencies against unitholders for items in our returns. The Tax Matters
Partner may bind a unitholder with less than a 1% profits interest in us to a settlement with the IRS unless that unitholder elects, by filing a statement with the IRS,
not to give that authority to the Tax Matters Partner. The Tax Matters Partner may seek judicial review, by which all the unitholders are bound, of a final partnership
administrative adjustment and, if the Tax Matters Partner fails to seek judicial review, judicial review may be sought by any unitholder having at least a 1% interest
in profits or by any group of unitholders having in the aggregate at least a 5% interest in profits. However, only one action for judicial review may go forward, and
each unitholder with an interest in the outcome may participate in that action.
A unitholder must file a statement with the IRS identifying the treatment of any item on its federal income tax return that is not consistent with the treatment of
the item on our return.
31
Intentional or negligent disregard of this consistency requirement may subject a unitholder to substantial penalties.
Nominee Reporting
Persons who hold an interest in us as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us:
(1)   the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee;
(2)   a statement regarding whether the beneficial owner is:
(a)   a non-U.S. person;
(b)   a non-U.S. government, an international organization or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing; or
(c)   a tax-exempt entity;
(3)   the amount and description of units held, acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner; and
(4)   specific information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers, means of acquisitions and transfers, and acquisition cost for purchases, as
well as the amount of net proceeds from sales.
Brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information, including whether they are U.S. persons and specific information on units they
acquire, hold or transfer for their own account. A penalty of $100 per failure, up to a maximum of $1.5 million per calendar year, is imposed by the Code for failure to
report that information to us. The nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner of the units with the information furnished to us.
Accuracy-Related Penalties
An additional tax equal to 20% of the amount of any portion of an underpayment of tax that is attributable to one or more specified causes, including
negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, substantial understatements of income tax and substantial valuation misstatements, is imposed by the Code. No
penalty will be imposed, however, for any portion of an underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for the underpayment of that portion and that
the taxpayer acted in good faith regarding the underpayment of that portion.
State, Local and Other Tax Considerations
In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, and
estate, inheritance or intangibles taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future even if
they do not live in those jurisdictions. We currently conduct business or own property in several states, many of which impose an income tax on nonresident
partners of partnerships doing business within the state. We may also own property or do business in other states in the future that impose income or similar taxes
on nonresident persons owning an interest in us. Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each prospective unitholder should consider
their potential impact on its investment in us. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to investigate the legal and tax consequences, under the laws of pertinent
states and localities, of its investment in us. Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. has not rendered an opinion on the state, local, alternative minimum tax or non-U.S. tax
consequences of an investment in us. We strongly recommend that each prospective unitholder consult, and depend on, its own tax counsel or other advisor with
regard to those matters. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all tax returns that may be required of it.
32
INVESTMENT IN MARKWEST ENERGY PARTNERS BY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
An investment in our common units or debt securities by an employee benefit plan is subject to certain additional considerations because the investments of
these plans are subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and restrictions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, and provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are
similar to such provisions of the Code or ERISA (collectively, "Similar Laws"). As used herein, the term "employee benefit plan" includes, but is not limited to,
qualified pension, profit sharing and stock bonus plans, Keogh plans, simplified employee pension plans and tax deferred annuities or individual retirement accounts
("IRAs") or other arrangements established or maintained by an employer or employee organization, and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include
"plan assets" of such plans, accounts and arrangements.
General Fiduciary Matters
ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code (an "ERISA Plan") and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and
the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the
assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary
of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in our common units or debt securities, among other things, consideration should be given to:
(a)   whether the investment is prudent under Section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA and any other applicable Similar Laws;
(b)   whether in making the investment, that plan will satisfy the diversification requirements of Section 404(a)(l)(C) of ERISA and any other applicable
Similar Laws;
(c)   whether the investment will result in recognition of unrelated business taxable income by the plan and, if so, the potential after-tax investment
return. For more information see "Material Tax Consequences" beginning on page 20 of this prospectus;
(d)   whether the investment is made solely in the interests of the ERISA Plan participants;
(e)   whether the investment would create any problems for the ERISA Plan's need for liquidity; and
(f)    whether making the investment will comply with the delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Similar Laws.
The person with investment discretion with respect to the assets of an employee benefit plan, often called a fiduciary, should determine whether an
investment in us is authorized by the appropriate governing instrument and is a proper investment for the plan. In addition, a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
may not deal with the plan's assets in his own interest, represent a person whose interests are adverse to the plan's in a transaction involving plan assets or
receive any consideration from a third party in connection with a transaction involving plan assets. A violation of fiduciary requirements could result in liability for
breach of fiduciary duty, disqualification from future fiduciary service, excise taxes and other adverse consequences to the ERISA Plan fiduciaries.
Prohibited Transaction Issues
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit employee benefit plans, and IRAs that are not considered part of an employee benefit plan, from
engaging in specified transactions
33
involving "plan assets" with parties that are "parties in interest" under ERISA or "disqualified persons" under the Code with respect to the plan, unless an exemption
is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non- exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.
The acquisition and/or holding of securities by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we or the initial purchasers are considered a party in interest or a
disqualified person, may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
securities are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department
of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or PTCEs, that may apply to the acquisition, holding and, if applicable, conversion of the securities.
These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE
90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide limited relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions,
provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any
investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate
consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.
Because of the foregoing, our securities should not be purchased or held (or converted to equity securities, in the case of any convertible debt) by a person
investing "plan assets" of any employee benefit plan, unless such purchase and holding (or conversion, if any) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA or the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.
Plan Asset Issues
In addition to considering whether the purchase of common units is a prohibited transaction, a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan should consider whether
the plan will, by investing in us, be deemed to own an undivided interest in our assets, with the result that our general partner also would be a fiduciary of the plan
and our operations would be subject to the regulatory restrictions of ERISA, including its prohibited transaction rules, as well as the prohibited transaction rules of
the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.
The Department of Labor regulations, including 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, provide guidance with respect to whether the assets of an entity in which
employee benefit plans acquire equity interests would be deemed "plan assets" under certain circumstances. Under these regulations, an entity's assets would not
be considered to be "plan assets" if, among other things,
(a)   the equity interests acquired by employee benefit plans are publicly offered securities; i.e., the equity interests are widely held by 100 or more
investors independent of the issuer and each other, freely transferable and registered pursuant to some provisions of the federal securities laws,
(b)   the entity is an "operating company," that is, it is primarily engaged in the production or sale of a product or service other than the investment of
capital either directly or through a majority owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, or
34
(c)   there is no significant investment by benefit plan investors, which is defined to mean that less than 25% of the value of each class of equity
interest, disregarding certain interests held by our general partner, its affiliates, and some other persons, is held by the employee benefit plans that are
subject to party of Title I of ERISA (which excludes governmental plans, foreign plans and non-electing church plans) and/or section 4975 of the Code.
With respect to an investment in our common units, our assets should not be considered "plan assets" under these regulations because it is expected that the
investment will satisfy the requirements in (a) and (b) above and may also satisfy the requirements in (c) above (although we do not monitor the level of benefit plan
investors as required for compliance with (c)). However, although we do not intend for our assets to be deemed as "plan assets" under these regulations, we cannot
provide assurances regarding this issue to any investor.
The foregoing discussion of issues arising for employee benefit plan investments under ERISA, the Code and Similar Laws was intended to provide a brief
summary of certain issues that employee benefit plans should consider before investing in our common units or debt securities, and should not be construed as
legal advice. Plan fiduciaries contemplating a purchase of common units are urged to consult with their own counsel regarding the consequences under ERISA, the
Code and Similar Laws in light of the serious penalties imposed on persons who engage in prohibited transactions or other violations.
Representation
Accordingly, by acceptance of our common units, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of the securities will be deemed to have represented and
warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the securities constitutes assets of any employee benefit
plan or (ii) the purchase and holding (and any conversion, if applicable) of the securities by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
We are registering the common units on behalf of the selling unitholder. As used in this prospectus, "selling unitholder" includes donees and pledgees selling
common units received from a named selling unitholder after the date of this prospectus solely to the extent permitted under the registration rights agreement with
the selling unitholder.
Under this prospectus, the selling unitholder may intend to offer our securities to the public:
•
•
•
through one or more broker dealers;
through underwriters; or
directly to investors.
The selling unitholder may price the common units offered from time to time:
•
•
•
•
•
at fixed prices;
at market prices prevailing at the time of any sale under this registration statement;
at prices related to market prices;
varying prices determined at the time of sale; or
at negotiated prices.
We will pay the reasonable costs and expenses of the registration and offering of the common units offered hereby. We will not pay any underwriting fees,
discounts and selling commissions allocable to the selling unitholder's sale of its respective common units, which will be paid by the selling unitholder. Broker
dealers may act as agent or may purchase securities as principal and thereafter resell the securities from time to time:

in or through one or more transactions (which may involve crosses and block transactions) or distributions;
on the New York Stock Exchange;
in the over-the-counter market; or
in private transactions.
Broker dealers or underwriters may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and may receive commissions from
purchasers of the securities for whom they may act as agents. If any broker dealer purchases the securities as principal, it may effect resales of the securities from
time to time to or through other broker dealers, and other broker dealers may receive compensation in the form of concessions or commissions from the purchasers
of securities for whom they may act as agents.
To the extent required, the names of the specific managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, as well as other important information, will be set forth in
prospectus supplements. In that event, the discounts and commissions the selling unitholder will allow or pay to the underwriters, if any, and the discounts and
commissions the underwriters may allow or pay to dealers or agents, if any, will be set forth in, or may be calculated from, the prospectus supplements. Any
underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents who participate in any sale of the securities may also engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us or our
affiliates in the ordinary course of their businesses. We may indemnify underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents against specific liabilities under the Securities Act.

In addition, the selling unitholder has advised us that they may sell common units in compliance with Rule 144, if available, or pursuant to other available
exemptions from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, rather than pursuant to this prospectus.
Because Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") views our common units as interests in a direct participation program, any offering of
common units under the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part will be made in compliance with Rule 2310 of the FINRA Rules.
To the extent required, this prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. The place and time of
delivery for the securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered will be set forth in the accompanying prospectus supplement.
In connection with offerings under this shelf registration and in compliance with applicable law, underwriters, brokers or dealers may engage in transactions
which stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at levels above those which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Specifically, underwriters,
brokers or dealers may over-allot in connection with offerings, creating a short position in the securities for their own accounts. For the purpose of covering a
syndicate short position or stabilizing the price of the securities, the underwriters, brokers or dealers may place bids for the securities or effect purchases of the
securities in the open market. Finally, the underwriters may impose a penalty whereby selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other brokers or
dealers for distribution of the securities in offerings may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed securities in transactions
to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities,
which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market, and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. involved in this offering own an aggregate of approximately 2,550 of our common units.
