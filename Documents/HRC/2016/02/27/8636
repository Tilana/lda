<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, 
Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, submits this report in accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 12/9. It presents the expert&#8217;s views on how to improve the draft guiding 
principles on extreme poverty and human rights (hereafter the draft guiding principles).  
</p>
<p>2. In 2006, the Human Rights Council examined the draft guiding principles prepared 
by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (the Sub-
Commission). At the request of the Council, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) led consultations on the draft guiding 
principles between 2006 and 2009.1 The views of States, United Nations agencies and 
intergovernmental organizations, United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures, 
national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other 
stakeholders were compiled and analysed in a report presented to the Council in 2009.2 
</p>
<p>3. In October 2009, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 12/19 inviting the 
independent expert &quot;to pursue further work on the draft guiding principles on extreme 
poverty and human rights&quot; and &quot;to submit a progress report presenting her 
recommendations on how to improve the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and 
human rights to the Council no later than its fifteenth session&quot;.  
</p>
<p>4. Following resolution 12/19, the independent expert reviewed contributions from all 
stakeholders3 that submitted comments on the Sub-Commission draft, including the 
conclusions of the seminar organized by OHCHR in January 2009. She consulted with, 
amongst others, the Administrator and the Poverty Group of the United Nations 
Development Programme. She also participated in two meetings with NGOs promoted by 
ATD-Quart Monde, and a meeting with human rights and development practitioners at 
Brandeis University.  
</p>
<p>5. Finally, the independent expert convened an expert meeting on 20-21 May 2010 in 
collaboration with the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung to discuss how to improve the principles. 
The meeting was attended by experts working on both human rights and development 
issues worldwide.  
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert&#8217;s report first details the rationale behind her proposals for 
improving the guiding principles and the basic conceptual definitions that should frame 
these proposals. Section IV addresses the main challenges experienced by persons living in 
extreme poverty that must be taken into account when preparing the principles. Finally, 
section V presents an annotated outline of the independent expert&#8217;s proposal on how to 
improve the draft guiding principles. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert gave high priority to consulting various stakeholders and 
welcomes the support of all those taking part in the various consultative processes, 
including State representatives.

<p><b> II. Rationale for the development of guiding principles on 
human rights and extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p>8. It is an urgent matter to put the realization of all human rights at the centre of efforts 
to eradicate extreme poverty. Long-lasting advances in the eradication of extreme poverty 
will only be achieved once measures recognize persons living in extreme poverty as 
subjects with rights and as potential agents for change. The recent global food, fuel and 
financial crises and their disproportionate impact on persons living in extreme poverty 
further demonstrate the need for guiding principles on human rights and extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>9. The independent expert agrees with all those participating in the rounds of 
consultations that the guiding principles should provide practical guidance on how to 
operationalize the obligations of States to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of persons 
living in extreme poverty, an often neglected and, to a certain extent, invisible segment of 
the general population. The guiding principles should foster effective implementation and 
compliance with existing human rights norms and principles. They should also help address 
the gap between human rights standards and the actual situation of persons in extreme 
poverty, bearing in mind their diversity worldwide. 
</p>
<p>10. The principles should guide all actors involved in designing, implementing and 
monitoring international, national and local policies to eradicate extreme poverty. They 
should add visibility and political momentum to the fight against extreme poverty, and 
address the difficulties States and the international community face in reaching those living 
in extreme poverty. They should also be an advocacy tool for all stakeholders working on 
poverty issues at the domestic and international level. 
</p>
<p>11. At their core the guiding principles must prioritize the importance of reaching out 
and protecting persons living in extreme poverty, as the most disadvantaged and 
marginalized individuals and groups in societies. The independent expert emphasizes the 
centrality of empowering persons living in extreme poverty through a human rights 
approach to alleviating poverty.  
</p>
<p>12. The guiding principles should provide common ground to assist and harmonize 
action, improving partnerships on the ground and building the foundations for efficient 
multi-stakeholder dialogues. They should bridge the often disparate debates and activities 
of actors working in development and in human rights, offering them a common point of 
departure for joint action. 
</p>
<p>13. The guiding principles should not be perceived as a humanitarian or charitable 
statement; they are based on internationally agreed human rights principles and standards as 
they apply to persons living in extreme poverty. They clarify the implications of human 
rights obligations for State policy decisions at national level and how human rights 
obligations apply to international policy decisions, in particular in regard to international 
assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conceptual framework  
</b></p>
<p>14. Poverty is universally recognized as a multidimensional phenomenon, extending 
beyond a lack of income to a lack of the basic capabilities to live in dignity. The current 
draft guiding principles use the definition of poverty established by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2001, which affirms that poverty is &#8220;a human 
condition characterized by the sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources, </p>


<p>capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate 
standard of living and other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights&#8221;.4 The 
former independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty elaborated 
on this definition by characterizing poverty as &#8220;the combination of income poverty, human 
development poverty and social exclusion&#8221;.5 The principles further benefit from the view of 
the Sub-Commission that &#8220;the lack of basic security leads to chronic poverty when it 
simultaneously affects several aspects of people&#8217;s lives, when it is prolonged and when it 
severely compromises people&#8217;s chances of regaining their rights and of reassuming their 
responsibilities in the foreseeable future.&#8221;6 Other definitions underline the multidimensional 
aspect of poverty. In the Programme of Action of the 1995 World Summit for Social 
Development, absolute poverty<b> </b>is defined as &quot;a condition characterized by severe 
deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, 
health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access 
to services.&quot;7 </p>
<p>15. Human rights and extreme poverty are linked in at least three ways: (a) poverty can 
be both a cause and a consequence of human rights violations; (b) the realization of all 
human rights and efforts to eliminate extreme poverty are mutually reinforcing; and (c) 
human rights norms and principles provide the framework for poverty reduction and/or 
eradication.8 
</p>
<p>16. The guiding principles should be framed around the existing obligations of States to 
respect, protect and fulfil all human rights and fundamental freedoms.9 The obligation to 
respect requires States to immediately refrain from jeopardizing the enjoyment of any rights 
domestically and internationally, including from acting in a way that generates or 
exacerbates extreme poverty. To this end, States should, for example, assess, identify and 
address the possible human rights impacts of their poverty reduction policies. The 
obligation to protect includes taking all necessary measures to protect persons living in 
extreme poverty from actions or omissions of third parties that might threaten or jeopardize 
their human rights. The obligation to fulfil requires States to take positive actions to 
facilitate the enjoyment of human rights, including creating institutional mechanisms to 
prevent human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>17. The guiding principles should also clarify and further develop the obligations 
regarding economic, social and cultural rights as they apply to those living in extreme 
poverty. They should recall that the obligations of States to progressively realize economic 
social and cultural rights10 require them to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible 
towards this goal.11 As part of this obligation, &#8220;any deliberate retrogressive measures &#8230; 
would require the most careful consideration and would need to be fully justified by

</p>
<p>(see, e.g. H. Shue, <i>Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence and US Foreign Policy</i> (Princeton, New 
Jersey, Princeton University Press 1996); E/CN.4/Sub.2/1987/23; and Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, general comments Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 21), it is widely 
accepted that it applies to all human rights.

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

States party obligations, para. 9. </p>


<p>reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the 
full use of the maximum available resources&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p>18. The guiding principles should recall that States parties to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are required to directly provide minimum 
essential levels of all economic, social and cultural rights when individuals or groups are 
unable, for reasons beyond their control, to realize these human rights by the means at their 
disposal.13 Fulfilling this minimum core obligation immediately is &#8220;incumbent on every 
State party&#8221;.14 Should it be unable to do so, &#8220;it must demonstrate that every effort has been 
made to use all resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of 
priority, these minimum obligations&#8221;.15  
</p>
<p>19. Considering that the majority of those living in extreme poverty are children and that 
extreme poverty in childhood is also a root cause of poverty in adulthood,16 the draft 
guiding principles should pay particular attention to children and address the issue of how 
measures to tackle extreme poverty should take into account their rights in relation to those 
of their parents/guardians or carers.  
</p>
<p>20. In line with the Sub-Commission draft, the guiding principles should focus on State 
obligations without neglecting the potential role of non-State actors, including international 
organizations, national human rights institutions, civil society organizations and the private 
sector. All have significant responsibilities in the promotion and protection of human rights 
of those living in poverty. The guiding principles should reaffirm States obligations to 
create an enabling environment that fosters and promotes the capacity of individuals, 
community-based organizations, social movements and other non-governmental 
organizations to combat poverty and empower persons living in extreme poverty to claim 
their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Overview of the main underlying and reinforcing 
deprivations faced by persons living in extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p>21. Poverty is not an inevitable phenomenon. It is frequently a result of actions and 
omissions by those in charge of State policies and other powerful economic entities. Due to 
structural - often unaddressed - social, political, economic and cultural inequalities, it is 
transmitted from one generation to another. As noted by special procedures mandate 
holders, &#8220;poverty is often a cause, as well as a result, of a complex system of human rights 
denials in which violations of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights interact 
and mutually reinforce each other with devastating effects&#8221;.17  
</p>
<p>22. The deprivations faced by persons living in extreme poverty are often imperceptible 
and go far beyond lack of income. Social exclusion and discrimination are major causes and 
consequences of poverty. Due to discrimination, groups such as women, children, racial 
and ethnic minorities, migrants and non-citizens, refugees, indigenous peoples, persons 
with disabilities and older persons, encounter greater challenges accessing income, assets

<p>and services and are thus particularly vulnerable to poverty.18 Having fallen into poverty, 
they are exposed to systematic stigmatization and discrimination on the grounds of their 
poverty which perpetuates their situation. Addressing discrimination requires a range of 
responses, since patterns vary across regions and within countries and can be both overt and 
covert.  
</p>
<p>23. While everyone is entitled to all human rights, persons living in extreme poverty 
face considerable interrelated and mutually reinforcing deprivations that prevent them from 
realizing their rights and strengthen the vicious cycle that perpetuates poverty through 
generations. For example, in addition to being exposed to underlying causes of ill health 
such as dangerous work conditions, unsafe housing and limited access to nutritious food, 
they have limited access to preventive health care, diagnosis and treatment. Their health 
problems often prevent them from undertaking a productive activity, meanwhile elevated 
health-care costs impact already meagre budgets.  
</p>
<p>24. Moreover, the health consequences of inadequate living conditions accumulate 
across the course of life and can be transmitted from one generation to the next. For 
example, children born to mothers living in extreme poverty are more than twice as likely 
to be born with a low birth weight, increasing their risk of future health and developmental 
problems.19 The result is a vicious cycle of social and economic disadvantages leading to ill 
health that in turn leads to further disadvantage. Similar challenges are faced with regard to 
education, as malnutrition or overcrowded conditions at home can be related to bad school 
performance and reduced attention and learning capacities, undermining the possibility of 
escaping poverty. 
</p>
<p>25. While persons living in extreme poverty do not constitute a homogeneous group, 
each having specific vulnerabilities and challenges, they commonly face obstacles in 
accessing government services and institutions, including physical, economic, 
administrative and other obstacles. Those who face discrimination on multiple grounds face 
even greater obstacles in overcoming extreme poverty.20  
</p>
<p>26. Physical obstacles are common challenges for persons living in extreme poverty. 
They are geographically remote from jobs, markets, resources, etc. They often have to 
travel a long way to access public services such as health care, education and sanitation 
facilities, and inhabit areas that have extremely limited access to transportation and roads. 
Government allocations for services and private investment typically vary according to the 
zone and the neighbourhood in which persons live: more affluent areas are usually provided 
with electricity, good roads, and water and sanitation infrastructures, whereas persons in 
deprived neighbourhoods often have little or inadequate access to similar services. To those 
experiencing extreme poverty time spent travelling to access services and job opportunities 
can represent a considerable loss of income, when they already earn little.  
</p>
<p>27. Persons living in extreme poverty face multiple economic obstacles, often paying 
proportionally more to access essential services such as water and electricity. Economies of 
scale mean that the more someone demands the less is spent per unit. Lower consumption 
levels by persons living in extreme poverty frequently lead to proportionally higher costs. 
Furthermore, user fees and the indirect costs of accessing essential services are often 
prohibitive for persons living in extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>  
 18 See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 20 (2009) on non-
</p>
<p>discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights.

</p>
<p>general recommendation No. 32 (2009) on the meaning and scope of special measures in the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, para. 7. </p>


<p>28. Administrative obstacles are another relevant concern. Lack of official 
documentation can prevent persons living in extreme poverty accessing crucial social 
services and jeopardizes the realization of their rights to work, education, health and social 
security, amongst others.  
</p>
<p>29. Lack of education and cultural obstacles can also isolate persons living in poverty. 
Lack of formal education, limited knowledge of official languages, lack of access to 
information about public policies and programmes and the entrenched stigmatization that 
often labels them as lazy, criminally minded or incompetent, further exclude persons living 
in poverty and hamper the realization of their rights and their access to services.  
</p>
<p>30. Extreme poverty is frequently related to political isolation. Persons living in extreme 
poverty often lack the possibility of exerting political influence, effective political 
representation and power. Several factors, such as the opportunity cost for participation, 
lack of information and often a feeling of powerlessness prevent them from actively 
participating in decision-making processes that affect them. 
</p>
<p>31. The situation of persons living in extreme poverty is further diminished by 
discrimination and stigmatization by civil servants (including public authorities, social 
workers, teachers and health-care providers) and private individuals, who often fail to 
recognize and support the efforts that persons living in extreme poverty are making to 
improve their lives. Those living in poverty often develop fear and hostility towards public 
authorities, and have little confidence in the institutions that should assist them. By 
generating a sense of shame, such stigmatization also actively discourages persons living in 
extreme poverty from approaching officials and accessing the support they need.  
</p>
<p>32. The situation of persons living in extreme poverty can be made worse by exposure 
to violence and limited access to public security and justice systems. The prevalence of 
violence in communities living in extreme poverty significantly limits their economic 
development. Limited access to justice and security may increase exposure to corruption 
and extortion, thereby aggravating their social and economic conditions. 
</p>
<p>33. Persons living in extreme poverty are also disproportionately affected by armed 
conflicts, health pandemics, natural disasters and climate change. They are, in general, less 
able to prepare for, adapt to and recover from crises. Often, in the case of conflicts, due to 
lack of resources they are unable to relocate to safe areas and are disproportionately 
affected by fighting and forced displacement. Attending badly constructed schools, working 
in overcrowded conditions, occupying lower quality housing in densely populated slums or 
flood areas, for example, places them at greater risk of losing homes, livelihood and life in 
the event of a natural disaster, or extreme weather occurrences due to climate change. They 
are forced to rely on coping mechanisms that can jeopardize their long term stability, for 
instance selling assets such as livestock and removing children from school to work. This 
makes their living conditions worse and exacerbates their poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Proposal for improving the draft guiding principles on 
extreme poverty and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>34. This section presents an annotated outline, divided into three sections detailing the 
views of the independent expert on how to improve the existing text of the draft guiding 
principles. It prioritizes those rights and policy guidelines that are particularly relevant in 
the context of extreme poverty. Rather than comprehensively describing the scope and 
content of each principle and right, it aims to identify the specific obstacles faced by 
persons living in extreme poverty and provide examples of measures that States should take 
to overcome those obstacles and ensure that those living in extreme poverty are able to 
enjoy their rights. </p>


<p>35. The first section describes overarching human rights principles that should frame all 
initiatives addressing the situation of persons living in extreme poverty. The second section, 
describes policy guidelines relevant for removing obstacles that perpetuate extreme 
poverty. Finally, the last section clarifies specific human rights-based obligations of States<i>.</i> 
All three sections list different principles separated into subsections, each presenting a 
justification for including that specific principle and examples of the key recommendations 
each principle should cover. While the examples provided were stressed during various 
consultation processes, they should not be regarded as an exhaustive list. 
</p>
<p>36. The principles focus on the State as the primary actor responsible for realizing the 
human rights of people living within its jurisdiction. This does not erode the responsibilities 
of non-State actors which are obliged, at the very least, to respect human rights.21 While 
State responsibilities at the domestic level are emphasized, the independent expert 
recognizes that international stakeholders (e.g. States, international financial institutions 
and transnational corporations) affect the functioning of States and their ability to adopt 
relevant measures to fulfil their human rights obligations. This has significant implications 
for international assistance and cooperation, as it calls for an adequate flow of financial and 
technical assistance to developing States.22 It also implies that there must be active efforts 
to establish equitable systems of multilateral trade, investment and finance that are 
consistent with human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. The content of the proposed guiding principles should not be interpreted as limiting, 
altering or otherwise prejudicing the rights recognized under international human rights, 
refugee, criminal or humanitarian law and related standards, or rights consistent with these 
laws and standards as recognized under national law.23  
</p>
<p><b>  Section 1: Overarching human rights principles  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recognizing the centrality of human dignity, universality, indivisibility, 
interrelatedness and interdependence of all rights  
</b></p>
<p>38. Human dignity must be the cornerstone of the guiding principles. This concept is 
closely related to the recognition of the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness and 
interdependence of all rights. The dignity of persons living in extreme poverty is often 
undermined by the severe deprivations they suffer, which increases their vulnerability and 
dependence on others. The inherent dignity, freedom and equality of individuals are linked 
to the guarantee that &#8220;basic necessities of life are accessible to all&#8221;, because &#8220;human 
dignity, freedom and equality ... are denied those who have no food, clothing or shelter&#8221;.24  
</p>
<p>39. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon requiring an holistic approach. Given 
the interdependence of human rights, and the reinforcing nature of key deprivations, the 
enjoyment of all human rights is crucial to the elimination of extreme poverty.

</i>2001 (1) SA 46 (CC). </p>


<p>40. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Stress the centrality of human dignity and recommend that all measures to 
address poverty are framed by a comprehensive framework that embraces 
the principles of universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness and 
interdependence of all human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Highlight the need to ensure coordination among the various policies, both 
preventing persons from falling into extreme poverty and addressing the 
needs and vulnerabilities of persons living in extreme poverty. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recognizing the agency and autonomy of persons living in extreme 
poverty 
</b></p>
<p>41. Individual autonomy, including the freedom to make one&#8217;s own choices, and the 
independence of persons living in extreme poverty must be respected and protected. They 
are too often treated in a paternalistic manner and denied the right to make their own 
decisions because public authorities often believe they are acting in their best interests. This 
reinforces the perception that persons living in extreme poverty are part of the problem 
rather than part of the solution. It prevents them from fulfilling their own potential and 
increases dependency, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty.  
</p>
<p>42. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that poverty reduction initiatives recognize and protect the right 
of persons living in poverty to make their own decisions, respecting their 
capacities to fulfil their own potential, their sense of dignity and their right to 
participate in decisions affecting their life.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recognizing the principles of equality and non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>43. Extreme poverty is often the consequence of structural and societal discrimination, 
denying different groups access to resources, opportunities and assets to provide for 
themselves, as well as the political voice to claim their rights. Groups that are 
systematically discriminated against on the basis of, inter alia, their ethnicity, race, religion, 
gender, age, disability and migrant status are more likely to fall into and remain in a 
situation of extreme poverty. Extreme poverty is often an additional ground for 
discrimination, exclusion, and marginalization, with both public and private actors reacting 
to persons and communities in extreme poverty in ways that have the effect of nullifying or 
impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field.25 
The stigmatization of persons living in extreme poverty including being regarded as  &#8220;a 
burden on the State&#8221; can prevent them from realizing their rights and ignite violence and 
hostility, and sometimes even forced displacement.  
</p>
<p>44. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recognize the principles of equality and non-discrimination as immediate and

<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend, further to improving regulation, taking special measures to 
ensure de facto equality and accountability mechanisms. Such special 
measures include &#8220;the full span of legislative, executive, administrative,

as employment, housing, education, culture and participation in public life for 
disfavoured groups, devised and implemented on the basis of such 
instruments.&#8221;27  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend promoting awareness-raising measures to eliminate negative 
stigma against persons living in extreme poverty, in particular measures to 
sensitize public and private service delivery professionals fostering respect for 
the rights and dignity of persons living in extreme poverty.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Promoting the advancement of women and the elimination of gender-
based discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>45. Gender inequality causes and perpetuates poverty. At the same time, improving the 
situation of women is a key element for sustainable development.28 Gender-based 
discrimination limits women&#8217;s opportunities to access education, decent work 
opportunities, land, ownership, credit, inheritance and other economic resources, increasing 
their likelihood of living in extreme poverty.29 Women face multiple and aggravated forms 
of discrimination due to their age, ethnicity, race, health or other status. 
</p>
<p>46. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Emphasize that poverty amongst women is exacerbated by the multifaceted 
forms of discrimination they endure.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the obligations of States to achieve de jure and de facto equality 
between men and women.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend measures to ensure that women have full and equal legal 
capacity to own, control, administer and alienate economic resources such as 
land, credit and inheritance. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend measures to ensure that women have equal access to social 
services, including health, education, equal access to the labour market and 
equality between the sexes in marriage and family relations, ensuring that

<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend measures to promote the equal distribution of food and other 
resources within the household.

<p><b> E. Ensuring public participation  
</b></p>
<p>47. The exclusion of persons living in extreme poverty from public life implies that their 
voices are not heard in the development and implementation of legislation and policies 
affecting their lives. Full and effective participation is central to the right to take part in 
public affairs. Extreme poverty cannot be eradicated if the life experiences of persons living 
in extreme poverty continue to be ignored in public debates. Exercising the right to 
participate is clearly related to the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, assembly 
and association, and the right to information.31<b> </b>Persons living in extreme poverty must be 
considered part of the solution and their voices must be heard and properly considered at all 
stages of the design, implementation and evaluation of policies affecting them.  
</p>
<p>48. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend the creation of specific mechanisms and institutional 
arrangements through which persons living in extreme poverty can effectively 
and meaningfully participate in all stages of decision-making processes that 
affect them.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Call for specific measures to ensure adequate representation in the decision-
making processes of groups that are at higher risk of falling into extreme 
poverty such as children, women, indigenous peoples, racial, religious, ethnic 
and other minorities, older persons and persons with disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend measures to remove obstacles to participation, such as lack of 
meaningful and accessible information and opportunity costs, and create 
enabling conditions for the inclusion of persons living in extreme poverty in 
participatory processes. These measures should include enhancing the 
capacity of individuals, community-based organizations, social movements 
and other non-governmental organizations that give visibility to those in 
extreme poverty. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Ensuring transparency and access to information 
</b></p>
<p>49. Corruption is less likely to persist where there are legal instruments and independent 
mechanisms protecting transparency and access to information. Persons living in extreme 
poverty often lack access to crucial information and are disproportionately affected by 
corruption. Not only does this reduce their net income but it also obstructs their access to 
social services or job opportunities. The lack of transparency creates leeway for authorities 
to manipulate the provision of social services on a discriminatory basis, reinforcing social 
exclusion.  
</p>
<p>50. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations related to the right to seek, impart and receive 
information.32 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that States make publicly available and accessible information 
about issues of particular concern to those living in extreme poverty, such as 
information relating to service provision and availability of public resources.  
</b></p>
<p>  
 31 Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 25 (1996) on article 25 (Participation in public 
</p>
<p>affairs and the right to vote), paras. 25-26. 
 32 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 19 (2). </p>


<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that States implement public information campaigns to reach 
persons living in poverty and inform them of their rights, as well as relevant 
services and programmes aimed at reducing poverty.  
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Ensuring accountability and the right to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>51. The principle of accountability is closely linked to the rights of victims to effective 
access to justice,33 effective remedies34 and the opportunity for all elements of 
reparation (restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of 
non-repetition).35 Accountability should be viewed in a broader sense, relating to 
both providing redress and correcting failures to prevent future harm. Persons living 
in extreme poverty are frequently unable to demand and claim their human rights, 
seek redress and hold accountable individuals and institutions for measures that 
violate their human rights. Without accountability and redress mechanisms, social 
programmes are less likely to be understood as entitlements that are linked to human 
rights and are more likely to be viewed as instruments of charity that political actors 
can manipulate. Lack of accountability also perpetuates malpractice and 
ineffectiveness.  
</p>
<p>52. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend measures to ensure those responsible for actions and omissions 
that undermine or jeopardize the human rights of persons living in extreme 
poverty are held accountable through judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative 
and political mechanisms. This includes strengthening and making accessible 
both formal and informal monitoring, complaints, appeal and oversight 
mechanisms to which persons living in poverty can safely address their 
concerns and seek redress in cases of violations.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that strategies, policies, services and programmes designed to 
respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of persons living in extreme 
poverty are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Section 2: Overarching policy guidelines 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Ensuring that persons living in extreme poverty are identified and 
reached by public policies, programmes and interventions 
</b></p>
<p>53. The principles of equality and non-discrimination require public policies to identify 
and prioritize disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups. This is particularly 
relevant when resources are insufficient to ensure assistance to the totality of the 
population. Priority must be given to persons living in extreme poverty to ensure that they 
enjoy their civil and political rights and at the very least a minimum core content of all 
economic, social and cultural rights. To adequately establish priorities and attend to the 
needs of these individuals and groups, States must have adequate information about who

<p>lives in extreme poverty, why they are living in poverty, and what the consequences of 
living in extreme poverty are. 
</p>
<p>54. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that States set clear and transparent criteria for public 
authorities/bodies to ensure that people living in extreme poverty are 
prioritized when implementing development, social or poverty reduction 
programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend setting up comprehensive data-collection systems that provide 
disaggregated data, taking into account the specific attributes of extreme 
poverty in each country. The collection and processing of information must 
be in accordance with internationally accepted norms to protect human 
rights, ensuring confidentiality and respect for privacy. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that the design and implementation of public policies, in 
particular social policies, take into account the information collected, and that 
priority on expenditure be given to initiatives reaching those living in extreme 
poverty. 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Ensuring that facilities, goods and services required for the enjoyment 
of human rights are accessible, available and of good quality 
</b></p>
<p>55. Persons living in extreme poverty face a number of physical, economic, cultural and 
social obstacles in accessing the facilities, goods and services required to live in dignity, in 
particular essential services, even when they are provided by the State. Sharp disparities 
between the services available in affluent and poverty-stricken areas can be related to 
inconsistent government spending policies and bias towards certain areas (urban zones for 
example), a lack of adequately trained and sensitized personnel, and a lack of incentives for 
the private sector.  
</p>
<p>56. Without adequate supervision, outsourcing the provision of services to private 
companies that are governed solely by financial motivation risks reducing quality, 
affordability and coverage. While States are required to ensure access to essential services, 
under international human rights law they do not have to be the sole providers.36 The 
delivery of services, facilities or goods can be under the responsibility of local authorities, 
private companies or civil society organizations. However in all these circumstances, the 
integration of non-State actors does not exempt the State from its human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>57. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations relating to the provision of facilities, goods and 
services required for the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
Note that even if the provision of these is achieved with the involvement of 
local governments, private sector or civil society entities, States are 
responsible for ensuring that these processes are carried out according to 
human rights principles and standards. In this sense, the following concerns 
should be further addressed: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The need to ensure adequate access to facilities, goods and services. 
Services essential to the realization of human rights such as health care and 
education must be accessible to communities living in extreme poverty. This 
</b></p>
<p>  
 36 See A/HRC/6/3, para. 53. </p>


<p><b>also implies the need to ensure that adequate transportation is available to 
communities living in extreme poverty, thereby reducing travel time to 
services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The need to ensure the affordability of facilities, goods and services. This 
includes measures to ensure that persons living in extreme poverty are not 
disproportionally charged due to low consumption rates. It may also include 
regulating markets to ensure affordable costs for essential goods and 
eliminating user fees for essential services. Affordability should not detract 
from the obligation to ensure free access in some cases, such as for primary 
education, which must be compulsory and free of direct and indirect costs;37 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The need to ensure the acceptability and adaptability of facilities, goods 
and services with regard to the specific needs of persons living in extreme 
poverty, taking into account cultural differences, language barriers or the 
requirements of tailor-made assistance for groups with special needs, such as 
older persons, children living on the street and other homeless people, 
persons with disabilities, and indigenous peoples;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The need to ensure adequate quality of the facilities, goods and services 
provided. This includes monitoring quality of service, whether provided by 
local governments or private companies. It also involves creating incentives 
for well-qualified service providers to work in areas inhabited by persons in 
extreme poverty.  
</b></p>
<p><b> J. Ensuring international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>58. Given that extreme poverty is greatly concentrated within countries where human 
and financial resources are scarce, international assistance and cooperation play an essential 
role in improving the situation of those living in extreme poverty. Numerous legally 
binding obligations38 and political commitments39 underline the shared international 
responsibility for poverty reduction.  
</p>
<p>59. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reaffirm the obligations to provide international assistance and cooperation, 
as established in international human rights law, and stress the obligations of 
States requiring assistance to seek and manage external assistance according 
to human rights principles.  
</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, article 4 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child; and article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which 
impose legally binding obligations with regard to international assistance and cooperation.

<p> 39 Including, for example: the Declaration on the Right to Development (General Assembly resolution 
41/128), United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2); the Doha Ministerial Declaration 
issued at the Fourth World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, 2001; the Monterrey 
Consensus on Financing for Development; and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable 
Development issued at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. Goal 8 of the 
Millennium Development Goals sets out the clear need for a global partnership to address the current 
inequities in the global trading system, the necessity of addressing the problem of debt and ensuring 
that advancements in technology and science benefit all countries. </p>


<p>&#8226; <b>Stress the importance of ensuring the long-term support, coordination and 
predictability of international assistance and that aid programmes should 
build capacity and adapt to the specific context of each recipient State. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the need to ensure effective participation of recipient States and 
affected peoples and strengthen their capacity and ownership in the context of 
international assistance.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Stress that international assistance and cooperation must be combined with 
appropriate action in international trade, market and investment promotion, 
and labour market regulation, to ensure that they reinforce rather than 
undermine each other.  
</b></p>
<p><b> K. Ensuring that third parties, including other States, international 
organizations and transnational corporations do not undermine the 
human rights of persons living in extreme poverty  
</b></p>
<p>60. In a global economy, other States, international financial institutions, transnational 
corporations and other private enterprises play a central role in creating a different social 
and economic environment that creates poverty or directly affects persons living in extreme 
poverty. For example, the capacity of indebted States to secure budget support for social 
services can be restricted by creditors. Persons living in extreme poverty are also vulnerable 
to the actions of private enterprises acting both domestically and internationally.  
</p>
<p>61. Under international human rights law States must protect human rights by ensuring 
and enforcing regulatory frameworks to prevent and punish abuses and provide adequate 
remedies for identified abuses.  
</p>
<p>62. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reaffirm State obligations to ensure that &#8220;binding human rights standards 
are integrated in their international relations, including through trade and 
investment, development assistance and participation in multilateral forums 
and organizations&#8221;40. This includes identifying the possible human rights 
impact of measures agreed at international level and refraining from 
undertaking any activity that negatively affect a person&#8217;s human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reaffirm that conditionalities should not be imposed on recipients or 
indebted States if these could result in, or encourage, human rights violations, 
or affect the ability of the State concerned to formulate and implement its 
own domestic social and economic policies to respect, protect and fulfil 
human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall that cancellation of foreign debt, climate change related transfers and 
similar measures should be additional and complementary to official 
development assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the importance of regulating the operations of all business enterprises, 
including transnational corporations or companies controlled by them, both 
in terms of the impact of their activities and the activities of subsidiaries, and 
relating to the treatment of employees.41 This includes regulating 
corporations acting domestically and internationally to take into account and

<p><b>report on their activities that impact on human rights and to formulate, 
implement and report on the implementation of a code of conduct based on 
human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Section 3: Specific rights-based obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b> L. Right to recognition as a person before the law  
</b></p>
<p>63. Recognition as a person before the law is a human right in itself and crucial for the 
enjoyment of other fundamental rights and freedoms. Often persons living in extreme 
poverty lack legal identity documents because, for example, they have no proof of birth or 
fixed address. Some simply live out of reach of registration processes, others cannot afford 
costs associated with registration. Discrimination on various grounds may further prevent 
persons living in extreme poverty from being registered and having a legal identity. Often 
the lack of documentation of the parents could result in their children also remaining 
undocumented. At the same time, if States lack accurate information about those under its 
jurisdiction they face greater challenges in policy planning.  
</p>
<p>64. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend the allocation of the necessary resources to establish registration 
systems that are accessible to and adequate for persons living in extreme 
poverty. Effective registration systems not only require adequate financial 
and human resources, but must be based on regulatory frameworks 
recognizing the human right of every person to recognition before the law. 
Regulatory frameworks must also protect the human right to privacy.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend the establishment of mechanisms to ensure monitoring and 
accountability as essential components of registration systems and highlight 
the importance of a decentralized, flexible and culturally sensitive 
registration system.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Give particular attention to addressing the legal, economic, procedural, 
practical and cultural barriers that impede women, girls, indigenous peoples, 
persons with disabilities, minorities, and other groups from registering. 
Recommend that States introduce awareness-raising campaigns to inform 
persons living in extreme poverty about registration processes and their 
importance. 
</b></p>
<p><b> M. Right to privacy and protection from intrusion in family life 
</b></p>
<p>65. Persons living in extreme poverty are more likely to be subject to attacks on their 
privacy, integrity, honour and reputation by State and non-State actors. Such intrusions may 
be caused by overcrowded housing conditions in slums or the deliberate intervention of law 
enforcement or social services. Children from families experiencing extreme poverty are at 
greater risk of being removed by the authorities and placed in residential care. Family 
contacts and the moral and psychological support families provide are then jeopardized.  
</p>
<p>66. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the obligations of guaranteeing respect for the privacy and family life 
of persons of living in extreme poverty, and recommend revising national 
legal and administrative frameworks covering family life to protect persons </b></p>


<p><b>from having authorities inappropriately intrude on their privacy. This 
particularly applies within the context of implementing social programmes.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reaffirm the notion of the family as &#8220;the fundamental group of society and 
the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and 
particularly children&#8221;,42 and recall the obligation to respect the best interests 
of the child in all measures adopted. Regarding their possible removal from 
the family household, this includes taking the necessary measures to support 
families, prevent separations and ensure rapid reunification whenever 
conditions permit. 
</b></p>
<p><b> N. Rights to life, personal security and physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p>67. Persons living in extreme poverty are often exposed to both institutional and 
individual risks of violence and threats to their physical integrity from both private and 
State officials and institutions. Continued exposure and vulnerability to violence affects a 
person&#8217;s physical and mental health and impairs their situation and capacity to escape 
poverty.  
</p>
<p>68. Inappropriate legal and administrative measures criminalizing acts such as begging 
and vagrancy particularly affect persons in situations of poverty. Law enforcement agents 
often profile and deliberately target persons living in poverty, and police violence and the 
arbitrary use of force under the guise of law enforcement disproportionally affect them.  
</p>
<p>69. The prevalence of violence within the home and in the community is also a major 
concern for persons living in extreme poverty. The lack of investment in prevention, early 
warning mechanisms and public security in impoverished areas exacerbates the threat of 
violence. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to all forms of violence within 
and outside the home. Moreover, those living in poverty, with little or no economic 
independence, have fewer possibilities of escaping violence. . 
</p>
<p>70. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations to protect the physical integrity of persons living in 
extreme poverty, including prohibiting and preventing all forms of violence, 
investigating, prosecuting and punishing those responsible.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend investing in accessible early warning mechanisms and providing 
adequate assistance to victims of violence, and ensuring accountability for 
violent occurrences. Further recommend the adoption of measures to assist 
groups at greater risk of poverty, such as women, children, persons with 
disabilities and indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend adopting specific measures to prevent, monitor and punish 
violence perpetrated by State agents against persons living in extreme 
poverty. Reaffirm the need to repeal inadequate legislation, for instance 
vagrancy laws, and establish clear accountability systems.  
</b></p>
<p><b> O. Right to equal and effective access to justice  
</b></p>
<p>71. Persons living in extreme poverty are particularly vulnerable to human rights 
violations and abuses and they often, for economic and other reasons, lack the capability to 
</p>
<p>  
 42 Convention on the Rights of the Child, preamble. </p>


<p>access justice and seek redress for actions and omissions that adversely affect them. They 
encounter a variety of obstacles, from being unable to successfully register initial 
complaints to having court decisions given in their favour not implemented, or only 
partially implemented. Even when free legal assistance is available, discrimination, 
linguistic barriers or fear of reprisals are powerful obstacles for persons living in poverty 
seeking justice and redress. Without effective access to justice, they are unable to seek and 
obtain a remedy for breaches of domestic law and human rights standards, exacerbating 
their vulnerability, insecurity and isolation, and perpetuating their impoverishment. 
</p>
<p>72. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations to take all necessary measures to ensure that those 
living in poverty have equal access to justice, and that justice is dispensed 
fairly, speedily and without discrimination of any kind.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend that States expand justice systems and establish accessible 
procedures, including non-formal dispute resolution mechanisms, in 
accordance with human rights standards, to support persons living in 
extreme poverty who are seeking justice. Such measures must take into 
account the limited capacity of persons living in extreme poverty to pay for 
services, the congestion in court systems and the efficacy of informal and 
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reaffirm that rights enshrined in international human rights instruments, 
including economic, social and cultural rights, must be justiciable within the 
domestic legal order.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend investment in training for judges, lawyers and law enforcement 
officials in the use of local languages and in addressing the specific needs of 
different groups living in extreme poverty. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend the adoption of special measures to ensure the safety and 
security of persons seeking the support of the justice system. 
</b></p>
<p><b> P. Right to an adequate standard of living, including access to food  
</b></p>
<p>73. Inadequate standards of living are a constituent part of extreme poverty. Persons 
living in extreme poverty are often denied the right to adequate food and safe drinking 
water which are essential for human survival, physical development, maintenance, and 
physical activity. 
</p>
<p>74. Lack of income through employment, social security support, or the support of other 
social protection measures frequently results in the exposure of persons living in extreme 
poverty to hunger or an inadequate diet. 
</p>
<p>75. The prevalence of an inadequate standard of living is related to limited or insecure 
means of livelihood. Often the price of basic commodities is a major obstacle in urban areas 
while rural communities usually rely heavily on access to natural resources to provide for 
themselves and their families. However many, such as women, indigenous peoples and 
small agriculture producers, lack legally enforceable and sustainable control over, 
management of, and access to such resources.  </p>


<p>76. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the immediate and progressive obligations of States with regard to the 
right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, and the 
fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.43  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend ensuring access to relevant livelihood opportunities for those 
living in extreme poverty and reaffirm that States should &#8220;proactively engage 
in activities intended to strengthen people&#8217;s access to and utilization of 
resources&#8221;.44 This can include specific legislative, administrative and policy 
measures to promote and ensure sustainable management of productive 
resources by those living in extreme poverty.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend revising and repealing discriminatory laws and related 
administrative practices that impede the recognition of ownership of land and 
resources by groups or individuals living in extreme poverty, particularly 
women.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend implementing effective land distribution and agrarian reform 
programmes in areas where land concentration threatens access to livelihoods 
for rural communities.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend ensuring access to relevant financial resources, including bank 
loans, mortgages and other forms of credit, by those living in extreme 
poverty. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend recognizing and compensating for the shortcomings of market 
mechanisms in ensuring access to key entitlements such as staple foodstuffs. 
Ensuring adequate distribution mechanisms that make such staples 
physically and economically accessible to persons living in extreme poverty, in 
a culturally acceptable way and without negatively impacting small farmers, 
indigenous peoples, forest dwellers, pastoralists or local subsistence 
fishermen. 
</b></p>
<p><b> Q. Right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>77. Persons living in extreme poverty are disproportionally affected by limited access to 
safe drinking water45 with life-threatening consequence.46 Persons living in poverty, in 
particular women and children, bear the brunt of lacking access to safe drinking water and 
adequate sanitation. Unsafe water and inadequate sanitation compromise dignity, seriously 
affect health status throughout the life cycle, and hold back poverty reduction, and 
economic growth.47  
</p>
<p>78. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>

access to a sufficient amount of safe drinking water for personal and domestic 
use - drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation and 
personal and household hygiene - to sustain life and health.

inhabited by persons living in extreme poverty, including improved access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation facilities.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend organizing large-scale public awareness campaigns promoting 
and providing information on hygiene.48 
</b></p>
<p><b> R. Right to adequate housing, security of tenure and protection from 
forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>79. Persons living in extreme poverty commonly lack adequate housing and security of 
tenure. They often inhabit land where they are vulnerable to forced eviction without 
adequate compensation and reparation.49 Persons living in extreme poverty tend to inhabit 
unsafe areas, and are disproportionately exposed to natural disasters or environmental 
hazards, with life-threatening consequences. In some situations, communities are removed 
by urban planning efforts to areas where there is inadequate access to livelihoods and 
services, thus increasing their vulnerability. Some particularly vulnerable groups are 
homeless and live in public areas and/or urban centres.  
</p>
<p>80. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the immediate and progressive obligations of States relating to the 
right to adequate housing for persons living in extreme poverty, including 
measures regarding security of tenure; availability of services, material 
facilities and infrastructure; affordability; habitability; accessibility; location 
and cultural adequacy.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend adopting due process safeguards against forced eviction and 
other forms of arbitrary or unlawful interference with people's privacy and 
home, including land. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall that evictions should only occur in exceptional circumstances, and in 
compliance with national law and international human rights norms and 
standards.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend ensuring adequate public expenditure and encourage private 
sector investment in low-income housing and access to urbanized land 
programmes to reduce the incidence of homelessness, or unassisted and 
unplanned settlements.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend adopting specific measures to ensure a safe and healthy 
environment in areas inhabited by persons living in extreme poverty, in 
particular, protecting these areas from climatic and health hazards.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the importance of prioritizing overall improvements in infrastructure 
in areas inhabited by persons living in extreme poverty, including all-weather 
roads and electricity.

</p>
<p>adequate housing. </p>


<p><b> S. Right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>81. Health is a clear example of how the deprivations of persons living in poverty can 
significantly reduce their ability to escape poverty: poverty engenders ill health and ill 
health engenders poverty. Limited access to physical and mental health care including 
medicine, insufficient nutrition and unsafe living environments, deeply affects the health 
status of persons living in extreme poverty and impairs their ability to engage in income-
generating activities.  
</p>
<p>82. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations to ensure the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, 
goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest 
attainable standard of health.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend taking special measures to target the main health conditions 
affecting persons living in extreme poverty, in particular neglected diseases 
that are particularly prevalent in impoverished communities and countries.50 
This includes identifying diseases and medical conditions that particularly 
affect those living in poverty, implementing the necessary immunization, 
education and other programmes, and training health practitioners to 
identify and treat particular illnesses that especially affect those living in 
poverty.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Call on States to provide tailor-made services for groups whose access to 
health services may raise particular challenges, such as women, older persons<i>, 
</i>children, indigenous peoples<i>, </i>minorities, slum-dwellers, labour migrants and 
those living in remote rural communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> T. Right to work and rights at work 
</b></p>
<p>83. Persons living in extreme poverty often lack adequate and secure work. In rural and 
urban areas alike they experience unemployment, underemployment, unreliable casual 
labour, low wages and unsafe and degrading working conditions. Women are particularly at 
risk, as are other groups affected by discrimination, such as migrants and persons with 
disabilities. Persons living in extreme poverty tend to work outside the formal economy, 
without any entitlement to social security benefits, such as maternity leave, sick leave, 
pensions, and disability and widowhood benefits. They commonly work in inappropriate or 
dangerous conditions for very low wages. Minimum work standards are rarely applied and 
they face job insecurity, with increased vulnerability to exploitation including bonded or 
forced labour, arbitrary dismissal and abuse, particularly female workers.  
</p>
<p>84. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations to establish and enforce minimum legal standards 
and administrative measures to ensure that all workers, in both the formal 
and informal sectors, enjoy just and favourable conditions of work, including 
a minimum wage that enables them to secure the essential components of the 
right to an adequate standard of living; equal pay for work of equal value; 
safe and healthy working conditions; rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of 
working hours; and the right to organize and bargain collectively.  
</b></p>
<p>  
 50 E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2. </p>


<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend paying particular attention to the situation of workers in the 
informal economy and caregivers. Call on States to collect disaggregated data 
assessing the dimensions of informal and care work. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend adopting measures to remove impediments to integration into 
the formal labour market for persons living in extreme poverty, including by 
promoting skills development opportunities without discrimination of any 
kind. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the obligations to prohibit and eliminate all forms of forced and 
bonded labour, as well as harmful and hazardous forms of child labour. 
Recommend that measures to enforce the prohibition of these forms of labour 
be accompanied by measures to ensure the social and economic reintegration 
of those affected and to avoid reoccurrence. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the importance of addressing human trafficking in full compliance 
with human rights norms and recommend that trafficked persons be 
protected from further exploitation and harm regardless of their capacity or 
willingness to cooperate in legal proceedings.51  
</b></p>
<p><b> U. Right to social security 
</b></p>
<p>85. Both as a right in itself and as a means to securing other rights, social security is 
crucial for the respect and protection of the dignity of persons living in extreme poverty, 
including their right an adequate standard of living. Social protection can prevent people 
from falling into extreme poverty by helping them cope with different risks, shocks and 
crises beyond their control.  
</p>
<p>86. Persons living in extreme poverty often cannot enjoy their right to social security, 
due to inadequate and ineffective social protection programmes. Because they are more 
likely to work in the informal economy, or to hold insecure, low-paid jobs, they are the 
least likely to be included in contributory social security systems; despite this, most States 
lack non-contributory social security systems. Inappropriate targeting mechanisms, 
complicated eligibility criteria, corruption, and limited geographical outreach or coverage 
often generate inequalities in access to social security and social assistance.  
</p>
<p>87. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations to allocate the necessary resources and develop 
comprehensive social security programmes to provide universal, non-
contributory social assistance as part of the minimum core content of the 
right to social security.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend creating a basic set of essential social transfers, in cash and in 
kind, to be paid to the most vulnerable to provide minimum income security 
and access to essential health care.52  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Stress the relevance of adopting measures to ensure that groups at greater 
risk of poverty, such as children, women, persons with disabilities and older

summary. </p>


<p><b>persons, are prioritized by assistance schemes. Also call for specific initiatives 
to guarantee that women have access to social security schemes, including 
social pensions, without having to depend on a &quot;male breadwinner&quot; through 
which household needs are calculated and channelled.53 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Right to education  
</b></p>
<p>88. Education is a crucial means by which people can escape poverty and obtain the 
means to participate fully in their communities. Education levels strongly and positively 
correlate with better employment opportunities. Students coming from families living in 
extreme poverty are more likely to drop out of school, or not even attend it in the first 
place, in favour of engaging in income-generating activities, including begging, or helping 
with household chores. The economic consequences of not finishing primary or secondary 
school are enormous and perpetuate the cycle of poverty. Girls are particularly affected: 
more commonly denied their right to education, they often end up in domestic work, early 
marriage and childbearing and rearing, which in turn increases impoverishment. 
</p>
<p>89. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the State obligation to immediately ensure free and compulsory 
primary education for all, within safe reach and without indirect costs. Such 
obligations require implementing policies on both the demand and supply 
sides: on the supply side, providing the necessary school infrastructure 
(buildings, adequate services and facilities including sanitation, water, and 
electricity for low-income settlements); on the demand side, ensuring that 
families and communities are not dependent on child labour to live in dignity.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend progressively ensuring the availability, accessibility, 
acceptability, adaptability and quality of education in all forms and at all 
levels. This includes allocating resources in priority towards persons living in 
extreme poverty, for example with proactive measures to combat school 
dropout and to compensate for socio-economic disadvantage.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend taking special measures to ensure the education of girls, children 
with disabilities, minorities, refugees, stateless persons, and those living in 
remote areas and slums, as being especially vulnerable and marginalized.54  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recommend reviewing and reforming legislation to ensure consistency 
between the minimum school leaving age and the minimum age of marriage 
and employment.55  
</b></p>
<p><b> W. Right to take part in cultural life 
</b></p>
<p>90. Poverty seriously restricts the ability of a person or a group of persons to exercise 
the right to take part in, gain access and contribute to all spheres of cultural life, and 
seriously affects their hopes for the future and their ability to effectively enjoy their own

<p>culture.56 This adds to their feelings of isolation and exclusion. Persons living in poverty 
must be able to engage in all activities that define the cultural life with which they identify 
without discrimination. This moves beyond traditional culture to include ways of life, 
language, oral and written literature, music and song, non-verbal communication, religion 
or belief systems, rites and ceremonies, sport and games, methods of production or 
technology, natural and man-made environment, food, clothing and shelter, the arts, and 
customs and traditions, through which individuals, groups of individuals and communities 
express their humanity and the meaning they give to their existence, and build their world 
view representing their encounter with the external forces affecting their lives.57 
</p>
<p>91. A revised version of the draft guiding principles should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall State obligations to realize the right of everyone to take part in cultural 
life. In particular, recommend the adoption of measures to respect and 
protect a person&#8217;s cultural identity and the cultural diversity of countries, to 
promote an environment of social inclusion that recognizes the contribution 
of all members of society, and create opportunities to access cultural life. This 
should include facilitating access to public spaces where individuals and 
groups from all communities can gather to practice rites and ceremonies, and 
facilitating access to cultural goods and services.58  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recall the importance of respecting and protecting the cultural heritage of 
these groups living in poverty. This includes protection from illegal or unjust 
exploitation of the lands, territories and resources of indigenous peoples by 
State entities, or private or transnational enterprises and corporations.59
