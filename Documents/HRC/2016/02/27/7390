<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2014, the special procedures continued to play a critical role in the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. Mandate holders addressed all types of rights &#8211; civil, cultural, 
</p>
<p>economic, political and social &#8211; as well as issues relating to specific groups. They reported 
</p>
<p>to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, undertook country visits and acted 
</p>
<p>on individual cases and concerns of a broader structural nature by means of 
</p>
<p>communications to States and others. They also conducted thematic studies, convened 
</p>
<p>expert consultations, contributed to the development of international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards, engaged in advocacy, raised public awareness and provided advice and support 
</p>
<p>for technical cooperation. The examples provided in the present report are indicative only 
</p>
<p>and do not reflect all activities carried out by all mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides facts and figures on the composition and outputs of the 
</p>
<p>special procedures in 2014, including concrete examples of their contributions for the 
</p>
<p>advancement of human rights. It describes the activities of the Coordination Committee of 
</p>
<p>Special Procedures and the main points discussed by the special procedures at their twenty-
</p>
<p>first annual meeting. The annual meeting is rooted in the Vienna Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action, which underlined the importance of preserving and strengthening the 
</p>
<p>system of special procedures and enabling it to harmonize and rationalize its work through 
</p>
<p>periodic meetings.1
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Facts and figures 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. New mandates 
</b></p>
<p>3. During 2014, the Human Rights Council established two new thematic mandates: on 
</p>
<p>the rights of persons with disabilities, and on the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures on the enjoyment of human rights. It also established a country mandate on 
</p>
<p>capacity-building and technical cooperation with C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>The special procedures system currently consists of 53 mandates, of which 39 are thematic 
</p>
<p>and 14 concern countries.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate holders 
</b></p>
<p>4. There are a total of 77 mandate holder positions, of which 31 were appointed in 
</p>
<p>2014. Mandate holders come from all United Nations geographic groups. At 31 December 
</p>
<p>2014, 23.68 per cent were from the African States, 19.74 per cent from Asian States, 11.84 
</p>
<p>per cent from Eastern European States, 19.74 per cent from Latin American and Caribbean 
</p>
<p>States and 25 per cent from the Western Group (see annex I). A total of 38 per cent of 
</p>
<p>mandate holders are female and 62 per cent are male. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Country visits and standing invitations 
</b></p>
<p>5. In 2014, special procedures conducted 80 country visits to 60 States and territories 
</p>
<p>(see annex II). One Member State (Cameroon) and one non-Member observer State (State 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), part II, para. 95. </p>


<p>of Palestine) were added to the list of those that have extended a standing invitation to 
</p>
<p>special procedures, reaching a total of 110 (see annex III).  
</p>
<p>6. Over the years, 167 States (or 86.5 per cent) have accepted requests for country 
</p>
<p>visits, and 166 have been visited by at least one special procedures mandate holder. A total 
</p>
<p>of 26 States (or 13.4 per cent) have never received or accepted any request for a visit by one 
</p>
<p>or more mandate holders (see annex IV). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Communications  
</b></p>
<p>7. In 2014, the special procedures addressed a total of 553 communications to 116 
</p>
<p>States; 451 communications were sent jointly by more than one mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>Communications covered at least 1,061 individuals, 179 of whom were women. A total of 
</p>
<p>237 replies were received (equivalent to 42.7 per cent of communications). A total of 135 
</p>
<p>communications were followed up by mandate holders (see annex V). Responses varied 
</p>
<p>from acknowledgement of receipt to more substantive replies. Three communications 
</p>
<p>reports were submitted to the Human Rights Council at its sessions.2  
</p>
<p>8. Following opinions issued by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention qualifying 
</p>
<p>the detention of a complainant as arbitrary, in 2014 the Working Group received 
</p>
<p>information on the release of 17 individuals and 230 military officers.  
</p>
<p>9. In 2014, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances transmitted 
</p>
<p>259 new cases of enforced disappearances, of which 69 under the urgent action procedure. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group clarified 47 cases. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Thematic reports and studies 
</b></p>
<p>10. In 2014, 135 reports were submitted to the Human Rights Council (including 64 
</p>
<p>country missions reports) and 36 to the General Assembly (see annex VI).  
</p>
<p>11. Some newly appointed mandate holders focused their first report on their methods of 
</p>
<p>work and priorities; this was the case of the mandate holders on the sale of children, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography; the effects of foreign debt and other related 
</p>
<p>international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>particularly economic, social and cultural rights; adequate housing as a component of the 
</p>
<p>right to an adequate standard of living, on the right to non-discrimination in this context; 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights defenders; the right to food; the enjoyment of all human rights 
</p>
<p>by older persons; the rights of indigenous peoples; contemporary forms of slavery, 
</p>
<p>including its causes and consequences; and the implications for human rights of the 
</p>
<p>environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. 
</p>
<p>12. A number of outgoing mandate holders recapitulated the achievements of their 
</p>
<p>mandate in their last report; this was the case of the mandate holders on the sale of children, 
</p>
<p>child prostitution and child pornography; the rights of indigenous peoples; the effects of 
</p>
<p>foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; trafficking 
</p>
<p>in persons, especially women and children; the right to food; the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders; extreme poverty and human rights; and the human right to safe drinking water 
</p>
<p>and sanitation. The final report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in Cambodia included reflections on the work of the mandate holder during 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/25/74, A/HRC/26/21 and A/HRC/27/72. </p>


<p>the six years of the mandate. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, addressed the developments witnessed within the United Nations with 
</p>
<p>regard to the theme of violence against women.3  
</p>
<p>13. Some mandate holders contributed to the debate on the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda, such as the mandate holders on human rights and international solidarity; minority 
</p>
<p>issues; the rights of indigenous peoples; the human rights of migrants; and the 
</p>
<p>independence of judges and lawyers.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Contributions to standard-setting and the protection and promotion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. In 2014, mandate holders continued to contribute to the progressive development of 
</p>
<p>international human rights law by means of studies, consultations and the elaboration of 
</p>
<p>guidelines in a variety of specific areas. For example, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
</p>
<p>right to water and sanitation published a handbook for realizing the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation,4 aimed at providing all relevant actors with concrete 
</p>
<p>guidance and tools on the meaning of this human right. The Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons, especially women and children, issued a set of basic principles on the 
</p>
<p>right to effective remedy for victims of trafficking in persons,5 intended to be a &#8220;living tool&#8221; 
</p>
<p>for practitioners and law enforcement officials to use in their daily anti-trafficking work. 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to Council resolution 20/16, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention embarked 
</p>
<p>on the preparation of draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and procedures on 
</p>
<p>the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before court.
 
The 
</p>
<p>draft will be presented to the Council at its thirtieth session. The Independent Expert on 
</p>
<p>human rights and international solidarity presented a draft declaration on the right of 
</p>
<p>peoples and individuals to international solidarity to the Council for its input.6
 
The draft 
</p>
<p>embodies the evolution of international solidarity into a concrete right to address the 
</p>
<p>structural causes of poverty, inequality and other global challenges that impede human 
</p>
<p>rights. A revised draft will be submitted to the Council and the General Assembly by 2016. 
</p>
<p>15. Several reports submitted to the Council and the General Assembly contained 
</p>
<p>recommendations for the development of international law, such as the recommendation of 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism that the Human Rights Committee develop and adopt a general comment on the 
</p>
<p>right to online privacy.7 The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty recommended the 
</p>
<p>drafting of an optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights or adapting the methods of work of the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights to monitor the implementation of social protection floors.8 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on violence against women recommended the conclusion of a legally binding 
</p>
<p>instrument to combat violence against women that addresses gaps in international human 
</p>
<p>rights law.9 The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human 
</p>
<p>rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination recommended 
</p>
<p>the drafting of an internationally binding instrument on private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies. The Independent Expert on the promotion of an equitable and democratic 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 A/HRC/26/38. 
</p>
<p> 4 A/HRC/27/55/Add.3. 
</p>
<p> 5 A/HRC/26/18, annex. 
</p>
<p> 6 A/HRC/26/34, annex. 
</p>
<p> 7 A/69/397, para. 64. 
</p>
<p> 8 A/69/297, paras. 61-62. 
</p>
<p> 9 A/69/368, para. 71. </p>


<p>international order is supporting the work of the open-ended intergovernmental working 
</p>
<p>group on a draft United Nations declaration on the right to peace. 
</p>
<p>16. Mandate holders contributed to the human rights debate, bringing to the attention of 
</p>
<p>the international community issues such as the use of drones in extraterritorial lethal 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism operations;10
 
the trend of remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones and 
</p>
<p>emerging autonomous weapons systems;11 the use of mass digital surveillance for counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism purposes;12 the implementation of the right to social security through the universal 
</p>
<p>adoption of social protection floors;13 and the use of private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies.14 
 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>or punishment published a book containing essays from more than 30 international experts 
</p>
<p>reflecting on and expanding interpretations of his report on abuses in health-care settings.15 
</p>
<p>The report of the Special Rapporteur has indeed led to widespread debate on such issues as 
</p>
<p>palliative care, forced psychiatric treatment and gender assignment surgery for intersex 
</p>
<p>persons.
 
</p>
<p>18. Mandate holders witnessed positive developments in national legal and policy 
</p>
<p>frameworks. For example, following the visit of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, especially women and children to Seychelles, a prohibition of trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons act was enacted. The law not only penalizes the crime of trafficking and makes 
</p>
<p>provisions for the protection and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking, but also established 
</p>
<p>a formalized interministerial committee to harmonize the State&#8217;s efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons and to oversee the implementation of a national strategy and plan of 
</p>
<p>action on trafficking in persons based on the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur.
 
</p>
<p><b> G. Media outreach and public awareness 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the period under review, 379 news releases and public statements were 
</p>
<p>issued, individually or jointly, by mandate holders. In addition, a number of web stories 
</p>
<p>were produced, as were three documentaries,16 on the visits of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the human right to water and sanitation, to Brazil; the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, especially women and children, to Italy; and the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, to Uruguay. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>20. Mandate holders continued to engage with numerous stakeholders and institutions 
</p>
<p>and to conduct several activities aimed at advocating for better protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>21. On 30 May 2014, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons held an Arria Formula meeting with the Security Council on the theme &#8220;Protection 
</p>
<p>of internally displaced persons: challenges and role of the Security Council.&#8221; On 28 
</p>
<p>October, he also participated in an open debate of the Council on women, peace and 
</p>

<p>security, with a focus on &#8220;displaced women and girls: leaders and survivors&#8221;. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples attended the Forum on Indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>held in New York in May, and the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, in September. Similarly, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, attended the 
</p>
<p>fifty-eighth session of the Commission on the Status of Women in March, while the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons addressed the Open-
</p>
<p>ended Working Group on the Human Rights of Older Persons at its fifth session, in July.  
</p>
<p>22. In 2014, 12 mandate holders participated in panel discussions held during the 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Human Rights Council. As a result of two consecutive reports submitted by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights on the issue of historical and memorial 
</p>
<p>narratives in divided societies,17 the Council decided to convene, at its twenty-seventh 
</p>
<p>session, a panel discussion on the issue. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, 
</p>
<p>justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence participated in the ensuing discussion 
</p>
<p>as a panellist, reflecting the linkages between the two mandates on this issue. 
</p>
<p>23. Following a recommendation of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, the 
</p>
<p>Council convened a panel discussion during its twenty-seventh session on the use of 
</p>
<p>remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones in counter-terrorism and military operations, with 
</p>
<p>the participation of the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions. 
</p>
<p>24. Mandate holders continued to organize expert meetings on topics of relevance to 
</p>
<p>their respective mandate. In November 2014, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance convened an 
</p>
<p>expert meeting on the dilemmas and challenges faced in combating the use of racial 
</p>
<p>profiling by law enforcement officers. The outcome of the meeting will inform his thematic 
</p>
<p>report to be submitted to the Council at its twenty-ninth session.  
</p>
<p>25. Under the guidance of the Working Group on Business and Human Rights, the third 
</p>
<p>annual Forum on Business and Human Rights was held in Geneva from 1 to 3 December 
</p>
<p>2014, and saw the participation of some 2,000 representatives of the private sector, 
</p>
<p>Governments and civil society. The theme of the Forum was &#8220;Advancing business and 
</p>
<p>human rights globally: alignment, adherence and accountability&#8221;. The report of the Forum 
</p>
<p>will be presented to the Council at its twenty-ninth session.18 
</p>
<p>26. On 25 and 26 November 2014, the Forum on Minority Issues held its seventh 
</p>
<p>session under the leadership of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues.19 Some 570 
</p>
<p>participants attended the Forum, including representatives of Member States, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and United Nations and regional intergovernmental bodies. 
</p>
<p>The debate focused on the theme &#8220;Preventing and addressing violence and atrocity crimes 
</p>
<p>targeted against minorities&#8221;. The recommendations of the Forum will be presented to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its twenty-eighth session.  
</p>
<p>27. The substantive inputs of the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
</p>
<p>Descent contributed greatly to the adoption on 18 November 2014 by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly of a programme of activities for the implementation of the International Decade 
</p>
<p>for People of African Descent (2015-2024) with the theme &#8220;People of African descent: 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 A/68/296 and A/HRC/25/49. 
</p>
<p> 18 A/HRC/29/29. 
</p>
<p> 19 See A/HRC/28/77. </p>


<p>recognition, justice and development&#8221;.20 The programme includes the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>forum for persons of African descent and the drafting of a United Nations declaration on 
</p>
<p>the promotion and full respect of the human rights of people of African descent. The 
</p>
<p>International Decade was officially launched at Headquarters on 10 December. 
</p>
<p>28. A number of mandate holders followed closely the debate over the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda and draft documents on the sustainable development goals, advocating 
</p>
<p>for a stand-alone goal on equality and women&#8217;s empowerment and the mainstreaming of a 
</p>
<p>gender perspective into all other goals. 
</p>
<p>29. Mandate holders also continued to integrate a gender perspective and promote the 
</p>
<p>human rights of women in their work.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities of the Coordination Committee of Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Procedures 
</b></p>
<p>30. In 2013 and 2014, the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures continued to 
</p>
<p>assist coordination among mandate holders and to facilitate interaction and dialogue with a 
</p>
<p>range a bodies and stakeholders. It prioritized engagement with the Council and the 
</p>
<p>participation of mandate holders in the Council&#8217;s work. The Committee and its Chairperson 
</p>
<p>met regularly with stakeholders, including the Secretary-General, the High Commisioner, 
</p>
<p>the President of the Council, and representatives of Member States and civil society. The 
</p>
<p>Committee advised on the appointment of new mandate holders, in particular the need for 
</p>
<p>the voice of special procedures to be heard in this process and for expertise and skills to be 
</p>
<p>main selection criteria, and engaged with the Consultative Group in this context. It also 
</p>
<p>worked on other issues, including the coordination of joint activities and statements on 
</p>
<p>country-specific and thematic issues; country-specific issues; the role of special procedures 
</p>
<p>in mainstreaming human rights; the facilitation of dialogue and cooperation between States 
</p>
<p>and special procedures; and reprisals against those who cooperate with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>in the field of human rights, and attacks against mandate holders, in particular at the 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Council and in relation to country visits. In addition, it continued to give 
</p>
<p>guidance on issues relating to the independence of special procedures, working methods 
</p>
<p>and the code of conduct, in accordance with the internal advisory procedure. The 
</p>
<p>Committee maintained regular contact with civil society.  
</p>
<p>31. The Committee&#8217;s activities included, inter alia, delivering statements on behalf of all 
</p>
<p>mandate holders at the special sessions of the Council, including during the sessions on the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic, the occupied Palestinian territories and Iraq.  
</p>
<p>32. The Committee also coordinated on behalf of all mandate holders the issuance of an 
</p>
<p>open letter on 21 January 2014 on the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic; on 21 
</p>
<p>February, a joint statement on the situation in Ukraine; on 17 October, a letter on climate 
</p>
<p>change; and, on 10 December, a statement on the occasion of Human Rights Day on 
</p>
<p>climate change and human rights (see annex VII). 
</p>
<p>33. The Committee continued to nurture its partnership with regional mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>including during a Wilton Park conference held in January 2014 on the theme &#8220;Addressing 
</p>
<p>implementation gaps: improving cooperation between global and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms&#8221;. A group of mandate holders attended the fifty-fifth ordinary session of the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (28 April - 12 May 2014), in Luanda, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20 See General Assembly resolution 69/16. </p>


<p>including the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, who 
</p>
<p>officially addressed the Commission.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Twenty-first annual meeting of special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>34. The twenty-first annual meeting focused on issues relating to the special procedures 
</p>
<p>system. Mandate holders exchanged views with the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the Deputy Secretary-General, the Special Advisers of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General on the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect, the Special Envoy 
</p>
<p>of the Secretary-General on Climate Change and the President of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, and representatives of United Nations entities, States, the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, the International Coordinating Committee of National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Institutions and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>35. During the meeting, the participants (see annex VIII) elected by acclamation the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, as Chairperson of 
</p>
<p>the Coordination Committee for the 2014-2015 cycle. The Chairperson of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group of Experts on People of African Descent, Mireille Fanon-Mendes-France, was 
</p>
<p>elected Rapporteur of the annual meeting and member of the Coordination Committee. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic, 
</p>
<p>Marie-Therese Keita Bocoum, and the Chairperson of the Working Group on the issue of 
</p>
<p>human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, Michael Addo, 
</p>
<p>were endorsed as members of the Committee. The former Chairperson of the Coordination 
</p>
<p>Committee and Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
</p>
<p>Chaloka Beyani, will remain an ex officio member for the coming year. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>36. During the meeting, mandate holders discussed their methods of work and areas for 
</p>
<p>improvement, including through enhanced coordination, strategic partnerships and the use 
</p>
<p>of information technologies. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Country visits and strategies 
</b></p>
<p>37. Mandate holders welcomed the increasing number of Member States issuing 
</p>
<p>standing invitations to special procedures. They noted, however, that in practice, they still 
</p>
<p>faced difficulties in visiting the countries to which they had been invited. It was suggested 
</p>
<p>that the attention of the President of the Council be drawn to instances where States deny 
</p>
<p>access to requests for visits so that appropriate action could be considered. Mandate holders 
</p>
<p>also regretted the practice of some States that deny access to certain mandate holders while 
</p>
<p>inviting others to visit.  
</p>
<p>38. Participants also discussed specific issues affecting country-specific mandate 
</p>
<p>holders, particularly when denied access to the State under consideration. They reiterated 
</p>
<p>the need to be able to monitor and follow up the human rights situation as requested by the 
</p>
<p>Council as its &#8220;eyes and ears&#8221;. The recommendation was also made that the Council use its 
</p>
<p>influence to assist country-specific mandates to carry out their functions adequately.  
</p>
<p>39. Participants identified the need to improve coordination among mandate holders and 
</p>
<p>to keep each other informed when planning visits to avoid numerous visits to a single 
</p>
<p>country. It was also recommended that country-specific and thematic mandate holders be 
</p>
<p>more closely coordinated when the latter intend to visit a State which is already the subject 
</p>
<p>of a special procedures mandate. </p>


<p><b> 2. Follow-up to activities 
</b></p>
<p>40. Mandate holders continued to discuss ways to improve follow-up to their 
</p>
<p>recommendations, including those made after country visits. They shared their experiences 
</p>
<p>of follow-up, in particular the initiatives that they had taken, including the publication of 
</p>
<p>reports, such as in the case of the Special Rapporteur on torture, who published a 
</p>
<p>compilation in September 2014.21 The compilation includes articles by senators and 
</p>
<p>representatives, officials of the Ministry of the Interior and the Penitentiary System, 
</p>
<p>members of the national human rights institution and the national preventive mechanism of 
</p>
<p>Uruguay, the Parliamentary Commissary for the penitentiary system,\ and a variety of 
</p>
<p>representatives leading non-governmental organizations. The publication is designed to be a 
</p>
<p>tool to focus attention on the status of the implementation of the recommendations made by 
</p>
<p>the mandate holder.  
</p>
<p>41. Other mandate holders disseminated questionnaires and convened workshops (see 
</p>
<p>annex IX). One mandate holder pointed out that, one year after a country visit, he asked the 
</p>
<p>State authorities whether they were interested in inviting him again; responses were often 
</p>
<p>positive. These more focused follow-up visits proved to be a positive experience; for 
</p>
<p>instance, in May 2014, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief conducted a 
</p>
<p>working visit to the Republic of Moldova, including the Transnistria region, to follow up on 
</p>
<p>the recommendations he had made when visiting the country in 2012. He welcomed the 
</p>
<p>adoption of Law 121/2012 on Ensuring Equality and the establishment in 2013 of the 
</p>
<p>Council for Preventing and Eliminating Discrimination and Ensuring Equality. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the adoption of a law on alternative civilian service in February 2014 and amnesty for those 
</p>
<p>who were previously condemned for conscientious objection to military service in 
</p>
<p>Transnistria were also a positive example of the implementation of one of his 
</p>
<p>recommendations. Other significant progress was the inclusion by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education of a subject on the Holocaust in history lessons in several grades.  
</p>
<p>42. Other mandate holders recalled the important role played by other stakeholders, in 
</p>
<p>particular civil society, in following up on the work of special procedures. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on torture worked with civil society stakeholders to support their follow-up 
</p>
<p>efforts and to provide a platform for the engagement of civil society with the Government 
</p>
<p>to drive anti-torture work forward. Participants also requested that reports on country visit 
</p>
<p>be also translated into the local languages of the States concerned.  
</p>
<p>43. Mandate holders also considered issues relating to alternative ways to follow up on 
</p>
<p>country visits in the light of the limited budget resources.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Information technologies 
</b></p>
<p>44. Mandate holders reiterated the need to revisit the OHCHR webpages devoted to 
</p>
<p>special procedures with a view to optimize this important information tool and to keep 
</p>
<p>users informed about their activities, including those of the Coordination Committee.  
</p>
<p>45. Moreover, participants requested that the above-mentioned webpages be made more 
</p>
<p>user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience, which could therefore engage in an 
</p>
<p>interactive dialogue. One step suggested was the translation of the content of the webpages 
</p>
<p>into all official languages of the United Nations. Mandate holders also enquired about 
</p>
<p>electronic meeting platforms. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law, Pr&#243;ximos Pasos Hacia una Pol&#237;tica Penitenciaria de 
</p>

</p>
<p>Relator&#237;a de Naciones Unidas contra la tortura, Washington College of Law, September 2014. </p>


<p>46. OHCHR informed the special procedures about steps taken to enhance and redesign 
</p>
<p>its current website. The process is being put in place in a gradual manner and is expected to 
</p>
<p>also include webpages devoted to special procedures mechanisms. In the meantime, the 
</p>
<p>Secretariat will continue to update content relating to special procedures mandates and to 
</p>
<p>create new pages for newly appointed mandate holders.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Media and outreach 
</b></p>
<p>47. Mandate holders discussed ways to increase efficiency when issuing media 
</p>
<p>statements, including issues related to timing and coordination with all concerned. They 
</p>
<p>also enquired about contacts with media units in other organizations on crossing-cutting 
</p>
<p>issues such environment and health, and suggested a different approach to press releases, 
</p>
<p>including by making them more targeted to resonate at the national and local levels.  
</p>
<p>48. The OHCHR media unit briefed participants about media established practices. It 
</p>
<p>also reported on other successful communication tools, such as web stories and information 
</p>
<p>notes.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Engagement with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>49. Participants considered how best to relate and share information within the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system, including in the field, to ensure that all are well informed about their work 
</p>
<p>and recommendations. In addition to and in keeping with the Human Rights Up Front 
</p>
<p>initiative, launched by the Secretary-General in July 2013, discussions should continue on 
</p>
<p>other ways to more fully integrate the findings of special procedures into the work of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system and its intergovernmental bodies, such as the Security Council.  
</p>
<p>50. Participants also considered cooperation with academic institutions, which could 
</p>
<p>provide useful research, especially in the light of the resource constraints faced by the 
</p>
<p>special procedures. Other useful ways for the special procedures to secure inputs included 
</p>
<p>expert meetings, national and regional consultations and meetings with regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges confronting the system </b></p>
<p>51. Despite an expanding system and the major contributions of the special procedures 
</p>
<p>to the protection and promotion of human rights, the system continued to face critical 
</p>
<p>challenges, including underfunding, which was having an impact on their activities. 
</p>
<p>Reprisals against those cooperating with the United Nations, its representatives and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in the field of human rights were a cause of great concern, as was the non-
</p>
<p>cooperation of certain States with mandate holders.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Financing the special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>52. OHCHR recalled that the special procedures received approximately 0.5 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations regular budget. These resources were distributed evenly across 
</p>
<p>mandates, but were still insufficient to support adequately all mandates and the needs of 
</p>
<p>mandate holders. In the past, a number of mandates had been established by the Council 
</p>
<p>without adequate regular budget resources and, in some cases, without any provision at all 
</p>
<p>for staff support. Today, the standard minimum of 1.5 Professional and 0.5 General Service 
</p>
<p>staff support for each individual mandate and three Professionals and one General Service 
</p>
<p>staff for each working group to ensure effective support to the mandates concerned had not 
</p>
<p>been met. Regular budget allocations provided for consultancies under existing mandates 
</p>
<p>had also decreased. Moreover, in the absence of a resolution on the special procedures </p>


<p>mechanism, there was no regular budget allocated to support the system as a whole, 
</p>
<p>including the activities of the Coordination Committee, the organization of the annual 
</p>
<p>induction session for newly appointed mandate holders, the annual meeting of mandate 
</p>
<p>holders and all information and other tools and services provided by the Special Procedures 
</p>
<p>Branch to the system.  
</p>
<p>53. The limited and/or lack of regular budget allocations was compensated by voluntary 
</p>
<p>contributions received by OHCHR from Member States. A number of mandates also 
</p>
<p>occasionally received earmarked contributions from Member States. Overall voluntary 
</p>
<p>contributions were, however, insufficient to meet all needs of the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>54. Mandate holders reiterated their concerns with regard to the inadequate resouces put 
</p>
<p>at their disposal under each mandate to fulfil their tasks adequately. They also discussed 
</p>
<p>fundraising issues and the possibility of approaching private institutions and foundations in 
</p>
<p>that regard. It was suggested that OHCHR be regularly informed of fundraising activities 
</p>
<p>by the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>55. Participants reiterated the need for Member States, the General Assembly and 
</p>
<p>United Nations budgetary bodies to allocate the corresponding budget when a mandate is 
</p>
<p>established. The establishment of a new mandate must be accompanied by the timely 
</p>
<p>provision of necessary resources through the regular budget, which must also provide 
</p>
<p>existing mandates with a reasonable minimum level of resources to allow the activities of 
</p>
<p>mandates to be conducted. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reprisals 
</b></p>
<p>56. Mandate holders discussed the issue of intimidation and reprisals against persons 
</p>
<p>cooperating with the United Nations and its representatives and mechanisms in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights. Several reported on cases of intimidation and reprisals against witnesses and 
</p>
<p>other interlocutors willing to engage with them before, during and after country visits. One 
</p>
<p>mandate holder gave a specific example from his own experience following a recent 
</p>
<p>country visit. Civil society representatives had been harassed and intimidated, some put 
</p>
<p>under de facto house arrest to prevent them from meeting with him; meeting places were 
</p>
<p>barricaded, and activities were monitored. The mandate holder had had to suspend the fact-
</p>
<p>finding part of his mission. He provided insights into the reactions of the Government and 
</p>
<p>United Nations field presences and proposed a discussion on reacting to a crisis situation 
</p>
<p>and providing persons in need with protection, including when reprisals are committed after 
</p>
<p>the visit. There was thus a need to develop a systematic approach to the issue and to protect 
</p>
<p>sources, who were now even more vulnerable because of the new electronic ways by which 
</p>
<p>they could be exposed.  
</p>
<p>57. Mandate holders agreed on the need to find ways to respond to acts of intimidation, 
</p>
<p>harrassment and reprisal faced by individuals trying to contact them, including by 
</p>
<p>identifying more effective and rapid mechanisms in situations where protection gaps exist 
</p>
<p>and when dealing with States that deny or trivialize protection concerns. They expressed 
</p>
<p>the need for a high-level mechanism to respond to States that engage in reprisals. 
</p>
<p>58. Mandate holders also referred to defamatory, ad hominem attacks by States and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations on mandate holders, and stressed that the Council should be 
</p>
<p>more active in responding to such attacks. 
</p>
<p>59. Mandate holders reiterated their concerns during their exchange with the President 
</p>
<p>of the Council, who noted that reprisals were a hindrance to the protection and promotion 
</p>
<p>of human rights. He acknowledged the difficulties in addressing this issue and agreed on 
</p>
<p>the need to continue to denounce cases of reprisal, to raise awareness and to protect actively 
</p>
<p>those at risk. The mandate holders also raised the issues with the Deputy Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>with a focus on the response given by the Secretary-General to the increasing number of </p>


<p>reprisals perpetrated against interlocutors of special procedures. The Coordination 
</p>
<p>Committee also informed participants on how it had systematically raised the issue with the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General, the High Commissioner, the President of the Council, States and civil 
</p>
<p>society.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Thematic issues  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. </b>Women&#8217;s human rights and Human Rights Council resolution 26/11 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. Discussions focused on Council resolution 26/11 on protection of the family and the 
</p>
<p>subsequent panel discussion, and were led by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p>61. Mandate holders appreciated the emphasis on the structural problems of care 
</p>
<p>responsibilities and the need to redistribute them between women and men, the family and 
</p>
<p>the State. They also appreciated the fact that, in the panel discussion, there was general 
</p>
<p>acceptance that families were diverse and as such, there should be no discrimination, and 
</p>
<p>that violence in the family should be eliminated. 
</p>
<p>62. Resolution 26/11 made, however, no reference to women&#8217;s right to equality within 
</p>
<p>the family, and participants in the panel discussion had erroneously equated the protection 
</p>
<p>of the family with the protection of the rights of individual members of the family, which 
</p>
<p>does not secure the right of women to equality in the family. Women and men had a well-
</p>
<p>established right to equality in all aspects of family life, as reflected in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>63. Furthermore, it could not be said that children had, like women, the right to equality 
</p>
<p>in the family: under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, children were entitled to be 
</p>
<p>free from abuse, have their voices heard and be respected, and this was not equivalent to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s right to equality with men in all aspects of family life. What should be guaranteed 
</p>
<p>was the equality of girls with boys in the family.  
</p>
<p>64. The Chairperson of the Coordination Committee made a statement on behalf of the 
</p>
<p>mandate holders on this issue (see annex X).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Sustainable development goals 
</b></p>
<p>65. Several mandate holders pointed out that they wished to continue their own efforts 
</p>
<p>to integrate human rights into the sustainable development goals, especially with regard to 
</p>
<p>putting greater emphasis on accountability for human rights. Participants in the discussion 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that, although the outcome document of the Open Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals22 put greater emphasis on human rights than the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals, gaps and weaknesses remained and had to be addressed. 
</p>
<p>Mandate holders agreed that much would depend on the way indicators to measure 
</p>
<p>achievement of the targets under each goal were formulated. It was suggested that the 
</p>
<p>mandate holders should endeavour to inform the discussion on indicators to make them 
</p>
<p>human rights-sensitive. 
</p>
<p>66. Some mandate holders explained how the current formulation of sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals did not address all the human rights dimensions related to their 
</p>
<p>individual mandates. For example, the right to adequate housing was not reflected to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22 A/68/970. </p>


<p>same extent as were the rights to food, education, health or water and sanitation. It was also 
</p>
<p>noted that long-term efforts and strong partnerships with other stakeholders were important 
</p>
<p>in order to influence the process. It was agreed that mandate holders would continue to seek 
</p>
<p>ways to monitor the negotiations and influence the formulation of the goals and indicators 
</p>
<p>by mapping out crucial dates in the process and channels for input. The possibility of a joint 
</p>
<p>statement focused on common issues, such as accountability, equality and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, was also discussed. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Climate change 
</b></p>
<p>67. Mandate holders focused their attention to climate change in the light of several 
</p>
<p>upcoming events on the issue within the framework of the United Nations in 2015, with a 
</p>
<p>view to increasing their interaction with the United Nations entities working on that issue.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Climate Change urged mandate 
</p>
<p>holders to speak out about the impact of climate change on human rights as they saw it in 
</p>
<p>the course of their work, and to contribute to discussions.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Envoy emphasized that this was a crucial time for the international 
</p>
<p>community and its response to climate change in the lead-up to the conclusion of a new 
</p>
<p>legally binding climate agreement in December 2015. Efforts of human rights advocates 
</p>
<p>had to build upon the Cancun Agreements and the language therein identifying the 
</p>
<p>relationship between human rights and climate change, and support the new language to be 
</p>
<p>proposed at the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Lima, &#8220;that parties should, in all climate 
</p>
<p>change-related actions, fully respect, protect and fulfil human rights&#8221;. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Council, in its resolution 10/4, had influenced the Agreements by affirming that human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations and commitments had the potential to inform and strengthen international 
</p>
<p>and national policymaking in the area of climate change, promoting policy coherence, 
</p>
<p>legitimacy and sustainable outcomes. 
</p>
<p>70. The Coordinator and Principal Legal Adviser of the United Nations Framework 
</p>
<p>Convention on Climate Change updated participants on the status of negotiations on the 
</p>
<p>climate change agreement, and explained the events and opportunities that human rights 
</p>
<p>advocates, like other stakeholders, could use to express their views. Because of the Cancun 
</p>
<p>Agreements, human rights were now part of the discourse and the best way to generate 
</p>
<p>input was through States parties.  
</p>
<p>71. The Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment referred to his mapping 
</p>
<p>report,23 which reflected the work of all special procedures on climate change. He had 
</p>
<p>initiated an open letter to States parties to the Framework Convention, in which he urged 
</p>
<p>them to build upon the human rights language of the Cancun Agreements and to ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of and respect for human rights in the new legally binding 
</p>
<p>instrument. The letter was underwritten by other mandate holders. The representative of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Environment Programme added that the environment community was 
</p>
<p>increasingly interested in incorporating human rights and the work of the special 
</p>
<p>procedures, and expressed support for the open letter. Other mandate holders shared their 
</p>
<p>experience of work on climate change and their views on the process and opportunities to 
</p>
<p>influence discussions. They supported the need to work individually and collectively to 
</p>
<p>emphasize human rights in the discussions over the next 15 months. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 A/HRC/25/53. </p>


<p>72. In accordance with Council resolution 26/27, in which the Council called upon 
</p>
<p>mandate holders to consider climate change in their work, the Council would convene a 
</p>
<p>discussion thereon at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Interaction with representatives of the United Nations and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>73. The High Commissioner welcomed the opportunity, at such an early stage since his 
</p>
<p>appointment, to engage in a candid discussion with all participants. He considered the 
</p>
<p>annual meeting a platform not just for exchanging views but also for exploring ways of 
</p>
<p>achieving greater synergies among mandates and impact for those who are unable to enjoy 
</p>
<p>their human rights. While recalling that the independence of the mandates of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner and the special procedures must be respected, he welcomed opportunities to 
</p>
<p>collaborate. OHCHR was committed to providing holistic support for all human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms to ensure that the entire system was resourced and supported to operate with 
</p>
<p>maximum efficiency and effectiveness, despite the very real resource constraints faced by 
</p>
<p>all. 
</p>
<p>74. Mandate holders raised a number of points, including budget constraints, the need 
</p>
<p>for a stronger human rights perspective in United Nations country teams and for greater 
</p>
<p>support from Resident Coordinators, attacks on mandate holders and increasing reprisals 
</p>
<p>against those who cooperate with human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR was endeavouring to address funding shortfalls. Efforts would continue 
</p>
<p>during the preparation of the 2016/17 regular budget submission to advocate for greater 
</p>
<p>regular budget funding for the special procedures. On the sustainable development goals, 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner welcomed the contributions of special procedures. He also pointed 
</p>
<p>out that, in its assessment of the outcome document, OHCHR had found that progress had 
</p>
<p>been made in ensuring that the framework addressed the full range of rights and included a 
</p>
<p>focus on inequalities, all key groups and some critical international reforms. With regard to 
</p>
<p>reprisals, the High Commisioner intended to address the issue with the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>at its sixty-ninth session.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Deputy Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Deputy Secretary-General provided an overview of the Human Rights Up Front 
</p>
<p>initiative. Prevention through early warning was core to the initiative and, in this regard, 
</p>
<p>special procedures had an important role to play, since conflicts often originate from human 
</p>
<p>rights violations that special procedures monitor and report on. The initiative had been 
</p>
<p>presented within the United Nations system to Members States, and was taking root in the 
</p>
<p>field, including through a letter addressed to all Resident Coordinators.  
</p>
<p>77. The Deputy Secretary-General pointed out that information gathered by special 
</p>
<p>procedures was extremely valuable, and invited mandate holders to find a more institutional 
</p>
<p>way of sharing information with the Human Rights Up Front initiative. The Chairperson 
</p>
<p>expressed the readiness of the special procedures to contribute to the initiative, and 
</p>
<p>proposed that a consultation be organized between the Coordination Committee, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>and the Deputy Secretary-General on submitting early warning information. </p>


<p><b> 3. Special Advisers of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide and on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Responsibility to Protect 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide listed 
</p>
<p>the different opportunities to enhance cooperation: (a) sharing information and analysis; (b) 
</p>
<p>contributing to the preparation of country visits or conducting joint country visits; (c) 
</p>
<p>contributing with comments to reports of special procedures; (d) participating in meetings 
</p>
<p>on thematic issues that are relevant to all; (v) issuing joint public statements; and (e) 
</p>
<p>holding meetings to enhance cooperation and share strategies on joint action.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect briefed participants on the 
</p>
<p>evolution of the concept of responsibility to protect and its relevance, and added two 
</p>
<p>additional opportunities for cooperation with the special procedures, namely, through the 
</p>
<p>first pillar of the responsibility of States to protect their own populations, through 
</p>
<p>prevention and early action; and the second pillar of the responsibility of the international 
</p>
<p>community to assist States. In the latter case, she stressed the role that special procedures 
</p>
<p>could play in encouraging States to live up to their responsibilities and in capacity-building 
</p>
<p>efforts to make States more resilient to atrocity crimes.  
</p>
<p>80. A number of mandate holders raised questions on, inter alia, the role and 
</p>
<p>responsibility of non-State actors (such as business enterprises); the type of information that 
</p>
<p>could be shared with the Special Advisers; how to broaden the approach to the prevention 
</p>
<p>of crimes (beyond criminal justice to also include social justice); the need to address both 
</p>
<p>justice and reconciliation issues; and to look into violence against women in non-conflict 
</p>
<p>situations, which may exacerbate violence against women in conflict situations.  
</p>
<p>81. The mandate holders agreed to explore areas of cooperation with the Special 
</p>
<p>Advisers, who reiterated their willingness to work with the special procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. President of the Human Rights Council  
</b></p>
<p>82. The President of the Council pointed out that 2014 had been a busy year, with 31 out 
</p>
<p>of 53 mandates appointed. Two new thematic mandates had been created: on the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, and on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights. The Council had also responded to emergency situations by 
</p>
<p>establishing, for example, commissions of inquiry on the situation in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Eritrea. It had also accepted that a 
</p>
<p>human rights team should be deployed to Iraq. At the most recent session of the Council, 
</p>
<p>the issues of civil society space and the protection of human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>journalists, and violence against persons because of their sexual orientation had been taken 
</p>
<p>up, and demanded ongoing attention. 
</p>
<p>83. The President encouraged mandate holders to be guided by the letter and spirit of the 
</p>
<p>Code of Conduct. Cooperation between States and the special procedures should be 
</p>
<p>constructive and open, with continuing dialogue. Although some States complained about 
</p>
<p>the work of special procedures, it was important to preserve the credibility of the system 
</p>
<p>and the independence of mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>84. The President reiterated the fact that the Council attached great importance to 
</p>
<p>recommendations made in the thematic and country visit reports of special procedures, 
</p>
<p>given that they gave States more information and helped in decision-making. Gabon, for 
</p>
<p>example, had had a positive experience with the visit of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons. The visit had resulted in a policy that was beneficial to the country. 
</p>
<p>85. The President had raised the issue of personal attacks on mandate holders with 
</p>
<p>States during Council sessions, and had noted a decrease. He pointed out that attacks on 
</p>
<p>those who cooperate with the mechanisms, including during country missions, had </p>


<p>increased, and he was advocating for civil society, including as partners of Governments. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the budget, the President informed participants that he had addressed the 
</p>
<p>issue of the increasing number of mandates without commensurate resources during his 
</p>
<p>discussions with senior officials of the United Nations Secretariat.  
</p>
<p>86. During the discussion, mandate holders advocated for their greater participation in 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Council, including during the universal periodic review, special sessions and 
</p>
<p>panel discussions. The issue of reporting on country visits outside of the annual interactive 
</p>
<p>dialogue with the Council was raised.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Member States 
</b></p>
<p>87. In their meeting with representatives of Member States, mandate holders raised 
</p>
<p>issues relating to, inter alia, the limited regular budget allocations to special procedures; 
</p>
<p>State cooperation with special procedures, particularly for country visits; follow-up to and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations of special procedures; reprisals against those who 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the United Nations; the Human Rights Up Front initiative; compliance with 
</p>
<p>the Code of Conduct; and cooperation with regional mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>88. Mandate holders also expressed concern at the increase in reprisals against 
</p>
<p>individuals associated with country visits, and requested a more formal response from the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council condemning such actions.  
</p>
<p>89. The representatives of a number of Member States took the floor to inform 
</p>
<p>participants about their experience with the special procedures, including the steps taken to 
</p>
<p>follow up on their recommendations following country visits. It was recalled that Member 
</p>
<p>States ultimately decided on the opportunity of visits on the basis of their own needs. A 
</p>
<p>number of States also referred to the importance of the timing of visits, which should be 
</p>
<p>organized whenever a need is expressed at the national level. This would enable national 
</p>
<p>actors to benefit in a timely manner from the expertise provided by the mandate holder and 
</p>
<p>also facilitate follow-up activities.  
</p>
<p>90. Mandate holders referred to the importance of finalizing country reports shortly after 
</p>
<p>their visit, and requested flexibility to permit rapid visits to countries when the human 
</p>
<p>rights situation was deteriorating. The need for more follow-up visits was noted by mandate 
</p>
<p>holders, who suggested looking at ways to institutionalize the practice. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Civil society and non-governmental organizations  
</b></p>
<p>91. In their meeting with representatives of civil society, mandate holders highlighted 
</p>
<p>the need for integrated follow-up strategies at both the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>They recalled the important role that they played in developing the capacity of local 
</p>
<p>organizations to disseminate and monitor the implementation of the recommendations made 
</p>
<p>by special procedures. They also referred to the importance of protecting and strengthening 
</p>
<p>the participation of civil society organizations in United Nations forums.  
</p>
<p>92. The civil society representatives expressed gratitude for the commitment of mandate 
</p>
<p>holders to cases of reprisal and the protection of human rights defenders. They requested 
</p>
<p>mandate holders to examine discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, caste and descent; 
</p>
<p>the right to privacy; the impact of extractive industries on the rights of indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>and the sustainable development goals. They also expressed the view that the Coordination 
</p>
<p>Committee should play a role in the selection and appointment of new mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>93. Participants in the meeting acknowledged that civil society greatly contributed to the 
</p>
<p>work undertaken by all mandate holders. It was agreed that dialogue and consultations with 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations should continue on a regular basis.  </p>


<p><b> 7. Regional human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>94. The Chairperson highlighted the importance that the special procedures system had 
</p>
<p>placed on cooperation with regional mechanisms over the years, particularly because such 
</p>
<p>cooperation added value to the work of both systems.  
</p>
<p>95. Marison Blanchard, a member of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>provided an overview of the work of the inter-American system, with a particular focus on 
</p>
<p>the Commission. The priority topics of the thematic special procedures of the Commission 
</p>
<p>included racism in the judicial system; indigenous women&#8217;s rights, including 
</p>
<p>disappearances of indigenous women; corporal punishment; the impact of organized 
</p>
<p>violence on the rights of children; migrant children&#8217;s rights; the use of criminal law to 
</p>
<p>prosecute human rights defenders; the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and 
</p>
<p>intersex persons; and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>96. Ms. Blanchard gave examples of good cooperation between the Commission and the 
</p>
<p>special procedures. The support of the special procedures of the Council had proven to be 
</p>
<p>effective, particularly at times when efforts were being made to weaken the regional 
</p>
<p>system. The Commission was willing to enhance cooperation.  
</p>
<p>97. Mandate holders sought further discussion on the petition procedure, country visits 
</p>
<p>and joint statements. They also added other examples of ongoing or upcoming cooperation, 
</p>
<p>and expressed openness to forging links with the Commission. A number of themes 
</p>
<p>emerged for further exchanges between the two systems in relation to development of 
</p>
<p>standards and common positions.  
</p>
<p>98. Mandate holders also discussed the status of implementation of the Addis Ababa 
</p>
<p>road map agreed between the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on 17 and 18 January 2012. The 
</p>
<p>Chairperson of the joint working group on the implementation of the road map outlined the 
</p>
<p>main activities carried out since June 2013. He highlighted the review of the road map 
</p>
<p>conducted between the two systems on the margins of the fifty-fifth ordinary session of the 
</p>
<p>Commission and some issues of common interest, such as the right to life, child marriage, 
</p>
<p>and business and human rights. He encouraged mandate holders to pursue cooperation with 
</p>
<p>all regional human rights mechanisms in a way that was respectful of the priorities and 
</p>
<p>procedures of those mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>99. The mandate holders welcomed the Secretary of the International Coordinating 
</p>
<p>Committee of National Human Rights Institutions, who pointed out that national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions constituted a bridge between the State and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, and between international human rights and national protection systems. The 
</p>
<p>Committee was committed to strengthening cooperation with the special procedures in 
</p>
<p>respect of country visits and information-sharing on human rights situations. It intended to 
</p>
<p>develop a compilation of good practices in collaboration with the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>100. The mandate holders recalled the important role played by national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions in promoting and protecting human rights. They thanked these institutions for 
</p>
<p>their work in disseminating the findings of the special procedures and, in some instances, in 
</p>
<p>following up on their recommendations. They agreed to continue working together, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the context of country visits. </p>

<p><b>Annex X 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Statement by the Chairperson of the Coordination 
Committee  
</b></p>
<p>We, special procedures mandate holders, have taken note with interest of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 26/11, adopted on 23 June 2014, on the &#8220;protection of the 
</p>
<p>family&#8221;, and the panel discussion on 15 September 2014.  
</p>
<p>We note with appreciation the emphasis on the structural problems of care 
</p>
<p>responsibilities and the need to redistribute them not only between women and men, as was 
</p>
<p>established by CEDAW in 1980, but also between the family and the State. We are also 
</p>
<p>reassured that in the panel discussion, there was general acceptance that families are diverse 
</p>
<p>and in this context, there should be no discrimination; and that violence within the family 
</p>
<p>should be eliminated. We trust that the Human Rights Council will incorporate these 
</p>
<p>positive elements in all its future work, in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>Yet we want to express our concern regarding the fact that the resolution made no 
</p>
<p>reference to women&#8217;s right to equality within the family and the panel discussion 
</p>
<p>erroneously equated the protection of the family with the protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>individual members of the family, in particular the rights of women to equality.  
</p>
<p>We recall that the right to equality between women and men in the family is 
</p>
<p>guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>We therefore call on the Human Rights Council to ensure that in all future 
</p>
<p>resolutions, concept notes and reports on the issue of the family, the right to equality 
</p>
<p>between women and men and between girls and boys within the family be explicitly 
</p>
<p>included as a fundamental human right. 
</p>
