</p>
<p>The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 26/2. 
</p>
<p>It provides a summary of the high-level discussion on the question of the death penalty held 
</p>
<p>on 4 March 2015 at the twenty-fifth session of the Council. The objective of the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion was to continue the exchange of views on the question of the death penalty and 
</p>
<p>to discuss regional efforts aiming at the abolition of the death penalty and related 
</p>
<p>challenges. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction</b> 
</p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its resolution 26/2, the Human Rights Council held its first biennial 
</p>
<p>high-level panel discussion on the question of the death penalty on 4 March 2015, at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth session. The aim of the panel discussion was to exchange views on the 
</p>
<p>question of the death penalty, and to address regional efforts aiming at the abolition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty and the challenges faced in that regard.  
</p>
<p>2. The panel was chaired by the President of the Human Rights Council, Joachim 
</p>
<p>R&#252;cker; opened by the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Ivan &#352;imonovi&#263;; and 
</p>
<p>moderated by the former President of the Swiss Confederation, Ruth Dreifuss. The 
</p>
<p>panellists were the Chairperson of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
</p>
<p>Sylvie Zainabo Kayitesi; the European Union Special Representative for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>Stavros Lambrinidis; the President of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>Tracy Robinson; the Commissioner from the International Commission against the Death 
</p>
<p>Penalty, Mohammed Bedjaoui; and Commissioner at the International Commission of 
</p>
<p>Jurists Sara Hossain.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening remarks and statements 
</b></p>
<p>3. In his introductory remarks, Mr. R&#252;cker welcomed the fact that around 160 
</p>
<p>countries around the world had either abolished the death penalty, introduced a moratorium 
</p>
<p>or did not practise it as a major achievement, and underlined the progress that represented 
</p>
<p>from a starting point of only 14 countries in 1948. He also pointed out that under 
</p>
<p>international law, the death penalty could only be imposed for the most serious crimes, and 
</p>
<p>only after a fair trial, among other safeguards.  
</p>
<p>4. In his opening remarks, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights described 
</p>
<p>various regional efforts towards the abolition of the death penalty and expressed confidence 
</p>
<p>that those initiatives contributed to the broader global trend. The Americas were the first 
</p>
<p>region to witness the abolition of the death penalty, with Venezuela in 1867, many others 
</p>
<p>having followed suit since. That led to the adoption of the Protocol to the American 
</p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights to abolish the death penalty in 1990. In Africa, a protocol to 
</p>
<p>the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the abolition of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>was being considered following the adoption in 2014 of the Declaration of the Continental 
</p>
<p>Conference on the Abolition of the Death Penalty in Africa (Cotonou Declaration). In 
</p>
<p>Europe, since the 1990s the Council of Europe had made abolition of the death penalty a 
</p>
<p>requirement for membership, and in the previous 16 years, no death sentence had been 
</p>
<p>carried out in any of the 47 member States. In Asia and the Middle East, national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions, parliaments, civil society organizations and other stakeholders were 
</p>
<p>actively working towards the abolition of the death penalty. In that regard, the Assistant 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General pointed out that in November 2014, the representative of Indonesia to the 
</p>
<p>Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Intergovernmental Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the European Union, had organized a regional meeting on 
</p>
<p>moratoriums on the use of the death penalty in the region. He also mentioned that the 
</p>
<p>Consultative Commission for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights of Algeria, 
</p>
<p>together with OHCHR, had organized a regional meeting in December 2014 in Algiers on 
</p>
<p>moving away from the death penalty in the Middle East and the North African region.  
</p>
<p>5.  The Assistant Secretary-General welcomed the fact that in the six months preceding 
</p>
<p>the panel discussion, the death penalty had been abolished in Chad, Fiji and Madagascar, 
</p>
<p>and that the most recent General Assembly resolution on a moratorium on the use of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty (resolution 69/186) had been supported by a record number of 117 countries. </p>


<p>He cautioned, however, that challenges remained: despite the overall trend towards 
</p>
<p>abolition, some States had decided to maintain or reintroduce the death penalty, and others 
</p>
<p>continued to impose death sentences for drug-related crimes. In that context, the Assistant 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General questioned the death penalty&#8217;s value as a deterrent, pointing out that 
</p>
<p>there was no evidence that the death penalty discouraged anyone from committing crimes. 
</p>
<p>He encouraged Member States to focus their crime prevention efforts on strengthening their 
</p>
<p>justice systems, since all too often it was the poor and marginalized foot soldiers of the drug 
</p>
<p>trade who were executed, rather than the drug kingpins. He also urged Member States not 
</p>
<p>to accept opinion polls in favour of retention, because public opinion might be based on 
</p>
<p>misconceptions about the deterrent effect and fairness of the application of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. It had been empirically proved that, the more a population was aware of facts, the 
</p>
<p>less it supported the death penalty. He called on retentionist States to provide public, 
</p>
<p>accurate and timely figures on their application of the death penalty and on crime statistics. 
</p>
<p>The Assistant Secretary-General concluded by labelling the death penalty an inhuman and 
</p>
<p>outdated punishment, and called on Member States to work together to render their justice 
</p>
<p>systems more effective without resorting to executing immigrants, minorities, the poor and 
</p>
<p>those with disabilities in order to demonstrate a commitment to fighting crime. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Contribution of the panellists  
</b></p>
<p>6. In her introductory remarks, as moderator of the Panel, Ms. Dreifuss stated that 
</p>
<p>humanity had made considerable advances towards the universal abolition of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, given the ever-increasing number of abolitionist States. She mentioned that the 
</p>
<p>reality of the death penalty had become very clear: it was accompanied by high levels of 
</p>
<p>social discrimination; it did not deter crime; and there was no link between maintaining the 
</p>
<p>death penalty and reducing violence in a society. She remarked that exchanging experience 
</p>
<p>and raising awareness about the death penalty had helped to create a situation where entire 
</p>
<p>regions and continents of the world were &#8220;death penalty free&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>7.  In response to questions from the moderator, Ms. Kayitesi&#8217;s remarks focused on 
</p>
<p>issues linked to the progress made towards the abolition of the death penalty in Africa since 
</p>
<p>1999, when the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights adopted a resolution 
</p>
<p>urging States parties to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights to implement a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on the death penalty and encouraging its abolition. 
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Zainabo Kayitesi pointed out that a working group on the death penalty in 
</p>
<p>Africa had been created by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in 
</p>
<p>2005, the mandate of which was to give effect to article 4 of the African Charter on Human 
</p>
<p>and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which enshrined the right to life. The Commission had also carried out 
</p>
<p>a study on the death penalty in Africa, which recommended the drafting of an additional 
</p>
<p>protocol to the Charter abolishing the death penalty.1 The Commission had reviewed the 
</p>
<p>draft protocol to the Charter in February 2015, and it was anticipated that the draft would be 
</p>
<p>adopted during a regular meeting of the Commission by the end of 2015. She underlined 
</p>
<p>that the draft protocol filled a legal gap in the Charter, and would provide a useful regional 
</p>
<p>tool on the road to universal abolition of the death penalty. In addition, a series of regional 
</p>
<p>conferences had brought together States, national human rights institutions, civil society, 
</p>
<p>academics, and representatives of the African Union. At the Continental Conference on the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 &#8220;Study on the question of the death penalty in Africa&#8221;, submitted by the Working Group on the Death 
</p>
<p>Penalty in Africa in accordance with resolution ACHPR/Res.79 (XXXVIII) 05; adopted by the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights at its 50th ordinary session (24 October&#8211;
</p>
<p>7 November 2011), Banjul, The Gambia. </p>


<p>Abolition of the Death Penalty in Africa that had taken place in late 2014 in Benin, a 
</p>
<p>declaration on the abolition of the death penalty in Africa had been adopted, known as the 
</p>
<p>Cotonou Declaration.2 Ms. Zainabo Kayitesi also emphasized that the Commission had 
</p>
<p>adopted two resolutions urging States to implement moratoriums and abolish the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, in 19993 and in 20084 respectively  
</p>
<p>9.  Ms. Zainabo Kayitesi welcomed the significant progress made towards universal 
</p>
<p>abolition in Africa, indicating that in 1999, 10 countries had abolished the death penalty 
</p>
<p>and 11 had de-facto moratoriums, whereas currently 19 African countries had abolished the 
</p>
<p>death penalty, and 23 had de-facto moratoriums. She also indicated that 10 African 
</p>
<p>countries had ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the most recent one being 
</p>
<p>Gabon. 
</p>
<p>10. In response to questions from the moderator, Mr. Lambrinidis&#8217;s remarks focused on 
</p>
<p>issues linked to the legal and philosophical bases of the European Union&#8217;s policy on the 
</p>
<p>universal abolition of the death penalty.<b> </b>  
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Lambrinidis underlined Europe&#8217;s strong commitment to the abolition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty, which was without asterisks, and without any reservation. He highlighted the 
</p>
<p>fact that abolition was required before a State could join the European Union, as abolition 
</p>
<p>defined European values. He also rejected attempts to view the abolition debate from a 
</p>
<p>cultural perspective, drawing attention to the diversity of cultures among members of the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe, as well as the fact that many countries with different cultural 
</p>
<p>backgrounds in all regions of the world had abolished the death penalty. Mr. Lambrinidis 
</p>
<p>expressed the view that those countries that had gone through terrible atrocities tended to 
</p>
<p>realize the cruelty of imposing the death penalty themselves. In that regard, he referred to 
</p>
<p>the Holocaust in Europe, and to the commitment of European nations that that should never 
</p>
<p>happen again which had contributed to Europe&#8217;s firm abolitionist position. He further 
</p>
<p>indicated that, as the people of Europe emerged from dictatorships, they realized that judges 
</p>
<p>could make mistakes and that fundamental principles of due process were violated on 
</p>
<p>occasion. Irreversible life and death decisions should, therefore, not be left in the hands of 
</p>
<p>any State institution, including the judiciary, as long as the death penalty was allowed. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Lambrinidis also pointed out that in those States that were not open and democratic, 
</p>
<p>and/or where judges and other officers in the system of administration of justice were not 
</p>
<p>sufficiently trained, the risk was even greater. He concluded by emphasizing that the death 
</p>
<p>penalty violated the dignity of all individuals. Everybody and every State should defend 
</p>
<p>their dignity through the abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>12. In response to questions from the moderator, Ms. Robinson&#8217;s remarks focused on 
</p>
<p>issues linked to the regional efforts in the Americas to abolish the death penalty, and the 
</p>
<p>challenges that States had faced prior to ratifying the Protocol to the American Convention 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights to abolish the death penalty, adopted in 1990. 
</p>
<p>13. Ms. Robinson noted that nearly half of the member States of the Organization of 
</p>
<p>American States (OAS) had ratified the Protocol to the American Convention on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to abolish the death penalty. In 2011, the Inter-American Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights had published a report on the death penalty entitled &#8220;From restrictions to abolition&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Also, at the request of a third of the OAS member States, both in 2013 and 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Commission had held hearings to exchange views on the need for OAS-wide abolition of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty.

</p>
<p> 4 Resolution ACHPR/Res.136 (XXXXIIII) 08. </p>


<p>14. Ms. Robinson informed the Human Rights Council that Suriname had recently 
</p>
<p>announced that it was on the way towards abolition of the death penalty. She pointed out 
</p>
<p>that the United States of America was the only country in the region that continued to 
</p>
<p>implement executions. Even the United States had, however, recently seen a shift in public 
</p>
<p>opinion regarding the death penalty and a reduction in the number of executions. About a 
</p>
<p>third of its States had abolished the death penalty. Ms. Robinson also stated that one of the 
</p>
<p>key factors for the retention of the death penalty in several States in the Americas was the 
</p>
<p>colonial heritage. There had, however, been significant progress. Thirteen of the 
</p>
<p>14 anglophone countries in the Americas had retained the death penalty. But in those 
</p>
<p>countries there had been significant progress. Ms. Robinson emphasized that the 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights had contributed to reducing the 
</p>
<p>number of persons sentenced to death in the region. No sentence had been carried out in the 
</p>
<p>anglophone Caribbean since 2008, and there were further many countries in the Caribbean 
</p>
<p>region that did not have any death-row prisoners. Referring to a statement by the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General of one Caribbean State, she reported that human rights were firmly rooted and 
</p>
<p>nurtured in the region. She recommended that, as a first step, executions in the United 
</p>
<p>States should end and those countries with de-facto moratoriums should move to de-jure 
</p>
<p>ones. She also urged Caribbean countries to refrain from using constitutional reform 
</p>
<p>processes to halt progress towards the abolition of the penalty.  
</p>
<p>15. In response to questions from the moderator, Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui&#8217;s remarks 
</p>
<p>focused on issues linked to progress made towards abolition in the Middle East and North 
</p>
<p>Africa, since the adoption of the Arab Charter on Human Rights on 22 May 2004.  
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Bedjaoui stated that, while the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which came into 
</p>
<p>force in 2008, did not abolish the death penalty, it restricted its use and introduced some 
</p>
<p>safeguards, including an obligation to ensure that it was handed down by a competent court. 
</p>
<p>It only allowed capital punishment for the most serious crimes. Pointing out that 
</p>
<p>international law did not unequivocally abolish the death penalty, he stated that over the 
</p>
<p>previous 20 years an increasing number of States had, however, favoured the abolition of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty, including States from the North African region, notably Algeria. He also 
</p>
<p>emphasized that leaders had to play a role in relation to the abolition of capital punishment. 
</p>
<p>He said that civil society in the Arab world had become very dynamic, and was capable of 
</p>
<p>influencing its leaders. He argued that the death penalty unfortunately frequently went 
</p>
<p>hand-in-hand with authoritarian regimes. Democratization in the Arab world would create 
</p>
<p>opportunities for realization of human rights for all in the region, irrespective of the 
</p>
<p>diversities and identities, including through the abolition of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>17.  In response to questions from the moderator, Ms. Hossain&#8217;s remarks focused on 
</p>
<p>issues linked to the regional trends towards the abolition of the death penalty in Asia, 
</p>
<p>human rights concerns regarding continued use of the death penalty in several States in the 
</p>
<p>region, and the obstacles that hindered the abolition of the death penalty in the Asian 
</p>
<p>region.  
</p>
<p>18. Ms. Hossain stressed that Asia was the only region in the world where there was no 
</p>
<p>regional human rights instrument and no regional mechanism to drive change. She pointed 
</p>
<p>out, however, that the vast majority of executions were only carried out in a few States and 
</p>
<p>there was a discernable trend towards abolition: several Asian countries had abolished the 
</p>
<p>death penalty for all crimes in recent years; and several had ratified the Second Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition 
</p>
<p>of the death penalty. Other countries had officially announced their intention to move 
</p>
<p>towards reducing the scope of capital punishment, including by commuting death sentences 
</p>
<p>to life imprisonment. In other countries, the possibility of abolishing the death penalty was 
</p>
<p>being discussed, and laws that permitted the death penalty were being reviewed. Many 
</p>
<p>countries had not carried out executions for several years. Several courts in the region had </p>


<p>either introduced safeguards relating to the situation of individuals on death row, or held the 
</p>
<p>mandatory death penalty to be unconstitutional. Criminal procedure laws had been 
</p>
<p>amended to require interrogations of individuals to be recorded or videotaped, thereby 
</p>
<p>providing safeguards against miscarriages of justice. In some countries, reviews of all death 
</p>
<p>sentences by supreme courts had been mandated. Ms. Hossain also highlighted the fact that 
</p>
<p>there were examples of reform initiatives across the region, from which other countries 
</p>
<p>could learn.  
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Hossain further emphasized that, while under international law, the death 
</p>
<p>penalty might only be imposed for the most serious crimes, in Asia it was still used in 
</p>
<p>relation to acts linked to sexual relations that were consensual, across sexes and between 
</p>
<p>the same sexes. She stated that, in some countries, conversion from, or renunciation of, 
</p>
<p>religion was considered a capital crime. The fact that laws in some countries continued to 
</p>
<p>allow for the mandatory use of the death penalty was of concern.  
</p>
<p>20.  Other challenges also highlighted by Ms. Hossain included: lack of respect for fair-
</p>
<p>trial standards; limited access to lawyers; lack of effective representation; lack of qualified 
</p>
<p>interpreters; absence of records of proceedings; unfair and inconsistent sentencing 
</p>
<p>practices; the fact that mitigating circumstances were often not taken into account; lack of 
</p>
<p>limited independence of the judiciary and the imposition of the death penalty through 
</p>
<p>special courts. People living in poverty continued to be disproportionally subjected to the 
</p>
<p>death penalty. Many countries across the region did not have meaningful legal aid 
</p>
<p>frameworks, which was particularly problematic in death penalty cases. Ms. Hossain also 
</p>
<p>expressed concerns regarding wrongful convictions, secrecy surrounding executions and 
</p>
<p>the method of execution. However, she reiterated that positions and discussions were 
</p>
<p>evolving within an increasing number of countries based on domestic and international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards, including provisions included in constitutions. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of the discussion

<p><b>  A. Importance of regional and intergovernmental bodies for advancing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>abolition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>22. Several delegates emphasized the potential of regional instruments to act as catalysts 
</p>
<p>for change on the ground. They could play a role in prohibiting the trade of drugs used for 
</p>
<p>executions, as well as the supply of technical assistance relating to such drugs. Some 
</p>
<p>delegates also emphasized that subregional mechanisms and intergovernmental bodies 
</p>
<p>could be instrumental in advancing the abolition of the death penalty. The Community of 
</p>
<p>Portuguese-speaking countries indicated that the abolition of the death penalty reinforced 
</p>
<p>security and the continuous development and consolidation of human rights. In 2003, the 
</p>
<p>Council of Ministers of the Community adopted a resolution on human rights and the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty, which contained the commitment of its members to work 
</p>
<p>towards the universal abolition of the death penalty and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment. That commitment had been renewed in 2013 through the adoption 
</p>
<p>of a resolution on the promotion and protection of human rights in the Community. The 
</p>
<p>commitment of the International Organization of la Francophonie to the abolition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty was expressed in its awareness-raising activities for different francophone 
</p>
<p>networks of lawyers, judges, constitutional courts and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. General remarks on the use of the death penalty  
</b></p>
<p>23.  Many delegations stated their opposition to the death penalty and held that the death 
</p>
<p>penalty constituted a violation of human rights, in particular the right to life. One delegation 
</p>
<p>quoted Martin Luther King, Jr., who said that: &#8220;Darkness cannot drive out darkness.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>Several States said that the right to life was enshrined in their national constitutions, 
</p>
<p>prohibited the imposition and implementation of executions, and that the protection of that 
</p>
<p>right was any State&#8217;s duty. Other delegations pointed out that it was critical for States to 
</p>
<p>interpret the right to life broadly.  
</p>
<p>24. Several States explained that they opposed the death penalty because it violated the 
</p>
<p>dignity of the condemned, as well as the dignity of humanity as a whole. They asserted that 
</p>
<p>the final and cruel nature of capital punishment was per se incompatible with the right to 
</p>
<p>life. They emphasized that the abolition of the death penalty contributed to the progressive 
</p>
<p>development and consolidation of human rights. Some delegates observed that rational 
</p>
<p>arguments in favour of abolition included the lack of evidence that the death penalty 
</p>
<p>deterred crimes; in practice it discriminated between those who could afford, and those who 
</p>
<p>could not afford, a good defence in a judicial system; and it carried the risk of killing 
</p>
<p>innocent people, which could not be tolerated in a civilized society. Several delegates also 
</p>
<p>labelled the death penalty one of the worst forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
</p>
<p>punishment.  
</p>
<p>25. Some States stressed that there was no international consensus on the abolition of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty. They observed that every State had the inalienable sovereign right to 
</p>
<p>decide about its legal and criminal justice system, without interference by other States. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the question of whether to retain or abolish the death penalty and the types of 
</p>
<p>crimes for which the death penalty was applied should be determined by each country, 
</p>
<p>taking into account the circumstances and threats unique to their societies. Those arguments 
</p>
<p>were, however, rejected by other States, with some labelling the death penalty a failure of 
</p>
<p>justice. Several experts and delegates stated that the process towards the abolition of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 Martin Luther King Jr., <i>A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther 
</i></p>
<p><i>King, Jr</i>. (1986). </p>


<p>death penalty went hand-in-hand with respect of the sovereignty of States. In that regard, 
</p>
<p>they called on States that continued to use the death penalty to acknowledge their own 
</p>
<p>constitutional provisions on human rights, including the rights to life and human dignity, 
</p>
<p>and asserted that such constitutional commitments must inform discussions on the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. They also pointed out that, while the death penalty might be a sentence permissible 
</p>
<p>under some domestic laws, the practice must be scrutinized in the light of national human 
</p>
<p>rights commitments as well as obligations under international and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties.  
</p>
<p>26. Some participants stated that the death penalty was a matter of criminal justice, 
</p>
<p>rather than human rights; and that it underpinned their criminal justice systems in order to 
</p>
<p>guarantee peace, security, and human rights for their citizens. Rejecting that argument, 
</p>
<p>several delegates and experts highlighted the fact that human rights were increasingly 
</p>
<p>perceived as universal, and therefore belonged to all humanity. The criminal justice system 
</p>
<p>of a country should be based on human rights, and it should respect the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law. They found the arguments opposing 
</p>
<p>criminal justice and human rights unconvincing, as ultimately the two complemented each 
</p>
<p>other.  
</p>
<p>27. Several delegates acknowledged the significant progress achieved so far through the 
</p>
<p>adoption of five resolutions on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty (General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolutions 62/149 of 2007, 63/168 of 2008, 65/206 of 2010, 67/176 of 2012, 
</p>
<p>69/186 of 2014)
 
the latest of which was adopted in December 2014 by a record number of 
</p>
<p>117 votes in favour, with 95 co-sponsors. It called upon all States, inter alia, to establish a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. Experts cautioned, 
</p>
<p>however, against the risks attached to moratoriums. At times, the fact that a moratorium 
</p>
<p>was in place encouraged judges to issue death sentences more easily, under the assumption 
</p>
<p>that the condemned would not be executed anyway. It was, therefore, desirable to abolish 
</p>
<p>the death penalty in all circumstances.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Rights of victims of crimes and the myth of deterrence 
</b></p>
<p>28. Some delegates mentioned the rights of victims of crimes<b> </b>to justify the retention of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty. They found it unacceptable to call for the protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>offenders involved in heinous crimes, while ignoring the rights of victims of such crimes. 
</p>
<p>In response, several delegates and experts called for States to ensure the voices of those 
</p>
<p>victims in whose name the death penalty was being carried out were heard and made part of 
</p>
<p>the process of moving towards abolition. In that regard, several initiatives that involved 
</p>
<p>victims of crimes and their families in the abolition process were highlighted. Several 
</p>
<p>delegates also emphasized that research from across regions showed that not all victims&#8217; 
</p>
<p>families felt that killing the perpetrators brought closure to them. They did not often want 
</p>
<p>the death penalty, but rather expected to see justice done effectively and efficiently. 
</p>
<p>Statistics from one country from the Americas showed that, despite the mandatory death 
</p>
<p>penalty for murder and some other crimes, only 5 per cent of convictions for murder were 
</p>
<p>recorded in that country. Finally, the move towards abolition might create space for 
</p>
<p>dialogue and improve respect for victims&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>29. Some delegates stated that the death penalty remained an important deterrent against 
</p>
<p>most serious crimes. They stressed that the rights of offenders must always be weighed 
</p>
<p>against the rights of the victims, their families and broader rights of their community to live 
</p>
<p>in peace; and the State had a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent citizens while 
</p>
<p>ensuring that justice was rendered to the victims and their families. Challenging that 
</p>
<p>argument, several delegates and experts referred to an extensive body of research that 
</p>
<p>disproved any suggestion that the death penalty had a deterrent effect on crime. They </p>


<p>pointed to the urgent need to tackle impunity to deter crimes. Impunity was one of the 
</p>
<p>gravest concerns in many regions of the world. Victims wanted to see that justice was done, 
</p>
<p>and attention should focus on judicial effectiveness. In other words, the duty of States was 
</p>
<p>to exercise due diligence: to investigate properly and to ensure that perpetrators could be 
</p>
<p>identified, arrested and prosecuted. They also recommended that authorities should address 
</p>
<p>the root causes of crimes effectively. The irreversibility of an execution in itself was an 
</p>
<p>argument for abolishing the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Public opinion and the role of political leaders 
</b></p>
<p>30. Some delegates reported that the death penalty continued to be used in their 
</p>
<p>countries because of public opinion, which remained in favour of the death penalty for 
</p>
<p>serious crimes. In that regard, experts and several delegates emphasized that public opinion 
</p>
<p>was neither definitive nor static. It was likely to change when people were better informed 
</p>
<p>of the issues. Looking at public opinion on one day did not necessarily reflect the following 
</p>
<p>day&#8217;s majority views. In that regard, a study in a country in the Americas found that 89 per 
</p>
<p>cent of people supported the death penalty, but when they were informed that innocent 
</p>
<p>people were sometimes executed, that support fell sharply to 35 per cent.  
</p>
<p>31. The role of political leaders was also highlighted. They needed to be better 
</p>
<p>informed, and must take the lead in changing public opinion. In that regard, experts 
</p>
<p>provided some examples of how national leaders had influenced public discourse. Although 
</p>
<p>public opinion in Greece was very much in favour of the death penalty when the former 
</p>
<p>Greek dictators were sentenced to death in 1974, the Prime Minister decided to impose life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment instead. That decision turned public opinion against the death penalty and 
</p>
<p>eventually led to the abolition of the death penalty in Greece. In France, although public 
</p>
<p>opinion was overwhelmingly in favour of the death penalty in 1981, its abolition decided by 
</p>
<p>the then President of France led to a change of public opinion. Speakers emphasized that 
</p>
<p>abolishing the death penalty needed leadership, vision and courage.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Implementation of human rights standards and safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>32. Several delegations emphasized that States that continued to apply the death penalty 
</p>
<p>must ensure for the individuals concerned the full protection set out in international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Economic and Social Council safeguards 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty.7 In that regard, some 
</p>
<p>delegates of retentionist States explained that rights and safeguards were respected in their 
</p>
<p>countries when imposing the death penalty, including through fair trials; and it was only 
</p>
<p>used for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, as determined by each State taking into account their 
</p>
<p>unique circumstances. Several delegations expressed concern, however, with regard to the 
</p>
<p>imposition of the death penalty in violation of fair-trial standards and safeguards in a 
</p>
<p>number of States across various regions. They deplored the fact that international 
</p>
<p>safeguards, while universally recognized, were not necessarily implemented. In particular, 
</p>
<p>they were concerned about: the use of the death penalty for crimes that did not meet the 
</p>
<p>threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; under international human rights law; mandatory death 
</p>
<p>penalty provisions in some countries; arbitrary application of the death penalty in secrecy; 
</p>
<p>the inhuman and degrading conditions of detention for death-row prisoners; the use of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 The safeguards were approved on 25 May 1984 by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 
</p>
<p>1984/50. </p>


<p>unregulated substances in the formulas of lethal injections; public executions; the increase 
</p>
<p>in the number of executions in certain countries; the expansion of the range of categories of 
</p>
<p>crime punishable by the death penalty in some countries; the use of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>against children, persons with disabilities and other groups at particular risk; the resumption 
</p>
<p>of executions after decades of de-facto moratoriums in some States; and the failure to 
</p>
<p>prevent miscarriages of justice. Some delegations also highlighted the need to discuss social 
</p>
<p>and economic implications of capital punishment.  
</p>
<p>33. Some delegates were concerned that persons accused of capital crimes did not often 
</p>
<p>benefit from the assistance of qualified interpreters. In addition, many had no access to a 
</p>
<p>lawyer and effective representation and no meaningful legal aid frameworks were in place. 
</p>
<p>In many countries, the judiciary was not independent, followed unfair and inconsistent 
</p>
<p>sentencing practices and failed to consider mitigating factors. The fact that special courts 
</p>
<p>were sometimes allowed to impose the death penalty, the lack of records of proceedings, 
</p>
<p>and the lack of proper notice regarding the time and date of executions were also 
</p>
<p>worrisome.  
</p>
<p>34. Several delegates were concerned that some retentionist States had expanded the 
</p>
<p>categories of crimes for which the death penalty might, or in some cases must apply, and 
</p>
<p>that some of those crimes did not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. They also pointed out that in some States, the majority of 
</p>
<p>death sentences handed down and executions carried out were for drug-related offences in 
</p>
<p>violation of international human rights law as such crimes did not meet the threshold of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. In that context, it was remarked that the forthcoming special session 
</p>
<p>of the General Assembly on the world drug problem, to be held in 2016, would offer 
</p>
<p>opportunities to discuss international cooperation on alternative approaches to combating 
</p>
<p>the illegal trafficking of narcotic drugs.  
</p>
<p>35. Furthermore, several delegates observed that capital punishment did not serve any 
</p>
<p>deterrent purpose in combating terrorism, and deplored that some States expanded the use 
</p>
<p>of the death penalty for crimes relating to terrorism. Expressing deep concern about 
</p>
<p>atrocities committed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or by other terrorist groups 
</p>
<p>in different parts of the world, they emphasized that all efforts must be made to counter 
</p>
<p>terrorism and hold perpetrators accountable, but any measures to counter those threats 
</p>
<p>needed to be consistent with the common values of justice and human rights. Legislation 
</p>
<p>that included a vague definition of terrorism contravened human rights. They also said the 
</p>
<p>death penalty clearly did not deter persons from committing terrorist acts as being executed 
</p>
<p>transformed them into martyrs.  
</p>
<p>36. Several delegates were concerned about the lack of respect for the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>facing the death penalty outside their country. In that regard, the panel was informed that 
</p>
<p>Argentina had submitted a habeas petition in the State of Texas in the United States 
</p>
<p>regarding flagrant violations of the rights of an Argentinian on death row since 1996. 
</p>
<p>37. Several delegations pointed out that a small number of countries continued to apply 
</p>
<p>the death penalty at an alarming rate. For instance, it was remarked that at least 753 
</p>
<p>individuals were reportedly executed in 2014<b> </b>in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/70, para. 13). Delegates also expressed concerns that countries from various 
</p>
<p>regions, such as Afghanistan, the Gambia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Pakistan and 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea, had recently ended long-standing moratoriums or resumed executions. 
</p>
<p>Several speakers said that those developments showed the need to pursue and reinforce the 
</p>
<p>determination to end the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>38. With reference to views of scholars from the Muslim world, it was stated, that, based 
</p>
<p>on the Islamic principles of pardon, redemption, mercy and forgiveness, the death penalty 
</p>
<p>was incompatible with Islam. The death penalty failed to meet key criteria or objectives of </p>


<p>punishment under Islamic principles, in particular the possible deterrent effect of the 
</p>
<p>punishment, the fact that it might bring about peace within society, and its corrective 
</p>
<p>nature.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Impact of the death penalty on other individuals 
</b></p>
<p>39. Some delegates discussed the issue of the wider impact of the death penalty on other 
</p>
<p>individuals, and mentioned in particular, that the human rights of children of parents 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death or executed should be considered. It was also reported that that issue had 
</p>
<p>been paid increasing attention by the Human Rights Council. In particular, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 22/11, the Council had acknowledged the importance of the protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights of children of parents sentenced to death or executed. It had also organized a panel on 
</p>
<p>that issue (see A/HRC/25/33). In that regard, the African Commission on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights had stressed the negative psychological impact that the death penalty had 
</p>
<p>on children and other family members of those sentenced to death. States should render 
</p>
<p>more accessible and transparent the process of clemency pleas for the families and victims 
</p>
<p>of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>40. It was also emphasized that, according to some research, the use of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>had major negative effects on other individuals, including on lawyers who defended the 
</p>
<p>condemned person, prison officials in charge of death-row prisoners, and families of 
</p>
<p>victims of crimes. For instance, prison officials in death-row quarters suffered long-term 
</p>
<p>trauma, lawyers of executed persons suffered from depression and children of parents 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death also suffered trauma.   
</p>
<p>41. With regard to executions of mothers of young children, experts referred to 
</p>
<p>article 30 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child that prohibited 
</p>
<p>death sentences for mothers of infants and young children.8 General comment 1 to the 
</p>
<p>Charter clarified that States parties should not evade their commitment not to sentence 
</p>
<p>pregnant women to death simply by waiting until after they had given birth.9 
</p>
<p><b> G. Ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>42. Several delegations stressed the importance of the Second Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, and called for its ratification. As at March 2015, the Protocol had been ratified by 
</p>
<p>81 States. It was emphasized that increased ratification of or accession to the Protocol was 
</p>
<p>needed to advance the universal abolition of the death penalty. It was pointed out that the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation was considering acceding to the Protocol.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (OAU Doc. CAB/LEG/24.9/49 (1990), 
</p>
<p>entered into force on 29 November 1999), art. 30 (e). 
</p>
<p> 9 African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, <i>General Comment on 
</i></p>
<p><i>Article 30 of the African Charter on on the Rights and Welfare of the Child</i>), para. 56, available from 
</p>
<p>www.refworld.org/pdfid/545b49844.pdf. </p>


<p><b> H. Role of domestic courts, national human rights institutions and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>43.  Several delegates recommended analysis of cases in which domestic courts had 
</p>
<p>sought to interpret constitutional human rights provisions consistent with regional and 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards, thereby creating rich sources of jurisprudence on 
</p>
<p>capital punishment. Such an analysis could contribute to advance discussion on the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty and harmonization of death penalty regimes across borders. A 
</p>
<p>1995 judgement of the Constitutional Court of South Africa was highlighted, in which the 
</p>
<p>Court had declared the death penalty unconstitutional and had stated that: &#8220;The rights to life 
</p>
<p>and dignity are the most important of all human rights, and the source of all other personal 
</p>
<p>rights ... By committing ourselves to a society founded on the recognition of human rights 
</p>
<p>we are required to value these two rights above all others.&#8221;10 That implied that, by retaining 
</p>
<p>a punishment that did not testify to high regard for human dignity and the value of human 
</p>
<p>life, the State had contributed to the degeneration of the moral fibre of the society. The 
</p>
<p>State as a role model for society had to take the lead not only in preaching respect for the 
</p>
<p>law but in demonstrating regard for human life and dignity.  
</p>
<p>44. Several delegates emphasized that various stakeholders, including national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions, civil society, political organizations, parliamentarians, religious bodies, 
</p>
<p>academic institutions and networks, and trade unions, had a role to play in advancing the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty. It was emphasized that OHCHR should advance the cause of 
</p>
<p>abolition by disseminating factual information, increasing awareness and understanding of 
</p>
<p>the implications of the death penalty, and through technical assistance. The role of the 
</p>
<p>International Commission against the Death Penalty and the World Congress against the 
</p>
<p>Death Penalty in advancing global abolition was also highlighted.11 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>In its concluding remarks, the panel emphasized that it was the international 
</b></p>
<p>community&#8217;s responsibility to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b>States had to protect human dignity as part of the overall protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all. By abolishing the death penalty, States placed human dignity at the centre. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>was also stated that abolition required political and technical support as well. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The panel reiterated that regional mechanisms must play their role effectively. 
</b></p>
<p><b>As they were closer to the ground and had a better understanding of the regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>context, they were well placed to encourage States that maintained the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p><b>to respect human rights. The example of Europe illustrated that regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multilateral organizations were key to advancing abolition. A key lesson learned in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Europe was that abolition could become a reality only as a result of increasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness and exchange of ideas between countries and societies. Experience gathered 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East showed that it was possible to move 
</b></p>
<p><b>gradually towards abolition through dialogue and advocacy and that the death 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalty was not about any particular culture or any religion. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>The panel also encouraged further research, particularly into the 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic profile of those who were subjected to the death penalty, assessing to

<p><b>what extent poverty and the absence of legal representation and of access to justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>played a role.  
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>Impunity bred popular support for the death penalty. In that regard, what was 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed was a rational and calm discourse that took into account different 
</b></p>
<p><b>perspectives, including the views of victims of crime. Panellists also highlighted the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fact that combating impunity could be successful only where national laws were 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective and applied in practice.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The panel further observed that lack of information on the use of the death 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalty did not permit victims and other stakeholders to monitor and quantify 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices in some countries. States should provide full information with regard to 
</b></p>
<p><b>convictions and actual executions. The convicted person, the lawyers, family members 
</b></p>
<p><b>and others concerned were also entitled to be informed about the execution.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Panellists emphasized that States that had abolished the death penalty, and had 
</b></p>
<p><b>established a moratorium, should continue to exchange information with States that 
</b></p>
<p><b>continued to use it. While welcoming the fact that several abolitionist States had 
</b></p>
<p><b>offered to share their experiences, the panel called on those States that maintained the 
</b></p>
<p><b>death penalty to reflect on such lessons. In that context, the panel underlined the role 
</b></p>
<p><b>played by the Human Rights Council and other United Nations bodies, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights treaty bodies and special procedures to advance discussions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal abolition of the death penalty.
