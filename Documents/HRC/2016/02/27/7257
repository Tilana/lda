</p>
<p>delegation of Honduras was headed by Secretary of State, General Coordinator of 
</p>

</p>
<p>the Working Group adopted the report on Honduras. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Honduras: Namibia, Paraguay and the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Montenegro, India and France are summarized in section I.B below. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation noted that Honduras had submitted its first report to the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review in 2010. Since then, Honduras had been implementing the 
</p>
<p>recommendations it had received. As a demonstration of its commitment to human rights, 
</p>
<p>in 2013, Honduras had submitted a voluntary mid-term progress report.  
</p>
<p>6. With the assistance of OHCHR, Honduras had also led an extensive consultation 
</p>
<p>process for the development of a public policy and the adoption of the National Action Plan 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights 2013&#8211;2022.  
</p>
<p>7. Honduras noted that the national report for its second universal periodic review had 
</p>
<p>been drafted following broad discussions at national level, including with civil society.  
</p>
<p>8. In the past five years, Honduras had held two general elections with the participation 
</p>
<p>of new political movements from a broad ideological spectrum. Honduras now participated 
</p>
<p>fully in all international forums and had diplomatic relations with more than a hundred 
</p>
<p>countries. Commercial and financial exchanges and services had also allowed Honduras to 
</p>
<p>have positive economic growth. Progress on citizen security and social protection 
</p>
<p>programmes were very important for Honduras. 
</p>
<p>9. Honduras had implemented 106 recommendations of a total of 129 
</p>
<p>recommendations received in 2010. Another 20 were in the process of being completed and </p>


<p>only three recommendations had so far not been implemented. Those achievements were 
</p>
<p>the result of a series of efforts highlighted during the presentation and in the second 
</p>
<p>national report, and showed the commitment of Honduras to human rights.  
</p>
<p>10. Honduras recognized that the universal periodic review offered an invaluable space 
</p>
<p>for dialogue with civil society and the international community. The composition of the 
</p>
<p>delegation attending the universal periodic review reflected the work of all institutions in 
</p>
<p>the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>11. Reference was made to progress in the development of a policy and institutional 
</p>
<p>framework, as well as cooperation with human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>12. Reference was also made to the amendments introduced to, among others, domestic 
</p>
<p>legislation to define the crimes of disappearance of persons, torture, discrimination and 
</p>
<p>incitement to hatred, in accordance with international norms. 
</p>
<p>13. The National Human Rights Commissioner had been appointed through a 
</p>
<p>competitive public process. The Executive Branch had created the Secretariat for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The National Action Plan on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights had been adopted.  
</p>
<p>14. Honduras had made a concerted effort to submit reports due to the treaty bodies. In 
</p>
<p>the framework of the open invitation to special procedures, visits had been made by five 
</p>
<p>special rapporteurs and working groups and the subsequent recommendations had been 
</p>
<p>taken into account in the National Action Plan on Human Rights. Honduras had also 
</p>
<p>complied with judgements of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>15. Since the first cycle, the National Congress had ratified six core international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments and withdrawn reservations about the status of refugees.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation noted that Honduras had been the victim of the aggression of 
</p>
<p>organized crime and had taken forceful measures to combat it. Honduras was no longer the 
</p>
<p>main bridge for the traffic of drugs between South and North America or the most violent 
</p>
<p>country in the world. Honduras had managed to make significant progress in protecting the 
</p>
<p>right to life. The national police had been subjected to a process of profound reform. 
</p>
<p>Honduras had also reinforced the public security system by approving a legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional framework that had enabled a reduction in killings and violence in general, 
</p>
<p>although there was still much to do.  
</p>
<p>17. The national policy for the prevention of violence against children and young 
</p>
<p>persons of Honduras had also been adopted. 
</p>
<p>18. Between 2014 and 2015, no murder or violent death linked to social conflicts had 
</p>
<p>been committed.  
</p>
<p>19. Regarding the protection of persons at risk, Honduras had complied with measures 
</p>
<p>recommended by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and precautionary 
</p>
<p>provisional measures issued by the Inter-American Court. The National Congress had 
</p>
<p>approved the law on the protection of human rights defenders, journalists, social 
</p>
<p>communicators and justice officials, which was being regulated in a participatory and 
</p>
<p>inclusive manner. The law provided for a series of preventive measures and emergency 
</p>
<p>protection according to the type of risk faced by a person, and the creation of a protection 
</p>
<p>system within the Secretariat for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>20. Measures against trafficking in persons, contained in the recently passed law, had 
</p>
<p>also been introduced.  
</p>
<p>21. The creation and integration of the National Committee for the Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment was noteworthy. The Committee had </p>


<p>established itself as a national, independent institution with administrative, technical and 
</p>
<p>budgetary autonomy.  
</p>
<p>22. Regarding democracy and participation, the National Congress had amended the 
</p>
<p>Constitution to allow bills to be introduced by plebiscite, referendum and citizen&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>initiative. A constitutional amendment had also been made to include the guarantee of 
</p>
<p><i>habeas data</i> as a mechanism of protection of private data and the rights to honour, privacy 
</p>
<p>and personal image. 
</p>
<p>23. Impeachment and the right to freedom of association were also guaranteed as part of 
</p>
<p>the constitutional reform. 
</p>
<p>24. In relation to the rights of indigenous peoples, Honduras promoted access to land. 
</p>
<p>The Secretariat for Energy, Natural Resources and the Environment was currently working 
</p>
<p>with the Confederation of Autochthonous Peoples of Honduras in drafting a bill on prior 
</p>
<p>and informed consultation of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>25. The National Commission against Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
</p>
<p>Forms of Intolerance had also been reactivated.  
</p>
<p>26. With regard to sexual diversity, Honduras had prioritized the implementation of 
</p>
<p>actions in the National Action Plan on Human Rights in favour of that group. Actions 
</p>
<p>included legal reforms, awareness-raising and training.  
</p>
<p>27. In the areas of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>poverty, the Constitution had been amended to include the right to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>Among others, Honduras launched a plan for the prevention of pregnancy in adolescents, 
</p>
<p>strengthened public education and adopted legislation to address the impact of climate 
</p>
<p>change.  
</p>
<p>28. Honduras had created the Directorate on Children, Adolescent and Family Issues, 
</p>
<p>which had an agreement with local governments to launch the national system of protection 
</p>
<p>of children for local- and national-level actions. It was also in the process of ratifying the 
</p>
<p>Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>29.  The special criminal justice programme, favouring alternative measures, had been 
</p>
<p>created by the Directorate. The Directorate also monitored all social reintegration 
</p>
<p>programmes. Special criminal justice programmes had been introduced by Honduras as part 
</p>
<p>of the Partnership Plan for Prosperity. 
</p>
<p>30. The protection of children against abuse was a principle incorporated in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. The National Congress had approved a comprehensive reform of the Children 
</p>
<p>and Adolescents Code and the Family Code, taking into account the recommendations of 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>31. The delegation referred to the request made to the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights to open an OHCHR country office in Honduras. 
</p>
<p>Honduras believed that the office would contribute to strengthening the national system for 
</p>
<p>the protection of human rights. It would open up spaces for dialogue, and monitor and 
</p>
<p>report objectively on the human rights situation in the country. The High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>would also provide technical assistance to institutions in Honduras.  
</p>
<p>32. The President of the Supreme Court of Justice reported that the National Congress 
</p>
<p>had created the Council of the Judiciary and Judicial Staff, which eliminated the possibility 
</p>
<p>of discretionary or political appointments. To ensure the right of citizens to demand 
</p>
<p>accountability for the conduct of judicial officials, all decisions of the Council can be 
</p>
<p>reviewed before ordinary and constitutional courts.  </p>


<p>33. Honduras had created national judges who dealt with organized crime cases, to 
</p>
<p>protect judges from external influence. It was also part of an Organization of American 
</p>
<p>States judicial programme which aimed at strengthening access to justice. Through the 
</p>
<p>Centre for the Support and Protection of Women&#8217;s Rights, the judiciary had also put into 
</p>
<p>practice, with the participation of civil society, coordinated actions to assist women victims 
</p>
<p>of violence. The Public Defender had also assigned human resources to assist women, 
</p>
<p>including through awareness-raising for the empowerment of women deprived of their 
</p>
<p>liberty.  
</p>
<p>34. The President of the Supreme Court of Justice referred to the case of the judges 
</p>
<p>separated from their posts in 2009, coinciding with the institutional crisis in Honduras that 
</p>
<p>same year. He reiterated that the decision by the Supreme Court of Justice had been based 
</p>
<p>on the verification of the Commission&#8217;s various violations of the disciplinary provisions to 
</p>
<p>which such former officials were subject. At the time, the former officials had had access to 
</p>
<p>legal recourses, which had not yet been exhausted.  
</p>
<p>35. The President of the Legislative Commission on Human Rights noted that the 
</p>
<p>National Congress of Honduras had legislative functions, and oversight functions of the 
</p>
<p>work of public authorities. It played an essential role in the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights. The Congress had created spaces for dialogue and consultations with civil 
</p>
<p>society, non-governmental organizations and other interested groups, which had generated 
</p>
<p>a considerable number of legislative proposals.  
</p>
<p>36. Close cooperation was maintained with United Nations entities and the international 
</p>
<p>community in general. The Congress was working on a priority basis on issues related to 
</p>
<p>the fulfilment of the rights of children, education, security, development, lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual, transgender and intersex groups, indigenous communities and Afro-descendants, 
</p>
<p>the environment and gender. It had identified as a challenge the construction of a legislative 
</p>
<p>agenda agreed with the relevant institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>37. The Congress had the responsibility of ensuring that institutions with a 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect and promote human rights, such as the Supreme Court of Justice, 
</p>
<p>the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the National Human Rights Commissioner, had the 
</p>
<p>necessary resources to implement their respective mandates. The Congress also played a 
</p>
<p>role in the selection of persons for those positions, received their annual reports and had the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of publicly assessing their performance.  
</p>
<p>38. The Secretary of State for Human Rights, Justice, Governance and Decentralization 
</p>
<p>reported that, in 2012, the Law on the National Prison System had been adopted. It created 
</p>
<p>the National Penitentiary Institute, assigned resources for the construction of four new 
</p>
<p>prisons to reduce prison overcrowding and contributed to the governance of 29 centres of 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty. A new corps of correctional officers had also been created.  
</p>
<p>39. The Secretariat for Human Rights, together with the National Penitentiary Institute 
</p>
<p>and with the advice of the Human Rights Adviser of OHCHR, had been coordinating the 
</p>
<p>development of the first national policy on the penitentiary, which was expected to be 
</p>
<p>completed soon. The General Regulation of the Law on the National Penitentiary System 
</p>
<p>had been approved and the National Penitentiary Academy was being designed. The 
</p>
<p>provision of food and access to hydro-sanitary and electric systems in detention centres had 
</p>
<p>also been improved.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2014, the National Institute for Migration for the implementation of the law on 
</p>
<p>migration and the immigration policy had been created. One of the main achievements had 
</p>
<p>been the introduction of the immigration control biometric system and the establishment of 
</p>
<p>a mechanism for combating trafficking. </p>


<p>41. Honduras had also tackled the emerging migration of unaccompanied minors. 
</p>
<p>Through institutional and intersectoral coordination under the leadership of the First Lady 
</p>
<p>of Honduras, the Special Commission for Migrant Children offered comprehensive services 
</p>
<p>of reception, health assessment, counselling support, training for work, school reintegration, 
</p>
<p>emergency food aid and economic aid so that children and family units could return to their 
</p>
<p>places of origin. Those actions have resulted in a substantial reduction of unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>children.  
</p>
<p>42. The Minister of the National Institute for Women noted that Honduras was 
</p>
<p>determined to make structural changes in favour of women&#8217;s equality. The elaboration of 
</p>
<p>the Second Gender Equality and Equity Plan had been led by the National Institute for 
</p>
<p>Women through a national consultation process. The Institute was currently implementing 
</p>
<p>an advocacy strategy and strengthening institutional mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>43. Honduras had established Gender Units in the Judicial Branch, Secretaries for 
</p>
<p>Health and Safety, and Gender Commissions in different municipalities. Processes were 
</p>
<p>also coordinated in Municipal Offices for Women. 
</p>
<p>44. Honduras had incorporated femicide in legislation and imposed penalties on the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of that crime. The Law against Trafficking of Persons and the National Plan 
</p>
<p>against Violence towards Women had also been adopted. 
</p>
<p>45. Honduras had launched a public-awareness campaign to eradicate the practices of 
</p>
<p>sexual harassment at work, covering public offices and the private sector. 
</p>
<p>46. The Protocol for Comprehensive Assistance to Women Victims of Violence and a 
</p>
<p>technical guide for use by health officials and justice operators had been developed. 
</p>
<p>Shelters in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula had also been established.  
</p>
<p>47. Honduras had adopted the Law on Equality of Wages between Women and Men. 
</p>
<p>There was a dialogue with the feminist movement, which allowed the State to ensure better 
</p>
<p>social impact and to promote a better quality of life for women in Honduras. 
</p>
<p>48. The Undersecretary of Labour and Social Security referred to the Second National 
</p>
<p>Plan of Action for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labour, which envisaged the 
</p>
<p>creation of national structures, the ratification of international norms, the harmonization of 
</p>
<p>national legislation and strengthening of national capacities and knowledge. A road map to 
</p>
<p>make Honduras a country free from child labour and its worst forms had been adopted. An 
</p>
<p>agreement had recently been signed with the United States of America to implement a 
</p>
<p>programme called &#8220;Bright futures&#8221; with an investment of US$ 7.5 million in four years. 
</p>
<p>49. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security had the responsibility of ensuring that 
</p>
<p>the employment conditions were decent. Efforts were being made for the 
</p>
<p>professionalization of the General Directorate of Inspection through various regulatory 
</p>
<p>proposals, such as the Law on Inspection and an International Labour Organization (ILO) 
</p>
<p>audit process.  
</p>
<p>50. A tripartite commission had also been created to follow up on the compliance of the 
</p>
<p>action plan on the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. 
</p>
<p>51. Honduras had also signed an agreement for the promotion of investment, protection 
</p>
<p>of employment, health and access to housing for workers of the Honduran <i>maquila</i> textiles 
</p>
<p>sector.  
</p>
<p>52. A social protection system framework law had been approved. Thanks to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of investment of the private sector and reactivation of the agricultural and 
</p>
<p>housing sectors, and various government placement programmes, new job opportunities 
</p>
<p>had been generated. Efforts were also under way, together with the National Congress, to </p>


<p>improve the employability of young people. One goal was for the generation of 200,000 job 
</p>
<p>opportunities. 
</p>
<p>53. The Undersecretary of State in the Offices of Development and Social Inclusion 
</p>
<p>referred to the policy of social protection and the Better Life programme targeting people in 
</p>
<p>condition of poverty and extreme poverty, with components of healthy housing, such as 
</p>
<p>water filters, latrines, ecological ovens, construction of cement floors, storage of water, 
</p>
<p>roofs and solidarity bags with food, which had benefited more than 100,000 families. 
</p>
<p>54. Other programmes included ones for productive micro-enterprises and family 
</p>
<p>farming, the Presidential Better Life Bonus programme and the School Lunch programme.  
</p>
<p>55. Honduras was currently holding consultations for the elaboration of a policy against 
</p>
<p>racism and racial discrimination to ensure the social and political participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants and the exercise of intercultural citizenship, as 
</p>
<p>well as the right to bilingual intercultural education, right to health, land and natural 
</p>
<p>resources. 
</p>
<p>56. A public policy and strategic plan to guarantee the human rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities had been adopted. Honduras had also subscribed to the Program of Action for 
</p>
<p>the Decade of the Americas for the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>57. The Undersecretary of Human Rights and Justice noted that, after the first universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, Honduras had led a broad process of consultation to design and adopt the 
</p>
<p>National Action Plan on Human Rights 2013&#8211;2022, which incorporated and transformed 
</p>
<p>into strategic action over 1,200 recommendations, including from civil society, the human 
</p>
<p>rights treaty bodies and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  
</p>
<p>58. The first phase of the Human Rights Observatory, to measure progress on human 
</p>
<p>rights issues and to facilitate reporting to treaty bodies and society in general, was also 
</p>
<p>under way. Honduras was currently designing an integrated monitoring and evaluation 
</p>
<p>system to assess the impact of the National Action Plan on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>59. Honduras was committed to continuing the citizen&#8217;s dialogue and participation. It 
</p>
<p>would share the outcome of the second review and promote the implementation of 
</p>
<p>subsequent recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>60. During the interactive dialogue, 60 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. All written 
</p>
<p>statements of the delegations, to be checked against delivery on the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Webcast archives,1 are posted on the extranet of the Human Rights Council when available. 
</p>
<p>61. Guatemala commended the creation of the Secretariat for Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the National Action Plan on Human Rights. It shared the concern of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination regarding the loss of the A-status 
</p>
<p>by the National Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>62. The Holy See acknowledged Honduran efforts to bring national legislation into 
</p>
<p>greater conformity with the international human rights instruments, especially those relating 
</p>
<p>to the prevention of enforced disappearances and torture, the national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution and the ratification of several instruments.
