<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> The promotion and protection of human rights in the context of

</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recalling the relevant 
international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that,  consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, States 
Members of the United Nations have pledged to achieve, in cooperation with the United 
Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all without distinction such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 12/16 of 2 October 2009 and 16/4 of 
24 March 2011, on freedom of opinion and expression, 15/21 of 30 September 2010 and 
21/16 of 27 September 2012, on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association, 19/35 of 23 March 2012, on the promotion and protection of human rights in 
the context of peaceful protests, and 21/12 of 27 September 2012, on the safety of 
journalists, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that, pursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly, of expression and of association are human rights guaranteed to all, while their 
exercise may be subject to certain restrictions, in accordance with States&#8217; obligations under 
applicable international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also </i>that any such restrictions must be based in law, in accordance with 
States&#8217; obligations under applicable international human rights instruments, and subject to a 
competent, independent, impartial and prompt administrative or judicial review, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that peaceful protests can occur in all societies, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging also</i> that participation in peaceful protests can be an important form 
of exercising the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, and of association, freedom of 
expression and of participation in the conduct of public affairs, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i>, in this regard, the role that peaceful protests can play during the period 
of elections and the contribution they can make to the conduct of free, fair and democratic 
elections, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that peaceful protests can contribute to the full enjoyment of civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> that participation in public and peaceful protests should be entirely 
voluntary and uncoerced, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>therefore that everyone must be able to express their grievances or 
aspirations in a peaceful manner, including through public protests without fear of reprisals 
or of being intimidated, harassed, injured, sexually assaulted, beaten, arbitrarily arrested 
and detained, tortured, killed or subjected to enforced disappearance, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>about acts that can amount to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions committed against persons exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly, of expression and of association in all regions of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing </i>its concern about the number of attacks targeting journalists in the 
context of peaceful protests, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that peaceful protests should not be viewed as a threat, and therefore 
encouraging all States to engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful dialogue when 
dealing with peaceful protests and their causes, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that national human rights institutions and representatives of civil 
society, including non-governmental organizations, can play a useful role in facilitating 
continued dialogue between individuals taking part in peaceful protests and the relevant 
authorities, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need to ensure full accountability for human rights violations or abuses 
in the context of peaceful protests, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, as adopted at 
the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, </p>


<p> 1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the thematic report of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on effective measures and best practices to ensure 
the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests,1 submitted 
in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 19/35; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recalls </i>that States have the responsibility, including in the context of 
peaceful protests, to promote and protect human rights and to prevent human rights 
violations, in particular extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, arbitrary arrest and 
detention, enforced disappearances, and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, and calls upon States to avoid the abuse of criminal and civil 
proceedings or threats of such acts at all times; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> States to facilitate peaceful protests by providing protestors with 
access to public space and protecting them, where necessary, against any forms of threats, 
and underlines the role of local authorities in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon </i>States to promote a safe and enabling environment for individuals 
and groups to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of 
association, including by ensuring that their domestic legislation and procedures related to 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association are in 
conformity with their international human rights obligations and commitments; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Underlines </i>the role that communication between protestors, local authorities 
and police can play in the proper management of assemblies such as peaceful protests, 
including protests that are spontaneous, simultaneous, unauthorized or restricted; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States to pay particular attention to the safety of women and their 
protection from gender-based violence, including sexual assault in the context of peaceful 
protests; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to avoid using force during peaceful protests, and to 
ensure that, where force is absolutely necessary, no one is subject to excessive or 
indiscriminate use of force; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon </i>States, as a matter of priority, to ensure that their domestic 
legislation and procedures are consistent with their international obligations and 
commitments in relation to the use of force by law enforcement officials, in particular 
applicable principles of law enforcement such as the principles of necessity and 
proportionality, bearing in mind that lethal force may only be used to protect against an 
imminent threat to life and that it may not be used merely to disperse a gathering; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls upon </i>States to investigate any death or injury committed during 
protests, including those resulting from the discharge of firearms or the use of non-lethal 
weapons by law enforcement officials; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Further calls upon</i> States and, where applicable, the relevant governmental 
authorities to ensure adequate training of law enforcement officials and military personnel 
and to promote adequate training for private personnel acting on behalf of a State, including 
in international human rights law and, where appropriate, international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 11. E<i>ncourages </i>States to make protective equipment and non-lethal weapons 
available to their law enforcement officials and to refrain from using lethal force during 
peaceful protests, while pursuing efforts to regulate and establish protocols for the use of 
non-lethal weapons; 
</p>

<p> 12. <i>Underlines </i>the necessity to address the management of assemblies, such as 
peaceful protests, so as to contribute to their peaceful conduct, and to prevent loss of life of, 
and injuries to, protestors, bystanders, those monitoring such protests, and law enforcement 
officials, as well as any human rights violations or abuses; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Recognizes </i>the key role played by national human rights institutions, civil 
society, including non-governmental organizations, journalists, writers and other media 
workers, Internet users and human rights defenders, and other relevant stakeholders, in 
documenting human rights violations or abuses committed in the context of peaceful 
protests; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Urges </i>States to ensure that national mechanisms, based on law in conformity 
with their international human rights obligations and commitments, can ensure oversight 
and accountability for human rights violations and abuses, including in the context of 
peaceful protests; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Also urges </i>States to ensure that victims of human rights violations and abuses 
have, through existing national mechanisms, access to a remedy and that they obtain 
redress, including in the context of peaceful protests; 
</p>
<p> 16.<i> Acknowledges</i> the importance of international cooperation in support of 
national efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, in order to  raise the capacities of law enforcement agencies to deal with peaceful 
protests in a manner that conforms with their international human rights obligations and 
commitments; 
</p>
<p> 17.<i> Requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To organize, before the twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council, a 
seminar on effective measures and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the context of peaceful protests, with the participation of States, relevant 
Human Rights Council special procedures, members of the treaty bodies and other 
stakeholders, including academic experts and civil society representatives, with the aim of 
building upon the above-cited report of the High Commissioner and other related work of 
the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prepare a report on the deliberations held during the seminar and to 
submit it to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this topic at its twenty-fifth session 
under agenda item 3.
