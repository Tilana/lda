<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of 
violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination reviews activities undertaken during the reporting period, including its 
engagement with the intergovernmental working group established by the Human Rights 
Council at its fifteenth session and its work in relation to the draft Charter of the Oversight 
Mechanism for the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers.  
</p>
<p> In addition, the Working Group discusses its project to collect and analyse national 
legislation on private military and security companies. It presents a sample analysis of three 
sets of national legislation that represent distinct approaches to the issue. From that 
analysis, the Working Group begins to identify common elements in national laws and 
some of the challenges faced in regulating the sector. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, the Working Group makes recommendations for Member States, including 
encouraging them to continue to develop national legislation on private military and 
security companies and to participate in the Working Group&#8217;s survey of national 
legislation. 
</p>
<p> As the Working Group has previously noted, national legislation should be 
complemented by a strong international regulatory framework. The Working Group 
recommends that Member States consider the possibility of developing a binding 
international instrument for the regulation of private military and security companies and 
urges all Member States to participate in the intergovernmental working group established 
by the Human Rights Council. The Working Group recommends that Member States 
ensure accountability for human rights violations involving private military and security 
companies, and provide victims of human rights violations with an effective remedy.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of 
violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination describes its activities since its previous report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/18/32). The thematic section of the report is a comparative analysis of three 
approaches to national legislation that identifies common elements and challenges in the 
regulation of private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on 
Human Rights, in which the Commission established the mandate of the Working Group, 
Human Rights Council resolutions 7/21 and 15/12, in which the Council extended that 
mandate, and 18/4. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group comprises five independent experts serving in their personal 
capacities: Patricia Arias (Chile), Elzbieta Karska (Poland), Anton Katz (South Africa), 
Faiza Patel (Pakistan) and Gabor Rona (United States of America). In October 2011, the 
Working Group decided that Ms. Patel would act as Chair-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group until December 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>4. In accordance with its usual practice, the Working Group held three regular sessions: 
two in Geneva and one in New York. It held regular meetings with representatives of 
Member States, non-governmental organizations and experts. It also reviewed allegations 
regarding the activities of mercenaries and private military and security companies and 
their impact on human rights, and decided on appropriate action.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth sessions of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>5. The thirteenth session of the Working Group took place in New York from 5 to 8 
July 2011. It included an expert seminar to discuss the content and status of the State 
monopoly on the legitimate use of force and possible implications for the regulation of 
private military and security companies. The Working Group is grateful to the 10 experts 
who contributed to this endeavour.1 On 8 July 2011, the Working Group held a press 
conference to discuss issues relating to its mandate. 
</p>
<p>6. The fourteenth session took place in Geneva from 24 to 28 October 2011. It included 
consultations with representatives of Member States, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-
governmental organizations. This was the first meeting of the five new members of the 
Working Group after the members appointed at the establishment of the Working Group 
completed their mandates in August and October 2011. After considering several country

<p>situations, by a letter dated 16 September 2011 the Working Group renewed its previous 
request to visit C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. That request was accepted by the Government of C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire in a letter dated 14 November 2011.  
</p>
<p>7. The fifteenth session was held in Geneva from 12 to 16 March 2012. At that session, 
the Working Group consulted representatives of Member States, the Department of Safety 
and Security, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and non-governmental organizations. It 
decided to submit comments on the draft Charter of the Oversight Mechanism for the 
International Code of Conduct on Private Security Service Providers. It also met the Under-
Secretary-General for Safety and Security to discuss the development of United Nations 
policies regarding the use of armed private security companies by United Nations organs 
and agencies. It welcomed efforts within the United Nations system to develop a coherent, 
human-rights-compliant policy framework for the procurement and use of armed private 
security companies, including relevant criteria, and agreed to continue to engage with the 
Department of Safety and Security in that process. 
</p>
<p>8. After considering several country situations, the Working Group requested visits to 
Libya and Somalia. By a letter dated 26 April 2012, the Government of Libya accepted the 
request. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Working Group sent two communications and one follow-up letter to 
Governments relating to alleged mercenary activities and to the activities of private military 
and security companies and their impact on human rights. The Working Group expresses its 
appreciation to those Governments that provided substantive replies to its communications 
and invites those that have not replied to do so, in accordance with the mandate from the 
Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Comments on the draft Charter of the Oversight Mechanism for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 16 January 2012, the Temporary Steering Committee of the International Code 
of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers issued the draft Charter of the Oversight 
Mechanism for the Code for public consultation. By a letter dated 30 March 2012, the 
Working Group submitted its comments on the draft Charter. These comments are 
discussed further below. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Comments on the Swiss draft federal law on the provision of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>security services abroad  
</b></p>
<p>11. On 12 October 2011, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of the Government 
of Switzerland issued a draft federal law on<b> </b>the provision of private security services 
abroad for public consultation.  The Working Group welcomed this open and transparent 
process and, by a letter dated 31 January 2012, submitted its comments. The Swiss draft 
law is discussed further below. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Other activities of the Working Group members 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Working Group signed an amicus curiae brief submitted by Human Rights First 
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the cases of <i>Al-Shimari v. </i></p>


<p><i>CACI International, Inc. and Al-Quiraishi v. L-3 Services, Inc.</i>, in which it was argued that 
contractors accused of international human rights violations, in this case torture, should not 
be granted a &#8220;combatant activities&#8221; exemption from civil liability in United States courts. 
On 11 May 2012, the full appeals court dismissed the appeal by the defendants and referred 
the case back to the district courts for further fact-finding.  
</p>
<p>13. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group participated in the annual joint 
seminar of the United Nations Office at Geneva and the Geneva Centre for the Democratic 
Control of Armed Forces convened on 7 December 2011 on the subject of the privatization 
of security. She delivered a statement on the challenges of regulating private military and 
security companies, gaps in regulation at the international and national levels and the need 
for a binding international instrument to ensure accountability for private military and 
security companies involved in human rights violations and to provide effective remedies to 
victims. From 30 May to 1 June 2012, she participated in a conference convened at the Si&#233; 
Ch&#233;ou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy at the University of Denver, 
United States, where she discussed current regulatory efforts and continuing challenges 
relating to the activities of private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>14. Ms. Arias participated in a regional workshop for North-East and Central Asia on 
the Montreux Document on pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for 
States related to operations of private military and security companies during armed 
conflict, held on 12 and 13 October 2011 in Ulaanbaatar. The workshop was organized by 
the Governments of Mongolia and Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red 
Cross and the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces. She gave a 
presentation on activities of private military and security companies in the scenario of the 
use of force, their impact on human rights, risks and challenges. 
</p>
<p>15. During the thirty-first International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, 
held in Geneva from 28 November to 1 December 2011, Ms. Karska participated in a side 
event entitled &#8220;Protecting civilians in armed conflict: beyond the Montreux Document  &#8211;
international developments in private military and security company regulation&#8221;, which was 
organized by the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs of the Government of 
Switzerland, the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. She gave a presentation on gaps in international 
human rights and humanitarian law in relation to accountability for violations of 
international law involving private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>16. On 28 March 2012, Mr. Rona participated as a resource person in the second session 
of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, during which the Committee held 
consultations on the definition of non-State actors and their involvement in enforced 
disappearances, including issues of responsibility and accountability. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Engagement of the Working Group in processes to elaborate 
standards for the regulation of private military and security 
companies at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Working Group welcomes the continued efforts by the Human Rights Council 
and Member States to elaborate an international regulatory framework for private military 
and security companies and to establish voluntary standards for the industry. It appreciates 
the opportunity to inform these continuing processes. </p>


<p><b> A. Intergovernmental working group on regulating private military and 
</b></p>
<p><b>security companies 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/26, established an open-ended 
intergovernmental working group with the mandate to consider the possibility of 
elaborating an international regulatory framework, including the option of elaborating a 
legally binding instrument on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of 
private military and security companies, including their accountability, taking into 
consideration the principles, main elements and draft text as proposed by the Working 
Group on the use of mercenaries. The members of the Working Group look forward to 
participating as resource persons in the second session of the open-ended intergovernmental 
working group, to be held from 13 to 17 August 2012 in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Draft Charter of the Oversight Mechanism for the International Code 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers 
</b></p>
<p>19. On 16 January 2012, the Temporary Steering Committee of the International Code 
of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers, a multi-stakeholder initiative supported 
by the Government of Switzerland, issued the draft Charter of the Oversight Mechanism for 
the Code for public consultation. By a letter dated 30 March 2012, the Working Group 
expressed its continued support for the process of developing the Code and the Charter as a 
means of improving the adherence of private military and security companies to 
international humanitarian and human rights standards. The Working Group recognized the 
challenges of developing the Charter and submitted extensive comments in an effort to 
improve the draft text so that it would better fulfil the promise of the Code to protect human 
rights in the context of activities of private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>20. As the implementing mechanism of the Code, the Charter&#8217;s structure and procedures 
have a critical bearing on the realization of the Code&#8217;s principles, goals and rules. The 
Charter&#8217;s effectiveness is the litmus test for the legitimacy of the Code as a means of 
improving the adherence of private military and security companies to human rights 
standards. The Working Group believes that the draft Charter does not live up to the 
promise of the Code in several ways, some of which illustrate the inherent limitations of a 
voluntary approach to regulation and demonstrate the need for a binding international 
instrument. 
</p>
<p>21. Generally, the Working Group believes that the Charter should be modified to 
explicitly mainstream the protection of human rights, which is the expressed goal of the 
Code and the Charter. The Working Group recommends that the Charter be brought further 
into compliance with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights developed by 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises (see A/HRC/17/31, annex), which 
were unanimously endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4. That 
framework is specifically embraced in the Code and the Working Group believes the 
Guiding Principles set out the basic parameters that an industry self-regulatory mechanism 
should meet. The Working Group is aware of criticism of the Guiding Principles, in 
particular by non-governmental organizations, but notes that such criticism does not </p>


<p>concern the usefulness of the Principles as setting out the basic parameters for a self-
regulatory mechanism such as the Code and Charter.2 
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group suggested specific areas in which the Charter could be 
strengthened. For example, it should require field audits. In addition, the third-party 
grievance mechanism established by the Charter should be revised to address the substance 
of third-party complaints (as envisaged in the Code), rather than focusing only on the 
procedural compliance of member companies. Lastly, the draft Charter contains provisions 
that permit companies to refuse to share information with monitoring mechanisms owing to 
contractual provisions or the potential for parallel legal proceedings. While the Working 
Group recognizes the reasoning behind such provisions, it believes that they present 
significant loopholes that could prevent the effective operation of Charter mechanisms and 
that the inclusion of such provisions reflects the inherent limitations of a self-regulatory 
mechanism, which can never replace accountability through the law. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group welcomed the opportunity to participate in the public 
consultation on the draft Charter and hopes that its comments will assist the Temporary 
Steering Committee in strengthening the draft Charter and producing a final document that 
lives up to the commitments made by the signatory companies to the Code. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Research into national regulation of private military and 
security companies 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Working Group believes that it would be useful to study and identify legislative 
approaches regarding the activities of private military and security companies and to assess 
the effectiveness of national legislation in protecting human rights. Such a study would 
inform the Working Group&#8217;s efforts to demonstrate the need for a legally binding 
</p>
<p>international instrument. In addition, it would assist in identifying best practices and may 
inform future projects to develop guidance for Member States seeking to regulate private 
military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group is conducting this work in phases. First, it is analysing national 
legislation that is easily accessible to develop preliminary conclusions on the models used 
by States. An example of this approach is the analysis of the national legislation of three 
countries set out below. Second, the Working Group has initiated a survey to collect 
national legislation pertaining to private military and security companies. It has requested 
Member States to provide information in this respect and will supplement the information 
collected with additional research. Some of this research will be conducted in collaboration 
with civil society partners.  
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group plans to analyse national legislation on a region-by-region 
basis. It is anticipated that the first regional analysis will be included as part of the report of 
the Working Group to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session, in 2013.

<p><b> A. Three models of national legislation: South Africa, United States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Switzerland  
</b></p>
<p>27. As noted above, the Working Group began its work on national legislation by 
analysing the national legislation of South Africa and the United States relating to private 
military and security companies and the above-mentioned Swiss draft law. This legislation 
reflects distinct approaches to the regulation of private military and security companies. 
South Africa, which was one of the first countries to seek to regulate such companies, 
severely limits the export of military services, whereas the United States and Switzerland 
take far less restrictive positions. Even between the United States and Switzerland, 
however, approaches vary. United States legislation is focused mainly on strengthening 
accountability for crimes committed by contractors overseas, while the Swiss draft law 
places greater emphasis on building a regulatory process for private military and security 
companies. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group is conscious that, whereas the national legislation of South 
Africa and the United States has been adopted, the Swiss legislation remains in the drafting 
process, and the Working Group looks forward to its adoption. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. South Africa 
</b></p>
<p>29. South Africa was one of the first countries to adopt legislation regulating private 
military and security companies.3 That legislation is founded on section 198 (b) of the 
country&#8217;s Constitution, which states that the resolve to live in peace and harmony precludes 
any South African citizen from participating in armed conflict, nationally or internationally, 
except as provided for in terms of the Constitution or national legislation. The legislation 
covering private military and security companies comprises the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act (No. 15 of 1998)4 and the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and 
Regulation of Certain Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act (No. 27 of 2006).5  
</p>
<p>30. To address the growing numbers of South Africans with military skills and 
experience offering their services abroad in the post-apartheid era, South Africa enacted the 
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act in 1998. The Act covers both mercenary 
activities and private military and security companies. Mercenary activity, defined as 
&#8220;direct participation as a combatant in armed conflict for private gain&#8221;, is forbidden, as is 
the recruitment, use, financing or training of mercenaries. The Act addresses private 
military and security companies through its regulation of the provision of foreign military 
assistance. Foreign military assistance is broadly defined to include military assistance to a 
party to an armed conflict (e.g. advice or training; personnel, financial, logistical, 
intelligence or operational support; personnel recruitment; medical or paramedical services; 
or procurement of equipment) in addition to security services (e.g. protection of individuals 
or property involved in armed conflict). Any action aimed at overthrowing a Government 
or undermining the constitutional order, sovereignty or territorial integrity of a State and 
other actions that further the military interests of a party to the armed conflict also form part 
of foreign military assistance.  
</p>
<p>31.  Under section 4 of the Act, any person or company seeking to provide foreign 
military assistance is required to obtain authorization from the National Conventional Arms 
Control Committee, a Cabinet committee comprising eight ministers and three deputy 
</p>

<p>ministers appointed by the President that was initially established in 1995 to deal with 
applications for arms sales. Upon receipt of such an application, the Committee makes a 
recommendation to the Minister of Defence, who makes a final determination according to 
criteria established in section 7 of the Act. Under this section, authorizations are not to be 
granted if they would be in conflict with the country&#8217;s international legal obligations, result 
in the infringement of human rights, endanger the peace by introducing destabilizing 
military capabilities, contribute to regional instability or negatively influence the balance of 
power, or support or encourage terrorism. 
</p>
<p>32. The Committee is required to maintain a register of authorizations and approvals 
issued by the Minister of Defence. In addition, it must submit quarterly reports to the 
national executive, Parliament and the Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Military 
Veterans on the register and on its activities under the Act. 
</p>
<p>33. The Act criminalizes the undertaking of the activities prohibited by the law and the 
undertaking of activities without requisite authorization. To facilitate prosecutions, section 
9 of the Act establishes the extraterritorial jurisdiction of national courts over offences 
under the Act. Specific sanctions for breaches of the Act are not identified, however.  
</p>
<p>34. As the Working Group noted in the report of its country visit to South Africa in 
2010, the Act does not appear to have been effective in regulating the private military and 
security industry.6   Indeed, following revelations that a number of South African nationals 
were involved in a coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea,7 South Africa adopted stronger 
legislation, the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain Activities in 
the Country of Armed Conflict Act, in 2006.  
</p>
<p>35. The Act mirrors the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act in its approach. It 
maintains the dual aims of prohibiting mercenary activities8 and regulating the provision of 
&#8220;assistance or service&#8221;, including &#8220;security services&#8221;. It is more specific than the previous 
legislation about the activities to be regulated. The term &#8220;assistance or service&#8221; includes 
any form of military or military-related assistance, service or activity, or any form of 
assistance or service to a party to the armed conflict by means of advice or training; 
personnel, financial, logistical, intelligence or operational support; personnel recruitment; 
medical or paramedical services; or procurement of services. The term &#8220;security services&#8221; 
is defined as including guarding and protection services, security advisory services and 
training, installing, servicing or repairing security equipment, and monitoring signals or 
transmissions. Under section 3 of the Act, no person, unless specifically authorized under 
by the  National Conventional Arms Control Committee, may negotiate or offer assistance, 
including rendering service, to a party to an armed conflict or in a regulated country; 
provide any assistance or render any service to a party to an armed conflict or in a regulated 
country; recruit, use, train, support or finance a person to provide or render any service to a 
party to an armed conflict or in a regulated country; or perform any other act that has the 
result of furthering the military interests of a party to an armed conflict or in a regulated 
country. Rather than rely solely on the loosely defined term &#8220;armed conflict&#8221; to determine 
the scope of the Act, section 6 provides that the President, on the recommendation of the 
</p>
<p>  
 6  A/HRC/18/32/Add.3, paras. 27-39. 
 7  See Adam Roberts, <i>The Wonga Coup</i> (London, Profile Books, 2006). See also A/HRC/18/32/Add.2. 
 8  Under the prohibition of mercenary activity, no person may participate as a combatant for private gain 
</p>
<p>in an armed conflict; directly or indirectly recruit, use, train, support or finance a combatant for 
private gain in an armed conflict; directly or indirectly participate in any manner in the initiation, 
causing or furthering of an armed conflict; or a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, uprising or rebellion against any 
</p>
<p>Government; or directly or indirectly perform any act aimed at overthrowing a Government or 
undermining the constitutional order, sovereignty or territorial integrity of a State. </p>


<p>National Conventional Arms Control Committee, can proclaim a country as &#8220;regulated&#8221; by 
</p>
<p>the Act. 
</p>
<p>36. The Act maintains the centrality of the Committee in implementing its provisions 
and even expands the Committee&#8217;s role. The Committee remains the authorizing authority 
and the keeper of records (section 8 of the Act maintains the requirement that the 
Committee submit quarterly reports to the national executive and Parliament with regard to 
the register and requires the Committee to record proclamations by the President as to 
regulated countries). The Committee is also mandated, however, to review and authorize 
requests to render humanitarian assistance in areas of armed conflict, unlike in the 
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, which expressly excluded &#8220;humanitarian or 
civilian activities aimed at relieving the plight of civilians in an area of armed conflict&#8221; 
from the definition of foreign military assistance under article 1 (iii). Furthermore, as with 
the previous law, it establishes the extraterritorial jurisdiction of South African courts over 
offences committed under the Act. 
</p>
<p>37. Although the Act was adopted by Parliament on 17 November 2006 and received 
presidential assent on 12 November 2007, it has yet to enter into force. During its country 
visit in 2010, the Working Group was informed by the South African authorities that certain 
regulations, such as those dealing with application forms, fees and the list of regulated 
countries covered by the Act, needed to be adopted before it would enter into force.9   
Because the Act has yet to enter into force, it remains to be seen whether it will effectively 
regulate the activities of private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. United States

<p>38. The United States has dramatically increased its reliance on the private military and 
security industry, most notably as part of its military missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.10    
Consequently, it has also substantially increased its regulation of private military and 
security companies. The current framework consists of national legislation, military 
regulations and administrative contracting policies and procedures. Perhaps owing to this 
relationship between the increase in contracting by the United States Government and its 
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, United States legislation on private military and 
security companies focuses on Government contractors rather than on those companies 
under contract with non-governmental organizations, private companies or other clients. 
The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 and certain provisions of the National 
Defense Authorization Acts for recent fiscal years comprise the core of United States 
national legislation on private military and security companies. It should be noted, however, 
that significant elements of the United States regulatory structure are found in agency-level 
regulations that are beyond the scope of the present report.

civilian criminal justice system to individuals who accompany the United States Armed

<p>Forces abroad. It provides for the prosecution of crimes committed abroad that, if 
committed in the United States, would be considered felonies punishable by at least one 
year in prison.  
</p>
<p>40. The Act originally allowed for the prosecution only of contractors &#8220;employed by or 
accompanying the Armed Forces&#8221;, which appeared to restrict prosecution to Department of 
Defense contractors. The legislation was amended in 2004 to extend to contractors with any 
federal agency &#8220;to the extent such employment relates to supporting the mission of the 
Department of Defense overseas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. In 2007, the United States established military jurisdiction over some contractors 
operating abroad. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2007 amended the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which regulates the national armed 
forces.  The amendment extended military jurisdiction over civilians &#8220;in time of declared 
war or a contingency operation&#8221; to &#8220;persons serving with or accompanying an armed force 
in the field&#8221;. The main change is the addition of contingency operations as situations in 
which such jurisdiction may be exercised. The Act defines the term &#8220;contingency 
operation&#8221; to include &#8220;a military operation that is designated by the Secretary of Defense as 
an operation in which members of the armed forces are or may become involved in military 
actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an 
opposing military force&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>42. Although the amendment seeks to extend military jurisdiction over civilian 
contractors, trial of civilians by court martial has previously been declared unconstitutional 
in several United States Supreme Court cases.11  It therefore remains to be seen whether 
military courts martial will prove an effective, constitutional method of ensuring 
accountability for private military and security company employees.12 
</p>
<p>43. The national defence authorization acts for the fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2011 
focus on the promulgation of regulations for the use of private military and security 
companies by United States Government agencies. These laws require various Government 
authorities to prescribe regulations on the selection, training, equipping and conduct of 
private military and security company personnel in areas of combat operations,13 and to 
meet tracking14 and reporting15 requirements. In addition, the Office of Management and 
Budget was required to review existing definitions of the term &#8220;inherently governmental 
function&#8221; for clarity, and to develop a single consistent definition that would ensure that 
</p>
<p>only Government employees or members of the armed forces perform inherently 
governmental functions and other critical functions necessary for the mission success of a 
federal agency.16

and provides specific examples including combat and security operations in certain situations 
connected with combat or potential combat. </p>


<p>44. Separately, &#8220;sense of Congress&#8221; provisions state that private security contractors 
should not be authorized to perform inherently governmental functions in an area of combat 
operations and that interrogation is an inherently governmental function that &#8220;cannot 
appropriately be transferred to private-sector contractors&#8221;. The Secretary of Defense is 
instructed to issue policy guidance requiring the establishment of a third-party certification 
process for private military and security companies as a condition for selection for defence 
contracts for private security functions and requiring private military and security company 
employees that carry weapons to obtain basic weapons certification from a reputable 
certifying body. Intelligence activities are excluded from these requirements.  
</p>
<p>45. Although the national defence authorization acts require some Government 
authorities to promulgate the above-described regulations, the regulations themselves are 
beyond the scope of the present analysis. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Switzerland 
</b></p>
<p>46. As mentioned above, the Swiss draft law on the provision of private security 
services abroad17 is one of the most recent efforts to comprehensively regulate private 
military and security companies. Just as the South African legislation, the Swiss draft law 
follows two tracks. First, it prohibits certain activities, including direct participation in 
hostilities in an armed conflict,18 the hiring, training and provision of security personnel for 
direct participation in hostilities, and the provision of security services associated with 
serious infringement of human rights.  
</p>
<p>47. Second, it regulates private companies providing security services. Such services are 
defined to include a range of activities from protection tasks to guarding prisoners to 
operational or logistical support for armed or security forces and intelligence activities.  
</p>
<p>48. In addition to applying to natural persons, legal persons and partnerships, the Swiss 
draft law covers private security companies operating in Switzerland and companies that 
are registered in Switzerland and control security companies operating abroad. Any person 
or company seeking to carry out security services abroad is required to notify the 
Government, which will decide whether to prohibit or approve the activity, or to undertake 
further investigation. Draft article 12 provides a list of activities, such as those that take 
place in armed conflict, which may be contrary to the aims of the law and which the 
competent authority can consider when deciding whether to prohibit an activity. The Swiss 
draft law establishes clear deadlines for notification to the applicant at each stage in the 
process. It also requires private security companies to &#8220;observe the provisions&#8221; of the 
International Code of Conduct of 9 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>49. The Swiss federal authorities must follow certain guidelines to employ private 
security companies abroad. They may use private security companies for the protection of 
persons; guarding and surveillance of real estate; protection and transfer of tangible and 
intangible assets and data protection and handling. Before using private security services, 
the federal authorities must ensure that the company satisfies requirements concerning the 
recruitment, training and oversight of its personnel; demonstrates a clean human rights 
record; and provides sufficient internal controls to ensure that its personnel will observe the 
rules of conduct and be penalized for failure to do so. The federal authorities must also

<p>www.bfm.admin.ch/content/dam/data/sicherheit/gesetzgebung/sicherheitsfirmen/vorentw-f.pdf. The 
Working Group based its comments on an unofficial English translation of the draft law. 
</p>
<p> 18  Draft article 4 (d) of the Swiss draft law defines direct participation in hostilities as &#8220;direct 
participation in hostilities developing within the scope of an armed conflict abroad within the 
meaning of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols I and II&#8221;. </p>


<p>ensure that the company&#8217;s personnel have been trained in the protection tasks that they will 
perform, applicable national and international law and other key areas, including 
fundamental rights, protection of personality and procedural law, conduct to be adopted 
with persons resisting or behaving violently, first aid, assessment of damage to health 
resulting from the use of force, and combating corruption. The Swiss draft law grants an 
exception to these standards if no company satisfying them is available and the protection 
task cannot be completed otherwise, but stipulates a maximum duration of six months for 
such contracts.  
</p>
<p>50. The Swiss draft law explicitly sets out the conditions necessary to authorize the use 
of arms by private security companies. Such companies may use arms only to execute a 
protection task or react in a situation of legitimate defence or state of need. In contracts 
with federal authorities, the use of arms must be stipulated.  
</p>
<p>51. Sections 19 to 21 set out specific sanctions, including fines and imprisonment, for 
violations, including serious violations of human rights. Public consultation on the Swiss 
draft law concluded on 31 January 2012 and a redrafting process to reflect comments 
received during the consultation period is under way. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Analysis 
</b></p>
<p>52. The national legislation described above illustrates the three primary elements at 
play in efforts to regulate private military and security companies: the banning of certain 
activities of such companies; requiring these companies to be registered with national 
authorities and licensing their activities abroad; and efforts to establish jurisdiction in the 
home countries of such companies for violations of human rights and criminal law that 
occurred abroad. The South African legislation and the Swiss draft law both include bans 
on certain activities and encompass registration and licensing. In contrast, in the United 
States, legislative efforts have focused primarily on jurisdictional issues. There is no 
legislative ban on activities or registration and licensing model comparable to that of South 
Africa and Switzerland, although some activities of private military and security companies 
(such as the export of weapons) may require licences, and vetting and training requirements 
are often included in United States Government contracts with private military and security 
companies. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Constraints on activities of private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>53. Under the South African legislation and the Swiss draft law, private military and 
security companies are prohibited from undertaking specific activities. In the former, this 
ban is reflected in the prohibition of mercenary activities. In the latter, it takes the form of 
an absolute prohibition on direct participation in hostilities and mandates Swiss authorities, 
when determining whether to issue a licence for activities abroad, to consider whether the 
activities will take place in the context of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>54. The Swiss draft law also includes specific situations in which the State can use 
private security companies and the standards that such companies must meet to receive 
State contracts. Private military and security companies can be used only to protect people, 
guard facilities, for the protection and transfer of tangible and intangible assets and for data 
protection and handling. Some of the more controversial uses of private military and 
security companies, such as detention operations and interrogation, are notably absent from 
this list. While United States legislation does not preclude private military and security 
companies from performing any specific functions, there is a move in the legislature to 
reach an understanding about what activities are inherently governmental and should not be 
outsourced, with interrogation falling into this category. </p>


<p><b> 2. Regulation of activities of private military and security companies  
</b></p>
<p>55. Both the Swiss draft law and the South African legislation embrace a regulatory 
approach to private military and security companies. The former mandates the registration 
and approval of private military and security company activities abroad. The latter does not 
require registration, but does require authorization for certain types of activities abroad.  
</p>
<p>56. While none of the legislation considered includes specific vetting and training 
standards for private military and security companies, Government authorities have been 
required to undertake additional steps to ensure the qualifications of the individuals who 
and companies that they seek to hire. Generally, legislation on private military and security 
companies leaves it to agency-level bodies to develop vetting and training requirements. 
This is the approach taken in the Swiss draft law. In the United States, the Secretary of 
Defense is required, under the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2011, to develop specific requirements for defence contractors, such as a third-party 
certification process and weapons certification for private military and security company 
employees who carry weapons. 
</p>
<p>57. The experience of South Africa in implementing a licensing scheme demonstrates 
some of the challenges that States face. The body charged with authorizing private military 
and security company activities abroad is a Cabinet-level body. While charging such a 
high-level body with this task may serve to ensure utmost care in authorizing the activities 
of private military and security companies, it has also resulted in administrative challenges. 
The South African legislation does not specify a time frame within which the Committee 
must make its determinations and there is little public information about its processes. For 
example, the Committee is required to report to Parliament on its own activities, including 
applications received and the status of authorizations, but this requirement has not been 
regularly met. It also remains unclear whether the Committee maintains the required 
register of authorizations and approvals issued by the Minister of Defence.19 This may have 
had the unintended effect of driving the private military and security company industry 
underground. During the Working Group&#8217;s trip to South Africa, several companies reported 
that they often chose not to seek authorization for their activities because they possessed 
little confidence that the Committee would handle applications fairly and promptly.20     
</p>
<p>58. None of the legislation reviewed included systematic monitoring and reporting by 
private military and security companies to ensure compliance with national laws and 
international human rights norms. It is therefore unclear whether, once a private military 
and security company is granted a licence to conduct certain operations, its activities under 
that contract are in any way monitored by the licensing authorities. The Swiss draft law 
does not require regular or periodic reporting on the activities of private military and 
security companies, nor does it require such companies to report allegations of crimes or 
human rights violations to the authorities. In South Africa, once a company has received 
authorization to offer its services abroad, the law does not provide for monitoring of its 
activities by the Committee or any other body. Companies are not required to report on 
their activities or undergo field auditing.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Scope of legislation 
</b></p>
<p>59. In defining the scope of regulation of private military and security companies, the 
States analysed have used various approaches, generally focusing on areas of armed 
</p>
<p>  
 19  A/HRC/18/32/Add.3, paras. 27-29.  
 20  Ibid., para. 30. </p>


<p>conflict and particular types of activities related to armed conflict. Their experience in 
seeking to use these concepts demonstrates some of the challenges in this field. 
</p>
<p>60. The initial legislation passed in South Africa, the Regulation of Foreign Military 
Assistance Act (No. 15 of 1998), covered the provision of military assistance to a party to 
an armed conflict and the provision of security services in an armed conflict. The term 
&#8220;armed conflict&#8221; itself was, however, loosely defined to include any armed conflict 
between the armed forces of foreign States, the armed forces of a foreign State and 
dissident armed forces or other armed groups, or armed groups. This loose definition could 
allow private military and security companies to avoid seeking authorization on the grounds 
that a particular situation did not rise to the level of an armed conflict. As the Working 
Group learned during its country visit, the loose definition has also hampered prosecutions 
because of the need to present expert witnesses to testify that a given situation constituted 
armed conflict.21 Another issue arising from the scope of the law is that some companies 
have claimed that they are providing humanitarian services, rather than military assistance 
or security services, and are therefore not required to obtain permission.22  
</p>
<p>61. In enacting the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain 
Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act (No. 27 of 2006), South Africa sought to close 
those loopholes by requiring permission for the rendering of military assistance or security 
services to countries that have been declared &#8220;regulated&#8221; by the President on the 
recommendation of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee. It also 
specifically covers the rubric of humanitarian activities, the exclusion of which in the 
previous law had allowed some private military and security companies to evade the 
authorization process.  
</p>
<p>62. Switzerland has taken a somewhat different approach, providing the authorities with 
an indicative list of factors that may be &#8220;contrary to the aims of the law&#8221; to consider when 
deciding whether to license particular activities of private military and security companies. 
The authorities may, for example, consider whether a private military and security 
company&#8217;s activities would take place in international or internal armed conflict, &#8220;a crisis 
or conflict zone (defined as a zone in which an international or internal armed conflict 
exists; a zone of internal tension or internal disorder not constituting an armed conflict; and 
a zone in which human rights are systematically and seriously violated), or &#8220;a confrontation 
connected with internal tension or internal disorder&#8221;.   Other activities potentially contrary 
to the aims of the law include providing &#8220;operational or logistic support for foreign armed 
</p>
<p>or security forces&#8221;, or services &#8220;in the field of military know-how&#8221;. The use of the inclusive 
phrasing &#8220;contrary to the aims of the law&#8221; would also provide the competent authority with 
the flexibility to prohibit other potentially objectionable activities of private military and 
security companies. 
</p>
<p>63. In the United States, legislative efforts to extend jurisdiction over private military 
and security companies and their employees have generally referenced United States 
military operations abroad and have sought to ensure that contractors involved in such 
missions &#8211; even when not engaged by the Department of Defense &#8211; are covered.  For 
example, when extending the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to cover non-
Department of Defense contractors, Congress maintained a link to Department of Defense 
missions, applying the law to contractors &#8220;supporting the mission of the Department of

2006), p. 61. </p>


<p>Defense&#8221;. Similarly, when Congress extended military jurisdiction over civilians 
accompanying United States armed forces, it did so by making such jurisdiction available 
in &#8220;contingency operations&#8221; (operations where the Secretary of the Defense certifies that 
United States forces are engaged in, or likely to be engaged in, armed hostilities). Where 
contractors are not regarded as supporting United States military operations, however, it is 
unclear whether these jurisdictional expansions would apply.23 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Use of existing bodies to implement new legislation  
</b></p>
<p>64. The South African and United States legislation assigned obligations relating to 
private military and security companies to existing authorities, rather than creating 
specialized bodies. The Working Group has already discussed herein some challenges for 
South Africa in using a Cabinet-level body to review requests for authorization to provide 
military and security services abroad. In the United States, cases against contractors are 
brought by individual United States Attorneys&#8217; offices, which also deal with other matters. 
There appears to be some recognition among United States lawmakers that a special unit 
might be better suited to bring these cases: the Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, 
which is pending in Congress, would establish new investigative units to investigate, arrest 
and prosecute contractors and employees who commit serious crimes.24  
</p>
<p>65. It is unclear whether Switzerland will create a new body to administer its law or 
whether it will designate an existing body to be the &#8220;competent authority&#8221;.  The explanatory 
report accompanying the Swiss draft law notes that it does not require the creation of a new 
authority and that the competence deriving from the law may be attributed to an existing 
authority.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Looking ahead  
</b></p>
<p>66. The above analysis is preliminary in nature. The project initiated by the Working 
Group to collect and analyse national legislation on private military and security companies 
will undoubtedly reveal further challenges and best practices. The Working Group looks 
forward to cooperating with Member States to gather all relevant legislation and other 
materials on national regulatory frameworks pertaining to private military and security 
companies and their personnel. The translation and publication of national legislation will 
provide a publicly available resource for use by stakeholders and will inform efforts to 
develop effective regulatory frameworks. Responses by Member States to the request by 
the Working Group for national legislation will also inform its report to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-fourth session, in 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>

companies, the Working Group welcomes efforts by States to develop national 
</b></p>
