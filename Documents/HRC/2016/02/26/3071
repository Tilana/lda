<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>all previous resolutions on internally displaced persons adopted by the 
General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, 
including Assembly resolution 66/165 of 19 December 2011 and Council resolution 14/6 of 
17 June 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991 on the 
strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the United 
Nations, and the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement annexed thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>General Assembly resolution 64/290 of 9 July 2010 and Human 
Rights Council resolution 15/4 of 29 September 2010, in which the Assembly and the 
Council emphasized the right to education of internally displaced persons and in emergency 
situations, such as armed conflicts or natural disasters, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply disturbed </i>by the alarmingly high numbers of internally displaced persons 
throughout the world, for reasons including armed conflict, violations of human rights and 
natural or human-made disasters, who receive inadequate protection and assistance, and 
conscious of the serious challenges that this is creating for the international community, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Emphasizing </i>that States have the primary responsibility to provide protection and 
assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, as well as to address the 
root causes of the displacement problem in appropriate cooperation with the international 
community, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that internally displaced persons are to enjoy, in full equality, the same 
rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their 
country, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all persons, including those internally displaced, have the right to 
freedom of movement and residence and should be protected against being arbitrarily 
displaced, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the international community&#8217;s growing awareness of the issue of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons worldwide and the urgency of addressing the root causes of their 
displacement and finding durable solutions, including voluntary return in safety and with 
dignity, as well as voluntary local integration in the areas to which persons have been 
displaced or voluntary settlement in another part of the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the twentieth anniversary of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons and the considerable results achieved since 
its creation, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming also </i>the continuing cooperation between the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons and national Governments, the relevant offices 
and agencies of the United Nations as well as with other international and regional 
organizations, and encouraging further strengthening of this collaboration in order to 
promote better strategies for, protection of, assistance to and durable solutions for internally 
displaced persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that natural disasters are a cause of internal displacement, and 
concerned about factors, such as climate change that are expected to exacerbate the impact 
of natural hazards, and climate-related events, and calling for disaster risk reduction and the 
building of resilience to disasters to be addressed with a renewed sense of urgency in the 
context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also </i>that internally displaced persons are increasingly situated outside 
camps, including in urban settings, with unique risks and vulnerabilities that pose specific 
challenges for the full enjoyment of their human, and recognizing further the need to adapt 
operations with regard to their needs and those of their host communities, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing </i>concern at the increasing number of persons who become disabled 
during situations of internal displacement in the context of armed conflict or natural 
disasters, and recognizing the need to provide adequate services and support for their 
reintegration, 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Recognizes </i>the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement annexed to 
General Assembly resolution 46/182 as an important international framework for the 
protection of internally displaced persons, and encourages Member States and humanitarian 
agencies to continue to work together in endeavours to provide a more predictable and 
targeted response to the needs of internally displaced persons and, in this regard, calls for 
international support, upon request, for the capacity-building efforts of States; 
</p>
<p>2.<i> Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur, through continuous dialogue with 
Governments and all intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations concerned, to 
continue his analysis of the root causes of internal displacement, the needs and human 
rights of those displaced, measures of prevention, including early warning, and ways to 
strengthen protection and assistance, as well as durable solutions for internally displaced </p>


<p>persons, and, in the latter regard, to use in his activities the Framework on Durable 
Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, and 
also encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to promote comprehensive strategies, 
taking into account the primary responsibility of States for the protection of and assistance 
to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Calls upon </i>States to provide durable solutions, and encourages strengthened 
international cooperation, including through the provision of resources and expertise to 
assist affected countries, in particular developing countries, in their national efforts and 
policies relating to assistance, protection and rehabilitation for internally displaced persons; 
</p>
<p>4.<i> Encourages </i>States to continue to develop and implement domestic legislation 
and policies dealing with all stages of displacement, in an inclusive and non-discriminatory 
way, including through the identification of a national focal point within the Government 
for issues of internal displacement, and through the allocation of budget resources, and 
encourages the international community, relevant United Nations agencies and regional and 
national actors to provide financial and technical support and cooperation to Governments, 
upon request, in this regard; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Welcomes </i>the adoption and ongoing process of ratification of the African 
Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in 
Africa, which marks a significant step towards strengthening the national and regional 
normative framework for protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons in 
Africa, and encourages other regional mechanisms to consider the development of similar 
regional normative frameworks for the protection of internally displaced persons; 
</p>
<p>6.<i> Takes note </i>with appreciation of the adoption by the Policy Committee of the 
Secretary-General of decision No. 2011/10 and its preliminary Framework on Ending 
Displacement in the Aftermath of Conflict, which establishes priorities and responsibilities

relevant United Nations agencies, in cooperation with other stakeholders and in 
consultation with national authorities and partners, to implement the Framework as a matter 
of priority; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recognizes </i>that the inter-agency cluster system plays a central role in the 
international community&#8217;s efforts to protect and assist internally displaced persons, and 
encourages Governments to work with the cluster system to advance the human rights of 
internally displaced persons; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Emphasizes the importance</i> of consultation with internally displaced persons 
and host communities by Governments and other relevant actors, in accordance with their 
specific mandates, during all phases of displacement, as well as the participation of 
internally displaced persons, where appropriate, in programmes and activities pertaining to 
them, taking into account the primary responsibility of States for protection of and 
assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Also emphasizes the importance</i> of taking the human rights and specific 
protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons into consideration, when 
appropriate, in peace processes, and further emphasizes that durable solutions for internally 
displaced persons, including through voluntary return, sustainable reintegration, relocation 
and rehabilitation processes and their active participation, as appropriate, in the peace 
process, are necessary elements of effective peacebuilding; </p>


<p>10.<i> Takes note </i>with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons submitted to the Human Rights Council at its 
nineteenth session ,1 and the recommendations contained in the report on a more 
systematized and equitable response to internally displaced persons outside camps as well 
as the concerned host communities; 
</p>
<p>11.<i> Expresses concern</i> at the persistent problems of large numbers of internally 
displaced persons worldwide, in particular the risk of extreme poverty and socio-economic 
exclusion, their limited access to humanitarian assistance, vulnerability to human rights 
violations and difficulties resulting from their specific situation, such as lack of food, 
medication or shelter, and issues pertinent during their reintegration, including, in 
appropriate cases, the need for the restitution of or compensation for property; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Also expresses concern</i> at the problem of protracted internal displacement 
and recognizes the need to find durable solutions; 
</p>
<p>13.<i> Expresses particular concern</i> at the grave problems faced by many internally 
displaced women and children, including violence and abuse, sexual exploitation, 
trafficking in persons, forced recruitment and abduction, and encourages the continued 
commitment of the Special Rapporteur to promote action to address their particular 
assistance, protection and development needs, as well as those of other groups with special 
needs, such as severely traumatized individuals, older persons and persons with disabilities, 
taking into account all relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p>14.<i> Condemns </i>the continued perpetration of sexual and gender-based violence 
against internally displaced persons of all ages, with women and girls disproportionately 
victimized, and calls upon authorities and the international community to work together for 
effective prevention, security, protection of human rights, access to justice and victim 
assistance, as well as in addressing the causes of violence against women and girls and in 
fighting impunity across the board; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon </i>States, in cooperation with international agencies and other 
stakeholders, to ensure and support the full and meaningful participation of internally 
displaced women at all levels of decision-making processes and activities which have a 
direct impact on their lives, in all aspects relating to internal displacement, regarding 
promotion and protection of human rights, prevention of human rights violations, 
implementation of durable solutions, peace processes, peacebuilding, post-conflict 
reconstruction and development; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Expresses particular concern</i> that many internally displaced children lack 
access to education in the immediate aftermath of their displacement and also years 
afterwards owing to attacks against schools, damaged or destroyed school buildings, 
insecurity, loss of documentation, language barriers and discrimination; 
</p>
<p>17.<i> Recommends </i>that States ensure through all necessary measures that internally 
displaced children, including those in conflict and post-conflict phases, have access to 
education on a par with the rest of the population and without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p>18.<i> Urges </i>States to take into account the specific needs of persons with 
disabilities when promoting and ensuring the protection of the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, in particular by ensuring that person with disabilities have equal access 
to assistance, protection and rehabilitation services; 
</p>

<p>19. <i>Notes </i>with concern the particular human rights challenges of large numbers 
of internally displaced persons living increasingly outside camps and in urban settings, and 
the need to better support host communities assisting them, in many countries where 
internal displacement persists, and recommends effective and appropriate approaches for 
the specific protection of the human rights and implementation of durable solutions for 
internally displaced persons that fully take into account their needs and human rights, as 
well as the needs of host families and communities; 
</p>
<p>20.<i> Reaffirms, </i>in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement annexed to General Assembly resolution 46/182, that States have the primary 
responsibility to protect the human rights of, and to promote durable solutions for, 
internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, including internally displaced persons 
living outside camps; 
</p>
<p>21.<i> Welcomes </i>ongoing efforts to identify challenges and good practices with a 
view to strengthening the equitable, effective and systematized response to internally 
displaced persons living outside camps, and strongly encourages States, national and 
international humanitarian and development actors, the international community and 
relevant civil society to undertake further stocktaking processes on current practices 
relating to the promotion and protection of the human rights and the implementation of 
durable solutions for internally displaced persons, and to allocate additional resources in 
this regard; 
</p>
<p>22.<i> Stresses the importance</i> of the participation of internally displaced persons 
living outside camps and their host families and communities in establishing predictable 
and systematized support systems that take fully into account their human rights, needs and 
vulnerabilities; 
</p>
<p>23.<i> Supports </i>the promotion of better understanding of the role and 
responsibilities of, and support for and obstacles faced by municipal and provincial 
authorities in the protection of the human rights of internally displaced persons living 
outside camps, with a view to developing effective and appropriate approaches that take 
fully into account their needs and human rights, facilitating durable solutions and including 
internally displaced persons outside camps in local development plans; 
</p>
<p>24.<i> Emphasizes </i>the importance of the effective collection of data, disaggregated 
by age, sex, diversity and location, on internally displaced persons for the protection of 
their human rights, the implementation of durable solutions and the assessment of their 
specific needs and vulnerabilities, and encourages Governments to use, on a voluntary 
basis, the services of the Inter-Agency Joint Internally Displaced Person Profiling Service , 
which has been set up to offer technical support in this regard; 
</p>
<p>25.<i> Acknowledges </i>the important contribution of age, gender and diversity 
mainstreaming in identifying, through a participatory approach, the protection risks faced 
by the different members of communities of internally displaced persons, in particular the 
non-discriminatory treatment and protection of women, children, persons with disabilities 
and the elderly; 
</p>
<p>26.<i> Recognizes </i>the adverse effects of climate change as contributors to 
environmental degradation and extreme weather events, which may, among other factors, 
contribute to human displacement, and invites the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
of internally displaced persons, in close collaboration with States and intergovernmental 
and non-governmental organizations, to continue to explore the human rights implications 
and dimensions of disaster-induced internal displacement with a view to supporting 
Member States in their efforts to build local resilience and capacity to prevent displacement 
or to provide assistance and protection to those who are forced to flee; </p>


<p>27. <i>Invites </i>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons to continue to analyse the particular human rights challenges faced by internally 
displaced persons outside camps and in urban settings, while taking into account the 
situations of the concerned host communities, to identify challenges and good practices 
and, in close consultation with Member States, to make proposals with a view to 
developing a more systematic approach to the protection of their human rights and the 
promotion of durable solutions in the context of his participation in the Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee and in his regular reporting  to the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council.
