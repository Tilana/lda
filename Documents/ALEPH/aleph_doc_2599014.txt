Nation Energy Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
 
Note 1.  Basis of Presentation
The   accompanying   condensed   consolidated   unaudited   interim   financial   statements   have   been   prepared   in   accordance   with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information.  They do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete
financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered
necessary for a fair presentation, have been included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements.  Operating results for the
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  For further information, refer to
the financial statements and notes thereto, included in the Company’s Form 10-K as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016 (“The
Annual Report”).
The Company was an oil and gas exploration, development and production company with properties located in Alberta Canada.
 Effective June 1, 2008, the Company sold all of its oil and gas properties in the Smoky Hill area of Alberta and began to review other
prospects. On October 11, 2013, we entered into a letter agreement with Paltar Petroleum Limited, an Australian company,
pursuant to which we agreed to acquire four exploration and development permits and twenty-nine applications for exploration and
development permits in respect of prospective acreage located in northern Australia.  On March 31, 2014, we amended this letter
agreement and, on November 27, 2014, we amended and restated the letter agreement to add additional exploration properties
and provide for new closing terms.  On June 13, 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated agreement, replacing in its
entirety the amended and restated agreement dated November 27, 2014. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a third amended
and restated agreement, replacing in its entirety the second amended restated agreement dated June 13, 2015. Also on August
30,   2015,   and   pursuant   to   the   terms   of   the   third   amended   and   restated   letter   agreement   (the   “Agreement”),   Paltar   or   its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Officer Petroleum Pty Ltd (“Officer”), and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nation Energy (Australia) Pty Ltd.,
entered into seven separate earning agreements and an option agreement. Effective December 17, 2015, the Company entered
into a first amendment to the third amended and restated agreement to extend the time allowed for certain actions contemplated in
the third amended and restated agreement and to provide further information concerning the additional earning agreements as
such   term   is   defined   in   the   third   amended   and   restated   agreement.   Also   effective   December   17,   2015,   the   seven   earning
agreements were amended to make compatible extensions of time for actions contemplated by the third amended and restated
agreement and to extend the deadline for cash payments under the earning agreements. Effective February 8, 2016, the Company
entered into a second amendment to the third amended and restated agreement to extend again the time allowed for certain
actions   contemplated   in   the   third   amended   and   restated   agreement.   Also   effective   February   8,   2016,   the   seven   earning
agreements were amended to make compatible extensions of time for actions contemplated by the third amended and restated
agreement.  Effective  February  12, 2016,  the  Company  entered  into  an  amendment to   the  option  agreement to  change   the
purchase price for the assets subject to the option. Effective May 31, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to the
third amended and restated agreement to revise the payment of consideration by Nation contemplated in the third amended and
restated agreement. Also effective May 31, 2016, the seven earning agreements were amended to make compatible changes in
consideration payable by Nation Australia and Nation contemplated by the third amended and restated agreement, and the option
agreement was terminated. To implement any new business plan, significant financing will be required and the Company will need to
be successful in its efforts to identify, acquire and develop a new business venture.
On June 19, 2015, the Company registered a wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia, Nation Energy (Australia) PTY Ltd. (“Nation
Australia”).
On July 6, 2015, the Company registered a wholly-owned subsidiary in Delaware, USA, Nation GP, LLC (“Nation GP”), a Delaware
limited liability company.
On July 6, 2015, the Company registered a wholly-owned subsidiary in Delaware, USA, Nation SLP, LLC (“Nation SLP”), a Delaware
limited liability company.
On July 8, 2015, the Company formed Paltar Nation Limited Partnership (“Paltar Nation”), a Delaware limited partnership between
Nation GP, as the general partner of the partnership and Nation SLP as the limited partner (which is currently the sole limited partner
of Paltar Nation). Nation Energy Inc. currently owns 100% of the membership interests in Nation GP, LLC and a 76.12% membership
interests in Nation SLP, LLC. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold 37.5 units (equal to 1.38%
ownership) at $20,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of $750,000. The additional 22.5% ownership belongs to Beetaloo Basin.
Non-controlling interest in Nation SLP was immaterial for the three-months ended June 30, 2016.

The Company formed Paltar Nation for the purpose of funding exploration expenditures required to be provided by the wholly-owned
subsidiary of Nation Energy Inc., Nation Energy (Australia) Pty Ltd., which is expected to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paltar
Nation, to explore and develop all or a portion of 775,292 acres of certain Australian exploration permits.
 
The Company is currently in the development stage as defined by Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 915-10 “Development
Stage Entities” (“ASC 915-10”).  Upon the sale of all of its oil and gas assets, the Company re-entered the exploration stage.
 Consequently, its operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.  For the period
from inception through June 1, 2008 (prior to the development stage), the Company accumulated a deficit of ($6,839,714).  During
the development stage, the Company has accumulated a deficit of ($6,777,536).
Note 2. Reclassification of Certain Balances
Certain   immaterial   balances   on   the   condensed   consolidated   balance   sheet   for   the   year   ended   March   31,   2016,   have   been
reclassified, with no effect on net income (or earnings per common share), to be consistent with classifications adopted for the year
ended March 31, 2017.
Note 3.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
Accounting standards-setting organizations frequently issue new or revised accounting rules. The Company regularly reviews all new
pronouncements that have been issued to determine their impact, if any, on its financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, ”Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which requires an entity to recognize
the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU will
replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new standard is effective for the
Company on December 15, 2017.  Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or
cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial statements and
related disclosures.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its
ongoing financial reporting. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09. The
amendment defers the effective date of ASU No. 2015-14 by one year. The new standard is effective for the Company on December
15, 2018.
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15,
“Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial
doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when
substantial doubt is not alleviated. The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The
Company has adopted this ASU as of the current period.
In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, “Income Statement – Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items”. This ASU is effective for annual and
interim   reporting   periods   beginning   after   December   15,   2015.   ASU   No.   2015-01   eliminates   the   concept   of   extraordinary   items.  
Management has adopted this accounting pronouncement.
 
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. This ASU is
effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. ASU No 2015-02 amends the analysis required by a
reporting   entity   to   determine   if   it   should   consolidate   certain   types   of   legal   entities.   Management   has   adopted   this   accounting
pronouncement.

Note 4.  Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company has incurred (losses) from
inception through June 1, 2008 of ($6,839,714) and further (losses) of ($6,777,536) during the development stage. The Company had
working capital and stockholders’ equity (deficits) of ($7,207,039) and ($28,698,932) at June 30, 2016, respectively, and working
capital and stockholders’ equity (deficits) of ($11,139,399) and ($18,381,953) at March 31, 2016, respectively. The Company is reliant
on raising capital to initiate its business plan. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being able to
secure financing and attain profitable operations.

Note 5.  Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
 
Basic earnings (loss) per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculations are determined by
dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. 
During the periods when they are anti-dilutive, common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered in the computation.

Note 6.  Related Party Transactions
During March 2002, the Company entered into a verbal agreement with a related party, Caravel Management Corp. (“Caravel”), in which
Caravel will provide administrative services on a month-to-month basis.  On January 1, 2009, the Company entered into a written
agreement revising the previous verbal agreement with Caravel.  The agreement provides for administrative services, office rent and
supplies for $7,865 per month.  Subsequently, effective November 1, 2010 the Company revised its agreement with Caravel to provide
administrative services for $3,500 per month. In addition to administrative services, the agreement also provides for office rent and supplies.
Total expenses recognized under this agreement were $10,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
 
On April 21, 2015, the Company entered into a debt settlement and subscription agreement with an officer and director, John Hislop,
whereby the Company agreed to settle a portion of the indebtedness, in the amount of $1,340,000, by allotting and issuing to John
Hislop 134,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a deemed price of $0.01 per share.  On April 24, 2015, the Company
announced that it had issued 134,000,000 shares of its common stock at a deemed price of $0.01 per share to Mr. Hislop.  However,
due to a technical flaw in the process of adopting the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (announced on February 3, 2014),
the Company was only authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of its common stock on April 23, 2015, and the issuance to Mr. Hislop
on April 23, 2015, was therefore void.  On June 29, 2015, the Company sent to its shareholders a proxy statement for a shareholder
meeting to be held July 22, 2015, at which meeting the Company proposed to rectify the technical flaw in its earlier effort to increase
its authorized capital.  On July 28, 2015, we closed the debt settlement agreement and reissued the 134,000,000 shares to Mr. Hislop
pursuant to the debt settlement and subscription agreement which settled a debt to Mr. Hislop equal to $1,340,000 immediately
following shareholder approval of the increase in our authorized capital on July 23, 2015. The shares were valued at $4,690,000
($0.035 per share based upon market price). The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3,350,000 in the year
ended March 31, 2016.
On August 4, 2015, Paltar Nation entered into a secured convertible note purchase agreement with David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust,
pursuant to which Paltar Nation issued a secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $584,000 in consideration for
$584,000.  The secured convertible promissory note bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum (15% per annum on and after the
maturity date or an Event of Default (as defined below)) and matured on August 4, 2016.  The entire unpaid principal sum of the
secured convertible promissory note will become immediately due and payable upon a material breach by (a) Paltar Nation of the
note, another note or the secured convertible note purchase agreement, or (b) Wotan Group Limited, an Australian limited company,
of the pledge agreement, described below, in each case that is not cured within 30 days of such breach (referred to as an “Event of
Default”).
 
David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust is a trust controlled by David N. Siegel, Chairman of the Board and a director of Nation Energy Inc. 
 
As of June 30, 2016, the principal balance of the loan was $584,000 and accrued interest payable of $52,960. The loan was not
repaid on August 4, 2016 and continues to accrue interest at a rate of 15% per annum.
Upon a sale of Paltar Nation’s limited partnership interests (“Interests”) in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
yielding gross cash proceeds to Paltar Nation of at least $20,000,000 (including $584,000 from the sale of the secured convertible
promissory note to David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust) on or before the maturity date (the “Qualified Financing”), the principal and any
accrued but unpaid interest under the note will automatically be converted into Interests.  The Interests to be issued to David N.
Siegel Dynasty Trust upon conversion will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the entire principal amount of the note plus
any accrued but unpaid interest under the note by (ii) 80.00% of the per-Interest price of the Interests sold to persons other than
David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust and other holders of the notes, if any, in the Qualified Financing.
In connection with the secured convertible note purchase agreement, Paltar Nation entered into a pledge agreement dated as of
August 4, 2015 with Wotan Group Limited, pursuant to which Wotan Group Limited pledged to David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust a
continuing first priority security interest in a number of Wotan Group Limited’s shares of Paltar Petroleum Limited equal to five
multiplied by the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts owed under the note and Paltar Nation agreed to pay a
commitment fee to Wotan Group Limited equal to $250,000 from the proceeds of the secured convertible promissory notes upon the
receipt by Paltar Nation of proceeds from the sale of such notes equal to or greater than $2,500,000 in the aggregate and an
additional commitment fee of $250,000 upon conversion of all of such notes.

In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common

Our Current Business
 
We currently have no business and operate as a shell company. We are in the process of evaluating the merits of joint venture opportunities
in the resource sector.  As discussed in Plan of Operation, below, we identified one such opportunity in Australia, which we have been
pursuing for the last few years.  Since 2013, we have focused all of our effort on refining this opportunity in Australia and moving it forward
with the intent to eventually explore the acreage involved, which is located in Northern and Western Australia, for oil and gas, and to exploit
any resource that we find.  Also as discussed in Plan of Operation, below, we have recently signed a series of earning agreements with
respect to this opportunity, and we are now considering our next steps in progressing this opportunity.  We intend to focus all of our attention
and resources on this opportunity for the near term, though we can offer no assurance that we will have any success in our efforts to
progress it or, if we do, that we will discover any oil or gas in commercially exploitable quantities.
Plan of Operation
 
The following is a discussion and analysis of our plan of operation and the factors that could affect our future financial condition. This
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in
this quarterly report.
Following the sale of all of our oil and gas operations effective June 1, 2008, we began to actively seek new oil and gas opportunities.
 On October 11, 2013, we entered into a letter agreement with Paltar Petroleum Limited, an Australian company, pursuant to which
we agreed to acquire four exploration and development permits and twenty-nine applications for exploration and development
permits in respect of prospective acreage located in northern Australia.  On March 31, 2014, we amended this letter agreement
and, on November 27, 2014, we amended and restated the letter agreement to add additional exploration properties and provide
for new closing terms.  On June 13, 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated agreement, replacing in its entirety the
amended and restated agreement dated November 27, 2014. On August 28, 2015, we entered into a third amended and restated
agreement, replacing in its entirety the second amended restated agreement dated June 13, 2015. Also on August 30, 2015, and
pursuant to the terms of the third amended and restated letter agreement (the “Agreement”), Paltar or its wholly-owned subsidiary,

subsidiary of Paltar Nation, to explore and develop all or a portion of 775,292 acres of certain Australian exploration permits.
Pursuant to the first amendment of the third amended and restated agreement, Paltar farmed out three specific graticular blocks in
each of the six petroleum exploration permits identified in the Agreement and it caused Officer Petroleum Pty Ltd., a wholly-owned
Australian subsidiary of Paltar, to farm out forty blocks in Exploration Permit 468 (“EP 468”). In addition, Paltar agreed to enter into
additional earning agreements with Nation Australia on December 31, 2015 (or such other date as the parties mutually agree), in
which it will farm out to Nation Australia six additional graticular blocks selected by Nation in EP136, three additional blocks in
each   of   EP143   and   EP231,   eight   additional   blocks   in   EP234   and   seven   additional   blocks   in   EP237   in   exchange   for   the
consideration specified in each additional earning agreement.
Each of the seven initial earning agreements, all of which are dated August 30, 2015, (six of which are further amended by the
Master Amendment to Six Earning Agreements dated December 28, 2015 but effective as of December 17, 2015 and by the
Second Master Amendment to Six Earning Agreements dated February 9, 2016 but effective as of February 8, 2016, and one of
which is amended by the First Amendment to EP 468 Earning Agreement dated December 28, 2015 but effective as of December
17, 2015 and by the Second Amendment to EP 468 Earning Agreement dated February 9, 2016 but effective as of February 8,
2016) granted certain rights and imposed certain obligations on Nation Australia in respect of the blocks of land described.  In the
aggregate, these blocks of land comprise 1,003,400 acres of the 8,936,800 acres covered by the seven Exploration Permits.  Each
of the seven initial earning agreements follows one of two negotiated templates (depending on whether the underlying interest in
the   Exploration   Permit   is   100%   owned   by   Paltar),   with   variations   in   the   applicable   standard   form   driven   by   the   specific
circumstances   affecting   each   Exploration   Permit.     Each   initial   earning   agreement   contains   general   terms   and   conditions,   a
description of the area covered a list of the encumbrances affecting the area, an amount of money to be paid by Nation Australia
on or before March 31, 2016 (since amended to a later date), and a commitment to pay 100% of the costs under applicable work
programs and budgets.  Paltar will act as the operator subject to overall supervision by an Operating Committee comprised of one
representative from each of Paltar and Nation Australia.  With respect to the initial earning agreements covering the Exploration
Permits for which Paltar does not own a 100% interest, ownership of the Exploration Permits remains with Paltar during the term of
the initial earning agreements, but if Paltar discovers a commercially exploitable accumulation of petroleum on any affected block it
must transfer any production license granted in respect of that discovery to Nation Australia, insofar as it covers blocks subject to
the earning agreement.  In connection with such transfer, Paltar is permitted to retain for itself an overriding royalty equal to the
difference between 25% and all existing royalty burdens applicable to the production license. With respect to the initial earning
agreements covering the Exploration Permits for which Paltar owns a 100% interest, upon Nation Australia spending at least the
Earning Amount specified therein in expenditure before the end of the Earning Period also specified therein, Nation Australia will
acquire   a  beneficial  interest  of  25%  in   the   underlying   Exploration   Permit  and   any  production  license  granted  in   connection
therewith.  If a 25% interest in a production license is acquired by Nation Australia pursuant to these earning agreements, Nation
Australia may, at its option for a period of ninety days thereafter, acquire the remaining 75% interest held by Paltar in exchange for
the grant of an overriding royalty equal to the difference between 25% and all existing royalty burdens applicable to the production
license.

Effective May 31, 2016, all of the initial earning agreements were amended and revised to consolidate and clarify terms of
consideration   thereunder   (the   “May   31,   2016   Earning   Agreements”).   Upon   execution,   Nation   Australia   issued   to   Paltar   a
promissory note in the principal amount of AUD$24,322,501, with payment guaranteed by Nation. As additional consideration, seven
days after delivery to Nation of Paltar’s audited financial statements for the three most recent fiscal years, together with such
additional fiscal period financial statements as may be required for reporting by Nation under applicable SEC regulations, Nation will
issue 900,000,000 of its common shares to Paltar, subject to the same restrictions on the transfer of such shares as set forth in the
third restated letter agreement dated August 30, 2015, as subsequently amended. The May 31, 2016 Earning Agreements have the
same terms as stated above in the initial earning agreements regarding work programs, overriding royalty, and the option to acquire
more interest.
In addition to the seven initial earning agreements, the parties entered into an option agreement dated August 30, 2015, pursuant
to which Paltar granted to Nation an option to purchase, exercisable until August 30, 2016, interests in Exploration Permits EP136,
EP143, EP231, EP232, EP 234 and EP237, all related business, financial, technical, geophysical, geological, geochemical and
environmental information and data that Paltar has the legal right to convey, certain Applications for exploration permits, and all of
the issued and outstanding shares of Officer (collectively, the “Assets”) for a purchase price of AUD$10,000,000 (approximately
$7,223,844 at current exchange rates). The option agreement was amended effective February 12, 2016, to change the purchase
price to 300,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Upon the execution of the May 31, 2016 Earning Agreements, the
option agreement was terminated and released by Nation.
The third amended and restated agreement contemplates that, as stated in the May 31, 2016 Earning Agreements, Nation has
agreed to issue to Paltar, from the Company’s treasury 900,000,000 common shares at an agreed value of $0.03 and one-third
cent per share as consideration for the other transactions described in the third amended and restated agreement.  All of Nation
Energy’s common shares to be issued pursuant to the third amended and restated agreement are to be held in escrow for at least
three years.  The escrow agent is to be a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company with a board of four managers.  David
Siegel, and John Hislop are each currently a director of the Company; each have certain rights to appoint managers to the escrow
agent’s board of managers, as more specifically set forth in the third amended and restated agreement.  Marc Bruner also has
rights to appoint managers to the escrow agent’s board of managers, as more specifically set forth in the third amended and
restated agreement. Each of Messrs. Siegel and Bruner currently own Paltar equity, while Mr. Hislop has the right to acquire Paltar
equity.  A fourth director of the Company, who has yet to be identified and appointed and who will not own any Paltar equity, is to
serve as the fourth manager of the escrow agent’s board of managers.  Each of the four managers will hold one vote and Mr.
Bruner, or the manager elected by the board of managers in the event Mr. Bruner no longer serves on the board of managers, will
hold a tie-breaking vote in the event of deadlock.

The Agreement also provides that Paltar, which will be the operator under the earning agreements, will have the right of first offer
to provide goods, services and work to the blocks subject to the earning agreements on terms that are competitive with and
comparable to those customarily available in the open market from arms-length third parties.
On September 15, 2015, Mr. Hislop resigned from the offices of President and Chief Executive Officer of our Company, and he
also resigned the position of Chairman of our Board of Directors.  Mr. Hislop remains a member of our Board of Directors and our
Chief Financial Officer.  Also on September 15, 2015, our Board of Directors appointed David N. Siegel as its Chairman and it
appointed Marc A. Bruner, one of our Directors, to the office of President and Chief Executive Officer of our Company.
On June 24, 2016, Mr. Bruner resigned as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer,
effective as of March 15, 2016, Also on June 24, 2016, effective as of March 15, 2016, Mr. Hislop resumed the duties of President
and Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis.
We   currently   have   no   business   and   operate   as   a   shell   company.     In   addition   to   our   efforts   to   complete   the   transactions
contemplated in the third amended and restated agreement with Paltar Petroleum, we continue to evaluate the merits of other
opportunities in the resource sector.
 
Cash Requirements During the Next Twelve Months
Over the next twelve months, we intend to use funds to evaluate new business acquisitions, as follows:
Estimated Funding Required During the Next Twelve Months

We have suffered recurring losses from operations.  The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon our company
attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. Management's plan in this regard is to raise
additional capital through a debt or an equity offering.  The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recovery and
classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our company
discontinue operations.
Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses noted above, in their report on the annual financial statements
for the year ended March 31, 2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to
continue as a going concern.  Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this
disclosure by our independent auditors.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of exploration, and, finally achieving a
profitable level of operations.  The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of
our current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations.  We are pursuing various
financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements.  There can be no assurance that additional financing will
be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.  If we are not able to obtain the
additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other
obligations as they become due.  In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Disclosure of Outstanding Share Data
As of August 22, 2016 we had 150,020,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  We do not have any warrants, options or
shares of any other class issued and outstanding as of the date of this quarterly report.

We generated a net (loss) of ($424,804) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net (loss) of ($97,563) for the three
months ended June 30, 2015.  This increased loss is primarily due to increased legal fees, consulting fees and office expenses pertaining to
the Paltar Agreements. Net (loss) per common share for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was ($0.003) compared to ($0.007) per
common share for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  General and administrative expenses increased to $328,225 during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 from $49,170 during the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to increased legal
fees of $67,789, consulting and management fees of $160,735 and rent of $30,000  pertaining to the Paltar Agreements in the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to legal fees of $24,387, $nil consulting fees and $nil rent in 2015.
 
Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $102,772 compared to $48,393 for the three months ended June 30,
2015.  The increase was primarily due to the new promissory note issued to Paltar Petroleum Limited in May 2016 described above under
the heading “Plan of Operation”.
 
We reported a foreign currency translation gain of $6,193 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a $nil for the three
months ended June 30, 2015.  This is due to transaction gains resulting from loans denominated in CAD. There were no transaction gains
during the three months ended June 30, 2015.

General and administrative expenses increased to $328,225 in the three month period ended June 30, 2016 from $49,170 in the three
month period ended June 30, 2015.  General expenses include administration fees which remained the same as the comparative three
month period.  Office expenses and Management Information System fees increased to $6,811 in the three month period ended June 30,
2016 from $238. This increase is primarily due to travel and entertainment expenses of $5,574 in the three month period ended June 30,
2016 compared to $nil in 2015.  Management fees were $60,000 in the three month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to $nil in 2015.
This is due to a Management Services Agreement between the Company and Carmen J. Lotito. Legal fees increased to $67,789 in the
three month period ended June 30, 2015 from $24,387 during the prior fiscal year due to increased legal fees relating to the Paltar
Agreement and subsequent amendments. Rent was $30,000 for the Denver office in the three month period ended June 30, 2016
compared to $nil in 2015. Filing fees and transfer agent fees increased to $10,390 in the three month period ended June 30, 2016
compared to $7,545 in the three month period ended June 30, 2015. Accounting fees increased to $42,000 from $6,500 in the comparative
three month period. The increase is primarily due to accounting fees incurred as a result of the Paltar transaction.

Loans Payable
 
On April 21, 2015, we entered into a debt settlement and subscription agreement with our chief financial officer and director, John
Hislop whereby we agreed to settle a portion of the indebtedness, in the amount of $1,340,000, by allotting and issuing to John Hislop
134,000,000 shares of our common stock at a deemed price of $0.01 per share.  On April 24, 2015, we announced that we had
issued 134,000,000 shares of our common stock at a deemed price of $0.01 per share to Mr. Hislop.  However, due to a technical
flaw in the process of adopting the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation (announced on February 3, 2014), we were only
authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of our common stock on April 23, 2015, and the issuance to Mr. Hislop on April 23, 2015, was
therefore void.  On June 29, 2015, we sent to our shareholders a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting to be held July 22, 2015,
at which meeting we proposed to rectify the technical flaw in our earlier effort to increase our authorized capital.  On July 28, 2015,
we closed the debt settlement agreement and reissued the 134,000,000 shares to Mr. Hislop pursuant to the debt settlement and
subscription agreement which settled a debt to Mr. Hislop equal to $1,340,000 immediately following shareholder approval of the
increase in our authorized capital on July 23, 2015. The shares were valued at $4,690,000 ($0.035 per share based upon market
price). The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3,350,000 during the year-ended March 31, 2016.
As of August 4, 2015, Paltar Nation Limited Partnership (“Paltar Nation”) entered into a secured convertible note purchase agreement
with David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust dated November 16, 2015 (the “2015 Secured Note Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which
Paltar Nation issued a secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $584,000 in consideration for $584,000.  The
secured convertible promissory note bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum (15% per annum on and after the maturity date or
an Event of Default (as defined below)) and matures on August 4, 2016.  The entire unpaid principal sum of the secured convertible
promissory note will become immediately due and payable upon a material breach by (a) Paltar Nation of the note, another note or
the 2015 Secured Note Purchase Agreement, or (b) Wotan Group Limited, an Australian limited company, of the Wotan Pledge,
described below, in each case that is not cured within 30 days of such breach (referred to as an “Event of Default”).
The 2015 Secured Note Purchase Agreement also contemplates sales of additional secured convertible promissory notes up to an
aggregate maximum of $5,000,000 (including the initial $584,000 sale to David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust dated November 16, 2015). 
The secured convertible promissory note issued to Michael B. Cox, described below, has been issued pursuant to the 2015 Secured

Upon a sale of Paltar Nation’s limited partnership interests (“Interests”) in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
yielding gross cash proceeds to Paltar Nation of at least $20,000,000 (including $584,000 from the sale of the secured convertible
promissory note to David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust dated November 16, 2015 and including $100,000 from the sale of the secured
convertible promissory note to Michael B. Cox) on or before the maturity dates of the notes (the “Qualified Financing”), the principal
and any accrued but unpaid interest under the notes will automatically be converted into Interests.  The Interests to be issued to
David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust dated November 16, 2015 upon conversion will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
entire principal amount of the note plus any accrued but unpaid interest under the note by (ii) 80.00% of the per-Interest price of the
Interests sold to persons other than David N. Siegel Dynasty Trust dated November 16, 2015 and other holders of the notes, if any, in
the Qualified Financing.
In connection with the secured convertible note purchase agreement, Paltar Nation entered into a pledge agreement dated as of
August 4, 2015 with Wotan Group Limited (the “Wotan Pledge”), pursuant to which Wotan Group Limited pledged to each of David N.
Siegel Dynasty Trust dated November 16, 2015 and any future secured noteholders pursuant to the 2015 Secured Note Purchase
Agreement (of which Michael B. Cox is one) a continuing first priority security interest in a number of Wotan Group Limited’s shares of
Paltar Petroleum Limited equal to five multiplied by the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amounts owed under each
noteholder’s respective note and Paltar Nation agreed to pay a commitment fee to Wotan Group Limited equal to $250,000 from the
proceeds of the secured convertible promissory notes upon the receipt by Paltar Nation of proceeds from the sale of such notes equal
to or greater than $2,500,000 in the aggregate and an additional commitment fee of $250,000 upon conversion of all of such notes.
 
As of June 30, 2016, the principal balance of the loan was $584,000 and accrued interest payable of $52,960. The loan was not

Going Concern
 
The unaudited financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our
company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  Our company
has incurred losses since inception in excess of $13 million and has only generated modest profitable operations when we commenced gas
production in fiscal 2006.  We have relied solely on shareholder advances to participate and continue operations.
 
Our company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being able to secure financing and attain profitable operations.  Our
company is currently evaluating business opportunities and will require financing for acquisition of any new business venture. 
  
Net cash (used in) operating activities in the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled ($397,867) versus cash (used in) operating activities
of ($14,839) in the three months ended June 30, 2015.  Cash balances were $427,349 and $1,334 as of June 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016, respectively. Our company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being able to secure financing and attain
profitable operations.
We have a limited operating history.  We can only estimate the future needs for capital based on the current status of our operations, our
current plans and current economic condition.  Due to the uncertainties regarding our future activities, we are unable to predict precisely
what amount will be used for any particular purpose.

Future Financings
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash of $427,349.  We currently do not have sufficient funds to acquire and develop any opportunities,
including the opportunity presented by the third amended and restated agreement with Paltar Petroleum.  Paltar Nation was formed for
the purpose of funding exploration expenditures required to be provided by the wholly-owned subsidiary of Nation Energy Inc., Nation
Energy (Australia) Pty Ltd., which is expected to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paltar Nation, to explore and develop all or a portion
of 775,292 acres of certain Australian exploration permits. We also anticipate continuing to rely on shareholder loans or equity sales of our
common stock in order to fund our business operations.   Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. 
There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity or arrange for more debt or other financing to fund any future
activities.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not Applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as define in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company in
reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our company’s management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the
presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies
with small staff:
1.     Insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel. During the three months
ended June 30, 2016, we had limited staff that performed nearly all aspects of our financial reporting process, including, but
not limited to, access to the underlying accounting records and systems, the ability to post and record journal entries and
responsibility for the preparation of the financial statement. This creates certain incompatible duties and lack of review over
the   financial   reporting   process   that   would   likely   result   in   a   failure   to   detect   errors   in   spreadsheets,   calculations,   or
assumptions   used   to   compile   the   financial   statements   and   related   disclosures   as   filed   with   the   SEC.   These   control
deficiencies could result in a material misstatement of our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented
or detected; and
2.     Lack of proper recording and analysis of accounting matters. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we reclassed
certain amounts between subsidiaries in order to accurately account for transactions on the entity level. The impact upon
consolidation was immaterial.
We intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies. We intend to
consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our year-end assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting.
In addition, subject to receipt of additional financing, we intend to undertake the below remediation measures to address the material
weaknesses described in this report. Such remediation activities include the following:
1.              We intend to continue to update the documentation of our corporate governance and internal control processes,
including formal risk assessment of our financial reporting processes.
2.       We intend to evaluate transactions quarterly to ensure accurate accounting at the entity level.
It should be noted that a control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can
occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of internal control is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
