</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
submits the present report in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 16/2. 
She focuses on the links between stigma and the human rights framework as it relates to 
water and sanitation. She has found that stigma, as a deeply entrenched social and 
cultural phenomenon, lies at the root of many human rights violations and results in 
entire population groups being disadvantaged and excluded. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur seeks to convey an understanding of stigma and to 
elucidate its drivers. She links stigma explicitly to water, sanitation and hygiene before 
examining different manifestations of stigma. She situates stigma in the human rights 
framework considering, in particular, human dignity, the human rights to water, 
sanitation, non-discrimination and equality, the prohibition of degrading treatment, and 
the right to privacy. Based on this analysis, the Special Rapporteur seeks to identify 
appropriate strategies for preventing and responding to stigma from a human rights 
perspective, before concluding with a set of recommendations. She emphasizes that 
States cannot fully realize the human rights to water and sanitation without addressing 
stigma as a root cause of discrimination and other human rights violations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 16/2. It 
is focused on the links between stigma and the human rights framework as it relates to 
water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly encountered incidences of lack of access to 
water and sanitation, where people in particular groups are systematically neglected 
compared to the rest of society. Those in power appear to be indifferent to their problems, 
or in the worst case, to be under pressure from society as a whole not to take any measures 
to improve service provision. Decision makers at times deploy stigma to &#8213;justify&#8214; their lack 
of political will to provide access to services for the marginalized, favouring policies that 
are popular in the broader society. The Special Rapporteur has been confronted with 
reluctance by decision makers to take action to overcome such neglect or exclusion, 
prompting her to examine these situations systematically.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur has found that stigma, as a deeply entrenched sociocultural 
phenomenon, lies at the root of many human rights violations, resulting in entire population 
groups being disadvantaged. It is so engrained that marked cases of human rights violations 
are perceived as &#8213;acceptable&#8214;. The Special Rapporteur seeks to shed light on the impact of 
stigma as the cause of neglect and exclusion in the enjoyment of the rights to water and 
sanitation and to explore recommendations for policymaking and appropriate solutions to 
address, prevent and respond to such human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>4. Stigma and discrimination are closely interrelated; they reinforce and legitimize 
each other. Stigma often lies at the root of discrimination; it is an antecedent to and a 
rationale for discrimination. It provides a &#8213;justification&#8214;, so that discrimination is seen as 
natural, necessary and desirable. Stigma plays an insidious role in making systemic 
discrimination possible. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
found that &#8213;discrimination against some groups is pervasive and persistent and deeply 
</p>
<p>entrenched in social behaviour and organization&#8214;.1  
</p>
<p>5. Stigma gives rise not only to discrimination, but also to a range of other human 
rights violations, both of economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political 
rights, underscoring the indivisibility of all human rights. Where people are excluded from 
the use of facilities, where they find themselves unable to access public toilets and have no 
alternatives, or where people are threatened with violence and fear for their physical and 
mental integrity, this may result in violations of the human rights to water and sanitation 
and other related rights, inter alia, the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment or 
the right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>6. Identifying human rights violations as rooted in stigma demands an exploration of 
the origins of discrimination and other human rights violations. To start, speaking openly 
about what seems &#8213;unmentionable&#8214; can act as an eye-opener, precisely because stigma is 
instrumental in propagating silence and imposing a culture of invisibility and shame, 
allowing human rights violations to continue unabated and with impunity. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur is aware that carelessly reporting attributes assigned to 
individuals and groups may, in fact, unintentionally further entrench the stigma wielded 
against them. To mitigate this risk, she uses quotation marks whenever she refers to such 
</p>
<p>  
 1  General comment No. 20 (2009) on non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>para. 12. </p>


<p>ascribed characteristics. Moreover, she believes that the benefits of speaking openly about 
the experience of stigma far outweigh these concerns. She considers it necessary to tackle 
the very topics masked by stigma, which are seen as uncomfortable or taboo.   
</p>
<p>8. At the same time, the focus on stigma limits the scope of the report. The report does 
not cover all groups that are disadvantaged in terms of access to water and sanitation. There 
are other, often heinous, forms of discrimination and other human rights violations that 
disadvantage certain individuals and groups. Indirect discrimination is also prohibited, that 
is, discriminatory actions that are not based on stigma, prejudices or stereotypes, but simply 
have an unintended discriminatory effect. Other forms of discrimination may be direct and 
deliberate, while not being based on stigma. The Special Rapporteur addresses many such 
situations in other areas of her work, but in the present report she focuses on violations of 
the human rights to water and sanitation emanating from stigmatization, enabling her to 
conduct a detailed analysis and identify appropriate response measures. 
</p>
<p>9. The scope of the report is guided by the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s mandate: the human 
right to water and sanitation. Hence, it covers some experiences and manifestations of 
stigma rather than all dimensions of people&#8216;s lives. The issues highlighted are only a few 
along a continuum of human rights concerns that stigmatized people face. Still, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that exploring the impacts of stigma through the lens of water, 
sanitation and hygiene highlights its pervasive nature in preventing people from leading a 
life in dignity. 
</p>
<p>10. To approach this work, the Special Rapporteur engaged in a wide consultative 
process, including an expert consultation held in Geneva in January 2012 with key 
individuals speaking on their own experience of stigma, civil society organizations, 
academia, international organizations and independent consultants. She also held a public 
consultation attended by over 80 participants, including more than 50 State delegations, and 
received about 50 written contributions. 2  These discussions have provided her with 
valuable guidance in preparing the present report, and she is grateful to all those who 
contributed. She also expresses her gratitude to the numerous people she has met over the 
past four years who have enabled her to understand the amplitude and dimensions of 
stigma.  
</p>
<p>11. In the report, the Special Rapporteur first seeks to convey an understanding of 
stigma and to elucidate its drivers. She links stigma explicitly to water, sanitation and 
hygiene before examining different manifestations of stigma. She situates stigma in the 
human rights framework considering, in particular, human dignity, the human rights to 
water and sanitation and other related rights, such as non-discrimination and equality, the 
prohibition of degrading treatment and the right to privacy. Based on this analysis, the 
Special Rapporteur seeks to identify appropriate strategies for preventing and responding to 
stigma, and concludes with a set of recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Understanding stigma and its drivers 
</b></p>
<p>12. Stigma relates closely to power and inequality, and those with power can deploy it at 
will. Stigma can broadly be understood as a process of dehumanizing, degrading, 
discrediting and devaluing people in certain population groups, often based on a feeling of 
disgust. Put differently, there is a perception that &#8213;the person with the stigma is not quite 
</p>

<p>human&#8214;. 3  Stigma attaches itself to an attribute, quality or identity that is regarded as 
&#8213;inferior&#8214; or &#8213;abnormal&#8214;. Stigma is based on a socially constructed &#8213;us&#8214; and &#8213;them&#8214; 
serving to confirm the &#8213;normalcy&#8214; of the majority through the devaluation of the &#8213;other&#8214;.4 
</p>
<p>13. What is considered &#8213;abnormal&#8214; changes over time and place, while the targets of 
stigma are always those who do not fit the &#8213;social norm&#8214;. In some instances, stigma is 
attached to a person&#8216;s social identity, especially in relation to one&#8216;s gender or gender 
</p>
<p>identity, sexual orientation, caste or race. Many ethnic groups experience very pronounced 
stigma. Stigma is also a common reaction to health conditions such as HIV/AIDS and some 
forms of disabilities. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explicitly 
calls on States to &#8213;adopt measures to address widespread stigmatization of persons on the 
basis of their health status, such as mental illness, diseases such as leprosy and women who 
have suffered obstetric fistula&#8214;.5 Indeed, stigma is often closely linked to the body as a site 
of the &#8213;normal&#8214; and the &#8213;different&#8214; and as a vehicle of contagion, especially in terms of 
sexuality and disease. Furthermore, stigma is frequently attached to activities that are 
considered &#8213;immoral&#8214;, &#8213;detrimental to society&#8214; or &#8213;dirty&#8214;, affecting, for instance, sex 
workers, sanitation workers, prisoners and homeless people. 
</p>
<p>14. In many instances, stigma is compound, multiple or intersectional, meaning that a 
single person can possess different attributes to which stigma are attached, such as in the 
case of an ex-prisoner who is homeless. Individuals experiencing compound stigma are 
often the ones who are most marginalized and discriminated against. The concept of 
intersectionality recognizes that individuals have multiple identities, attributes and 
behaviours, and that the intersections of these multiple aspects give shape to experiences of 
stigmatization and discrimination. Individuals falling into a particular category do not all 
inhabit the same social positions.  
</p>
<p>15. People who are stigmatized can find it is almost impossible to escape the stigma. 
Similarly, some may experience stigma by association, that is, extending beyond a person 
with a particular attribute. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
found that people may be discriminated against by being associated with or by being 
perceived as part of a particular group.6 For example, during her mission to Bangladesh, the 
Special Rapporteur found that the occupation as &#8213;sweeper&#8214; is passed down through 
generations and that people in that occupation feel &#8213;trapped&#8214; (A/HRC/15/55 and Corr.1, 
paras. 26, 75 and 76). 
</p>
<p>16. At a fundamental level, stigma reflects unequal power. Power can be about the 
ability to define standards of what is &#8213;normal&#8214; and &#8213;acceptable&#8214;. Stigma can be created to 
the detriment of some, while being to the &#8213;benefit&#8214; of others. It is not only those at the top 
of any societal hierarchy who stigmatize. Stigma is deeply entrenched in any society and 
plays out within particular groups, as no group has a monolithic identity. Stigma can be 
deployed wilfully and strategically, and perpetuates patterns of inequality. It is an element 
of the structural and social dynamics which (re)produce unequal power relations. 
</p>
<p>17. Power relationships result in the marginalization and exclusion of certain groups and 
individuals from decision-making processes, access to resources and services, and the 
ability to shape social life. Stigma supplies the world view for marginalization by 
&#8213;legitimizing&#8214; the process of setting up and perpetuating an &#8213;us and them&#8214; divide, and 
through the devaluation and dehumanization of those seen as being outside the &#8213;us&#8214;.

 5  General comment No. 20, para. 33. 
 6  Ibid., para. 16. </p>


<p>18. Understanding how stigma relates to social power, marginalization and exclusion 
also reveals the drivers of stigma, which lie in the individual, social, cultural and 
institutional spheres. Individuals across society contribute to the creation and continuation 
of stigma. Often, prejudices and stereotypes persist across generations, and are combined 
with irrational fears&#8212;of contagion, &#8213;impurity&#8214; or &#8213;otherness&#8214;. This is frequently 
exacerbated by a lack of access to accurate information, for example on the transmission of 
diseases. In many instances, people are not aware that they are stigmatizing certain groups, 
since their stereotypes are widely prevalent in society, considered &#8213;normal&#8214; and 
&#8213;acceptable&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>19. Stigma can also be felt as personal shame, guilt and embarrassment, referred to as 
internalized stigma. It manifests itself in self-exclusion from services or opportunities, low 
self-esteem, negative self-perceptions, social withdrawal, and fear of disclosure of one&#8216;s 
stigmatized status.   
</p>
<p>20. Stigma also has its drivers at the societal level with, for instance, the media 
contributing to spreading prejudices and stereotypes. It is also driven by deeply entrenched 
cultural beliefs relating, for instance, to gender, sexuality, health and descent. Caste systems 
are striking examples of systems that lead to the stigmatization of large parts of the 
population, potentially amounting to violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>21. These drivers of stigma in the individual, social and cultural spheres find their 
reflection at the institutional, structural and policy levels. Politicians often win votes by 
proposing populist policies reflecting public attitudes. Instead of combating stigma, 
legislative, policy and institutional frameworks may reflect stigmatizing attitudes, further 
entrenching stigma by institutionalizing, formalizing and legitimizing it.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Stigma and its links to water, sanitation and hygiene 
</b></p>
<p>22. Stigmatization often results in lack of access to water and sanitation and poor 
hygiene standards. The lack of access to essential services is a symptom, while the root 
causes lie in stigmatization. Only through an understanding of these causes will it be 
possible to implement effective measures to improve access to services. Stigma is often 
closely linked to perceptions of uncleanliness, untouchability and contagion. In many 
instances, stigmatized people are perceived as &#8213;dirty&#8214;, &#8213;filthy&#8214; and &#8213;smelly&#8214;, affecting for 
instance homeless populations, menstruating women and girls, Roma communities, Dalits 
or women suffering from obstetric fistula.7 Individuals who find themselves stigmatized 
because of the perception that they are &#8213;dirty&#8214; or &#8213;contagious&#8214; may be socially ostracized 
and be denied access to water, sanitation and hygiene services, hence reinforcing the 
stereotype of uncleanliness and prolonging a vicious circle. It is not their inherent condition 
to live in filthy and poor conditions; it is a position imposed by society that uses stigma as a 
tool to create, perpetuate and justify marginalization and inequality. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Manifestations of stigma 
</b></p>
<p>23. Stigma manifests itself in different ways, combining ostracism, abandonment, 
shunning, rejection, isolation, exclusion, bullying, discrediting, blaming, harassment, 
</p>
<p>  
 7  Obstetric fistula is a medical term which refers to a hole which develops either between a woman&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>rectum and vagina, or between a woman&#8216;s vagina and bladder (or both), as a result of obstructed 
</p>
<p>labour, resulting in constant urinary and/or faecal incontinence. See World Health Organization 
(WHO), &#8213;10 facts on obstetric fistula&#8214; (2010). </p>


<p>physical violence, among many others, but fundamentally all these manifestations relate 
back to the process of devaluing and dehumanizing individuals in certain groups and 
creating an &#8213;us and them&#8214; divide. Different people experience stigma in different ways, and 
the extent to which certain manifestations apply differs. The examples mentioned are for 
illustrative purposes only. They are not meant to imply that particular groups experience 
stigma exclusively in one way or another, or that other manifestations would relate only to 
other groups.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Rendering people and their needs invisible 
</b></p>
<p>24. Stigma has a perverse effect of silencing. It creates taboos and results in issues not 
being addressed. Stigma renders some people and their needs invisible in society. For 
instance, denying the practice of &#8213;untouchability&#8214; and the resulting silence that surrounds it 
is part of the stigma. Similarly, millions of people suffer from neglected tropical diseases,8 
particularly the poorest in isolated rural areas. For the most part they are invisible in public 
health planning, research and treatment. Several of these diseases are linked to poor water 
and sanitation conditions, and have traditionally been a source of stigma and isolation. The 
fact that stigma is often internalized further contributes to the silencing effect by preventing 
people from bringing up certain issues due to their acceptance of the stigma. This silence 
results in denial that human rights violations exist&#8212;they are not seen, thought about or 
addressed.  
</p>
<p>25. The silence and stigma surrounding menstruation makes finding solutions for 
menstrual hygiene management a low priority. Menstruating women and girls often lack a 
private place to change or wash the rags used. Menstruation has many negative cultural 
attitudes associated with it, including the idea that menstruating women and girls are 
&#8213;contaminated&#8214;, &#8213;dirty&#8214;, &#8213;impure&#8214; or &#8213;polluted&#8214;. These manifest in practices such as the 
seclusion of women and girls, reduced mobility, dietary restrictions, and/or women and 
girls being required to use different water sources or prohibited from preparing food for 
others during menstruation&#8212;practices that are often deeply rooted in sociocultural and 
patriarchal interpretations of religious prescriptions. Even where such restrictions are not 
followed, women and girls may continue to harbour internalized stigma and are 
embarrassed to discuss menstruation. The lack of privacy for cleaning and washing, the fear 
of staining and smelling, and the lack of hygiene in school toilets are major reasons for 
being absent from school during menstruation, and have a negative impact on girls&#8216; right to 
education.9  
</p>
<p>26. The invisibility created by stigma also has negative impacts on the situation of some 
persons with disabilities. The World Health Organization estimates that over 1 billion 
people worldwide live with some kind of physical, mental, intellectual or sensory 
impairment.10 However, due to the silence and shame created by stigma, persons with 
disabilities and their needs are often rendered invisible, making it impossible for them to 
enjoy a range of human rights, as most practices, services and facilities are biased against 
them. In some societies, persons with disabilities are perceived as &#8213;problems to be fixed&#8214; or 
as a &#8213;burden&#8214;. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, in extreme 
cases, children and adults with mental disabilities have literally been tied up inside the 
home&#8212;with no access to sanitation&#8212;to hide them from the community.    
</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Road Map for Implementation</i> (Geneva, 2012).

</i></p>

 10 WHO, <i>World Report on Disability</i> (Geneva, 2011), p. 29. </p>


<p>27. Some older persons might also face stigma, in particular when suffering dementia or 
other mental illnesses and requiring care, including for their sanitation and hygiene needs. 
Incontinence is not uncommon, but usually not openly addressed. Again, stigma can 
contribute to making the particular needs of older persons invisible, preventing the care 
they require and isolating them. 
</p>
<p>28. The silencing effect of stigma is pronounced in relation to prisoners, who are often 
forgotten and neglected. Prison conditions, including concerning water and sanitation, are 
notoriously substandard in many parts of the world. The Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has noted that in many 
countries &#8213;authorities simply do not regard it as their responsibility to provide detainees 
with the most basic services necessary for survival, let alone for a dignified existence or ... 
an &#8215;adequate standard of living&#8216; &#8214; (A/64/215 and Corr.1, para. 43). In one country he found 
that &#8213;it is the task of [the detainees&#8216;] families to bring them water in plastic bottles and food 
in plastic bags. Since there are no toilets, they must use the same bottles to urinate and the 
plastic bags to defecate&#8214; (ibid.). In another country he was confronted with &#8213;detainees 
[using] the water in the toilets for drinking&#8214; (ibid., para. 44). There is often a perception 
that prisoners &#8213;deserve&#8214; inadequate services and that scarce resources should not be used to 
improve prison conditions. The stigmatization of prisoners results in low priority given to 
their needs and a failure to meet basic human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Pushing people to the margins of society 
</b></p>
<p>29. Stigma is also manifest in the rejection, avoidance and marginalization of certain 
groups, quite literally pushing people to the margins of society. Racist and similar attitudes 
demean, degrade and dehumanize groups of people because of their racial, ethnic, religious, 
linguistic or caste identity. Many racial and ethnic groups or castes experience stigma, 
including indigenous peoples, pastoralists, (semi-)nomadic tribes such as the Bedouins, 
persons with albinism, Roma in Europe and Dalits in South Asia. They may suffer from 
pervasive negative stereotyping, social exclusion and denial of fundamental human rights. 
In some instances, people are forced to live at the outskirts of cities and villages, sometimes 
being relocated to more remote areas, subjected to an &#8213;out of sight, out of mind&#8214; attitude. 
</p>
<p>30. In some situations, indigenous peoples may be stigmatized as &#8213;primitive&#8214; and 
pursuing an &#8213;uncivilized&#8214; lifestyle. In her missions to Costa Rica and to the United States 
of America, the Special Rapporteur observed that indigenous communities are 
disproportionately excluded from access to water and sanitation. 11 Similarly, pastoralist 
communities and (semi-)nomadic tribes are often neglected in terms of access to services.12 
State policies may seek to &#8213;civilize&#8214; indigenous, pastoralist or nomadic communities, 
pushing them to live on reserves or in urban slums, with substandard water and sanitation 
services even in these areas, highlighting how attitudes, stigmatization and public policies 
mutually reinforce each other to the detriment of these communities.  
</p>
<p>31. The situation is similar for many ethnic groups across the globe. Access to water and 
sanitation for Roma is notoriously precarious. It is not uncommon for Roma communities, 
including those living in countries where non-Roma communities have universal access to 
water and sanitation, to lack even rudimentary access, as found by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Reports of the Special Rapporteur on her missions to Costa Rica (A/HRC/12/24/Add.1 and Corr.1), 
</p>
<p>para. 48, and to the United States (A/HRC/18/33/Add.4), paras. 61-69. 
 12 See, for example, Sharmila Murthy and Mark Williams, &#8213;The complicated nature of stigma: realizing 
</p>
<p>the human rights to water and sanitation for Bedouins in the Negev, Israel&#8214;, submission to the Special 
Rapporteur. </p>


<p>during her mission to Slovenia (A/HRC/18/33/Add.2, paras. 33-36). This situation 
highlights one of the insidious qualities of stigma: it has a self-fulfilling and circular nature. 
Roma are stereotyped as being &#8213;dirty&#8214;, &#8213;smelly&#8214; and &#8213;unclean&#8214; while being denied access 
to water and sanitation. Sometimes, well-meant interventions can reinforce their 
stigmatization. Reportedly, some municipalities in Eastern Europe have implemented 
shower programmes in schools, encouraging Roma children to take a shower before 
entering the classroom&#8212;with the unintended effect of identifying them as being too &#8213;dirty&#8214; 
to receive education and as such further entrenching their stigmatization.13  
</p>
<p>32. Similarly, caste systems are closely related to stigma and patterns of human rights 
violations. Caste systems across the world are deeply rooted in social segregation, based on 
ideas of purity and pollution and lending traditional &#8213;legitimacy&#8214; to discrimination. The 
International Dalit Solidarity Network underlines that Dalits &#8213;are considered &#8215;lesser human 
beings&#8216;, &#8215;impure&#8216; and &#8215;polluting&#8216; to other caste groups. They are known to be &#8215;untouchable&#8216; 
</p>
<p>and subjected to so-called &#8215;untouchability practices&#8216; in both public and private spheres&#8214;.14 
</p>
<p>In terms of water and sanitation provision, Dalit habitations are often systematically 
excluded (A/HRC/15/55 and Corr.1, para. 76). 
</p>
<p>33. Dalits are regularly forced into the most menial, socially degrading, dirty and 
hazardous jobs. Some Dalits, in particular women, work as manual scavengers or sweepers; 
the terminology varies across countries, but generally refers to those who clean faeces from 
dry toilets.15 As a result of their direct contact with human faeces, manual scavengers suffer 
from a range of health problems (A/HRC/15/55 and Corr.1, para. 75) that are for the most 
part left untreated and add further to their stigmatization. Manual scavengers and sweepers 
suffer extreme forms of social exclusion, even within their own caste. These practices are 
not only deeply rooted in society, but also institutionalized through State practice, with 
municipalities themselves employing sweepers (ibid.). Moreover, patterns of stigmatization 
are perpetuated in schools, being reflected in the nature of cleaning duties, namely, through 
the assignment of toilet cleaning to the &#8213;lower&#8214; castes.16 Instead of breaking caste barriers, 
teachers perpetuate stigmatization, limiting the rights of young people to be free from 
discrimination and to access education. 
</p>
<p>34. All over the world, toilets are associated with dirt, disease and disgust, and an 
occupation in this field correlates with lower social status. Sanitation workers are often 
insulted and attacked when carrying out their work and in some places are forced to work at 
night to conceal the nature of their tasks. Although sanitation workers in developed 
countries do not perform unhygienic work to the same extent, benefiting from protective 
gear and advanced sanitation systems, they also often face disrespect and rejection. 17 
Undocumented migrant workers often carry out jobs that no one else wants to do, such as 
sanitation work, and may lack the protections that apply to the working conditions of the 
formal work force. 
</p>
<p>35. People living in poverty, homeless persons, pavement dwellers, street children and 
slum dwellers also face stigmatization and are frequently forced to exist at the margins of 
society. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has found that a person&#8216;s

<p>social and economic situation when living in poverty or being homeless may result in 
pervasive discrimination, stigmatization and negative stereotyping, which can lead to 
unequal access to services.18 People living in poverty face a range of barriers in accessing 
water and sanitation services, including a perception that they are to be blamed for their 
poverty and do not deserve adequate services. Homeless people and street children are 
frequently blamed for their homelessness, and labelled as &#8213;mentally deficient&#8214;, &#8213;criminals&#8214; 
or &#8213;addicts&#8214;. Children living in dilapidated surroundings&#8212;without a social safety net, and 
without access to safe water and sanitation&#8212;may see those surroundings as a reflection of 
their own self-worth,19 hence growing up with low self-esteem and embarrassment. Slums 
and informal settlements are often not taken into account in urban planning. People living 
in slums are often simply absent from official records and urban plans; there is a perception 
that &#8213;they do not count&#8214;, once again highlighting the dehumanizing nature of stigma. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Excluding people from facilities 
</b></p>
<p>36. Stigma often manifests itself in exclusion from social gatherings or everyday 
activities. Many people affected by stigma also experience the impact of stigma in their 
access to shared or common water and sanitation facilities. Reportedly, Dalits have been 
unable to collect water from shared wells or have been fined for drinking from a common 
water tap, and Dalit women have reportedly had to wait in a separate queue until non-Dalits 
have fetched water. Large-scale violence and physical attacks by members of the dominant 
caste have been reported where Dalits attempted to access facilities in areas inhabited by 
the dominant caste.20 Similarly, people living with HIV/AIDS have sometimes been locked 
out of communal latrines or water taps by their neighbours.21  
</p>
<p>37. Excluding people from water and sanitation facilities creates a vicious circle of 
further entrenching stigmatization. For instance, not providing homeless persons with the 
opportunity to use public facilities forces them to resort to urinating and defecating in 
public, without being afforded any privacy. In being so exposed, people are stigmatized 
even further. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Ostracism within </b>one&#8217;s<b> own family 
</b></p>
<p>38. Stigmatization is not limited to the public sphere. For instance, many people living 
with HIV/AIDS face stigmatization within their families. Similarly, women with obstetric 
fistula are often stigmatized, due to the leaking of urine and sometimes faeces, resulting in a 
constant wetness and foul odour. The stigma associated with fistula demonstrates how 
closely the external and internalized dimensions of stigma are intertwined. Women 
suffering from fistula are often deserted by their family and friends while also feeling 
ashamed and disgraced; they often &#8213;eat alone, sleep alone, and pray alone&#8214;.22 Lack of 
access to water and sanitation worsens the situation and reinforces the stigma against such 
women, who need to wash and bathe more frequently.

<p><b> E. Threats to privacy and security 
</b></p>
<p>39. Stigmatized people frequently face threats to their privacy; they experience people 
staring at them, in particular when they look physically different from what is considered 
&#8213;normal&#8214;. They are verbally insulted, harassed or threatened or experience physical abuse 
and violence, for instance, when attempting to access water and sanitation facilities. Such 
threats directly affect people&#8216;s access to services and have a detrimental effect on their 
</p>
<p>health, dignity and livelihoods. In many instances, the perpetrators are not held 
accountable, but rather enjoy impunity. 
</p>
<p>40. A report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their 
sexual orientation and gender identity has highlighted that homophobic and transphobic 
violence may be physical or psychological, and that those attacks &#8213;constitute a form of 
gender-based violence, driven by a desire to punish those seen as defying gender norms&#8214; 
(A/HRC/19/41, para. 20). While the human rights concerns are much broader, in relation to 
water and sanitation specifically, the use of public bathrooms, which are often sex-
segregated, has been associated with exclusion, denial of access, verbal harassment, 
physical abuse and sometimes even the arrest of transgender and intersex individuals. More 
broadly, they are at risk of exposure, violence and harassment in seeking access to services 
such as water and sanitation when those are in common areas, or where privacy is 
unavailable or compromised. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Criminalization  
</b></p>
<p>41. Stigma often finds its way into legislative and policy frameworks mirroring societal 
attitudes and prejudices. In many countries, stigmatization is reflected in the criminalization 
of work-related activities and practices or the lack of legal protection. For instance, the lack 
of protection creates a climate of impunity, invisibility and silence and violence against sex 
workers. They are often forced to work in unsafe environments, including in the outskirts of 
cities, with no access to services. 
</p>
<p>42. The stigmatization of homeless persons is starkly apparent in their criminalization, 
for instance through the adoption of local ordinances criminalizing proxy behaviours, that 
is, common behaviours among homeless people, including public urination and defecation. 
While such laws are seemingly neutral, they disproportionately affect homeless people, 
who rely on public places for these activities.23 Homeless people often have limited access 
to water, toilets and showers, thus the enforcement of such regulations results in them being 
denied the rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Situating stigma in the human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>43. Stigma is a deeply engrained sociocultural phenomenon that not only disadvantages 
entire population groups, but often results in serious human rights violations. Situating 
stigma in the human rights framework is essential for identifying the obligations of States 
and establishing accountability. Stigma has close links to a range of civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights, highlighting the indivisibility and interdependence of 
all human rights. The human rights standards and principles of human dignity and non-
discrimination, the human rights to water and sanitation and other closely related human 
</p>
<p>  
 23 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights (A/66/265), paras. 33 ff. </p>


<p>rights will be explored in more depth, as they show close links to the way stigma is 
manifested in relation to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human dignity 
</b></p>
<p>44. Human dignity is the foundation of all human rights. The International Covenants on 
Human Rights proclaim that the rights enshrined therein derive from the inherent dignity of 
the human person. Human dignity is an intrinsic and universal quality of the human person. 
Behaviour and activities that violate human dignity can include activities or statements that 
&#8213;demean and humiliate individuals or groups because of their origins, status or beliefs&#8214;, as 
well as negative stereotyping that implies that members of a particular group are inferior.24 
Stigma is, by its demeaning and degrading nature, antithetical to the very idea of human 
dignity. Stigma as a process of devaluation, of making some people &#8213;lesser&#8214; and others 
&#8213;greater&#8214;, is inconsistent with human dignity, which is premised on notions of the inherent 
equality and worthiness of the human person. It undermines human dignity, thereby laying 
the groundwork for violations of human rights. Human dignity is closely linked to the 
realization of the human rights to water and sanitation, and to various related rights such as 
non-discrimination, the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right 
to privacy. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>45. The human rights to water and sanitation are guaranteed under international law. 
They are components of the right to an adequate standard of living guaranteed in article 11, 
paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as 
well as in many other human rights treaties. Moreover, water and sanitation are inextricably 
linked to a range of other human rights, including the rights to life, to health and to housing. 
The human rights to water and sanitation have been reaffirmed through explicit recognition 
by the General Assembly25 and the Human Rights Council.26 
</p>
<p>46. States are obliged to progressively realize the human rights to water and sanitation, 
meaning that they must move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards the goal 
of full realization. They must undertake deliberate, concrete and targeted steps and must 
devote the maximum available resources to the realization of human rights.27  
</p>
<p>47. States must respect, protect and fulfil the human rights to water and sanitation. They 
must not only refrain from interfering with these human rights, but also protect individuals 
against interference by private parties. States, for instance, have positive obligations to take 
appropriate measures to ensure that persons from stigmatized groups are not excluded from 
access to wells or facilities. The obligation to fulfil does not generally require States to 
provide services directly, instead States must create an enabling environment for the 
realization of these rights. However, when people do not have the means to provide for 
themselves, the State is required to provide access to water and sanitation services, for 
instance by ensuring that homeless persons have access to public facilities, or that prisons 
are adequately equipped with sanitation facilities. The measures required to fully realize the

<p>States parties obligations, paras. 2 and 10. </p>


<p>human rights to water and sanitation reach far beyond ensuring access to services, and 
include appropriate measures to combat stigma as a cause of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Non-discrimination and equality  
</b></p>
<p>48. The right to be free from discrimination in the exercise of human rights, including 
the rights to water and sanitation, is paramount and cross-cutting under international human 
rights law. Non-discrimination and equality are central to all core international human 
rights treaties. They include extensive provisions to protect against discrimination and 
ensure equality, covering in particular racial discrimination, as well as the situation of 
children, women, and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>49. Discrimination is defined as constituting &#8213;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or 
preference or other differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on the 
prohibited grounds of discrimination and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or 
impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of Covenant 
rights&#8214;.28 
</p>
<p>50. In terms of prohibited grounds of discrimination, the International Covenants on 
Human Rights list race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national 
or social origin, property, birth or other status. The term &#8213;other status&#8214; indicates that these 
lists are not exhaustive. The treaty bodies have sought to elucidate the term, finding that it 
encompasses, inter alia, disability, age, sexual orientation and gender identity, health status, 
place of residence, and economic and social situation.29 These grounds show a significant 
overlap with groups experiencing stigmatization, highlighting again that stigma often lies at 
the root of discrimination. Conversely, this relationship also allows for the use of stigma as 
a marker and for the consideration of groups who experience stigmatization when 
interpreting the term &#8213;other status&#8214;. While it may already be implicit in the treaty bodies&#8216; 
reasoning, this would, for instance, require the recognition of homelessness as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>51. States have an immediate obligation to guarantee non-discrimination in the exercise 
of the rights to water and sanitation. They must ensure that laws, policies, programmes and 
other measures are not discriminatory. When deeply engrained, discrimination is 
intractable&#8212;as is often the case where stigma lies at the root of discriminatory action&#8212;and 
temporary special measures may be required to ensure the redistribution of power and 
resources. 30  Finally, to address discrimination based on stigma as a deeply entrenched 
societal phenomenon, States must adopt measures to ensure that private actors do not 
discriminate on prohibited grounds.31

<p><b> D. Prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment  
</b></p>
<p>52. Stigma can also be seen to relate to the prohibition of inhuman or degrading 
treatment, as provided under, inter alia, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (art. 7), and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (art. 16). Inhuman or degrading treatment is interpreted as 
extending beyond acts causing physical pain to include mental suffering. In the case of 
degrading treatment, the aspect of humiliation plays a greater role even than the severity of 
the suffering,32 showing close links to the ways in which stigmatization is experienced. 
</p>
<p>53. Inhuman or degrading treatment can result from acts, but also from omissions, and 
States bear responsibility for both.33 The Special Rapporteur has emphasized that &#8213;because 
evacuation of the bowels and bladder is a necessary biological function and because denial 
of opportunities to do so in a lawful and dignified manner can both compromise human 
dignity and cause suffering, such denial could, in some cases (for example, where it results 
from deliberate actions or clear neglect) amount to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment&#8214; 
(A/HRC/18/33/Add.4, para. 58). This may be of particular relevance to prisoners, homeless 
persons, slum dwellers and others who are unable to access facilities as a result of the 
stigma they face. The Human Rights Committee has found that the lack of adequate 
sanitation in prisons can amount to inhuman treatment.34 
</p>
<p>54. States are also obliged to protect individuals from acts or omissions of third parties. 
In that regard, the Human Rights Committee explained that &#8213;it is the duty of the State party 
</p>
<p>to afford everyone protection through legislative and other measures as may be necessary 
against the acts prohibited by article 7 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights], whether inflicted by people acting in their official capacity, outside their official 
capacity or in a private capacity&#8214;.35 This scope of the prohibition of inhuman or degrading 
treatment has significant implications for the measures States need to take. They need to 
address stigma that could result in situations amounting to degrading treatment due to the 
lack of access to adequate sanitation facilities, for example, in private schools or care 
institutions, or due to the deliberate denial of access to water or sanitation in that sphere. It 
is not sufficient for States to simply prohibit such treatment and criminalize it;36 they need 
comprehensive and positive measures to prevent and address it. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to privacy  
</b></p>
<p>55. According to article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
&#8213;no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, 
home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation&#8214;. It 
guarantees the respect for the individual existence and autonomy of the human being.37 The 
right to privacy includes the right to be different.38 Human rights law awards the same

<p>protection to the honour and reputation of, for example, homeless people, sex workers or 
prisoners as to that of any other member of society.  
</p>
<p>56. For many stigmatized individuals, stigma results in a negative impact on their right 
to privacy when attempting to meet their water and sanitation needs. For instance, homeless 
people may be forced to urinate and defecate in public, given the inexistence or lack of 
maintenance of public facilities. During her mission to Slovenia, the Special Rapporteur 
met with Roma communities who were forced to defecate in the open and bathe in a stream 
due to the lack of adequate facilities. When doing so they were reportedly chased by the 
police (A/HRC/18/33/Add.2, para. 35). In these cases, the State directly interferes with 
people&#8216;s privacy, not only by chasing them, but also by not allowing their dwellings to be 
</p>
<p>connected to water supply and sewerage systems due to their alleged &#8213;illegal&#8214; status. 
Similar situations can be found in slums all over the world where the alleged &#8213;illegal&#8214; status 
of settlements results in people being denied access to facilities that would guarantee their 
privacy. In South Africa, a case was brought to the court concerning unenclosed toilets built 
by the municipality, that is, toilets that were erected without the enclosing superstructure 
that would hide people from view when using them. The Western Cape High Court found, 
inter alia, a violation of the right to privacy enshrined in article 14 of the South African 
Constitution.39 
</p>
<p>57. Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights goes on to 
guarantee that &#8213;everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference 
or attacks&#8214;, thus including an explicit guarantee of protection against interference by private 
parties. This results in a positive obligation of States parties to protect privacy against 
interference and attacks by others,40 which has been found to be of particular relevance, for 
instance, in relation to persons deprived of personal liberty, older persons, persons with 
disabilities or transgendered persons.41 This provision is of enormous significance in the 
context of combatting stigma. It clearly demonstrates that States&#8216; obligations reach into the 
</p>
<p>private sphere. They cannot dismiss stigma as a social phenomenon over which States have 
no influence. Instead, they have positive obligations that extend into this realm, requiring 
States, for instance, to take measures that enable women and girls to manage their 
menstrual hygiene needs in a manner that protects their privacy and dignity. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Identifying appropriate strategies for prevention and 
response 
</b></p>
<p>58. States cannot meet their human rights obligations without addressing stigma. They 
not only have obligations not to act as stigmatizers, but are also obliged to protect 
individuals from actions or omissions of third parties. States must protect individuals from 
human rights abuses committed by private actors, including the media, service providers, 
community members and family members. To determine what States are required to do to 
combat stigma, one can build on the due diligence standard developed to define the 
obligations of States as regards the actions of private parties. It has been widely used in 
other areas of law, such as violence against women,42 providing a framework of assessment

<p>for ascertaining whether human rights obligations are met. It requires States to go beyond 
enacting legislation, to take positive action to meet their obligations effectively, and to 
make a legitimate and reasonable effort to prevent and combat stigma. 
</p>
<p>59. Since stigma is so complex and so deeply engrained in society, permeating different 
spheres, preventing and combating it requires holistic approaches and systemic solutions:  
</p>
<p>(a) Stigma must be addressed at different levels, to ensure change at the level of 
individual behaviours, as well as at the broader social and cultural levels. It is crucial to 
recognize the extent to which States perpetuate stigma and address this at the institutional 
and structural levels;  
</p>
<p>(b) While States are the primary duty bearers under international human rights 
law, non-State actors also have responsibilities and can be held accountable for human 
rights abuses. They should be part of any efforts to combat stigma; 
</p>
<p>(c) Addressing stigma requires working with the stigmatized as well as with the 
stigmatizers, while recognizing that there is significant overlap. Those who experience 
stigmatization due to a certain attribute are just as likely as the majority population to 
stigmatize others;  
</p>
<p>(d) Strategies need to cover prevention and address existing stigma, as well as 
provide for redress for the stigmatized and punishment for the perpetrators where 
stigmatization results in human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Participation and empowerment 
</b></p>
<p>60. Meaningful participation of stigmatized individuals in crafting measures to combat 
stigma in relation to water and sanitation is absolutely essential. In order to ensure 
meaningful participation States must guarantee access to information in relevant languages 
and formats and targeted to different ages and population groups. For example, since stigma 
relating to some diseases is often reinforced by a lack of scientific information on ways to 
prevent, treat or transmit diseases, a critical aspect is to run public health campaigns and 
ensure that all individuals can seek and receive accurate and trustworthy information. 
Empowerment should be the key strategy, with those experiencing stigma having space to 
combat prejudices and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>61. In the context of sex workers, the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, a 
grassroots sex workers&#8216; collective in India, began organizing self-regulatory boards made 
up of its staff, doctors, advocates, national human rights commissioners, local politicians 
and officials, and sex workers themselves in a number of red-light districts. Their objectives 
included mitigating violence against sex workers, but also brought about improvements in 
access to water and sanitation.43 
</p>
<p>62. In order to combat stigma effectively, it is essential to address both its external and 
internalized dimensions. People who are stigmatized often feel embarrassment and shame, 
so they remain silent and are incapable of combatting stigma working against them. Where 
stigmatized people lack voice and agency, empowering them to know and claim their rights 
is crucial. This requires States to ensure access to information on rights and mechanisms to 
claim them, as well as to information on issues such as menstruation and hygiene. A

Society Institute, 2008), pp. 36 ff. </p>


<p>positive self-perception can motivate others to also change their attitudes. Empowering 
people supports them in confronting, challenging and educating people who stigmatize 
them, as well as in holding the State and other actors accountable for discrimination and 
other human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>63. Networks of stigmatized people have proven to be well-placed to understand the 
challenges, and often provide vital community support. Many stigmatized groups are well 
organized, make claims on their rights, and educate society at large and policymakers. In 
that regard, further fostering such interactions, networks and organizations is critical to 
combatting stigma. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Awareness-raising to break taboos and challenge stereotypes  
</b></p>
<p>64. Silence is a major component of stigma. The first step is to speak openly about what 
seems &#8213;unpleasant&#8214; or &#8213;unmentionable&#8214; or deviates from dominant public opinion, and to 
recognize the stigma attached&#8212;be it obstetric fistula, homelessness, intersexuality, 
menstrual hygiene or another issue. Stigma is often based on ignorance, fears and 
misconceptions that can be tackled through awareness-raising. The voice of the stigmatized 
must be amplified, and their space must be broadened to clearly articulate their needs and 
rights.  
</p>
<p>65. Probably the greatest challenge in combatting stigma is the fact that it is deeply 
entrenched in sociocultural norms and attitudes. Tackling it requires raising awareness of 
stigmatizing practices that are pursued under the umbrella of culture, religion and tradition. 
The interpretations of culture on which such practices are based are neither immutable nor 
homogenous and must therefore be challenged, including by questioning the legitimacy of 
those who perpetuate stigmatizing practices in the name of culture and uncovering the 
underlying power dynamics (E/CN.4/2006/61, para. 85). 
</p>
<p>66. Broad-based awareness-raising and advocacy campaigns on various issues are 
essential to achieve visibility. This can include posters, booklets, radio, television, 
magazines, websites and other media. The stigma index developed in the context of 
HIV/AIDS44 is an innovative tool aimed at measuring stigma and using the data for raising 
awareness, empowering the stigmatized, and advocating for change. In the context of 
menstrual hygiene, UNICEF Bangladesh aims to contribute to developing better menstrual 
hygiene in rural areas through the training of community hygiene promoters targeting 30 
million rural Bangladeshis.45  
</p>
<p>67. The attitudes, stereotypes and prejudices that make up stigma must be uncovered 
and challenged. In that context, article 5 (a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women requires States parties to take all appropriate 
measures &#8213;to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a 
view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which 
are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on 
stereotyped roles for men and women&#8214;. Similar provisions requiring States to combat 
stereotypes and prejudices are included in article 8, paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and article 7 of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The rationale of these provisions can be

</p>
<p>p. 12. </p>


<p>transferred to stigmatized groups in general, since prejudices and ideas of inferiority and 
superiority are central to the formation of stigma.  
</p>
<p>68. Eliminating stereotypes requires a combination of measures at different levels that 
reach a range of stakeholders. Any messages aimed at dismantling stigma should be 
developed by, or at least in consultation with, the stigmatized. It is specifically incumbent 
upon States to combat stereotyping in State institutions, including local authorities, by 
sensitizing and training State officials directly involved in the provision or monitoring of 
water and sanitation services, as well as law enforcement officials and judges. Judicial 
decisions, legislation and executive statements have an impact on public attitudes and it is 
therefore crucial to ensure that they do not perpetuate stereotypes and prejudices. 
</p>
<p>69. Some prejudices develop at an early age and can be inherited from parents and 
others and must therefore be addressed as early as possible. Schools have an obligation to 
educate children to act as agents of change, developing tolerant behaviour towards others, 
encouraging dialogue and interaction and promoting changes that will eventually permeate 
other spheres.46 Human rights education with a focus on non-discrimination should be part 
of every school curriculum. Education should be inclusive, accepting students with 
differences, so that these differences are perceived as &#8213;normal&#8214; and students develop 
respect for &#8213;otherness&#8214;. The same holds true for comprehensive sexual education, including 
on menstruation, in order to provide accurate information and combat silence and stigma, 
targeting both girls and boys. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislative, policy and institutional measures 
</b></p>
<p>70. Legislation can protect people and enable them to claim their rights, but it can also 
create barriers and perpetuate stigmatization. States must develop and reform laws and 
policies to ensure non-discrimination and equality. They must enact protective legislation, 
and ensure that laws are implemented and enforced. The more explicitly legislation 
addresses specific instances of discrimination, the more it can contribute to combatting the 
related stigma. Legislative measures need to be accompanied by other measures that can 
achieve changes in institutions, practices, patterns and customs.  
</p>
<p>71. Evaluating existing laws and assessing their potential discriminatory and 
stigmatizing impact in the water and sanitation domains is equally important. The 
stigmatization of homeless communities, for instance, is often reinforced through 
legislation that criminalizes certain proxy behaviours. Such laws do nothing to address the 
root causes of homelessness and must be replaced by policies that aim at guaranteeing 
adequate housing to marginalized individuals and families. A report by the United States 
Interagency Council on Homelessness, based on information gathered at a summit 
convened by the council and the United States Department of Justice, condemns the 
criminalization of homelessness and suggests alternatives that are grounded in community 
engagement and aimed at overcoming barriers to housing by directly working with the 
homeless. 47  Building on the recognition that criminalization does not provide any real 
solutions, all levels of government must put into practice effective alternative approaches.

<p><b> D. Adopting targeted interventions  
</b></p>
<p>72. One of the drivers of stigma is irrational assumptions that influence policy design 
and implementation. States should adopt policies and measures that are based on evidence, 
rather than on preconceptions. To establish the evidence base, States should undertake a 
comprehensive study on stigma, understand who is affected, for what reasons, and how 
stigma manifests itself. This requires both quantitative and qualitative data. Based on this 
assessment, States must take targeted measures and affirmative action to address groups 
that experience stigmatization. This will often require devoting greater resources to these 
groups, for instance through earmarked funds. 
</p>
<p>73. For example, some Slovenian municipalities have taken measures in response to the 
lack of access to water and sanitation in many Roma communities. Previously, either 
ownership or authorized occupation of a home was required to receive municipal services, 
thus the unauthorized status of a settlement was a barrier to services. The municipalities of 
Prekmurje region have waived these strict regulations, which has resulted in all but 3 of the 
38 Roma settlements gaining access to services.48 
</p>
<p><b> E. Adopting technical measures 
</b></p>
<p>74. While the focus in combating stigma must be on bringing about societal change and 
changes in attitude, technical measures are still crucial to ensure accessibility, for instance 
for persons with disabilities or older persons, as are public health measures to prevent and 
cure neglected tropical diseases. Sanitation systems should be adjusted to avoid manual 
sanitation work. The provision of adequate facilities is crucial for menstrual hygiene 
management, since it is often the lack of a safe and clean space that prevents women and 
girls from exercising proper hygiene.  
</p>
<p>75. Water and sanitation interventions are transformative and can be an entry point for 
broader societal change. They facilitate the realization of other human rights, such as 
education, health and work. In many instances, water and sanitation interventions prove to 
be ideal starting points since everyone shares the need for these services, ensuring access 
brings tangible improvements in people&#8216;s lives, and speaking about water and sanitation 
can be easier than addressing societal inequalities at large. To capitalize on that 
opportunity, technical measures need to be accompanied by measures that go beyond 
building infrastructure.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Ensuring access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>76. One of the defining tenets of the human rights framework is accountability. States 
are obliged to put in place judicial and non-judicial accountability mechanisms to redress 
human rights violations. Mechanisms must be in place to investigate violations and punish 
the perpetrators. States must not allow impunity. They must provide for redress at the 
individual level, including restitution, compensation, satisfaction and/or guarantees of non-
repetition.49 Mechanisms at the international level, including the universal periodic review 
and the procedures of the treaty bodies, should be strengthened and applied in the context 
of human rights violations based on stigma.

</p>
<p>water, para. 55. </p>


<p>77. Access to justice must not only be provided for in the law, but be ensured in 
practice. States should ensure accountability mechanisms that are accessible, affordable, 
timely and effective.50 Stigmatized individuals are often affected by a range of barriers in 
accessing the courts and other mechanisms, including physical, economic or linguistic 
barriers. States should take measures to ensure physical access to buildings, for instance for 
persons with disabilities (see Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 
13), adopt legal aid schemes, and provide relevant information in local languages, among 
other relevant measures. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Stigma plays an insidious role in perpetuating, </b>&#8220;<b>justifying</b>&#8221;<b> and ultimately 
creating impunity for human rights violations. It also serves to silence and erase 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues, and exclude individuals and communities from access to water and sanitation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing some people from exercising their civil, cultural, economic, political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>social rights. Most often, stigmatized individuals are the ones whose lives and health 
</b></p>
<p><b>are placed directly in jeopardy by lack of access to water and sanitation. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The human rights framework requires States to prioritize the most 
marginalized, and to ensure their access to information, empowerment and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation. States must identify challenges, duty bearers and solutions through 
</b></p>
<p><b>bottom-up local diagnostics, ensure accountability and tie any measures taken to 
</b></p>
<p><b>substantive human rights standards. This process is as essential in combating stigma 
</b></p>
<p><b>as the substantive parameters it hinges upon. The process of having the conversation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>of including people in the discussion, and finding solutions together, has the potential 
</b></p>
<p><b>to effect shifts in attitudes and behaviours and to lead to lasting and transformative 
</b></p>
<p><b>changes. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> Only by addressing stigma will States be able to fully realize the human rights 
to water and sanitation, and ensure non-discrimination or the prohibition of inhuman 
</b></p>
<p><b>and degrading treatment. Comprehensive and holistic measures to prevent, address 
</b></p>
<p><b>and provide for redress in cases of stigma and punish the perpetrators where stigma 
</b></p>
<p><b>results in the violation of human rights are indispensable. States must refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>any activities that perpetuate and institutionalize stigma, and must protect individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>from human rights abuses committed by third parties, including, for example, service 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers, the media, community members and family members, that are rooted in 
</b></p>
<p><b>stigma as a deeply entrenched sociocultural phenomenon. To that extent, States must 
</b></p>
<p><b>act with due diligence. They must go beyond enacting formal legal provisions and take 
</b></p>
<p><b>positive action to meet their obligations effectively and make a legitimate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasonable effort to prevent and combat stigma. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Stigma must be addressed in its external and internalized dimensions in order 
to combat it effectively. Information, participation and empowerment must be the 
</b></p>
<p><b>starting point of any measures to combat stigma. Many stigmatized groups are well 
</b></p>
<p><b>organized, make claims on their rights, and educate society at large. States and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders should further empower stigmatized groups and individuals to claim 
</b></p>
<p><b>their rights and to confront and challenge stigma and the people who stigmatize them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>All relevant stakeholders, including individuals, communities, families, civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, networks of stigmatized groups, the media and donors, among many 
</b></p>
<p><b>others, have responsibilities to combat stigma and should work together.

</p>
<p>application of the Covenant, para. 9. </p>


<p>82.<b> In line with the above, the Special Rapporteur offers the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States must tackle the practice of stigmatization in their strategies for 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully realizing the rights to water and sanitation, in the elaboration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of national plans of action for water and sanitation and in financing 
</b></p>
<p><b>water and sanitation sectors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In order to better understand this phenomenon, States must undertake a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive study on stigma, through a widely participatory process, to identify 
</b></p>
<p><b>stigmatized populations, as well as to analyse the drivers of stigma in relation to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the human rights to water and sanitation. This process should be based 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the experience of people who face stigmatization, giving them space for articulation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and empowering them to claim their human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Such study and its findings should, in particular:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Serve as the basis for the adoption of new legislation and policies or the 
</b></p>
<p><b>revision or amendment of existing legislation and policies which may not 
</b></p>
<p><b>expressly address stigma as one of the key obstacles to exercising the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>water and sanitation by individuals or specific population groups. Where 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation and policies reflect stigmatizing attitudes, institutionalizing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>formalizing stigma, they must be repealed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Be widely disseminated, including with the purpose of increasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness about the pervasive impact of stigma in the exercise of the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>water and sanitation. States and other stakeholders should adopt broad-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising and advocacy campaigns to ensure the visibility of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of individuals or groups of individuals facing stigma;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Serve as a basis for challenging stereotypes. Based on the findings, States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should start tackling stigma within the State institutions and adopt public 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaigns. They should focus on school interventions, and target stereotypes 
</b></p>
<p><b>and harmful practices that find a formal </b>&#8220;<b>justification</b>&#8221;<b> under the umbrella of 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture, law or tradition;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Serve as the basis for the design of specific policies and programmes, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocation of financial and human resources, targeted evidence-based measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, where needed, temporary special measures for groups and individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>facing stigma in relation to the rights to water and sanitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Provide guidance in the prioritization of measures taken in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the human rights to water and sanitation. As stigmatized 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals are often among the most marginalized and lack access to basic 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels of services, States must target them with priority. States should earmark 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources in the national and municipal budgets for this purpose; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Be systematically included in periodic reports to treaty body monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and to the universal periodic review. Regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms should also receive information on a regular basis on stigma 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing the full enjoyment of the rights to water and sanitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) National human rights institutions, as well as civil society organizations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should explicitly address stigma as part of their work, empowering stigmatized 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals to claim their rights and supporting States to address stigma as part of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their human rights obligations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States must put in place accountability mechanisms and ensure access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice where stigmatization results in human rights violations. Mechanisms must be </b></p>


<p><b>in place to investigate violations and punish perpetrators. States must also provide for 
</b></p>
<p><b>redress at the individual level, including restitution, compensation, satisfaction and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees of non-repetition. States must guarantee access to justice in practice by 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring that mechanisms are accessible, affordable, timely and effective.
