DAKOTA TERRITORY RESOURCES CORP
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1—Basis of Presentation
The  accompanying  unaudited  interim  financial  statements  of  Dakota  Territory  Resource  Corp.
(“we”,  “us”,  “our”,  the  “Company”,  the  “Corporation”)  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (“SEC”),  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in our annual report on Form 10-K, for
the  year  ended  March  31,  2016  as  filed  with  the  SEC.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  all
adjustments,  consisting  of  normal  recurring  adjustments,  necessary  for  a  fair  presentation  of
financial  position  and  the  results  of  operations  for  the  interim  periods  presented  have  been
reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results  to  be  expected  for  the  full  year.  Notes  to  the  financial  statements  which  would
substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most
recent fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as reported in our annual report on Form 10-K, have
been omitted.
The  Company’s  absence  of  revenues,  recurring  losses  from  operations,  and  its  need  for
significant additional financing in order to fund its projected loss in 2017 raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Note 2—Related Party Transactions
Effective October 1, 2005, we began paying a management consulting fee to Minera Teles Pires
Inc.,  a  company  controlled  by  the  President  and  director  of  the  Company.  The  agreement
provides a fixed fee of $10,000 per month of which $5,000 is paid and the other $5,000 deferred
until financing is obtained by us. Additionally, the agreement provides for a payment of $1,500
per  month  for  office  rent  and  expenses.  During  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  we
incurred approximately $34,500 in management fees and rent from Minera Teles Pires Inc. As of
June 30, 2016, we owed Minera Teles Pires approximately $419,000 for management fees and
out of pocket expenses.
Effective  February  24,  2012,  we  began  paying  consulting  fees  to  Jerikodie,  Inc.,  a  company
controlled by our Vice President and a director of the Company. The agreement provides a fixed
fee of $9,000 per month plus approved expenses. During the three months ended June 30, 2016,
we incurred approximately $27,000 in consulting fees from Jerikodie, Inc. As of June 30, 2016,
we owed Jerikodie, Inc. approximately $318,000 for consulting fees and out of pocket expenses.
On  March  19,  2013,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Wm  Chris  Mathers  to
compensate  Mr.  Mathers  as  the  Company’s  CFO  and  agreed  to  pay  Mr.  Mathers  cash  in  the
amount of $1,000 per month increasing to $2,000 per month on September 1, 2013 and to $3,000
per month on March 1, 2014. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred $9,000
in  compensation  to  Mr.  Mathers.    As  of  June  30,  2016,  we  owed  Mr.  Mathers  $70,000  for
consulting fees.
Note 3—Mineral Properties
On  September  26,  2012,  the  Company  was  re-organized  with  North  Homestake  Mining
Company.  With this re-organization, the Company acquired 84 unpatented lode mining claims
covering approximately 1,600 acres known as the Blind Gold Property located in the Black Hills
of South Dakota.
On  December  28,  2012,  the  Company  acquired  57  unpatented  lode  mining  claims  covering
approximately  853  acres  known  as  the  West  False  Bottom  Creek  and  Paradise  Gulch  Claim
Group, the City Creek Claims Group, and the Homestake Paleoplacer Claims Group, all located
in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  The West False Bottom Creek and Paradise Gulch Claims
were  contiguous  to  the  Blind  Gold  Property  and  have  been  incorporated  into  the  Blind  Gold
Property.  The  purchase  price  was  1,000,000  restricted  common  shares  valued  at  $0.15  per
share, or $150,000.
On February 24, 2014 the Company acquired surface and mineral title to the 26.16 acres of the
Squaw and Rubber Neck Lodes that comprise Mineral Survey 1706 in the Black Hills of South
Dakota.  Located immediately to the north and adjoining the Company’s Paleoplacer Property,
Mineral  Survey  1706  was  explored  by  Homestake  Mining  Company  in  the  late  1980’s.      The
Company is required to make annual lease payments of $8,000 for a period of 5 years, of which
$8,000 was due upon execution of the agreement.  The Company has an option to purchase the
mineral property for $120,000.
6
On  March  3,  2014,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  approximately  565.24  mineral
acres  in  the  Northern  Black  Hills  of  South  Dakota.    The  acquisition  increased  our  mineral
interests in the Homestake District by nearly 23%, to over 3,057 acres. As part of the property
acquisition,  the  Company  purchased  an  additional  64.39  mineral  acres  located  immediately
southwest  and  contiguous  to  our  Paleoplacer  Property,  including  mineral  title  to  the  historic
Gustin, Minerva and Deadbroke Gold Mines.  The three mines were the last of a string of mines
that produced ores from fossil gold placers derived from the Homestake Lode and are located at
the point where the channel disappears under the cover of younger sedimentary and intrusive
rocks approximately one mile north of the Homestake Open Cut source.  With this acquisition the
Company consolidated and extended the Paleoplacer Property position to a distance extending
approximately 3,100 feet along the south to north trend of the channel.  The purchase price of the
mineral interests was $33,335.
The Company plans to commence an exploratory program on these mineral properties as soon
as financing can be arranged.

Notes Payable to Related Party
The Company had 11 notes payable to its President pursuant to advances which had historically
been made by the President. The notes were dated between March 2011 and August 2012, were
unsecured,  ranged  in  amount  from  $10,000  to  $50,000,  and  bore  interest  at  12%  per  annum.
 These notes were re-structured and combined on March 27, 2013 into a single promissory note
payable (the “New Note”).  In conjunction with this restructuring, the President forgave accrued
interest totalling $57,817 (recorded as an equity transaction).  The New Note is unsecured, has a
principal amount of $265,000, and bears interest at 4% per annum. The Company will apply 10%
of the gross proceeds from any equity financing in an amount exceeding $0.5 million (whether
one or more transactions) from and after the date hereof to prepay principal and accrued interest.
All remaining unpaid principal and interest was due at March 27, 2016 and remains unpaid.
As of June 30, 2016, the balance of the promissory note payable amounted to $570,550, of which
$265,000 is due to related party on the balance sheet.

Note 5—Convertible Notes Payable
On August 14, 2008, the Company executed a 5% convertible note of $100,000 that was due
August 13, 2010.  The note is now due and payable, however the lender has to date made no
request for payment. The note may be converted from time to time, all or any part of the principal
plus any unpaid accrued interest ($56,298 as of June 30, 2016) thereof into common stock of the
Company at a conversion price per share equal to the greater of i) the closing market price per
share of the common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of conversion as
quoted  on  the  OTC-BB  or  such  other  exchange  upon  which  the  Company’s  shares  are  then
listed or traded, or ii) $200 per share ($20.00 per share after adjustment due to 1 for 200 reverse
stock split; $200 per share after a further adjustment due to a 1 for 10 reverse stock split).  The
conversion  price  shall  be  subject  to  adjustments.    The  minimum  amount  to  be  converted  is
$10,000.  As of June 30, 2016, this note is outstanding.
Note 6—Line of Credit
We executed a Line of Credit with Wells Fargo Bank in California. The Line of Credit allows us to
borrow up to $47,500. The balance of this Line of Credit at June 30, 2016 was approximately
$39,500.
Note 7—Common Stock
Our authorized capital stock consists of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of
$0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.
During  the  first  quarter  2017,  we  received  $5,000  from  an  investor  for  50,000  shares  of  our
common stock at a price of $0.10 per share.  As of the date of this filing these shares have not
been issued.
During  the  first  quarter  2017,  we  issued  100,000  shares  of  our  common  stock  for  consulting
services.
At June 30, 2016, the total issued and outstanding shares were 56,816,787.
Note 8—Subsequent Events

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:

and
·
risks related to our securities.
This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Although
we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results
not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially
from those anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We caution readers not to place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except
as  required  by  law,  we  disclaim  any  obligation  subsequently  to  revise  any  forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the
occurrence  of  anticipated  or  unanticipated  events. We  qualify  all  the  forward-looking
statements contained in this Quarterly Report by the foregoing cautionary statements.
Overview and Organizational History
We  are  a  mining  exploration  stage  company  engaged  in  the  business  of  the  acquisition,
exploration and development of mineral properties. Dakota Territory maintains 100% ownership
of three mineral properties located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, including the Blind Gold,
City Creek and Homestake Paleoplacer Properties, all of which are located in the heart of the
Homestake  District  and  cover  a  total  of  approximately  3,057  acres.  We  currently  have  limited
operations and have not established that any of our projects or properties contain any proven or
probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7.
On  March  9,  2012  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  North  Homestake  Mining
Company  to  exchange  common  stock  to  affect  the  acquisition  of  North  Homestake’s  gold
exploration properties located in South Dakota. The Agreement was completed on September
26, 2012 and the Company concurrently effected a 10 for 1 reverse stock split.  The merger was
recorded as a reverse recapitalization and the issuances of common stock were recorded as a
reclassification  between  paid-in  capital  and  par  value  of  Common  Stock.    North  Homestake
Mining Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 12, 2011.
On December 31, 2012, the Company completed an agreement to acquire 57 unpatented lode
mining claims covering approximately 853 acres in the Black Hills of South Dakota in exchange
for 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which was valued at $0.15 per share on
the transaction date.
On February 24, 2014 the Company acquired surface and mineral title to the 26.16 acres of the
Squaw and Rubber Neck Lodes that comprise Mineral Survey 1706 in the Black Hills of South
Dakota.    The  property  is  located  immediately  to  the  north  and  adjoining  the  Company’s
Paleoplacer Property.
On March 3, 2014, we completed an acquisition of approximately 565.24 mineral acres in the
Northern  Black  Hills  of  South  Dakota.  The  acquisition  increased  our  mineral  interests  in  the
Homestake District by nearly 23%, to over 3,057 acres. As part of the property acquisition, we
purchased an additional 64.39 mineral acres located immediately southwest and contiguous to
our Paleoplacer Property, including mineral title to the historic Gustin, Minerva and Deadbroke
Gold Mines.
We were incorporated in the State of  Nevada  on  February  6,  2002  under  the  name  Lakefield
Ventures, Inc.  In September 2012, the Company changed its name from Mustang Geothermal
Corp  to  Dakota  Territory  Resource  Corp,  reflecting  a  change  in  business.  The  Company  has
been  in  the  exploration  stage  since  its  formation  and  has  not  realized  any  revenues  from  its
planned  operations.  The  Company  is  primarily  engaged  in  the  acquisition,  exploration,  and
development of mineral properties.
There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of
our business is dependent upon obtaining further long-term financing, successful exploration and
development of our property interests and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations.  The
issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity
interests of our current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.

Current Plan of Operations
We plan on concentrating all exploration activities on our gold property in South Dakota. During
fiscal year 2017, we will require additional new financing of approximately $2.0 million to carry
out our planned exploration, none of which we have secured as of the date hereof.
Our  planned  exploration  program  will  consist  primarily  of  field  and  diamond  drill  programs.
 Additionally, the budget and any use of proceeds covering any equity based financing would
provide  for  the  annual  maintenance  requirements  for  the  Company’s  claims,  leases,  and
concessions and our general operating needs.

Our  estimated  working  capital  requirements  and  projected  operating  expenses  for  the  next
twelve-month  period  total  approximately  $2.0  million.  Our  current  working  capital  will  not  be
sufficient to cover our estimated capital requirements during the next twelve-month period; we
will be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or through debt
financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the required capital or
that actual cash requirements will not exceed our estimates.
Since we are an exploration stage company and have not generated revenues to date, our cash
flow  projections  are  subject  to  numerous  contingencies  and  risk  factors  beyond  our  control,
including exploration and development risks, competition from well-funded competitors, and our
ability  to  manage  growth.    We  can  offer  no  assurance  that  our  expenses  will  not  exceed  our
projections.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As  of  June  30,  2016,  we  had  a  working  capital  deficit  of  approximately  $1,997,000  and  our
accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2016 was approximately $3,604,000.  We had a loss for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 of approximately $120,000.
During  our  fiscal  year  ending  March  31,  2017,  we  plan  to  spend  approximately  $897,000  for
diamond drilling, $23,000 for field programs and $90,000 for assays, as well as approximately
$691,000  for  expenses  related  to  exploration  programs.    The  timing  of  these  expenditures  is
dependent upon a number of factors, including the availability of drill contractors.  We estimate
that  general  and  administrative  expenses  during  fiscal  year  ending  March  31,  2017  will  be
approximately $400,000 to include payroll, legal and accounting services and other general and
other expenses necessary to conduct our operations.
We have no employees.  Our management, all of whom are consultants, conduct our operations.
 We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next twelve-month
period.  Given the early stage of our exploration properties, we intend to continue to outsource
our professional and personnel requirements by retaining consultants on an as needed basis.
 However, if we are successful in our initial and any subsequent drilling programs, we may retain
employees.
We currently do not have sufficient funds to complete exploration and development work on our
properties,  which  means  that  we  will  be  required  to  raise  additional  capital,  enter  into  joint
venture relationships or find alternative means to finance placing one or more of our properties
into commercial production, if warranted. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the
delay or indefinite postponement of exploration and development or production on one or more of
our  properties  and  any  properties  we  may  acquire  in  the  future  or  even  a  loss  of  property
interests. We cannot be certain that additional capital or other types of financing will be available
when needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable or acceptable to
us. Our ability to arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing
capital market conditions as well as our business performance.

We had no operating revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. We are not
currently profitable. As a result of ongoing operating losses, we had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $3,604,000 as of June 30, 2016.

approximately  $17,750  of  stock  compensation  for  consultants.  The  remaining  general  and
administrative  expenditures  were  primarily  for  legal,  accounting  &  professional  fees,  investor
relations and other general and administrative expenses necessary for our operations.
We had losses from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaling approximately
$112,000  and  a  net  loss  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016  totaling  approximately

operations totaling approximately $129,000 and a net loss of approximately $205,000.  For the

relating to the $100,000 convertible note issued in June 2015 and accrued interest expense on
notes payable totaling approximately $22,000.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current
or  future  effect  on  our  financial  condition,  revenues,  results  of  operations,  liquidity  or  capital
resources.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based
on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of
financial statements requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and the related
disclosures  of  contingencies.  Management  bases  its  estimates  on  various  assumptions  and
historical experience, which are believed to be reasonable; however, due to the inherent nature
of estimates, actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions. On
a  regular  basis,  management  reviews  the  accounting  policies,  assumptions,  estimates  and
judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP.
However,  because  future  events  and  their  effects  cannot  be  determined  with  certainty,  actual
results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Management  believes  that  the  following  critical  accounting  estimates  and  judgments  have  a
significant  impact  on  our  financial  statements;  Valuation  of  options  granted  to  Directors  and
Officers using the Black-Scholes model.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q,  an  evaluation  was
carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the
Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and
operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and Rule

concluded  that  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report,  our  disclosure
controls  and  procedures  were  not  effective  in  ensuring  that:  (i)  information  required  to  be
disclosed  by  us  in  our  reports  that  we  file  or  submit  to  the  SEC  under  the  Exchange  Act  is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable
rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and
CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose
in  their  periodic  reports  filed  with  the  SEC  information  regarding  specified  health  and  safety
violations,  orders  and  citations,  related  assessments  and  legal  actions,  and  mining-related
fatalities.  During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  our  U.S.  exploration  properties  were  not
