<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolution 8/7 of 18 June 2008 and Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2005/69 of 20 April 2005 on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, and 
stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with those 
resolutions and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that proper regulation, including through national legislation, of 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises and their responsible operation 
can contribute to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of and respect for human rights 
and assist in channelling the benefits of business towards contributing to the enjoyment of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned </i>that weak national legislation and implementation cannot effectively 
mitigate the negative impact of globalization on vulnerable economies, fully realize the 
benefits of globalization or derive maximally the benefits of activities of transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, and that further efforts to bridge governance 
gaps at the national, regional and international levels are necessary,  
</p>
<p>  
&#8727; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
the Council on its seventeenth session (A/HRC/17/2), chap. I.
