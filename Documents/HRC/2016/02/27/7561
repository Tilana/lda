<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression undertook an official visit to Montenegro from 11 to 17 June 2013.  
</p>
<p>Montenegro has repeatedly stated its commitment to protect and promote the right to 
freedom of expression. Over recent years, the country has enhanced its legal framework; 
for example, it decriminalized defamation in 2011. However, implementation of the 
normative framework has been unsatisfactory at times.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was deeply concerned by reports of violence and threats 
against journalists and the media, often targeting those investigating corruption and 
criminal activity. He was troubled, in particular, by the limited investigations into some of 
those attacks and the consequent lack of accountability.  
</p>
<p>With regard to the independence of the media, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
concern about the continuing Government ownership of a print newspaper and its financial 
support, although this has been prohibited by law since 2002. He also noted that a worrying 
level of polarization among media groups was impairing efforts towards self-regulation.

the recent reports on attacks against representatives of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) community.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, carried out an official mission to Montenegro from 
11 to 17 June 2013, at the invitation of the Government. The visit was undertaken pursuant 
to his mandate to assess compliance with international standards on the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister, Mr. Milo 
&#272;ukanovi&#263;; the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and European 
Integration, Mr. Igor Luk&#353;i&#263;; the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information 
Society and Telecommunications, Mr. Vujica Lazovi&#263;; the Minister of Internal Affairs, 
Mr. Ra&#353;ko Konjevi&#263;; the Minister of Human and Minority Rights, Mr. Suad Numanovi&#263;; 
and the Deputy Minister of Culture, Mr. &#381;eljko Rutovi&#263;.  
</p><p>3. He also met with the Acting Director of the Police, the Deputy Chief State 
Prosecutor, the President of the Supreme Court of Montenegro, the President of the 
Constitutional Court, the Parliamentary Committee for Human Rights and Freedoms, the 
Director of the Agency for Electronic Media, and the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition, the Special Rapporteur met with civil society organizations, media 
groups and journalists, the academic community, as well as representatives of international 
organizations based in the country.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur extends his thanks to the Government of Montenegro for the 
invitation and the cooperation extended to him before and during the visit. He also wishes 
to express his gratitude for the outstanding support provided to him throughout his visit by 
the United Nations country team. Finally he is particularly thankful for the information 
received from civil society representatives, in particular from activists and journalists 
directly engaged in the promotion of freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International legal standards 
</b></p>
<p>6. In carrying out his assessment of the situation regarding the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression in Montenegro, the Special Rapporteur has been guided by the 
relevant international legal standards. In this case, the most pertinent treaties are the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by the country on 
23 October 2006 and, at the regional level, the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on Human Rights), 
which Montenegro assumed by succession.  
</p>
<p>7. The analysis of the Special Rapporteur in the present report has been guided in 
particular by article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He has also been guided by other 
relevant declarations, resolutions and guidelines of various United Nations bodies, 
including general comment No. 34 (2011) of the Human Rights Committee on article 19: 
freedoms of opinion and expression; resolutions 16/4 and 21/12 of the Human Rights 
Council; and the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. At the domestic level, the right to freedom of opinion and expression is provided for 
in the Constitution of Montenegro,1 as well as additional national legislation. Article 47 of 
the Constitution, establishes that: &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression 
by speech, writing, picture or in some other manner. The right to freedom of expression 
may be limited only by the right of others to dignity, reputation and honour and if it 
threatens public morality or the security of Montenegro.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, the Constitution has specific provisions concerning the:  
</p>
<p>(a) Freedom of the press (art. 49): &#8220;Freedom of press and other forms of public 
information shall be guaranteed. The right to establish newspapers and other public 
information media, without approval, by registration with the competent authority, shall be 
guaranteed;&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(b) Prohibition of censorship (art. 50): &#8220;There shall be no censorship in 
Montenegro. The competent court may prevent dissemination of information and ideas via 
the public media if required so to: prevent invitation to forcible destruction of the order 
defined by the Constitution; preservation of territorial integrity of Montenegro; prevention 
of propagating war or incitement to violence or performance of criminal offences; 
prevention of propagating racial, national and religious hatred or discrimination;&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(c) Right to access information (art. 51): &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to access 
information held by the State authorities and organizations exercising public authority. The 
right to access to information may be limited if this is in the interest of: the protection of 
life; public health; morality and privacy; carrying of criminal proceedings; security and 
defence of Montenegro; foreign, monetary and economic policy;&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(d) Right to freedom of assembly (art. 52): &#8220;The freedom of peaceful assembly, 
without approval, with prior notification of the competent authority shall be guaranteed. 
The freedom of assembly may be temporarily restricted by the decision of the competent 
authority in order to prevent disorder or execution of a criminal offence, threat to health, 
morality or security of people and property, in accordance with the law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution of Montenegro also directly incorporates international agreements 
into domestic law. Article 9 provides that: &#8220;The ratified and published international 
agreements and generally accepted rules of international law shall make an integral part of 
the internal legal order, shall have the supremacy over the national legislation and shall be 
directly applicable when they regulate relations differently from the national legislation.&#8221; 
Article 145 further stipulates that domestic laws &#8220;shall be in conformity with the 
Constitution and confirmed international agreements, and other regulations shall be in 
conformity with the Constitution and the law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>11. Additional relevant legal instruments provide regulations regarding, inter alia, the 
work of the media, the activities of public and private broadcasting services, electronic 
media and access to information held by public bodies.  
</p>
<p>12. The Media Law,2 enacted in 2002, establishes general principles and provisions on 
which the media system is based. It prohibits censorship and establishes that Montenegro

</b></p>
<p>shall provide and guarantee freedom of information at the level of the standards as 
contained in the international documents on human rights and freedoms (art. 1). Article 23 
of the law prohibits the publication of &#8220;information and opinions that instigate 
discrimination, hatred or violence against persons or group of persons based on &#8230; race, 
religion, nation, ethnic group, sex or sexual orientation&#8221;. The Media Law also establishes a 
right for individuals to demand publication of a correction or reply &#8220;without any 
modification or addition&#8221; (art. 28) if requested within 30 days of publication of material 
which offends them, with few exceptions. Publishers failing to do so are subject to judicial 
review. 
</p>
<p>13. The Law on Electronic Media, enacted in 2010, regulates the process of licensing of 
the transmission and broadcasting of radio and television signals; as well as monitoring 
compliance with broadcasting standards. It also establishes the Agency for Electronic 
Media as an independent regulatory body with the tasks of adopting the Broadcasting 
Development Strategy and monitoring audiovisual broadcasters. It further provides for the 
establishment of a public broadcaster, which is partially funded by the national 
Government.  
</p>
<p>14. Public broadcasting activities are regulated by the Law on Public Broadcasting 
Services which, inter alia, defines the mechanisms for financing and managing these 
services, including the responsibilities and composition of the Radio Television 
Montenegro Council. 
</p>
<p>15. The Law on Digital Broadcasting, enacted in 2011, regulates methods and 
conditions for digital terrestrial broadcasting as well as the procedure of switch-over from 
analogue to digital broadcasting. 
</p>
<p>16. Finally, the Freedom of Information Act, enacted in 2012, establishes the right to 
access information held by public bodies, public companies and other entities performing 
public powers.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
in Montenegro 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General overview 
</b></p>
<p>17. Over recent years, Montenegro has reformed laws and introduced new legal 
instruments with the aim of enhancing the protection of the right to freedom of expression 
in the country. The implementation of these improved norms has, however, been 
unsatisfactory at times. The decriminalization of libel and defamation in 2011, for example, 
was a remarkable step. Nonetheless, the fines levied by courts are still high on occasion, 
and civil defamation lawsuits seem to disproportionately target some sectors of the media 
considered to be critical of the authorities. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was very concerned by the frequent reports on violence and 
intimidation against journalists and media outlets, often victimizing investigative journalists 
reporting on corruption and criminal activity. He was in particular concerned by reports on 
the inadequate investigation of well-known episodes and the lack of clarification of the 
potential involvement of State officials.  
</p>
<p>19. Montenegro has a relatively diverse media landscape: with a population of around 
650,000 inhabitants, there are reportedly 23 television stations, 53 radio stations, 4 daily, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>3 weekly and 30 monthly newspapers operating.3 The small market and its financial 
constraints are, however, considered to easily expose the media to pressure from business 
leaders and the Government. In this regard, the direct or indirect interference of the 
Government in the media is an additional reason for concern. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur was concerned by the continued State ownership of the daily newspaper 
<i>Pobjeda</i> as it seems to contribute to the politicization of the very polarized media. He notes 
that this hostility impairs efforts towards self-regulation and the establishment of journalist 
associations as well.  
</p>
<p>20. Montenegro recently adopted the Law on Free Access to Information establishing 
important instruments to facilitate public access to information, in line with international 
standards. However, the adoption of this new norm must be complemented by efforts to 
enhance the capacity of officials to comply with requests and sensitize civil society.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>21. Finally, the Special Rapporteur was concerned by reports on discriminatory 
statements in the media and among the political leadership. In particular his attention was 
drawn to the recently reported attacks against representatives of the lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender (LGBT) community. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Violence and intimidation against journalists 
</b>22. One of the most important roles played by journalists in society is the investigative 
reporting function, where allegations of wrongdoing, whether by the State or by private 
individuals, are investigated and publicly debated. This vital function requires journalists to 
be, and publicly perceived to be, effectively protected by the State. Without such 
protection, journalists may lack the confidence to investigate powerful interests, and 
violence, or the threat of violence, may be used by some to deter the media from further 
investigating very relevant controversial stories related to any form of wrongdoing.  
</p>
<p>23. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was extremely concerned by multiple 
reports of intimidation and violence against journalists and media outlets in Montenegro. 
Civil society and journalist representatives indicated that common targets are allegedly 
journalists investigating issues such as organized crime or alleged links between organized 
crime and the authorities.4 Reports have also underlined that many attacks have not been 
properly investigated. On the other hand, the authorities tended to relate most of these 
events to ordinary criminal reactions to the media coverage.5 
</p>
<p>24. In the six months following the visit of the Special Rapporteur to the country he 
received information on 13 alleged episodes of violence and intimidation against the 
Montenegrin media. The Government informed that investigations on these allegations are 
ongoing, and that proceedings were initiated in 5 of these cases by filing criminal and 
misdemeanour charges against 13 individuals. In a recent study, 30 acts of intimidation and 
violence, including threats, stoning of premises, destruction of property, physical assaults,

<p>planting of explosives, and murders of journalists were identified from May 2004 to 
January 2014.6 The study found that victims were mostly the media or individuals critical 
of the Government. The report also noted that investigations were conducted poorly and 
typically without result. Difficulties in coordination between the State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
and the police often impaired the prosecution. In cases partially or fully concluded, despite 
the conviction of some perpetrators or accomplices, there were serious concerns about the 
lack of identification of persons who had ordered the attacks.7 </p>
<p>25. Concerns about violence against journalists in Montenegro have been repeatedly 
voiced by international entities. In 2013, the progress report of the European Commission 
on the accession process of Montenegro noted that: &#8220;Despite recent convictions and 
investigations into cases of violence against the media, a number of old and recent cases of 
threats and violence against journalists, including attacks against media property, need to be 
solved by stepping up investigations and prosecutions. The recent rise of cases is a cause 
for concern.&#8221;8 The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
Representative on Freedom of the Media has also expressed concern over attacks against 
the Montenegrin media.9 
</p>
<p>26. Possibly the most notorious unresolved case of violence against a journalist is the 
murder in 2004 of publisher and editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper <i>Dan</i>, Mr. Du&#353;ko 
Jovanovi&#263;. Mr. Jovanovi&#263; was assassinated by automatic gunfire from a vehicle following a 
long history of threats received. He had filed a complaint against a member of a criminal 
syndicate in 2002 for making threats, and had reported to the <i>Beta</i> news agency in the same 
year that he had received a letter warning him that &#8220;top-ranked officials at the Ministry of 
the Interior [were] planning his assassination&#8221;.10 Numerous defamation claims had 
allegedly been made against his newspaper for reporting on the involvement of top officials 
in cigarette smuggling and trafficking in women in Montenegro. Following his shooting, 
one person was convicted for being an accomplice to his murder through evidence showing 
that he had been involved in the purchase of a vehicle and weapons used in the crime, and 
that he had been present in the vehicle in which the shooting took place. To date, the 
perpetrator as well as those who ordered the killing have not been found.  
</p>
<p>27. The murder of Mr. Jovanovi&#263; raised widespread attention and its lack of clarification 
continues to be noted by the international community.11 The episode had already been 
addressed in the report on the visit of the previous Special Rapporteur to Serbia and 
Montenegro in 2004,12 which concluded by recommending that law enforcement agencies 
and judicial authorities speedily conclude investigations on the assassination of media 
professionals. During the current visit, interlocutors both within Government and civil 
society made reference to the lack of clarification of this particular case. The failure of the 
authorities to define the exact circumstances of Mr. Jovanovi&#263;&#8217;s killing 10 years after it 
took place, and in particular, those who ordered his assassination is taken by various 
journalists and civil society representatives as the main example of the lack of 
accountability for attacks against the press.

<p>28. Another notorious case that remains unresolved is the assassination of Srdan Voji&#269;i&#263; 
in 2006. Mr. Voji&#269;i&#263; was the driver of the Montenegrin poet and writer Jevrem Brkovi&#263; 
(who wrote about the relationship between organized crime and public officials). He died 
while reportedly trying to protect Mr. Brkovi&#263; who was being beaten with metal bars by 
three masked assailants. No one has ever been charged in connection with these attacks. 
</p>
<p>29. The daily newspaper <i>Vijesti</i> has been repeatedly affected by attacks against its 
property. On 26 December 2013, an explosive detonated outside the main office of the 
newspaper, below the window of the office of its editor-in-chief. On 13 February 2014 a 
vehicle owned by <i>Vijesti</i> was burned in an apparent arson attack. Similar arson attacks had 
been committed on <i>Vijesti</i> vehicles on at least three earlier occasions: on 14 July 2011 and 
twice on 28 August 2011. To date, two individuals have been prosecuted in relation to the 
event of 26 December, and no suspects have been identified in the other case.  
</p>
<p>30. Journalists working for <i>Vijesti</i> have been directly attacked on repeated occasions. In 
September 2007, &#381;eljko Ivanovi&#263;, one of the founders of the newspaper, was reportedly 
beaten by two men outside a restaurant where the newspaper was celebrating its tenth 
anniversary. Two men were later convicted in this case, but Mr. Ivanovi&#263; maintained that 
the two convicted men bore no resemblance to those who had actually attacked him; he also 
indicated that he suspected the involvement of the authorities.13 In August 2009, after 
photographing the Mayor of Podgorica&#8217;s illegally parked car, an editor and a 
photojournalist from <i>Vijesti </i>were attacked by the Mayor and his son. One person was 
convicted in connection with this case, but irregularities in the police investigation were 
noted.14 In September 2010, five journalists working for <i>Vijesti</i>, including Mr. Ivanovi&#263;, 
received death threats in letters addressed to them individually. Although the police 
indicated that they had undertaken &#8220;intensive activities on resolving the case&#8221;,15 no suspects 
have been identified. 
</p>
<p>31. In March 2012, journalist Olivera Laki&#263;, also working for <i>Vijesti</i>, was physically 
assaulted in front of her house in the centre of Podgorica. Ms. Laki&#263; had written a series of 
articles on the illegal production of cigarettes in the northern town of Mojkovac and had 
been receiving threats for over a year. She was granted police protection after the incident 
and one person identified as the attacker was convicted.16 However, the motives for the 
attack were never fully clarified and she was obliged to stop her activities as an 
investigative journalist. The suspected involvement of public officials in the threats against 
the journalist was not fully clarified either.  
32. As indicated in his thematic report on the protection of journalists,17 for the Special 
Rapporteur an attack against a journalist is not only relevant as an obvious violation of the 
rights of an individual to impart information, but it also undermines the rights of society at 
large to seek and receive information. Moreover, he considers that the failure to undertake 
effective investigations and to prosecute those responsible for attacks against journalists is 
key to the occurrence of new violent episodes which may end in the undermining of the 
work of the entire press. 
</p>
<p>33. The Human Rights Council recently emphasized the vital importance of the safety of 
journalists through its resolution 21/12. States condemned all attacks against journalists in 
the strongest terms and expressed their concern at the impunity of this violence. States also 
committed to promote a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their work

<p>independently and without undue interference, including by means of (a) legislative 
measures; (b) awareness-raising in the judiciary, law enforcement officers and military 
personnel, as well as journalists and civil society, regarding international human rights and 
humanitarian law obligations and commitments relating to the safety of journalists; (c) the 
monitoring and reporting of attacks against journalists; (d) publicly condemning attacks; 
and (e) dedicating necessary resources to investigate and prosecute such attacks. 
34. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that the Montenegrin authorities 
openly recognize the need to address concerns about the safety of journalists as a matter of 
priority and for openness to debate all possible solutions to this serious issue. In the last 
national report for their second cycle during the universal periodic review process, the 
authorities included addressing the impunity of past assaults on journalists as a key 
challenge for the country.18 Six recommendations accepted by Montenegro in the review 
process also directly related to the safety of journalists and the media.  
35. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that in November 2013, the Ministry of 
the Interior established an 11-member commission for monitoring investigations into 
attacks on journalists. The group includes six representatives from the State Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office, Police Administration and Agency for National Security, four journalists &#8211; 
including its chair, the Assistant Chief Editor of <i>Dan</i> &#8211; and a representative of civil society. 
He considers that the careful review of past cases of violence against journalists that remain 
unresolved is not only relevant to the clarification of these cases, but could also inform the 
adoption of additional measures aiming at the prevention of future attacks. In particular, it 
is essential to fully clarify suspicions about the involvement of police or other State 
authorities in all situations of insecurity.  
</p>
<p>36. Besides his concern over the impunity of a large number of attacks against 
journalists, the Special Rapporteur is very disturbed by reports on the use of inflammatory 
statements by some authorities and political leaders against journalists and the media that 
have been critical of them. For example, political leaders have reportedly referred to some 
media groups as being disloyal to the country, and have even predicted the imminent 
closure of these media outlets.19 The Special Rapporteur also received information on 
verbal harassment and physical aggression of journalists attending political rallies. For 
example, on 8 August 2012 <i>Dan</i> journalist Lidija Nik&#269;evi&#263; attended a political party 
meeting in Nik&#353;i&#263; where she was verbally and physically attacked.20 In addition, two other 
journalists were reportedly assaulted in another political gathering on 4 October 2012.21  
37. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, if the atmosphere of intimidation and violence 
against journalists is to end, besides taking bold measures to finally ensure accountability in 
all recorded cases of violence, it is imperative that Montenegrin politicians not only refrain 
from using inflammatory rhetoric against the press that is critical of them, but also openly 
voice their full support for the independence of the media, publicly condemning any form 
of attack against journalists.

</p>
<p><b> 2. Defamation 
</b></p>
<p>38. Laws establishing the crime to defame, insult, slander or libel someone or something 
represent a traditional threat to freedom of expression.22 Therefore, the Special Rapporteur 
notes with appreciation that in 2011 the criminal offences defined in articles 195 (insult) 
and 196 (libel) of the Penal Code of Montenegro have been deleted. Redress in these cases 
can now be found only through civil procedures. In June 2012 a Law on Amnesty of 
Persons Convicted of Insult and Libel was adopted reversing the effects of the sentencing 
of those previously convicted of the criminal offences of insult and libel. He also welcomes 
the adoption by the Supreme Court of a Principal Legal Position which establishes that 
pecuniary compensation for liability in defamation cases should be in line with European 
standards as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights and that the amount of the 
compensation does not discourage journalists and the media from exercising their 
professions.   
</p>
<p>39. A study has noted that, despite huge progress in legislation, close monitoring of the 
court system is needed to ensure that standards used by the European Court of Human 
Rights are fully implemented and to discourage frivolous and politically motivated 
lawsuits.23<b> 
</b></p>
<p>40. A disproportionately high number of initiatives against media enterprises that are 
considered to be critical of the authorities were noted by civil society and the media, in 
particular the daily newspapers, <i>Vijesti</i> and <i>Dan</i> and the weekly <i>Monitor</i>.24 Another review 
indicated that at the end of 2012, there were over 30 complaints pending against the daily 
newspaper <i>Dan</i>, with claims amounting to over 1 million euros; 23 complaints amounting 
to almost 2 million euros against <i>Vijesti</i>, and nine cases against the weekly newspaper 
<i>Monitor</i>, amounting to 200,000 euros.25 
</p>
<p>41. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recalls how important it is for the authorities 
to respect the freedom of the media to investigate their activities and the need to take 
measures to prevent the use of judicial instruments to intimidate critical voices in the press. 
Notably, in a case relating to Montenegro, the European Court of Human Rights has 
already held that: &#8220;Senior civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider 
limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals.&#8221;26 
</p>
<p>42. Despite the Supreme Court decision to limit compensation in line with international 
standards, concerns remain with regard to the possibility of imposition of excessive 
monetary awards by civil courts, particularly considering the levels of payment of local 
journalists (compensation may amount to 14,000 euros when the average annual wage is 
less than this).27 The recurrent use of courts against certain media also threatens the 
economic capacity of these vehicles.

<p>43. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that another recent 
ruling of the European Court of Human Rights28 was used as a reference by the 
Montenegrin Constitutional Court while reviewing a previous sentence of the Supreme 
Court. According to the decision by the European Court of November 2011, the amount of 
damages and costs imposed on the journalist Veseljko Koprivica by the Montenegrin 
Supreme Court was disproportionate to the legitimate aim served and thus in violation of 
article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Government interference in the media 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Media Law requires print media in Montenegro to be privately owned. 
Nevertheless, the State continues to own and fund the<i> Pobjeda</i> newspaper. Several attempts 
to privatize this daily paper have failed in the last few years. Its low daily circulation and 
high debt levels are reported to have discouraged bidders.  
</p>
<p>45. Continued Government ownership of this newspaper is particularly concerning as 
the editorial content of <i>Pobjeda </i>is widely regarded as having a pro-Government bias, 
including during electoral periods.29 The extreme polarization that marks relations between 
media groups in the country (see also the subsection below) is often politicized by the 
perception of the use of <i>Pobjeda</i> as a vehicle to promote the work of the Government and to 
discredit media groups taking a critical view of the authorities30 &#8211; for example, <i>Pobjeda</i> 
publicly reported what it considered to be examples of wrongdoing by people affiliated 
with <i>Vijesti</i> and <i>Monitor</i> (two of the main publications that maintain a critical tone against 
the ruling authorities). 
46. The Special Rapporteur received complaints that the Government was unfairly 
subsidizing <i>Pobjeda</i> by directly and indirectly placing public advertising, and unduly 
controlling its editorial policies. A study showed that 91 per cent of all government 
advertising in the local print media was allocated to <i>Pobjeda</i>, although the <i>Pobjeda</i> 
management reported that this represented only 15 per cent of its revenues.31 There were 
also complaints that a detailed assessment on the distribution of State resources among 
different media outlets was difficult as the Government failed to provide updated and 
disaggregated information on overall public expenditure on advertising.  
</p>
<p>47. As much as the Special Rapporteur appreciates the challenges involved in the 
transfer of <i>Pobjeda</i> to private hands, he considers that this move is urgently required to 
prevent further politicization of the media and to promote pluralism. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur underscores the importance of ensuring full transparency and fair 
allocation of public resources in media activities, given the risk that these resources might 
become a tool for political pressure. As indicated in Human Rights Committee general 
comment No. 34 (2011): Care must be taken to ensure that systems of government subsidy 
to media outlets and the placing of government advertisements are not employed to the 
effect of impeding freedom of expression. Furthermore, private media must not be put at a 
disadvantage compared to public media in such matters as access to means of 
dissemination/distribution and access to news.32

</p>
<p>48. In addition concerns were raised with regard to the lack of independence of the 
public broadcasting services. Reforms in the functioning of the public broadcaster were 
recently implemented with the reported aim of ensuring self-sustainability. However it was 
noted that professionalism and independence of the public broadcaster have not yet been 
fully achieved.33 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur considers that Council of Europe 
recommendation No. R (96) 10 on the guarantee of the independence of public service 
broadcasting provides very useful guidance on the concrete requirements needed to ensure 
full editorial independence of public services.  
</p>
<p>49. Finally concerns exist with regard to the independence and capacity of the Agency 
for Electronic Media. In January 2013, amendments to the Law on Electronic Media 
established the requirement for the Agency to transfer any budget surplus to the State 
budget. Parliament also obliged the Agency to amend its financial plan for 2013. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that these measures can undermine the financial autonomy 
and capacity required of this regulatory body, exposing it to political interference.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Polarization of the media  
</b></p>
<p>50. In his meetings with media editors, journalists, civil society and government 
representatives, the Special Rapporteur was very concerned by the level of polarization that 
exists in the Montenegrin media. He was encouraged by the fact that all major media 
outlets agreed to attend a joint meeting organized during his visit with all media, but regrets 
the great level of animosity which disrupted the debate at times.  
</p>
<p>51. Montenegro has a relatively diverse media landscape, particularly considering the 
size of the country. However, media groups appear to be divided between those taking a 
critical position against the ruling authorities (particularly, the above-mentioned daily 
newspapers <i>Vijesti </i>and <i>Dan</i> and the weekly <i>Monitor</i>) and those taking a more supportive 
view.  
</p>
<p>52. Almost all interlocutors during the visit recognized that the great polarization and 
politicization of the media directly affected efforts towards self-regulation. In 2003 a code 
of ethics for journalists was adopted, but since then efforts to put in place a common self-
regulatory body have failed. In March 2012, the Media Council for Self-Regulation was 
founded by representatives of 18 print, broadcasting and Internet media outlets in 
Montenegro. <i>Vijesti</i>, <i>Dan</i> and the weekly <i>Monitor</i> refused to join the process. In 2013 
<i>Vijesti</i> established an ombudsman for its readers. 
53. In the recent analysis of self-regulatory efforts it was noted that the existing 
mechanisms did not provide satisfactory responses.34 The work of the existing bodies is 
neither well known nor publicized and the independence of these bodies from the owners of 
the media is not well ensured. The only active body, the Media Council for Self-Regulation 
appears to contradict the notion of self-regulation by focusing a great deal of attention on 
media outlets which are not affiliated to this entity: between 2012 and 2013 only 11 per 
cent of the violations reported by this body were committed by its members, the remaining 
89 per cent were committed by non-members.35

<p>54. The lack of success in self-regulatory efforts is aggravating concerns relating to the 
bad quality of some of the work done by the media. There have been complaints made, for 
example, with regard to the disclosure of the identity of children and incidents of hate 
speech. Despite regulations providing for a right of reply, it has also been alleged that some 
media have refused at times to acknowledge and publicly correct serious mistakes even 
after complaints had been made.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the media is responsible for maintaining high 
professional and ethical standards through voluntary self-regulation. Furthermore he notes 
that the voluntary nature of regulatory efforts must be preserved to secure the necessary 
independence of the media. In this regard, he urges the media to engage in dialogue in order 
to either strengthen the existing self-regulating body, or at least, to establish an operative 
self-regulating mechanism of their individual choice.  
</p>
<p>56. The lack of solidarity in the highly polarized media landscape has additional 
consequences for the journalistic profession as a whole. Montenegro has several journalist 
associations (including the Association of Professional Reporters of Montenegro, the 
Association of Reporters of Montenegro, and the Society of Reporters of Montenegro). 
However, it was noted that those entities were mostly ineffective. The absence of a strong 
union to act on behalf of journalists is thought to undermine their capacity to bargain for 
improved wages and working conditions.36  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Access to information 
</b></p>
<p>57. As indicated above, in line with international standards regarding the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, Montenegro establishes the right to access information 
held by public authorities in its Constitution (art. 51). Montenegro reaffirmed its 
commitment to ensure the right to access information by signing the Council of Europe 
Convention on Access to Official Documents in 2009.  
</p>
<p>58. In February 2013 the Law on Free Access to Information entered into force in 
Montenegro. The Law enables people or legal entities to request access to information held 
in any form by State and local authorities, public companies, and other entities exercising 
public powers, subject to the exceptions noted in the Constitution. The Law also created a 
supervisory body called the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to 
Information.37 This entity is mandated to act as an appeal body for access to information 
requests.  
</p>
<p>59. The establishment of obligations to proactively disclose information, of penalties in 
case the information is not issued rightfully and the establishment of a public entity 
mandated to process information requests were regarded as particularly positive advances 
in the new normative framework.  
</p>
<p>60. Despite these positive developments, concerns were expressed regarding the 
doubling of the deadline for responding for information requests and the prevalence of 
frequent excuses for secrecy established in other laws.38 Civil society also indicated that 
despite the advances in legislation, a culture of secrecy was still frequently present among

</p>
<p>public entities. In 2012 an organization submitted over 7,000 requests for information and 
reported receiving 48 per cent of the documents requested.39 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur received complaints that courts were not disclosing 
information on their activities and decisions adequately nor promptly. The European Union 
noted that most court decisions have become publicly accessible but are not published in a 
timely manner.40 In March 2013, guidelines on access to information were adopted by the 
Supreme Court. The Special Rapporteur underlines that with very few exceptions, court 
cases are matters of public interest and must be open to public reporting. Similarly, but 
more importantly, all court verdicts must be published in their entirety, and only redacted in 
accordance with the relevant laws.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur has indicated, in his most recent report to the General 
Assembly (A/68/362), that the adoption of national laws on access to information should be 
understood as the first step in a broader process. Political will; an active civil society 
advocating and monitoring implementation of those norms; and overall respect for the rule 
of law are all essential components for the effective implementation of norms on access to 
information. In this regard, he understands that it is particularly vital to secure adequate 
support and full independence for the newly established Agency for the Protection of 
Personal Data and Free Access to Information so it can fully exercise its mandate as a 
catalyser for the implementation of the existing norms. The Agency should not only be 
capable of processing cases effectively, but should also publicly report on all its activities, 
enabling the general public to regularly assess overall institutional compliance with the law.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Incitement to hatred  
</b></p>
<p>63. The Constitution of Montenegro prohibits incitement to or instigation of hatred or 
intolerance on any ground, as well as any direct or indirect discrimination on any ground. 
The anti-discrimination law (2010) also specifies the mechanisms for protection against 
discrimination. The Media Law further establishes the prohibition of publishing 
information and opinions that incite to discrimination, hatred or violence against a person 
or a group of persons on the ground of their sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>64. Given the ethnic and cultural diversity that marks Montenegrin society, it is critical 
to guarantee that all minorities have their right to expression protected and promoted. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the reports on the financial support provided by 
the Ministry of Culture for the production of media content related to minorities and 
vulnerable groups. However, he underlines the fact that the allocation of public funds for 
any media or content production should be independently administered.  
</p>
<p>65. Despite the legal framework, episodes of discriminatory statements in the media and 
among the political leadership can be noted with some frequency and require dedicated 
attention. In 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
expressed concern at sex-discriminatory statements made by politicians and that the media 
often conveyed stereotyped and sometimes degrading images of women.41 Discriminatory 
statements also target minority groups, such as the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians (RAE) 
and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals.

<p>66. The Special Rapporteur received numerous reports on attacks against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender people. The European Union noted that activists defending the 
rights of sexual monitories are still exposed to discrimination; it also indicated that violence 
against LGBTI individuals continued to increase in the country with impunity, as attacks 
are rarely reported; and criminal offences of that type are not properly prosecuted.42 
</p>
<p>67. Attempts by the LGBT community to conduct peaceful demonstrations have been 
challenged by violence. In October 2013, it was reported that 2,000 police officers were 
deployed to ensure the safety of participants in a gay pride demonstration in Podgorica. In 
July, around 200 demonstrators clashed with police in the town of Budva as they tried to 
cross the blockade protecting 40 marchers calling for LGBT rights. Zdravko Cimbaljevic, 
the founder and director of the organization, LGBT Forum Progress, was granted asylum in 
Canada in November 2013 based on the assessment that Montenegro was unable to protect 
him, because the State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had failed to properly treat numerous cases of 
hatred and threats addressed against him in the country. A survey conducted in 2009 
indicated that 70 per cent of the Montenegrin population considered homosexuality to be an 
illness.43  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the authorities have formally 
recognized the need to enhance measures to protect sexual minorities from discrimination 
and violence. He also notes with appreciation the inclusion in the national plan for 
implementation of the Law on Prohibition of Discrimination of initiatives to sensitize the 
media and to disseminate anti-discrimination messages through the media. Attention to the 
enforcement of national norms and to the implementation of sensitization strategies will be 
crucial in promoting a shift in the recurrent disturbing levels of hostility against the LGBT 
community. Moreover, beyond formal announcements, it is essential to have the country&#8217;s 
authorities publicly state their open rejection of all forms of incitement to hatred, in 
particular hate messages targeting sexual minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Restrictions on public demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>69. Although protected by the Constitution, public demonstrations have been reportedly 
prevented or unduly restricted by the authorities in Montenegro. The Public Assembly Act 
establishes that the competent authority (the police) may prohibit a peaceful assembly if it 
has not been properly notified. However, concerns were noted at the conversion of the 
requirement for notification into a de facto authorization process. In 2010, it was reported 
that the Montenegrin Police Directorate had rendered 78 decisions prohibiting a peaceful 
assembly by invoking the Public Assembly Act in order to prevent risks to traffic safety and 
to the movement and work of a larger number of citizens.44 Civil society organizations are 
challenging the constitutionality of these legal restrictions to demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur notes that the right to freedom of expression includes all 
forms that persons can choose to express their views and opinions. This includes the right 
to conduct peaceful demonstrations. In this regard, he expresses concern at the repeated 
decisions prohibiting demonstrations and urges the Montenegrin police to make greater 
efforts to manage traffic around demonstrations, and address any other security concerns 
that may exist, in order to ensure that restrictions to this constitutional right occur only on 
exceptional occasions.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the openness to dialogue 
demonstrated by the Montenegrin authorities when discussing the concerns described 
in the present report. He notes that Montenegro repeatedly stated its commitment to 
ensure the realization of the right to freedom of opinion and expression as established 
by international standards and recognized that, in that context, important steps had 
already been taken to improve legislation and institute policy guidance. However, a 
number of obstacles continue to undermine the complete translation of the 
commitments stated into practice.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Despite pledges to ensure the safety of the press, the continued impunity of 
notorious cases of violence against journalists perpetuates a sense of insecurity which 
can frequently intimidate the media in the country. This feeling is further aggravated 
by the perception that investigative journalists and media enterprises that are 
regarded as critical of the Government seem to be disproportionately victimized by 
attacks.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Commitments to promote pluralism and the quality of the media seem to be 
affected by extremely high levels of polarization among media outlets. In particular, 
the direct involvement of the Government as the owner of a printed newspaper and 
the constant clashes between authorities and some media outlets have resulted in the 
frequent politicization of the work of the media. Similarly, the progress represented 
by the decriminalization of defamation may be undermined if courts continue to 
implement excessive fines and fail to stop frivolous litigation.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Progress in the adoption of norms protecting against all forms of 
discrimination has its impact limited by the failure to protect groups particularly 
targeted by discriminatory statements such as the LGBT community. In particular, 
anti-discrimination efforts may be easily undermined if political authorities not only 
fail to publicly condemn all forms of discrimination, but also occasionally resort to 
some sort of discriminatory remark in their own political statements.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur proposes the following 
recommendations.

<p><b> 1. Ensure the protection of journalists and the media against violence 
</b>76. <b>The identification of responsibilities in all cases of violence and intimidation 
against journalists must be achieved without delay, so perpetrators are brought to 
justice. In particular, adequate resources must be provided to ensure that the recently 
established commission for monitoring investigations into attacks on journalists fully 
succeeds in its task. Specific attention must be given to the clarification of the 
potential direct or indirect involvement of the authorities or public officials in all 
episodes of violence.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The authorities should value the work of the investigative press in their 
statements and refrain from attacking it. Particular attention must be paid to 
ensuring accountability in episodes of violence against the press by members of 
political parties. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Ensure courts adequately apply international standards regarding defamation  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The work of Montenegrin courts that are implementing the new national norm 
for defamation must be closely monitored to ensure that complaints of defamation are 
not used to intimidate the press. Courts must be systematically made aware of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards relating to the imposition of penalties for defamation. The 
authorities must respect the freedom of the media to investigate their activities and 
refrain from using judicial instruments on defamation to intimidate critical voices in 
the press. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Prevent Government interference in the media 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Government must urgently conclude the transfer of <i>Pobjeda</i> to private 
hands, as its continued ownership of this daily newspaper and the perceived political 
bias in its editorial line contribute to the politicization of the national media. The 
Government should also ensure full transparency with regard to the allocation of 
public resources in advertising by guaranteeing their fair distribution across all 
media. The autonomy and full independence of the public broadcasting services and 
of the Agency for Electronic Media must be ensured on a permanent basis. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Overcome media polarization and support all efforts to promote self-regulation 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>A better dialogue among all media outlets is essential to permit a more 
objective discussion on the challenges faced by this vital sector. All media groups must 
be stimulated to voluntarily take part in self-regulatory initiatives, to pay particular 
attention to the elimination of discriminatory remarks and to improving the quality of 
the work currently being developed. To be effective, self-regulatory bodies must have 
their work well publicized among readers and viewers, so these may file complaints, if 
desired. The staff that support self-regulatory initiatives must have their 
independence from media owners preserved. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Enhance access to information 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Adequate financial and human resources must be secured for the newly 
established Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to 
Information so it can fully implement its mandate with autonomy and independence. 
The Agency should be capable of processing all requests effectively and also 
systematically report on institutional compliance with the law. Investments must be 
made to make civil society aware of the procedures for requesting information and to 
enhance the capacity of all public entities to comply with the law through technical 
support and training.</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Promote diversity and non-discrimination and ensure responses to all forms of 
incitement to hatred  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The State must actively promote the right to expression of minorities, ensuring 
the full independence of those benefiting from financial resources. Law enforcement 
authorities must fully implement national norms regarding the prohibition of 
discrimination on all grounds. Specific attention must be paid to the recurrently high 
levels of hostility against the LGBT community. In particular acts of aggression 
against this community must be fully investigated. The authorities must publicly 
express their complete rejection of all forms of incitement to hatred. Efforts to 
promote the self-regulation of the media should also play an important role in 
ensuring better protection against incitement to hatred through the media.
