</p>
<p>mind the importance of the Optional Protocols to the Convention, as well as other 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments,

<p>against humanity and war crimes, calling upon States not to grant amnesties for such

</p>
<p>remains critical and convinced that urgent and effective national and international

<p>action is called for,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that regional instruments should contribute to the strengthening of the 
</p>
<p>norms of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,

</p>

<p>particularly children, and that as such should be strengthened; that it is entitled to 
</p>
<p>receive comprehensive protection and support; that the primary responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>protection, upbringing and development of children rests with the family; that all 
</p>
<p>institutions of society should respect children&#8217;s rights and secure their well-being and

<p> <i>Underlining</i> the need for mainstreaming a gender perspective and recognizing 
</p>
<p>the child as a rights holder, in all policies and programmes relating to children,

<p>use of force with consequences, which are often irreversible for their physical and 
</p>
<p>emotional integrity,

<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that environmental damage has potentially negative effects on 
</p>
<p>children and their enjoyment of their life, health and a satisfactory standard of living,  
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with appreciation</i> of the attention paid to children in the 
</p>

</p>
<p>factors that may lead to disparities, and other statistical indicators at the national, 
</p>
<p>subregional, regional and international levels to develop and assess social policies and
