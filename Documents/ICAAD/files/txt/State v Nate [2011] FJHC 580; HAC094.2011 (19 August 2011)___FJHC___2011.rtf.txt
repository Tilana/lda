Following the trial lasting for 10 days, the assessors have returned with the verdict of guilty on all 3 Counts mentioned in the information against the 1st Accused Semi Nate and 2nd Accused Meli Valetiri.

2.      
During the trial the Learned DPP had entered Nolle Prosequi against the 3rd Accused and he was discharged by this Court.

4.      
I adjourned to consider my judgment. I direct myself in accordance with the law contained in my summing up which I made to the assessors today.

5.      
At the beginning of the trial a voir dire inquiry was held to determine the admissibility of the statement made by the 1st and 2nd Accused to the Police at the caution interview. Both accused persons had admitted their participation in the offence. After carefully considering the evidence this court had permitted the prosecution to adduce the statements as evidence in Court.

6.      
When the trial was taken up the 1st Accused and 2nd Accused submitted that the statements were taken under assault, threat and intimidation but the assessors unanimously disbelieved the same and accepted the contents of the statements.

7.      
This Court finds that the Prosecution had proved the case against the 1st and 2nd Accused persons beyond reasonable doubt.

8.      
This Court finds the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. This Court accepts their verdict.

9.      
Considering all this Court finds both the 1st Accused Semi Nate and 2nd Accused Meli Valetiri guilty as charged.

10.     
Accordingly this Court convicts the 1st Accused Semi Nate and the 2nd Accused Meli Valetiri as charged in the information.
