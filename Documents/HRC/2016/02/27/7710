<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Chad was held at the 13th meeting on 
29 October 2013. The delegation of Chad was headed by Raoul Laouna Gong, Minister of 
Human Rights and the Promotion of Fundamental Freedoms. At its 18th meeting, held on 
31 October 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Chad. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Chad: Benin, Ecuador and the United Arab 
Emirates. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Chad: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/TCD/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/TCD/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/TCD/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Slovenia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to Chad through the 
troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation began by describing the importance Chad attached to human rights 
issues and its great willingness to meet all the commitments that it had freely entered into.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation then drew attention to the establishment in 2005 of a Ministry of 
Human Rights and listed several conventions and treaties signed and ratified by Chad in 
</p><p>2009. They included the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime; the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its 
Optional Protocol; the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. In addition, Chad had ratified several legal instruments at the regional 
level.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation reported that significant progress had been made in incorporating the 
provisions of international instruments ratified by Chad into domestic law. Accordingly, </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-10021 
</p>
<p>several pieces of national legislation had been enacted while others were in the process of 
being adopted, such as the Personal and Family Code, the Criminal Code, the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Child Protection Code 
and the Code of Conduct for Soldiers. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation explained that the national report was the result of a multi-agency, 
participatory process. The report had been drafted by the interministerial committee to 
monitor the implementation of international human rights instruments (made up of 
representatives of various ministries, civil society, the National Human Rights Commission 
and resource persons) and by human rights associations. It had then been adopted by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation noted that the Government, in collaboration with the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), had taken a series of actions and measures concerning children 
in armed conflict. In that regard, the delegation mentioned in particular the plans to train 
400 members of the contingents for Mali and the Central African Republic before the end 
of the year; missions to check the age of soldiers, conducted jointly by the Government and 
the United Nations, in security and defence zones; a programme for family reunification 
and the reintegration of children withdrawn from armed forces and armed groups, and the 
appointment of a focal point in the Ministry of Defence for the implementation of the plan 
of action.  
</p>
<p>10. With regard to trafficking in children, the delegation stated that there was no 
trafficking as such in Chad but that some situations that were tantamount to trafficking 
were punished if they came to the attention of the government authorities (for example, the 
Zo&#233;&#8217;s Ark case). The delegation also mentioned that an order providing for the 
establishment of an interministerial technical committee to combat trafficking in persons 
had been issued on 17 October 2013. The Committee would be responsible, inter alia, for 
monitoring compliance with obligations in relation to trafficking in persons, proposing 
amendments to national legislation to bring it into line with international instruments and 
coordinating the activities of the relevant departments. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation also reported that a draft decree regulating child labour was in the 
process of being adopted to supplement and clarify the provisions on the protection of 
children contained in the Labour Code. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation recalled that the duration of police custody was 48 hours, and that it 
could be extended to 72 hours by the prosecutor. In order to protect citizens&#8217; rights, the 
draft Code of Criminal Procedure provided that legal assistance should be available during 
that period and that pretrial detention was 6 months for ordinary offences and 1 year for 
serious offences.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation noted that press offences had been decriminalized under the Act of 
31 November 2010. Freedom of the press was guaranteed by a number of legal and 
institutional mechanisms introduced by the Government. Journalists were, however, 
expected to practise their profession without inciting citizens to hatred or violence. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to women, the delegation noted that the Government had taken a 
number of actions to strengthen the protection of women&#8217;s rights. For example, a national 
gender policy and a national strategy to combat gender-based violence had been approved. 
The delegation also reported that the Government had established penalties for the 
perpetrators of violence against women in articles 325 ff. of the draft Criminal Code. 
Penalties for the perpetrators of female genital mutilation had also been provided for in that 
draft. It was specified, however, that female genital mutilation was practised by only a few 
ethnic groups in Chad, and that the Government had wished to introduce penalties in its 
national legislation in order to comply with its international obligations. The delegation also 
mentioned a number of measures taken for women, including a national campaign to </p>


<p>GE.14-10021 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>combat all forms of violence against women, the increasing empowerment of women in 
decision-making bodies and the construction of a women&#8217;s centre in N&#8217;Djamena to 
strengthen women&#8217;s capacity to exercise their rights. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation noted that, with the support of the European Union, Chad had 
undertaken an in-depth reform of the justice system through the Programme to Support 
Justice in Chad (PRAJUST). The delegation mentioned, inter alia, the construction of court 
buildings, the establishment of a legal aid centre to assist disadvantaged people in legal 
proceedings; the construction or refurbishment of more than 10 detention centres; the 
launch of an information and public awareness-raising campaign on access to the law and 
to justice; specific measures for the social reintegration of prisoners; the establishment of a 
national institute for judicial training (with a course for training prison administrators, 
supervisors and warders); and a review of all of the existing codes, including the draft 
Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that, although considerable progress had been made, much 
remained to be done given the variety of difficulties faced, including ingrained 
sociocultural attitudes, limited financial resources and the lack of qualified human 
resources. However, despite those difficulties, Chad was committed to stepping up its 
efforts and allocating all available resources to ensure that the promotion and protection of 
human rights were an absolute priority for the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>23. Thailand commended Chad for its ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography and its initiatives to strengthen prisoners&#8217; rights. It remained concerned about 
discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS and requested information on the number of 
people living with HIV/AIDS and relevant measures that had been adopted. Thailand urged 
the international community assist Chad and encouraged Chad to continue engaging with 
the United Nations treaty bodies. It made recommendations. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.14-10021 
</p>
<p>24. Togo commended Chad for its commitment to settling conflict and ensuring lasting 
peace. It noted improvements resulting from the ratification of international instruments 
such as the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Togo made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Tunisia encouraged intensified efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women and urged OHCHR and the international community to respond to requests from 
Chad for technical assistance, including opening an OHCHR office in N&#8217;Djamena. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Turkey commended the Government for its commitment to national dialogue on

made recommendations. 
</p>

sexual violence against women and girls, the lack of resources for policing in refugee 
hosting areas and persistently poor prison conditions and treatment of prisoners. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Uruguay noted the ratification of international human rights instruments, efforts to 
protect boys, girls and adolescents, legislative developments to strengthen the rule of law, 
and the pending bill to strengthen the National Human Rights Commission. Uruguay made

recommendation. 
</p>
<p>32. Viet Nam noted the close cooperation between Chad and international organizations, 
particularly regarding children&#8217;s rights, and its work with the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF) to combat the recruitment of child soldiers. It encouraged Chad to increase 
efforts to ensure human rights were respected and urged international and regional bodies to 
provide close cooperation. Viet Nam also noted the National Strategy to Combat Gender 
Violence. 
</p>

international community for capacity-building and technical assistance. Algeria made 
recommendations.

opposition parties in ensuring democracy. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Azerbaijan welcomed the ratification of the United Nations Convention against

</p>
<p>44. Brazil praised the ratification of international instruments on children&#8217;s rights and

<p><b>8</b> GE.14-10021 
</p>
<p>information on the effectiveness of policies to tackle food insecurity. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Burkina Faso commended the Government for its ongoing inclusive social dialogue 
and for extending a permanent invitation to the special procedures. It called on the 
international community to support Chad in its efforts to promote and protect human rights. 
It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>46. The delegation had taken note of the questions put by States in their interventions 
concerning women and children, justice reform, making the National Human Rights 
Commission compliant with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for 
the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (Paris Principles), journalists and prisoners, 
and people living with HIV. The delegation pointed out that Chad had made major efforts 
to address all those problems. However, the delegation added that it had not come to the 
meeting simply to say that everything had been achieved and that there were no 
implementation problems. In Chad, as in all countries emerging from a period of unrest, 
everything was a priority. It was difficult to promote and protect human rights if the reform 
of the administration remained unresolved, if justice reform was not complete and if the 
security services and the army were not under control. Despite the pressure to address all its 
priorities, human rights had always been a key concern for the Government of Chad. The 
delegation also noted that sociocultural attitudes could not be changed overnight nor would 
they disappear simply because a decree or a law was enacted. Changing traditions took 
time.  
</p>
<p>47. With regard to justice reform, the delegation explained that the national institute for 
the judiciary had been set up by the Government of Chad with a view to strengthening 
national rights and ensuring that judges were aware of rights under domestic law and under 
international law adopted by Chad. 
</p>
<p>48. The delegation noted that Chad had launched a full-scale birth registration campaign 
and that a national programme to regularize civil status records throughout the country was 
under way. As a result, 200,000 births had been registered in 2013. 
</p>
<p>49. With regard to the possibility of discrimination against persons living with HIV, the 
delegation stated that there was a law to protect persons living with HIV.  
</p>
<p>50. With regard to the press, the delegation recalled that the order of 2008, which had 
given rise to discussion, debate and controversy, had been amended in 2010. That law was 
not perfect, and if it emerged that changes were necessary, they would be made in the 
interests of democracy and the protection of human rights. In addition, discussions were 
under way with the relevant professional associations as to whether any changes were 
necessary.  
</p>
<p>51. In response to a number of speakers who had called on Chad to continue the reform 
of the National Human Rights Commission to ensure that it was in compliance with the 
Paris Principles, the delegation said that there was no cause for concern. The bill was with 
the Council of Ministers and would be adopted before the end of 2013. The bill had been 
delayed because the Government had wanted to achieve a consensus in all sectors.  
</p>
<p>52. With regard to food policy, the delegation mentioned that the Government had 
launched a Millennium Development Goals acceleration framework in September 2013 
with a view to eradicating food insecurity and reducing malnutrition rates. However, much 
remained to be done if the people of Chad were to be able to feed themselves adequately.  
</p>
<p>53. The delegation noted that political dialogue was inclusive and that the opposition as 
a whole was represented in the National Framework for Political Dialogue. Civil society, 
trade unions, women&#8217;s associations and human rights associations were also represented in 
the National Framework. The Framework was in the process of preparing the Independent </p>


<p>GE.14-10021 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>National Electoral Commission, made up of 17 members from the majority, 17 members of 
the opposition and 6 members from civil society. The delegation stressed that the 
democratic process was progressing, that there was real political debate, and that all 
political opinions, both from the majority and from the opposition, were represented.  
</p><p>54. In addition, the delegation reported that there was ongoing dialogue between the 
Government and trade unions in order to avoid crises and to organize meetings to find 
solutions to concerns as they arose. 
</p>
<p>55. Returning to questions on the press, the delegation noted that in any new democracy, 
the press was not entirely sure of its role in the democratic process and that even the 
Government was still finding its way in that area. As a result, conflicts could arise, but the 
courts were in place to set things on the right track if necessary, or to deal with complaints 
&#8212; often lodged by individuals &#8212; and the judicial system had demonstrated its 
independence in that area. The delegation stressed that the Government understood that a 
free press served the interests of democracy and the people. However, journalists had to be 
trained and the Government was working for that, through the Higher Council for 
Communication, which was made up of representatives of the press, the Government and 
the National Assembly. There was also a professional association that reprimanded 
members if the press made mistakes. 
</p>
<p>56. With regard to violence against women, the delegation drew attention to the 
establishment of a national coordinating body for prevention and protection pursuant to an 
order issued in 2010. Such violence was now punishable but there was also a need to raise 
public awareness, as nothing would be achieved if punishment was not accompanied by 
education. Accordingly, the Government had launched a national awareness-raising 
campaign based on publications such as &#8220;United against violence against women&#8221; and the 
Code of Conduct for Soldiers. 
</p>
<p>57. Burundi welcomed achievements in health, especially involving women, children 
and people living with HIV/AIDS. It noted measures to combat discrimination against 
women and gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation (FGM). Burundi 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. Canada asked Chad to detail its measures to combat the recruitment and use of 
children by armed groups and to facilitate their reintegration. It recognized the importance 
of the country&#8217;s commitment to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated 
Stabilization Mission in Mali. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Cape Verde noted the accession to international human rights instruments, including 
the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the positive impact of 
human rights legislation and national plans to combat child recruitment and violence 
against women and ensure gender equality. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. The Central African Republic commended Chad for its cooperation with UNICEF in 
combating the recruitment of child soldiers, its national strategy incorporating women&#8217;s 
concerns over gender-based violence and the building or refurbishment of hospitals offering 
free emergency care to all, without discrimination, and health-care facilities. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>61. China acknowledged the Government&#8217;s plans to enhance economic, social and 
agricultural and environmental development, and to promote equality and reduce poverty. It 
recognized the signing of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. China made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Comoros commended Chad for strengthening political dialogue as a means of 
extending civil peace and constitutional order, promoting the right to education and access </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-10021 
</p>
<p>to justice, and working to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. The Congo noted that Chad had acceded to several international human rights 
instruments, implemented a programme supporting judicial reform and adopted a national 
human rights action plan and a policy to combat the use of children in armed conflict. It 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Costa Rica welcomed the establishment of the interministerial follow-up committee 
on international agreements and the training school for judges. It urged Chad to establish its 
National Human Rights Commission, despite limited human and financial resources, and to 
institute a moratorium on the death penalty. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire welcomed reforms to improve human rights, particularly on security, 
health, education and the judicial and prison systems, and praised the initiatives to promote 
social dialogue, reduce poverty and increase press freedom. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Cuba noted the priority given to combating poverty, inequality and social exclusion 
and to environmental protection, rural development and building economic infrastructure. It 
welcomed the alignment of education policy to the MDGs. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. The Czech Republic welcomed the signature of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. It was concerned about violence, corruption, prison 
overcrowding and conditions, the continuing harassment of human rights defenders and 
journalists and repression of freedom of expression, the weak enforcement of the ban on 
FGM and sexual violence perpetrated by peacekeeping forces. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. The Democratic Republic of the Congo commended Chad for the major reforms it 
had instituted, including in the legal and institutional frameworks, in response to the first 
cycle of UPR recommendations. It noted that protection of vulnerable groups, especially 
women and children, had been strengthened. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Djibouti noted measures adopted for vulnerable groups. It encouraged Chad to 
continue fighting all forms of discrimination, especially against women and children. It 
asked what measures had been adopted to monitor the implementation of the National 
Gender Policy. Djibouti made a recommendation. 
</p><p>70. Egypt welcomed measures to promote and protect civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights, including those of women and children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Ethiopia noted the implementation of a number of recommendations from the first 
UPR cycle and the commitment of Chad to the UPR. It welcomed measures to uphold and 
strengthen civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including those of women 
and children. Ethiopia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. France welcomed the efforts made since the first UPR cycle, including signing the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and committing to prohibit the 
recruitment of child soldiers. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Gabon welcomed the legislative amendment on the creation of the National Human 
Rights Commission bringing it into line with the Paris Principles. It encouraged further 
reforms to strengthen economic, social, cultural and women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. It 
called upon the international community to support Chad in implementing the UPR 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Switzerland commended Chad for its cooperation with the Extraordinary African 
Chambers under Senegalese jurisdiction, but was concerned about the independence of the 
judiciary. It commended Chad for not having applied the death penalty since 2003. It was </p>


<p>GE.14-10021 <b>11 
</b></p>

<p>102. In response to the question on child soldiers, the delegation recalled that the 
Government had worked with a special United Nations team to carry out checks in at least 
eight security and defence zones in the country. There were no longer any child soldiers 
and steps would be taken to ensure that there never would be again. However, the issue 
remained a challenge for Chad, as it was not enough to withdraw child soldiers, they had to

reintegration was successful.

to enact legislation, but that attitudes needed to be changed and that, when the time was 
right, the State would decide what it needed to do in that regard.  
</p>
<p>105. The delegation also stressed the problem of the weight of custom and tradition, 
which was a constraint on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. The reason for the delay in 
introducing legislation in that area was that it was necessary to work on changing mindsets 
before laws were enacted. Legislative measures should reflect the will of the people.  
</p>
<p>106. With respect to the events of February 2008, the delegation noted that it was a 
judicial problem and that the Chadian authorities had provided the resources for the justice 
system to carry out investigations entirely independently. Efforts had also been made to 
compensate the victims of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>107. The delegation said that the authorities had approved the national gender policy, 
which would soon be formally adopted. With regard to violence against women, awareness-
raising campaigns had been conducted in all regions of the country in cooperation with the 
United Nations Population Fund. 
</p>
<p>108. With regard to education, the delegation reported that the 1996 law provided for free 
public education and promoted girls&#8217; education. In addition, the Government had begun a 
reform of the education system and set up a mechanism for pooling resources, an agency 
for the promotion of community education initiatives to which the State, partners and 
parents&#8217; associations contributed resources for the running of schools according to their </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.14-10021 
</p>
<p>needs. Progress was also being made in the area of literacy, and the authorities would be 
taking steps to create a literacy support fund.  
</p>
<p>109. On the subject of health, the delegation noted that 13 per cent of the national budget 
was allocated to health, and thanked Cuba for having made 47 doctors available to Chad 
and agreed to train 157 Chadian doctors.
