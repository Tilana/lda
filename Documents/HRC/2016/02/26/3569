</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Human Rights Council adopted, at its fourteenth session, resolution 14/5 on the 
role of prevention in the promotion and protection of human rights. By this resolution, the 
Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to consult States, national human rights institutions (NHRIs), civil society and 
other relevant stakeholders, using a questionnaire format, on the conceptual and practical 
dimensions of prevention with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights, and 
to compile and publish the responses. Building on that research, the Council further 
requested that OHCHR convene a workshop, based on the information gathered from the 
questionnaire, to further explore the role of prevention in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and to present a summary of the workshop proceedings to the Council at its 
eighteenth session. 
</p>
<p> The questionnaire, circulated to States, NHRIs and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), received 53 responses regarding, inter alia, the legal framework of States, 
functional capacity needs, core promotion and protection activities, priority thematic areas, 
addressing the Millennium Development Goals from a human rights perspective, rule of

 &#8727; Late submission. 
 ** All references to Kosovo, whether to the territory, institutions or population, shall be 
</p>
<p>understood in the context of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), and without prejudice 
to the status of Kosovo. 
</p>

<p>law and democracy, statistics and data collection, participation rates in the international 
human rights system, and interaction with NGOs. 
</p>
<p> Building on the findings from the questionnaire, OHCHR held a workshop 
exploring the question of prevention in the context of the promotion and protection of 
human rights. It was structured around the prevention of torture and ill-treatment and the 
prevention of human rights violations related to human trafficking and migration, in order 
to allow for the findings related to structural issues from the questionnaire to be explored in 
more detail. 
</p>
<p> The questionnaire and the workshop revealed four key findings with regard to the 
ability of States and non-State actors to understand and take action on the prevention of 
human rights violations. The key findings were: 
</p>
<p> (a) There is a need to further elaborate what prevention means in practice. The 
concept of prevention in the context of human rights needs to be further developed; 
</p>
<p> (b) A holistic and strategic action on human rights across all functions of the 
State will result in a more effective prevention; 
</p>
<p> (c) An improved collection and disaggregation of statistics and data related 
explicitly to human rights will have a key impact on the prevention of human rights 
violations;  
</p>
<p> (d) Initiatives to tackle discrimination, in particular against vulnerable groups, 
should apply to the full range of vulnerable groups in the community. 
</p>
<p> Two main recommendations are made based on these findings: 
</p>
<p> (a) As a follow-up to the responses to the questionnaire and the discussion at the 
workshop, further research is recommended to be undertaken on the different aspects of 
prevention, and on consolidating the different definitions and approaches to prevention. 
There is a need to develop in States, NHRIs and non-State actors a stronger understanding 
of the implications and practical application of prevention, especially as it relates to all 
areas of discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (b) It was recommended that practical tools be developed to support States and 
other actors in understanding the role of prevention and to guide them through the 
developing of strategic and integrated prevention policies at a national level.

that expressly and specifically prevent human rights violations. The responses to this 
question were widely varied and included measures such as constitutional protections, the 
creation of an NHRI, the existence of Ministries of Justice or similar, court systems, and 
laws against the violation of human rights. Participants indicated that, while the responses 
to the question were all positive and welcome steps towards tackling human rights 
violations and impunity, both the range and the lack of detail provided may suggest that the 
concept of &#8220;prevention&#8221; in the context of human rights violations needs to be further

it addresses the wide range of elements that can lead to situations of torture and ill-
treatment. By conducting a rigorous analysis of the legal and administrative frameworks, 
procedural rights and guarantees of a fair trial, and by conducting visits to places of 
detention, meeting with detainees and others, and gathering relevant information, the 
Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment is able to get a clear understanding of the entire system and address both 
one-off incidences as well as systematic weaknesses. </footnote> 10

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>1. At its fourteenth session, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 14/5 on the 
role of prevention in the promotion and protection of human rights. In the resolution, the 
Council expressed concern about continued human rights violations around the world and 
reaffirmed the obligation of States under the Charter of the United Nations to promote 
universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council stressed the importance of effective preventive measures 
as part of the overall strategies for the promotion and protection of human rights, as well as 
the need for States to promote supportive and enabling environments for the prevention of 
human rights violations. It further recognized that States have a primary responsibility for 
the promotion and protection of human rights, including the prevention of human rights 
violations, and that this responsibility involves all branches of the State. In addition, the 
Council encouraged States to strengthen the mandate and capacity of national human rights 
institutions (NHRIs), where they exist, to enable them to fulfil their preventive role in 
accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to consult States, NHRIs, civil society and 
other relevant stakeholders, using a questionnaire format, on the conceptual and practical 
dimensions of prevention with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights, and 
to compile and publish the responses. Building on that research, the Council further 
requested that OHCHR convene a workshop, based on the information gathered from the 
questionnaire, to further explore the role of prevention in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and to present a summary of the workshop proceedings to the Council. The 
present report contains the summary of the responses to the questionnaire as well as of the 
workshop. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Questionnaire 
</b></p>
<p>4. The questionnaire was circulated to States, NHRIs and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) to capture data and to take stock of preventive mechanisms put in 
place through policies, programmes and projects on the prevention of human rights 
violations. The responses provided the basis for taking forward the workshop and other 
future initiatives related to prevention, including those influencing the work of United 
Nations human rights bodies, in order to promote and protect human rights, both 
individually and collectively. The questionnaire is included in full in annex III to the 
present document. OHCHR received responses from 24 Governments, 21 NHRIs and 8 
NGOs, for a total of 53 responses (see annex I); 9 were received from Africa, 7 from the 
Americas, 10 from Asia and the Pacific and 26 from Europe (see annex II). 
</p>

<p>explanatory comments, and the respondents were encouraged to provide details of their 
policies, programmes and projects to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. From the trends shown in the responses and particular comments from respondents, 
one can draw general conclusions about the core issues and capacity needs in relation to 
both institutional characteristics (such as legal framework, mandate and budget) and 
performance (such as resource allocation, working methods and relationships). A brief 
summary of the results showed that: 
</p>
<p> (a) A large majority of respondents have laws, policies and programmes in place 
to prevent human rights violations. However, the implementation of these mechanisms is 
still a challenge in most States;  
</p>
<p> (b) A number of respondents are carrying out activities relating to human rights 
education and research. However, many indicated a lack of capacity and resources to do so; 
</p>
<p> (c) Most respondents recognized the need to improve engagement with 
vulnerable groups and minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Workshop 
</b></p>
<p>7. Building on the findings from the questionnaire, on 20 May 2011 OHCHR held a 
workshop exploring the question of prevention in the context of the promotion and 
protection of human rights. It was structured around two sessions, one focusing on civil and 
political rights and the other on economic and social rights, to allow for the findings 
relating to structural issues from the questionnaire to be explored in more detail. The case 
studies, which were presented from the perspectives of the State, the NHRI and the NGO 
community, focused on the prevention of torture and ill-treatment and the prevention of 
human rights violations related to human trafficking and migration, with regard to the 
discrimination component in particular. The workshop was attended by a range of actors, 
including States, NHRIs and NGOs. The agenda of the workshop is contained in annex IV. 
</p>
<p>8. The morning session focused on understanding the concept of prevention as it 
related to torture and other ill-treatment, with panellists emphasizing the role of the State in 
developing and participating in formal structures to address torture and ill-treatment. 
Central to this discussion was the exploration of the effectiveness of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, with the New Zealand NHRI describing how being the designated national 
preventive mechanism had worked in practice. All panellists agreed that an essential 
component to prevention was understanding the underlying reasons why the human rights 
violation occurred, and addressing them. In the case of torture and ill-treatment, it was 
argued that the structural areas that were most important to prevention were the legal 
frameworks, the political context, the organization and efficiency of the criminal justice 
system, and the independence of the judiciary. It was also noted that any situation that 
featured a total imbalance of power, such as during the initial period of arrest, police 
custody or transfers between places of detention, also carried a higher risk for torture and 
ill-treatment. In order to prevent cases of torture and ill-treatment, States must examine 
those areas and ensure that they are functioning in a transparent and open manner. In terms 
of creating mechanisms to support prevention, panellists recognized the value of the 
Optional Protocol as a formal mechanism at the international level to assist States with 
developing and ensuring compliance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It was recognized that a central 
component of the success of the Optional Protocol was that it was a voluntary mechanism 
that acted to support States to achieve greater compliance. A further success of the Optional 
Protocol as a prevention mechanism was that it acted across areas such as access to places </p>


<p>of detention, access to documents relating to detention, and interviews with relevant 
individuals, including those who were detained. The approach was comprehensive and 
considered the individual situation in the State, and the functioning of specifically the 
penitentiary system, but also the system more broadly. The creation of holistic regulatory 
frameworks and policies by the State would ensure that there was limited space for human 
rights violations to occur. 
</p>
<p>9. The importance of understanding the context of and risk factors for human rights 
violations was also reflected in the afternoon session in the context of migration, trafficking 
and discrimination. All panellists made clear that in order to fully prevent violations caused 
by migration and trafficking, it was essential to understand and address the economic 
context in which such movement occurred. People became vulnerable to trafficking, it was 
argued, because they were discriminated against and their economic and social rights were 
denied. It was further suggested that the phenomenon needed to be understood in the 
context of the world economic crisis. The pool of potential victims was rapidly growing due 
to patterns of widespread inequality, lack of employment opportunities, insecurity of food 
and livelihood, violence, conflict, discrimination and poverty. Building on this, the 
panellists agreed that it was essential to also look at the demand side of trafficking, which 
included the social, political and economic factors that developed and sustained the market 
for trafficking. To work on the prevention of human rights violations that were the result of 
migration and trafficking, it was essential to reduce the demand for exploitative sex and 
labour that led to that trade; such demand was linked to distorted market forces in the 
countries of destination, and weaknesses in the national, regional and international 
frameworks that allowed for impunity.  
</p>
<p>10. With regard to international human rights instruments, although there have been 
developments over the last three decades to address the issue of migration and trafficking, 
there are still gaps and challenges related to the non-application of the international norms. 
The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families was highlighted as an example, having been ratified by only a 
handful of States. While international law does clearly identify the forms of trafficking and 
the obligations on States with regard to the appropriate treatment of victims, there were still 
gaps in protection both within certain States and between countries of origin and countries 
of reception. 
</p>
<p>11. The questionnaire focused extensively on the structural and policy response that 
States, NHRIs, NGOs and other actors are taking to reflect the role of prevention in their 
functions. While responses varied between actors, some common responses and 
conclusions could be drawn from each sector. 
</p>
<p><b> II. States 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation, policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>12. Alongside voluntary pledges and commitments, States reported that they were 
ensuring the protection and promotion of human rights through the ratification of 
international human rights treaties and taking measures on their implementation. The 
ratification of regional charters, such as the European Social Charter, was another way of 
developing these protections.  
</p>
<p>13. Many States are introducing amendments and legal reforms for ensuring better 
human rights protection in their legislative frameworks. As a common rule, States reported 
that national constitutions were the main and fundamental legislation ensuring human rights 
protection, which in some cases was being complemented by specific legislation on certain </p>


<p>human rights issues, such as discrimination, equal opportunity and treatment, and provision 
of legal aid to the poor. Some national legislation also provides sanctions for unequal 
treatment in employment and for harassment. In some States, offences committed based on 
discrimination were considered as having aggravating circumstances and in other States, 
the fact of discrimination based on religion was a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p>14. In defining priorities and policies, States reported that they were in the process of 
developing, implementing and updating national action plans on human rights. Thematic 
action plans were also mentioned, with regard to human rights education, health, social 
welfare, minorities, and violence against women. Policies in relation to ensuring economic, 
social and cultural rights included comprehensive pension systems, national housing 
programmes, and social programmes for times of crisis and for the prevention and 
reduction of poverty. 
</p>
<p>15. In order to ensure cooperation and cohesion, some States indicated that they had 
developed focal points on human rights issues in designated government ministries and 
agencies. Certain States were imposing fines and sanctions for the non-implementation of 
economic, social and cultural rights. States were also supporting human rights organizations 
working at the national level, including civil society organizations and national human 
rights institutions. The support varied from incentives and subsidies to awarding grants for 
special initiatives. Training institutions were providing human rights education for civil 
servants, law enforcement officers, judges and prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>16. Considerable attention was given to disadvantaged groups in State policies. With 
increases in migration, governments have been taking measures to protect the rights of their 
citizens in the context of both legal and illegal migration, while some States have developed 
bilateral agreements guaranteeing the rights of migrant workers. Projects have been 
implemented for the inclusion of migrant children in the educational system, as well as the 
drafting of new school curricula with human-rights-based approaches. An integration 
programme for disabled students was introduced along with a provision of incentives for 
the employment of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Bodies, structures and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>17. When asked what organizations or structures they had created to act as prevention 
bodies, States invoked commissions, committees, ombudsmen and public defenders. Some 
of these bodies were formal NHRIs in compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>

<p><b> C. Human rights education and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>20. In most States, human rights education was seen as a priority and measures were 
taken to include it in the educational system. States reported that they were engaged in 
close cooperation with NHRIs and NGOs not only in promoting human rights education but 
also in identifying possible gaps and further defining measures for resolving them. 
</p>
<p>21. Some States reported that they had developed a number of television and radio 
programmes for raising public awareness. Training institutions had been established for 
creating more understanding among judicial officials, prosecutors, officers of correctional 
institutions and law enforcement officers. Briefings and special programmes had also been 
developed for decision-makers and high-level State officials. In one State, a mandatory 
human rights course had been introduced for new recruits of law enforcement agencies and 
for court judges. In other settings, to prevent violations and ensure security, armed forces 
were receiving additional human rights training. 
</p>
<p><b> III. National human rights institutions  
</b></p>
<p>22. The submissions received from NHRIs indicated that they see themselves as playing 
a key role in the protection and promotion of human rights. One of the key ways that they 
undertake this role is through becoming involved in the enshrining of human rights within 
the national legislative framework and introducing a human rights-based approach in 
government policies.  
</p>
<p>23. In some States, national institutions were able to play a role in the prevention of 
human rights violations by becoming the key actors in legislative-reform processes and the 
identification of national policies on non-discrimination. Within this framework, NHRIs are 
being conferred with specific functions and responsibilities to address discrimination; to 
fulfil this mandate, NHRIs undertook awareness-raising trainings on race-related 
discrimination, public campaigns for tolerance and other initiatives, which included the 
empowerment of women.  
</p>
<p>24. Indeed, many NHRIs considered that their work in public awareness-raising and 
human rights education is their main tool for prevention. NHRIs organized trainings, 
seminars and workshops, targeting in particular representatives of the law enforcement 
agencies. NHRIs reported that they had created training programmes on human rights for 
high-level decision-makers, parliamentary members, government officials, judges and 
journalists, with some institutions making such training mandatory for new recruits. Some 
events incorporated advocacy activities aimed at the ratification of international human 
rights treaties and contributed to the fostering of a human rights culture.  
</p>
<p>25. Publications, media programmes and educational modules of NHRIs were 
complemented with the opportunities offered by the advancement of information 
technology. Internet-based social networks are making a huge contribution to the activities 
of NHRIs. These opportunities make it possible for NHRIs not only to quickly update the 
public on their activities, but also to increase their influence on public opinion. NHRIs 
continue to work for the promotion of human rights education in close cooperation with 
academia and research institutes.  
</p>

<p>27. NHRIs also reported that they have an important obligation in fostering cooperation 
with various stakeholders, including civil society organizations, through joint inquiries, 
projects grants and awareness-raising activities such as trainings, seminars and workshops.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>28. Civil society organizations stated that they played an active role in advocating for 
legal reforms in line with human rights obligations and the commitments of a State. 
Governments were increasingly recognizing the distinctive role of NGOs in reviewing 
national legislation, regulations, policy documents, procedures and the conduct of law 
enforcement agencies.  
</p>
<p>29. Indeed, States considered civil society organizations as essential partners and looked 
for further possible engagement. In some countries, legal training organized by ministries 
or government agencies has been taking place in cooperation with the NGO community, 
including legal reforms and amendments.  
</p>
<p>30. In some places, special offices and units were established to provide NGOs with 
support and to assist in addressing their concerns and challenges. In order to ensure 
transparency in government conduct, some ministries had also created a system of frequent 
briefings on current updates and developments for representatives of NGOs.  
</p>
<p>31. Some States reported that they organized annual NGO forums on human rights. 
Prominent NGOs were recognized and granted membership in advisory and consultative 
bodies of different ministries and agencies. Furthermore, States reported that NGOs were 
directly involved and engaged in legislative drafting processes.  
</p>
<p>32. NGOs also reported that they played a key role in ensuring the effective 
implementation of legislation and programmes through ongoing monitoring and reporting. 
</p>
<p>33. Human rights training and awareness-raising were the main tools used by NGOs for 
the promotion and protection of human rights. Many human rights campaigns were 
organized either individually or jointly by civil society. NGOs reported a range of different 
methods used to foster a human rights culture, depending on context.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Key findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The concept of prevention 
</b></p>

<p>plans on prisons, programmes for the integration of minority societies, strategies and 
programmes on child education, education policies, programmes for the prevention of 
HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, health policies and strategies for minorities 
and disadvantaged groups, policies on equal opportunities for persons with disabilities, 
gender equality, children&#8217;s rights, non-discrimination, sexual violence, migration and 
others.  
</p>
<p>36. During the workshop session on the prevention of torture the panel distinguished 
between two forms of prevention: 
</p>
<p> (a) Direct prevention, which aims to prevent torture from occurring by reducing 
the risk factors that cause it; 
</p>
<p> (b) Indirect prevention, which takes place when torture has already occurred but 
aims to avoid its reoccurring through justice and reparation. 
</p>
<p>37. It was recognized by most respondents to the questionnaire and by participants at the 
workshop that education and awareness-raising are central to promoting the prevention of 
violations. From the responses to the questionnaire, it appears that actors are focusing 
predominately on indirect prevention and identifying mechanisms that seek to remedy 
violations as opposed to preventing them outright. Thus there is a need to further develop, 
and raise awareness of, the concept of prevention.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Strategic action 
</b></p>
<p>38. The participants noted that the responses from the questionnaire revealed the need 
for strategic action on human rights protection. It was reported that many States had 
enacted national action plans, in which the human rights-based approach was introduced to 
guide them in addressing their country&#8217;s human rights needs, to raise awareness of human 
rights issues among government officials, security authorities, civil society organizations 
and the general public, to mobilize a broad spectrum of society in a cooperative 
atmosphere, to propose realistic activities and achievable targets and to promote linkages 
with other national programmes. However, despite this positive description, the participants 
acknowledged that there are still shortcomings regarding implementation and follow-up, as 
only half of the respondents had set up a formal structure within the existing government 
institutions tasked with strategy implementation.  
</p>
<p>39. Participants in the discussion on migration and trafficking indicated that the failure 
to ensure a cooperative strategic approach to migration between the countries of origin and 
the countries of reception resulted in gaps in protection for migrants.   
</p>

<p><b> C. Statistics and data collection 
</b></p>
<p>41. A key barrier emerging from both the questionnaire and the workshop that is 
preventing all actors from engaging in effective prevention work is the lack of statistics and 
data illustrating the depth and extent of the problem. 
</p>
<p>42. Nearly all States reported that they had official agencies to collect data at the 
national and subnational levels based on standardized methodologies. It was indicated, 
however, that the use of this information has not been explored by States in monitoring 
civil and political rights along with economic and social rights.  
</p>
<p>43. From the NHRI perspective, there was a recognition that statistical data analysis 
allows the mapping of human rights violations and the identification of key priority areas, 
and therefore is an effective tool for the prevention by NHRIs of abuses and violations at 
early stages. However, even with this recognition, NHRIs were not in a position to 
undertake technical data collection and analysis. While some are in a process of developing 
specific indicators for the evaluation of the human rights situation in their respective 
countries, the main source of information for analysis and monitoring remains their 
complaints and petition registry. In this respect, NHRIs are benefiting from information-
sharing with different organizations, both governmental and non-governmental, although 
challenges persist with regard to the accuracy of this information and with regard to 
cohesion among institutions responsible for collecting information. Another concern was 
raised on the funding of specific statistical surveys regarding implementation of rights of 
certain groups, such as persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>44. This gap in data collection was mirrored at the international level in the context of 
migration, when it was noted that the data on victims of trafficking  is scant. There was 
concern that the inability to gather a full picture of the situation and its drivers limits the 
ability of States to respond effectively. 
</p>
<p>45. The participants reported that while statistics and data were seen as central to 
understanding human rights violations and to framing and developing effective policy and 
legislative responses, there remained significant gaps in data collection. These gaps 
undermine the ability of States and NHRIs to accurately prioritize human rights violations, 
and thus take action to prevent them from occurring. Some States and NHRIs requested the 
support and guidance of OHCHR in better understanding how to develop human rights 
indicators that can be used to gain a picture of the human rights situation in their domestic 
context. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Understanding the diversity of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>46. Through the questionnaire, States, NHRIs and NGOs were asked to identify the 
measures that they had taken to counter discrimination, in particular with respect to racial 
discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of sex or religion, and discrimination against 
the marginalized, including in the context of migration. Further, they were asked to identify 
issues that arise from the implementation of existing measures that provide human rights 
protection for specific groups vulnerable to discrimination, such as religious groups, ethnic 
groups, women, linguistic or cultural minorities, indigenous peoples, persons with 
disabilities, migrants, refugees, persons of African descent, victims of trafficking, persons 
with HIV/AIDS, the poor and others. It is important to take stock of the range of actions 
being taken to prevent human rights violations in those groups that are most vulnerable to 
violations. 
</p>

<p>and penalties for discriminatory practices, while others had established State institutions to 
specifically handle issues of minorities and vulnerable groups, such as women, children, 
persons with disabilities, the poor, indigenous groups, the elderly, detainees, sexual 
minorities, migrants or non-nationals and ethnic minorities. Such institutions include 
NHRIs, ombuds-institutions, equality commissions and others which are aimed at ensuring 
equal treatment and equal opportunities for all in addition to fighting against discriminatory 
treatments and practices.  
</p>
<p>48. States had put in place programmes and policies aimed at integrating marginalized 
groups as well as encouraging tolerance, inclusive societies and cultural diversity. A 
number of countries in Europe had established programmes and policies for integrating and 
improving the conditions of Roma people, especially the children and youth.  
</p>
<p>49. A significant number of respondents also had established specialized government 
ministries and programmes as well as strategies to address specific issues, such as a strategy 
for the social inclusion of persons with disabilities, national programmes on gender 
equality, programmes on integrated social service systems, and programmes for preventing 
and combating discrimination. Some countries had established specific administrative 
offices, such as commissioners against discrimination, with the mandate to propose 
administrative and penal measures against perpetrators of discriminatory acts.  
</p>
<p>50. Several States had set up specialized departments or units addressing discrimination, 
including departments focused on racial discrimination (20 States), migrant workers (7 
States), disability issues (40 States), religious discrimination (10 States), ethnic 
discrimination (9 States), linguistic discrimination (2 States), discrimination against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgendered persons (5 States), and HIV/AIDS (5 States). Some 
participants indicated that the limited range of groups protected through the creation of 
special departments raises the concern that other groups are not being adequately 
recognized as suffering discrimination. Some notable omissions included departments 
dedicated to the prevention of discrimination based on age, economic status, gender and 
migration.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 14/5, through a 
questionnaire and an interactive workshop, revealed that States, NHRIs, NGOs and 
experts recognize the importance of the role of prevention in the promotion and 
protection of human rights. The participants agreed that, while the core work of the 
Council tends to be more focused on addressing situations of violation, the long-term 
effectiveness of the Council will depend on its work on prevention. In this way, the 
prevention of human rights violations must be central. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The participants indicated that, despite this good will and commitment, many 
actors were not clear as to what prevention means in practice, which limited their 
ability to act on this agenda. Although at the international level there has been 
discussion about prevention, with multiple references to it in different human rights 
instruments, there is no one clear picture of what that means and how to apply it in a 
domestic or national context. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Compounding this lack of knowledge about what role prevention should play, 
the participants indicated that States are tending not to take strategic action to 
address human rights violations across all their functions. With some States having 
action plans, but few using human rights-based approaches, it appeared as if many of 
the activities undertaken to prevent human rights violations or to promote and protect 
human rights were limited in scope. Discussions on the Optional Protocol to the </b></p>


<p><b>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment indicated that the strength of the process was that it took a more holistic 
view of each State&#8217;s situation, allowing for recommendations and actions that 
addressed all causes of torture and ill-treatment. This could stand as a model for other 
action on human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Underpinning the gaps in developing integrated human rights action plans was 
a lack of relevant data and statistics to identify problem areas. Although many States 
and NHRIs did engage in data collection, it was indicated that the data collected was 
not human rights specific and did not necessarily highlight issues relating to the 
prevention of violations. Some participants requested support in understanding how 
to design data sets and monitoring programmes to measure human rights, which 
would enable them to set goals and develop evidence-based programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The discussion revealed that there is support and will for further work in this 
area, with all actors recognizing the essential role that the prevention of human rights 
violations plays in the promotion and protection of human rights. The discussions 
conducted and commitments made at the workshop indicated that further research 
and frameworks are required to assist States and other actors in overcoming the 
barriers that they are facing in understanding and mainstreaming the role of 
prevention in the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</b>56. <b>On the basis of the responses to the questionnaire and the discussion at the 
workshop, it was recommended that further research be undertaken on the different 
aspects of prevention, and on consolidating the different definitions and approaches to 
prevention. There is a need to develop in States, NHRIs and non-State actors a 
stronger understanding of the implications and practical application of prevention, 
especially as it relates to all areas of discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Furthermore, it was recommended that, following on from the workshop, 
practical tools be developed to support States and other actors in understanding the 
role of prevention and to guide them through the development of strategic and 
integrated prevention policies at a national level. </b></p>
