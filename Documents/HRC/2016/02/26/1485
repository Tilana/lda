</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to 
continue its endeavours to protect and diligently promote human rights at the national and 
international levels and to participate in an active and constructive manner in the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The Kingdom emphasizes its cooperation with, and support for, the UPR mechanism 
in view of the tangible results that the latter is achieving and which are helping to promote 
and protect human rights throughout the world in conformity with the basic principles of 
objectivity and transparency. The interactive and cooperative nature of this process ensures 
that it will continue to provide increasing opportunities to achieve its desired goals and 
aspirations while, at the same time, respecting national cultures and benefiting from them to 
promote and protect the universality and interdependence of human rights in accordance 
with the provisions of Human Rights Council resolution 21/3 of 20 September 2012. 
</p>
<p>3. The 225 recommendations made to the Kingdom at the seventeenth session of the 
Working Group were carefully considered by the Board of the Kingdom&#8217;s Human Rights 
Commission which includes a number of experts in sharia, law and the various fields of 
human rights. They were subsequently discussed by a committee consisting of high-level 
representatives of more than 16 government agencies and several civil society institutions, 
including the National Society for Human Rights, were also consulted. The 
recommendations were then submitted to a group of specialists and academics concerned 
with human rights so that they could express their views thereon. It is noteworthy that 88 of 
these recommendations, to which reference will be made in accordance with the thematic 
classification adopted in the report, were fully or partly endorsed and are being 
implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The Kingdom&#8217;s views and conclusions concerning the 
recommendations made to it 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Kingdom&#8217;s Basic Law of Governance is derived from the Islamic sharia in 
accordance with article 7 of the said Law which stipulates that: &#8220;Governance in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia shall derive its authority from the Book of Almighty God and the 
Sunna of His Messenger by which this and all other laws of the State shall be governed&#8221;. 
Article 26 of the Law further stipulates that: &#8220;The State shall protect human rights in 
conformity with the Islamic sharia&#8221;. Before setting forth its views on the recommendations, 
the Kingdom wishes to make the following clarifications: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Its full or partial endorsement of the recommendations is in keeping with the 
principles and precepts of the Islamic sharia, which protect human rights and 
criminalize any violation thereof, and with the provisions of the laws in force; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Partial endorsement signifies its approval of only part of the recommendation, 
as will be made clear in the following sections of the report, or its approval of 
the objective of the recommendation while holding a differing opinion 
concerning the manner of its implementation or the requisite time frame 
therefor; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Its non-endorsement of some recommendations may be attributable to their 
incompatibility with the principles and precepts of the Islamic sharia, their 
failure to reflect the current situation, their coverage of matters falling outside 
the scope of the Review or their inclusion of false allegations. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/3/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-11594 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Kingdom&#8217;s views and conclusions concerning the recommendations made to it, 
in accordance with their thematic classification, are as follows: 
</p>
<p><b> A. Accession and commitment to international human rights treaties and 
withdrawal of reservations thereto 
</b></p>
<p>6. As indicated in paragraph 19 of its national report, the Kingdom conducts an 
ongoing periodic study of international human rights treaties and instruments in order to 
assess the appropriateness or feasibility of accession thereto. In this connection, the 
Kingdom wishes to point out that it has acceded to the ILO Minimum Age Convention, 
1973 (No. 138). With regard to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, the sharia 
and the Kingdom&#8217;s legislation contain adequate provisions to ensure achievement of the 
purpose of these conventions. The Kingdom wishes to emphasize the fact that that the 
principle of reservations to international conventions is a right recognized by international 
law. Moreover, the Kingdom believes that the reservations that it has made to the treaties 
that it has signed or to which it has acceded are not incompatible with the aims and 
purposes of those treaties. Accordingly: 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been endorsed in this section are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.1; 138.3; 138.11; 138.12; 138.17; 138.18. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been partially endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.7; 138.9; 138.10; 138.19; 138.<footnote name="2">2. The Kingdom&#8217;s innovative counter-terrorism initiative is distinguished by the 
delicate balance that it maintains between combating terrorism and protecting human rights. 
This is one of the intrinsic principles of the Islamic sharia, from which the Kingdom derives 
its regulations. Moreover, existing regulations and bills of law are subject to periodic 
review and study by the Human Rights Commission in order to ensure their conformity 
with international standards since article 5, paragraph 2, of the Commission&#8217;s Statute 
stipulates that the Commission &#8220;shall express its opinion on bills of law relating to human 
rights and shall review existing legislation and propose amendments thereto in accordance 
with the established procedure&#8221;. These legislative enactments are also subject to review by 
national human rights and civil society institutions. The Kingdom assumes that the intended 
meaning of the term &#8220;jihadism&#8221;, to which reference is made in recommendation 138.<footnote name="2">4. The recommendation that has not been endorsed is: 
</footnote>18, is </footnote>0; 138.<footnote name="23">. Four recommendations were made on matters not falling within the above thematic 
categories. Three of these recommendations have been endorsed: 
</footnote>; 138.32. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have not been endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.2; 138.4; 138.5; 138.6; 138.8; 138.13; 138.14; 138.15; 138.16; 138.21; 138.22; 138.24; 
138.25; 138.26; 138.140. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Reform of the judicial and legal systems 
</b>7. As stipulated in the Basic Law of Governance, the terms of reference of the judiciary 
and the legal system are derived from the Islamic sharia. The Supreme Court is responsible 
for determining the judicial principles most consistent with international standards, as 
already indicated in paragraph 33 of the national report. Furthermore, in order to safeguard 
every individual&#8217;s right to life, the Kingdom&#8217;s legislation designates homicide as a 
punishable criminal offence. No authority is empowered to modify or abolish the legally 
established fixed penalties (<i>hudud</i>) prescribed in the Islamic sharia. 
8. The precepts of the Islamic sharia are characterized by their broad scope, their 
suitability for every time and place and their responsiveness to changing circumstances. 
This is borne out by the promulgation of numerous sharia-based enactments, some of which 
make provision for specific categories of crime and penalties (as in the case of the 
Repression of Crimes of Trafficking in Persons Act). The Codes of Sharia (Civil) and 
Criminal Procedure have likewise been amended to make them more consistent with the 
relevant international standards. The new Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates, inter alia, 
that judicial hearings must be conducted in public unless, exceptionally, the court decides 
otherwise on grounds of security or in order to safeguard public morals or if such is 
necessary for the purpose of discovering the truth. This is in conformity with international 
standards concerning rules to ensure a fair trial. Accordingly: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/3/Add.1

<p><b>4</b> GE.14-11594 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been endorsed in this section are:</b> 
</p>
<p>138.27; 138.28; 138.29; 138.30; 138.31; 138.33; 138.60; 138.63; 138.69; 138.139; 138.141; 
138.142; 138.145; 138.146; 138.147; 138.149; 138.150; 138.153; 138.155; 138.156. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been partially endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.34; 138.37; 138.39; 138.41; 138.42; 138.43; 138.45; 138.144; 138.148. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have not been endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.38; 138.50. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Kingdom&#8217;s legislation guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of choice 
of religion and belief without prejudice to the country&#8217;s identity as the focal point to which 
1.5 billion Muslims throughout the world turn in prayer. The Kingdom does not have any 
minorities in the religious sense of the term. In this connection, the Kingdom refers to 
paragraphs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27 of its national report. 
</p>
<p>10. While drawing attention to the fact that the draft Civil Society Institutions Act is 
currently under study, the Kingdom wishes to emphasize that it does not deem itself to be 
under any obligation to set a deadline for the promulgation of this or other legislative 
enactments. Accordingly: 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been endorsed in this section are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.48; 138.49; 138.51; 138.53; 138.59; 138.117; 138.154; 138.162; 138.165; 138.168; 
138.170; 138.172; 138.173. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been partially endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.46; 138.47; 138.52; 138.54; 138.137; 138.164; 138.175. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have not been endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.169; 138.171; 138.174; 138.193. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Rights of women and children 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Kingdom&#8217;s laws and regulations guarantee equality and designate all forms of 
discrimination, particularly against women, as punishable criminal offences. However, 
since acts of discrimination might be committed with impunity within the context of 
erroneous individual practices, endeavours are being intensified to eliminate such 
discrimination through the adoption of further policies, regulations and procedural 
measures under which any form of discrimination against women will be criminalized and 
punished. The national report highlighted the achievements made in the field of women&#8217;s 
rights and particularly in regard to women&#8217;s participation in public and political life.  The 
Kingdom is aware that the system of male guardianship or tutelage to which reference is 
made in some of the recommendations is regarded as implying male domination over 
women. It therefore wishes to reaffirm that its regulations protect women from such 
domination or any practices conducive thereto and in no way entail any marginalization of 
women or gender-based differentiation likely to undermine the recognition of women&#8217;s 
rights in a manner consistent with the definition of discrimination incorporated in the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Islamic 
legal concept of <i>qiwama</i> (tutelage in the sense of men&#8217;s obligation to protect and provide 
for their womenfolk) guarantees women&#8217;s rights and helps to ensure a properly structured </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/3/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-11594 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>and cohesive family. If this obligation is abused and exploited as a means to subjugate a 
woman and violate her rights, there are many ways in which the woman can seek redress at 
any time, particularly through the judiciary. 
12. The Islamic sharia prohibits forced marriage and, under the Kingdom&#8217;s regulations, 
a marriage contract is deemed to be null and void in the absence of proof of the full and free 
consent of either of the spouses. The marriage of minors is an issue that is currently under 
study and, consequently, it would be inappropriate to specify a minimum age for marriage 
before learning the outcome of the study. It should be noted, however, that marriage of 
minors is a rare occurrence. Accordingly: 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been endorsed in this section are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.44; 138.55; 138.56; 138.57; 138.58; 138.74; 138.75; 138.92; 138.93; 138.95; 138.96; 
138.98; 138.99; 138.100; 138.101; 138.102; 138.103; 138.105; 138.106; 138.107; 138.108; 
138.113; 138.114; 138.115; 138.134; 138.138; 138.152; 138.163; 138.176; 138.177; 
138.178; 138.179; 138.180; 138.181; 138.184; 138.191; 138.192. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been partially endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.35; 138.109; 138.110; 138.111. 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have not been endorsed are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.36; 138.104. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Promotion of human rights culture and education 
</b></p>
<p>13. All the recommendations made in this section have been endorsed, namely: 
</p>
<p> 138.61; 138.62; 138.64; 138.65; 138.66; 138.67; 138.68; 138.71; 138.97. 
</p>
<p><b> F. The death penalty and corporal punishment 
</b></p>
<p>14. The death penalty is imposed only for the most serious crimes and, as indicated in 
paragraphs 34, 35 and 38 of the national report, the Kingdom&#8217;s regulations, and primarily 
the Statute of the Judiciary, the Code of Sharia (Civil) Procedure and the Code of Criminal 
Procedure which are consistent with international standards, incorporate safeguards that 
ensure a fair trial. In general, the judiciary tends to waive the death penalty in keeping with 
the precept of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): &#8220;Ward off the <i>hudud</i> (fixed 
penalties) with specious argument&#8221;. 
15. To determine criminal responsibility, the Kingdom&#8217;s judiciary takes account of 
precise and specific criteria such as age. If the perpetrator of a capital offence meets any of 
these criteria, he is deemed to have been aware of the nature of his felonious act and, 
consequently, bears responsibility therefor and deserves the prescribed penalty. This 
exemplifies the way in which the Islamic sharia established an additional international 
standard by showing concern for the right to life to which all other rights are subordinate. 
The death penalty is waived in the case of minors and is never imposed on children. It is 
noteworthy that the Kingdom&#8217;s legislation defines a child in a manner consistent with 
article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

</p>
<p><b> G. Endeavours to combat discrimination and domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Kingdom&#8217;s labour regulations do not require women to seek permission from 
any other person in order to engage in an occupation. It is noteworthy that any officials who 
impede the receipt of complaints of domestic violence are held accountable and punished 
under the provisions of numerous enactments including, in particular, the Protection from 
Abuse Act. Accordingly: 
</p>
<p><b>All the recommendations made in this section have been endorsed, namely: 
</b></p>
<p>138.70; 138.94; 138.112; 138.135; 138.136; 138.143; 138.157; 138.183; 138.189; 138.190; 
138.215. 
</p>
<p><b> H. International cooperation in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Kingdom is willing to engage in ongoing positive cooperation with international 
human rights mechanisms, including the Council&#8217;s Special Procedures, by permitting visits 
by Special Rapporteurs and responding positively to their relevant inquiries and requests 
for information and clarifications. The scheduling of their invitations and the decision as to 
who should be invited are left to the Kingdom&#8217;s authorities concerned with human rights. 
The Kingdom is eager to implement the recommendations that it has endorsed and human 
rights dialogues in this regard will be conducted within the framework of the United 
Nations mechanisms. Accordingly: 
</p>
<p><b>The recommendations that have been endorsed in this section are: 
</b></p>
<p>138.76; 138.77; 138.78; 138.79; 138.81; 138.82; 138.83; 138.87; 138.90; 138.91; 138.221;

<p>138.72; 138.80; 138.131; 138.132; 138.133; 138.159; 138.160. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Workers&#8217; rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Kingdom&#8217;s regulations protect the rights of workers, regardless of whether they 
are nationals or foreign residents. It should be noted that there are no migrant workers in the 
Kingdom, since all foreign workers entering its territory hold fixed-term contracts of 
employment on the expiration of which they return to their home countries. The term 
&#8220;sponsor&#8221; is an incorrect designation that is not used in the Kingdom&#8217;s regulations, in 
which the approved term is &#8220;employer&#8221;. The Labour Law and the regulations and decisions 
issued pursuant thereto contain precise definitions of all the rights and obligations of 
workers and employers and these texts are constantly being reviewed, in the light of 
changing labour market conditions, in such a way as to guarantee the rights and obligations 
of both parties. Accordingly:
