The descriptions of the royalties in this Annual Report have been simplified for presentation purposes. This Annual Report contains forward-looking information, which is subject to change 
and risk and should not be relied upon. This Annual Report should be considered along with the additional supporting detail, assumptions and risks regarding the use of forward-looking 
information outlined on page 18 of this Annual Report and in the Anglo Pacific Group PLC (the “Group”) Annual Information Form, which is available on www.sedar.com and on the website 
at www.anglopacificgroup.com. As a royalty holder, the Group often has limited, if any, access to technical information or is subject to confidentiality provisions. For this Annual Report and 
the Annual Information Form, the Group has generally relied on the public disclosure of the owners and operators of the royalty properties. More current information may be available in 
subsequent disclosure and on the Group website. The Group’s royalties often cover less than 100% and sometimes only a portion of the publicly reported reserves, resources and production 
of the property. This Annual Report also contains references to past prices of and/or yields on the Group’s shares. Readers are reminded that past performance cannot be relied on as a guide

Who we are
Anglo Pacific is a royalty company specialising in royalties derived 
from the mining of natural resources. Within this sector we have 
a diverse portfolio that spans different commodities including 
coking coal, iron ore and precious metals.
Market capitalisation
£361m
“  I am pleased to announce  
a record year for our royalty 
income, as Anglo Pacific 
continues to make progress 
with its strategy of  
developing a leading  
portfolio of royalties.”
  Peter Boycott 
  Chairman
FTSE 250 Listed
  LSE: APF
  TSX: APY
We also invest internationally from the Americas to Europe and 
Australasia and our portfolio includes both producing mines and 
development projects.
Our objective is simple – to continually build a diverse portfolio  
of royalties that will generate growing, long-term returns for  
our shareholders.
Our strategy for growth
We are developing our portfolio through three primary routes:
1  Acquiring existing royalty agreements
2   Creating new royalties by
financing development
3   Vending mineral licences to third party
developers in exchange for new royalties
Acquisitions
New Royalties
Growth
Mineral Licences
We also develop royalty opportunities through  
our equity investments.

Royalties explained
A royalty is an entitlement to an agreed percentage of a project’s sales 
revenue, without any liability for production costs or capital expenditure. 
There are different reasons for the origination of a royalty ranging from 
land ownership to exploration rights; however, as a royalty company,  
our entitlement comes through purchasing existing royalty agreements  
or as a result of direct financial investment.
In the mining industry, most royalties endure for the life of the resource 
and are paid on a regular basis. Historically there have been different 
terms for royalties including Gross Revenue or Net Smelter Return 
Royalties, which are based on the gross sale price of the actual minerals 
mined. Our model is based around Gross Revenue or Net Smelter Return 
Royalties as they provide the best and clearest return.
Creating new royalties
Our new royalty agreements tend to come from providing financing to 
mining operations, usually to help them progress a mine into production. 
We also develop royalty opportunities through our equity investments.
Acquiring existing royalties
We buy existing royalty agreements, such as those owned by exploration 
companies who may have retained an interest in a mine they helped 
discover. Once acquired, royalty companies rarely sell their agreements.

Strong cash position
“ In the year under review I am 
pleased to report that the Group 
has further expanded its royalty 
portfolio and continues to realise 
profits from the sale of non-core 
mining interests despite difficult 
market conditions. 
 With the Group reporting record 
royalty revenues and a substantial 
liquidity position, the Board 
will again be recommending an 
increased final dividend.”
A year in review
During the first half of 2011, two natural disasters affected the short term outlook for certain 
commodities to which the Group is exposed.
The extensive flooding in Queensland, Australia, during the first quarter of the year caused 
substantial disruption to coal deliveries from the Group’s Kestrel and Crinum coal interests.  
This reduction in output at both mines was more than compensated for by higher coking coal 
prices in the first half of the year resulting in increased royalty cash flows for the Group.
The Fukushima earthquake in March 2011 caused severe disruption in economic activity in 
Japan and elsewhere. The subsequent nuclear disaster affected the prospects for the nuclear 
power industry and the near term outlook for the uranium market.
In the second half of 2011, both mining markets and commodities prices were further impacted 
by fears of recession in Europe and a slackening of demand from China.
Despite these headwinds, the Group was able to realise substantial gains from its strategic 
mining interests and has maintained a resilient, ungeared balance sheet in the face of increasing 
recessive forces. The Group continues to report substantial earnings and record royalty cash 
flows, whilst benefiting from its royalty income based on top line sales revenue at a time  
when the mining industry is subject to significant operating cost inflation, as well as  
fluctuating demand.
The Group’s strategy remains focused on securing new royalties, both by acquisition and 
through investment in its mining interests, thereby generating consistent cash flows and 
supporting increasing dividends to shareholders.

Chairman’s review
“ During 2011, the Group acquired 
an iron ore and a chromite royalty 
and completed the purchase of 
an option to acquire a substantial 
nickel royalty.”
Royalty portfolio
Acquisitions
The announcement of an agreement to acquire an additional iron ore royalty in February 2012, 
will, following its completion, increase the total royalties in the Group’s portfolio to 20, of 
which four are currently in production.
The new royalties announced during the year and after the period end were:
•	On January 12, 2011, the Group completed the previously announced Royalty Option 
Agreement with Horizonte Minerals PLC (“Horizonte”) for the Group to purchase a net 
smelter return royalty on all revenues from the advanced exploration stage Araguaia and 
Lontra Nickel Projects (“Araguaia Project”) in Brazil. The Group paid Horizonte the sum of 
US$0.5 million in exchange for the six year option to acquire a 1.5% net smelter return 
royalty from the Araguaia Project for US$12.5 million.
•	On August 2, 2011, the Group announced the purchase of an existing 1% net smelter return 
royalty over the Black Label, Black Thor and Big Daddy chromite deposits in Ontario, Canada, 
from KWG Resources Inc (“KWG”). These projects are operated by Cliffs Natural Resources Inc 
(“Cliffs”) and form part of Cliffs’ growth plans in the “Ring of Fire” area in northern Ontario. 
The consideration for the acquisition was US$18 million.
•	On August 3, 2011, the Group announced its agreement to provide a non-interest bearing 
advance of US$30 million to London Mining PLC (“London Mining”) in exchange for a 1% 
gross revenue royalty over the Isua iron ore project in Greenland. The agreement contains a 
number of milestones. In the event of these not being met, the Group retains the right to be 
repaid in cash or, at London Mining’s discretion, in shares at the market price at the time.
•	On November 17, 2011, the Group announced that it had signed a letter of intent with
Cardero Resource Corp. (“Cardero”) relating to a proposal to develop the Trefi coal project in 
British Columbia, Canada. On March 6, 2012, Cardero informed the Group of their withdrawal 
from this proposal.
•	On February 6, 2012, the Group announced its agreement to acquire 50% of the Mount Ida 
1.5% gross revenue iron ore royalty, in Western Australia, from Red Rock Resources PLC for 
a total consideration of US$14 million. The consideration will be paid in three instalments 
depending on certain milestones being achieved, with the initial payment of US$6 million on 
completion of the transaction.
These acquisitions have broadened and diversified the Group’s portfolio of royalties, both by 
commodity and geographically. The Group will continue to focus its efforts on commodities 
leveraged to the Asian growth story.

Producing royalties
Kestrel
Rio Tinto Limited reported coal sales from Kestrel for 2011 of 3.8 million tonnes, a reduction 
compared to 4.4 million tonnes in 2010, and largely due to adverse weather in Queensland 
during the first half of the year. The lower export levels from Australia combined with record 
global steel production supported the strength of coking coal prices throughout the year with 
sale prices for hard coking coal ranging between US$328 and US$235 per tonne.
The higher prices for hard coking coal resulted in Kestrel coal royalties for the year ended 
December 31, 2011 of £26.5 million (A$41.2 million) compared to £21.9 million (A$37.0 
million) received in 2010.
Crinum
As the Crinum longwall leaves the Group’s private royalty ground, the royalties for the year 
ended December 31, 2011 reduced to £6.0 million (A$9.1 million) compared to £8.0 million 
(A$7.6 million) received in 2010. In the Group’s coal royalty valuation, future production from 
Crinum continues to be difficult to evaluate and as a result is ascribed no value.
Amapá 
Royalty receipts for the year ended December 31, 2011 were £2.7 million (2010: £0.2 million). 
This is the first year the Group has received a full year of cash flow from Amapá. 
El Valle
The El Valle Boinas/Carles gold and copper mines were commissioned during the second 
quarter of 2011, with production to September 30, 2011 of 9,336 ounces of gold, 1.05 million 
pounds of copper and 28,456 ounces of silver. During the year, maiden receipts of £0.3 million 
arising from the Group’s net smelter return royalty were received and applied against the 
debenture instrument.
Engenho
Royalty payments for the year ended December 31, 2011 were £0.3 million. Delays in 
permitting the adjacent Crista deposit and other operational matters have resulted in the 
Engenho operations being put on care and maintenance. On December 20, 2011, Mundo 
Minerals Limited’s Brazilian subsidiary was put into the Brazilian equivalent of the US Chapter 
11 process and the Group does not expect any royalty receipts during 2012.

Equity interests
During the year, the Group continued its strategy of taking equity stakes in strategic 
opportunities with the prospect of potential royalties. This allows the Group to develop 
a detailed understanding of project risks and form working relationships with management. 
Where royalties cease to be a financing option, the Group will seek to dispose of the 
particular equity investment in a manner that is profitable to the Group, while minimising 
disruption to the investee company. This approach has again proved successful with the Group 
realising significant gains for shareholders during 2011 while generating a number of royalty 
opportunities. However, difficult market conditions and a confused outlook for uranium 
affected valuations at the year end.
Board and personnel developments
On September 23, 2011, Mr. Matthew Tack resigned as Finance Director. He joined the Group 
in 2004 and was appointed to the Board in 2006. He is leaving the Group at the end of March 
2012 to return to Australia after ten years working in the United Kingdom. Mr. Tack has been 
an integral part of the development of the Group during the past seven years and we are 
grateful for the contribution he has made. The Group has recruited a Chief Financial Officer, 
Mr Kevin Flynn, who commenced duties in January 2012.
Outlook
With recent signs of recovery in the US economy and much better bank liquidity within the 
troubled Eurozone, mining markets and commodity prices have improved sharply in the last 
two months. This has resulted in a significant increase in the value of the Group’s equity 
interests since the year end. Furthermore, with this improving background, the raising of 
mining finance from conventional lenders or equity issues has become less of a challenge for 
larger mining companies. However, in the junior mining sector access to finance still remains 
challenging. In this environment, the Group continues to identify royalty opportunities and 
receive numerous enquiries for mining finance.
The Group will continue to make the acquisition of new royalties its principal strategic focus, 
leveraging off its cash resources, strong royalty revenues and pro-active management.
Finally, I would like to thank my Board colleagues and staff for their application and hard work 
in achieving another good year’s results.

Report of the Directors
Directors’ report
The Group continues to expand and 
diversify its royalty portfolio
The directors submit their report and the audited financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC is a public limited company, incorporated in 
England, and listed on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol 
APF and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol APY.
Strategy
Anglo Pacific Group PLC’s strategy, conducted through the holding 
company (the “Company”) and its subsidiary undertakings (together, 
the “Group”), is to secure new royalties by acquisition and through 
investment in its mining interests in order to generate strong cash 
flows and continue to pay dividends to its shareholders. The Group 
remains committed to a progressive dividend policy.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are set out on 
section entitled “Where we operate” on 
of the Group’s principal activities.

Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is set out on 
financial statements.
The Group profit after tax decreased by 35% to £36.7 million  
(2010: £56.3 million).
The directors recommend a final dividend of 5.50p per share for the 
year ended December 31, 2011 which, with the interim dividend of 
4.25p per share paid on January 11, 2012, will make total dividends for 
2011 of 9.75p per share (2010: 9.05p per share). The final dividend is 
subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on April 19, 2012. The Board proposes to pay the final dividend 
on July 4, 2012 to shareholders on the Company’s share register at 
the close of business on May 4, 2012. As with previous dividends, 
depending on the share price at the time the Board will consider 
whether shareholders will be given the opportunity to elect to receive 
new shares instead of cash. The Board is seeking to renew its authority 
to offer this alternative at the Annual General Meeting. Should this 
alternative be offered, the price will be calculated on the basis of the 
average mid-market closing price of the ordinary shares for the five 
business days commencing May 2, 2012. The last date for elections 
under such an alternative, if offered, will be June 15, 2012.
Review of the business
This business review comprises the sections on 
“Who we are”, “Where we operate”, “How we performed”, together 
with the Chairman’s Review on 
 pages 6 to 9 and the Financial and 
Operational Reviews set out below. The Key Performance Indicators on
pages 2 to 4 entitled
pages 5 and 14 and the Risks and Uncertainties laid out on
page
14 also form part of this review.
Financial review
The Group’s royalty revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 
were £35.1 million compared to £30.1 million for the previous year.  
The total of these royalty revenues and cash flows from royalty  
debentures during the year of £0.7 million (2010: £0.9 million),  
result in total royalty cash flow per share increasing by 16% to 33.11p 
(2010: 28.65p).
Anglo Pacific Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Realised gains on disposal of mining and exploration interests were 
£20.3 million (2010: £41.0 million). In difficult junior mining markets 
these gains were the result of the disposal of some of the Group’s 
successful mining investments where the acquisition of royalties was 
considered unlikely. Overall the Group’s profit before tax for the year 
was £49.0 million (2010: £65.8 million) and Group earnings per share 
for the year were 33.87p (2010: 51.99p).
The Group’s Australian coking coal royalty interests have been 
independently valued at December 31, 2011 at £175.1 million (2010: 
£177.1 million). The Group’s royalty instruments following fair value 
adjustments were valued at £24.7 million at December 31, 2011  
(2010: £28.1 million).
The total cost of royalties, excluding amortisation, treated as 
intangibles has increased to £70.5 million at December 31, 2011 (2010: 
£42.1 million). As part of the annual impairment review a directors’ 
valuation of these royalties has been undertaken using a discounted 
cash flow valuation model, which uses forecast commodity prices  
and management’s best estimate of an appropriate discount rate 
taking into account project-specific risk factors. At December 31, 2011 
the directors’ valuation of these assets was £120.5 million  
(2010: £54.2 million).

The Group’s quoted and unquoted equity investments, including royalty 
options, were valued at £64.6 million at December 31, 2011 (2010: 
£128.5 million). The private equity interests and royalty options remain 
accounted for at cost.
The Group’s work on the Trefi and Panorama coal projects in British 
Columbia, Canada continues to be included in the accounts at 
cost, and the cost of property acquisition, tenure maintenance and 
deferred exploration totalled £2.1 million at December 31, 2011 
(2010: £2.0 million). 
As at December 31, 2011, the Group had cash of £32.2 million compared 
to £28.3 million at December 31, 2010, with no borrowings or hedging. 
When combined with royalty and trade receivables, total cash and 
receivables at December 31, 2011 was £44.5 million (2010: £37.1 million). 
The Group has limited capital expenditure requirements other than for 
the acquisition of additional royalties. Management believe that the 
Group’s current cash resources and future cash flows will be sufficient to 
cover the cost of general and administrative expenses, income taxes and 
dividend payments. The Group remains debt free and its liquid resources 
are held mostly in Australian and Canadian dollars and with a number of 
different financial institutions. The Group’s mining interests and royalty 
revenues are also mainly denominated in these two currencies.

Report of the Directors
Directors’ report
The Group’s total assets at December 31, 2011 were £380.2 million, 
compared to £415.6 million at December 31, 2010. This does not include 
any increase in value over cost that may be attributable to the Group’s 
royalty intangibles or the Panorama and Trefi coal projects. If royalty 
intangibles were included at valuation this would enhance assets by 
a further £52.2 million (2010: £12.1 million).
Operational review
Coking coal royalties
In Australia, coking coal royalty receipts from the Kestrel and Crinum 
mines, operated by Rio Tinto Limited and BHP Billiton Limited 
respectively, were £32.4 million (2010: £29.9 million). Lower export 
levels of coking coal from Australia in the first half of 2011, largely due 
to adverse weather in Queensland, and record global steel production 
supported coking coal prices over the first half of the year with spot 
prices above US$300 per tonne. Prices fell toward the end of the 
year with a downturn in steel market sentiment brought about by 
the protracted Eurozone crisis. Global steel production also retreated 
in the second half of 2011 which coincided with the recovery of 
Australian coking coal supply. Coal sales by Kestrel were 3.8 million 
tonnes in 2011 (2010: 4.4 million tonnes). Throughout the year the 
sales price range of hard coking coal was US$328 to US$235  
per tonne.
The coal royalties from the Kestrel and Crinum mines are paid on 
coal mined under private subterranean rights with a royalty rate 
prescribed by the Queensland Mineral Resources Act Regulations. 
These regulations provide that a royalty rate of 7% applies to the value 
of coal sold below A$100 per tonne and a rate of 10% applies to the 
value of coal sold above A$100 per tonne. The Group owns 50% of the 
private subterranean rights and therefore receives 50% of the royalties 
paid on coal sold.
The independent valuation of these interests at December 31, 2011 
was £175.1 million (A$265.9 million) compared to £177.1 million 
(A$270.3 million) at December 31, 2010. The valuation is based on the 
net present value of the pre-tax cash flows discounted at a rate of 7% 
and the net royalty income is taxed in Australia at a rate of 30%.
Iron ore royalties
In Brazil, royalty receipts from the Amapá Iron Ore System (“Amapá”) 
operated by Anglo American PLC were £2.7 million (2010: £0.2 
million). The Group holds a 1% gross revenue royalty covering iron 
ore within the Amapá licences in the Amapá region of northern 
Brazil. Amapá is 70% owned by Anglo American PLC and 30% by 
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (“Cliffs”), a large US based NYSE listed 
company. Anglo American PLC’s public disclosures show Amapá 
produced 5.08 million tonnes of pellet and sinter feed in 2011 
including increased production of the higher value pellet feed. For 
further information on the operation and for the latest iron ore reserve 
and resource estimates please see www.angloamerican.com.
Also, in Brazil, the Group holds a 1% gross revenue royalty on iron ore 
and non-precious metals, other than copper, on Beadell Resources 
Limited’s (“Beadell”) mineral rights in the State of Amapá (excluding 
any mineral rights comprising the Tartaruga Project as at October 11, 
2010) including the Tucano Concession adjacent to Anglo American 
PLC’s Amapá operation. The rights currently cover approximately 
2,500 square kilometers and as well as containing Beadell’s Tucano 
gold project are prospective for iron ore. On August 29, 2011 Beadell 
announced a maiden JORC compliant iron ore resource for the  
Tucano Concession the details of which can be found at  
www.beadellresources.com.au. Beadell is currently stockpiling iron 
ore from stripping operations related to its gold project and seeking a 
strategic partner for the development of the iron ore resource. Beadell 
Resources Limited is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
During the year the Group acquired a 1% gross revenue royalty on 
London Mining PLC’s Isua iron ore project in Greenland in exchange for 
a non-interest bearing advance of US$30 million. London Mining PLC, 
which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has commenced work 
on a feasibility study for the Isua project with production targeted 
for 2015. The royalty agreement contains a number of milestones, 
including the completion of a bankable feasibility study by December 
31, 2012 and obtaining an exploitation licence by December 31, 2013. 
In the event of these not being met, the Group retains the right to be 
repaid in cash or, at London Mining’s discretion, in shares at the market 
price at the time. Further information on the project and the latest 
iron ore resource estimate can be found at www.londonmining.co.uk. 
On February 6, 2012 the Group announced a proposed transaction 
to acquire 50% of the 1.5% gross revenue royalty on the Mount Ida 
magnetite iron ore project from Red Rock Resources PLC, a London 
Stock Exchange listed company. The acquisition will total US$14 
million paid in three instalments: (i)US$6 million on completion 
and agreement of terms of the transaction for a 0.3% gross revenue 
royalty; (ii) US$4 million for a further 0.225% gross revenue royalty 
following a positive definitive feasibility study (“DFS”), a decision to 
mine and 20% of the pre-production capital costs outlined in the 
DFS being provided for; and (iii) US$4 million for a further 0.225% 
gross revenue royalty, taking the total to 0.75% on commencement 
of commercial production. The Mount Ida magnetite iron ore project 
is being developed by Jupiter Mines Limited (“Jupiter”), an Australian 
Stock Exchange listed company. The project has a JORC compliant 
Inferred iron ore resource announced by Jupiter on January 19, 2011 
and a scoping study was completed in March 2011 outlining the 
production of high quality magnetite concentrate, to be transported 
along the existing railway from Menzies to Port Esperance on Western 
Australia’s south coast. A feasibility study is underway for completion 
by the end of 2012. Additional information on the project and the 
latest iron ore resource estimate can be found at  
www.jupitermines.com. 
In Australia the Group holds a 1.5% gross revenue royalty covering 
three exploration licences in the central Pilbara region of Western 
Australia. The tenements, covering approximately 263 square 
kilometres, are owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP Billiton 
Limited and host a number of known iron occurrences, the most 
significant being the Railway deposit. The tenements are supported 
by extensive rail infrastructure including the rail lines from Rio Tinto 
Limited’s West Angelas and Yandicoogina mines and BHP Billiton 
Limited’s rail line serving its current operations at Mining Area C, which 
lies immediately to the east of the Railway deposit. United Minerals 
Corporation NL (“UMC”) explored the tenements during the period 
2007 to 2010. The last update of resources was by UMC on September 
21, 2009, when it announced a JORC compliant Indicated iron ore 
resource. UMC was acquired by BHP Billiton Limited in February 2010. 
Further information may be found at www.bhpbilliton.com.
The Group owns a 2% net smelter return royalty interest in the 
Jogjakarta iron sands and pig-iron project (“Jogjakarta”), located in 
Indonesia and operated by Indo Mines Limited (“Indo”) an Australian 
Stock Exchange listed company. On August 29, 2011 Indo announced 
the results of a JORC compliant feasibility study; the details of which 
can be found at www.indomines.com.au. On September 8, 2011 the 
company announced that it had successfully produced pig-iron at 
the Outotec Trial Smelting facility and on February 1, 2012 that it had 
received the final environmental approval for Jogjakarta.

Report of the Directors
Directors’ report
2011 Quarterly Activities Report, Berkeley reported that discussions 
were continuing with ENUSA regarding the development of the “State 
Reserves”. Berkeley also announced that its wholly owned Salamanca 
I uranium project continues on schedule with first production 
anticipated in 2014. For further information on the projects and  
the latest uranium resource estimates please see  
www.berkeleyresources.com.au.
The Group owns a 1% net smelter return royalty interest in the 
developing Four Mile uranium project located in South Australia and 
operated by a joint venture between Quasar Resources Proprietary 
Limited (“Quasar”) (75%) and Alliance Resources Limited (“Alliance”) 
(25%). Approval for the mine was granted by the Australian 
government in July 2009; however, the joint venture parties are 
currently in dispute over a number of matters and development 
of the mine has been placed on hold until these are resolved. On 
February 10, 2012, in what the Group sees as a positive development, 
Alliance announced that notices of discontinuance had been filed 
ending litigation surrounding the native title agreement for the Four 
Mile uranium project. Subsequently, Alliance announced on February 
20, 2012 that Quasar and Alliance had received an offer of a 10 year 
mineral lease over the Four Mile uranium project from the South 
Australian Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy. On January 
27, 2010 Alliance announced a JORC compliant Indicated uranium 
resource and on July 28, 2010 Alliance reported the results of a scoping 
study. Alliance Resources Limited is an Australian Stock Exchange 
listed company and further details of the project and the latest 
uranium resource estimates can be found at  
www.allianceresources.com.au.
In addition, the Group holds the royalty rights on some mineral 
exploration licences in the Athabasca Basin region of Canada. The 
Group has recognised an impairment charge of £1.1 million during the 
year, as a result of the inherent uncertainty of these licences entering 
commercial production. The Group will continue to review the 
development of these licences on an annual basis.
Gold royalties
The Group owns a 2.5% net smelter return royalty, escalating to 3% 
for gold prices in excess of US$1,100 per ounce, on the El Valle-Boinas/
Carles (“EVBC”) gold/copper mines located in Spain and operated 
by Orvana Minerals Corp (“Orvana”), a Toronto Stock Exchange 
listed company. Commissioning of EVBC commenced June 1, 2011 
with production to September 30, 2011 of 9,336 ounces of gold, 
1.05 million pounds of copper and 28,456 ounces of silver (Orvana 
Operational Update November 10, 2011). During the year, the maiden 
receipts relating to the net smelter return royalty were received. 
These totalled £0.3 million and consisted of repayments under the 
debenture instrument. On February 21, 2012 Orvana announced 
an updated gold and copper resource estimate and production 
projections for EVBC; further details can be found at www.orvana.com.
The Group holds a 2.5% net smelter return royalty on the Engenho 
gold mine in Brazil, operated by Mundo Minerals Limited (“Mundo”), 
an Australian Stock Exchange listed company. During the year, receipts 
relating to the net smelter return royalty on the Engenho gold mine 
totalled £0.3 million (2010: £0.4 million). These receipts consisted of 
repayments under the debenture instrument and also included £0.1 
million interest. In November 2011, Mundo placed the Engenho gold 
mine on care and maintenance and on December 20, 2011, Mundo’s 
Brazilian subsidiary was granted court approval for protection under 
Recuperação Judicial, the Brazilian equivalent of the US Chapter 11 
process. As at December 31, 2011 a full provision of £1.6 million was 
made against the royalty instrument held by the Group in Mundo.
The Group owns a 2.5% escalating net smelter return royalty on 
the Malartic-Midway and McKenzie Break projects. The projects
Anglo Pacific Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
are located in Quebec, Canada, and were until recently operated 
by Northern Star Mining Corp. On January 25, 2011 the company 
announced that it had been deemed to have filed assignments in 
bankruptcy. The Group has registered its royalty interests against the 
relevant tenures and continues to pursue its rights with the receiver 
to ensure that the royalty remains attached to the property in the 
event of any disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2010 a full 
provision of £4.2 million was made against the royalty instrument held 
by the Group in Northern Star Mining Corp.
The Group also owns an option to acquire a 2% net smelter return 
royalty on Creso Exploration Inc’s Duggan gold property in Ontario, 
Canada. Exploration work at this property is ongoing.
Chromite royalties
During the year the Group acquired a 1% net smelter return royalty 
interest in the Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy chromite projects 
via the purchase of 7207565 Canada Inc. from KWG Resources Inc. (a 
Toronto Stock Exchange listed company) for US$18 million. The deposits 
in the “Ring-of-Fire” region of Northern Ontario, Canada are owned 
and operated by Cliffs. Cliffs is currently preparing a comprehensive 
Project Description as required under Canadian guidelines for economic, 
environmental and social assessments. Further details on the project can 
be found at www.cliffsnaturalresources.com.
The Group holds a 3% gross revenue royalty over the output from 
Empire Mining Corp’s (“Empire”) Bulqiza chromite project in Albania. 
On November 7, 2011 Empire announced it was ceasing operations 
in Albania due to material omissions in its renewed exploration 
licences. Empire has been conducting high level talks with the Albanian 
government in an effort to rectify the matter. A clarification of Empire’s 
position is expected in the first half of 2012. Empire Mining Corp is listed 
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Nickel royalty option
The Group holds an option to acquire for US$12.5 million a 1.5% net 
smelter return royalty on the Araguaia and Lontra Nickel Projects 
(“Araguaia Project”) which are located in the Carajas Mineral 
District of Northern Brazil and are owned by Horizonte Minerals PLC 
(“Horizonte”), a London Stock Exchange listed company. Horizonte 
acquired the Araguaia Project from Teck Resources Limited in 2010, 
which resulted in Teck Resources Limited controlling approximately 
44% of Horizonte’s outstanding share capital. On January 10, 2012 
Horizonte announced an updated NI 43-101 / JORC compliant nickel 
laterite resource; work on a Preliminary Economic Assessment is 
underway for delivery mid-2012. Further information can be found at  
www.horizonteminerals.com.
Other royalty options
The Group also owns options to acquire a 1% net smelter return 
royalty on each of the Highbank Lake and Eastbank PGE exploration 
properties in Ontario, Canada, owned by Northern Shield Resources 
Inc., a Toronto Stock Exchange listed company.
Coal properties
During the year the Group continued to assess prospective partners 
for its Panorama and Discovery coal projects in the Groundhog 
Coalfield, northern British Columbia, Canada (collectively referred to 
as “Panorama”) and its Trefi coal project in the Peace River Coalfield, 
northwest British Columbia, Canada.
The Panorama coal project has a NI 43-101 / JORC compliant 
Indicated resource of 13.7 million tonnes of semi-anthracite to 
anthracite coal and an Inferred resource of 24.1 million tonnes of semi-
anthracite to anthracite coal. 
The Trefi project has a NI 43-101 / JORC compliant Measured coal 
resource of 14.25 million tonnes and an Indicated coal resource of 25.1 
million tonnes and an Inferred coal resource of 51.6 million tonnes.

Report of the Directors
Directors’ report
The Group continues to examine possible methods of monetising its 
interest in both Panorama and Trefi while retaining a royalty. 
Mining and exploration interests
The Group’s equity investments in both listed and unlisted mineral 
exploration and development companies continued to generate 
opportunities for royalty acquisitions during the year. The Group’s 
equity investments remained focused on copper, precious metals, iron 
ore and uranium at December 31, 2011. Where royalty opportunities 
appeared no longer identifiable within an equity investment, the 
Group disposed of the interest. Despite difficult equity market 
conditions during the year the Group was able overall to realise 
significant profits on these disposals.
Outlook
With recent signs of recovery in the US economy and much better 
bank liquidity within the troubled Eurozone, mining markets and 
commodity prices have improved sharply in the last two months. 
This has resulted in a significant increase in the value of the Group’s 
equity interests since the year end. Furthermore, with this improving 
background, the raising of mining finance from conventional lenders 
or equity issues has become less of a challenge for larger mining 
companies. However, in the junior mining sector access to finance 
still remains challenging. In this environment, the Group continues 
to identify royalty opportunities and receive numerous enquiries for 
mining finance.
Key performance indicators
The Board has identified four main key performance indicators,  
all of which are financial:
(i)  Value of new royalties acquired
(ii)  Net asset value
(iii) Earnings per share
(iv) Dividends per share
In addition to these financial KPIs, the Board also considers non-
financial factors such as the Group’s compliance with Corporate 
Governance Standards and environmental considerations relevant 
to some of the Group’s mining interests. These factors cannot be 
efficiently measured so do not form part of the Group’s KPIs.
Risks and uncertainties
In addition to normal business risks, the Board has identified, inter alia, 
four main macro-economic risks that could affect the Group’s 
performance:-
(i)  A prolonged, world-wide economic recession
(ii)  Sustained low commodity prices
(iii) A fall in precious metal prices
(iv) Currency volatility
Measures taken by the Board to manage these risks include:-
•	Regular mining project management meetings and discussions
•	Regular documented project review meetings
•	Substantial cash holdings
•	A diversified portfolio of projects covering a number of commodities
and geographical areas
•	Substantial exposure to gold and other precious metals
•	Regular review of sovereign risk
•	Cash being held at a number of banks and stockbrokers in a variety
of currencies and short term financial instruments
Anglo Pacific Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
The Board is also aware of the need for succession planning and 
the associated risks to the Group are under constant review. 
Further appointments will be made to the Board as required.
Financial instruments
The Group’s principal treasury objective is to provide sufficient liquidity 
to meet operational cash flow and dividend requirements and to allow 
the Group to take advantage of new growth opportunities whilst 
maximising shareholder value. The Group operates controlled treasury 
policies which are monitored by management to ensure that the needs 
of the Group are met as they evolve. The impact of the risks required 
to be discussed in accordance with IFRS 7 are summarised below, while 
detailed discussion and sensitivity analysis relating to these risks is 
contained in note 3 to these accounts.
Liquidity and funding risk
The objective of the Company in managing funding risk is to ensure 
that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. At 
the year end there was no debt outstanding and the Company, with its 
strong balance sheet, had good access to capital markets, if required.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, royalty 
instruments held as financial assets, trade and other receivables and 
investments. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit 
risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables, 
including royalty receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present 
the amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful 
receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior 
experience and the current economic environment. Where possible 
the Group has registered its interests against the relevant mining titles 
for the royalties it has acquired. In addition, the Group is generally 
entitled to full reconciliations of amounts paid and retains the right to 
audit the royalty returns and verify the calculations.
The Group’s credit risk on royalty instruments held as financial 
instruments, has been reviewed and the estimated current exposure is 
as disclosed in note 17 where the future contractual right to cash flow 
from these instruments is reflected in their fair value.
The credit risk on bank deposits is limited because the counterparties 
have high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit 
risk, with exposure spread over a large number of currencies 
and counterparties.
In 2007, the Group created a derivative financial instrument to 
provide finance to an unlisted mining development company, which 
has subsequently listed (note 19). This instrument is convertible into 
equity in the company or royalties over the company’s properties 
at the Group’s option for a period of up to five years. In the event of 
default the instrument becomes repayable and the Group would rank 
equally with the company’s other unsecured creditors. The Group 
undertakes detailed analysis of factors which mitigate the risk of 
default to the Group on a regular basis.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s transactional foreign exchange exposure arises from 
income, expenditure and purchase and sale of assets denominated in 
foreign currencies. As each material commitment is made, the risk in 
relation to currency fluctuations is assessed by the Board and regularly 
reviewed. The Group does not consider it necessary to have a hedging 
programme in place at this time.

The Group has no borrowings or debt and the Group’s financial 
instruments have limited exposure to fluctuations as a result of 
changes in interest rates. This is regularly reviewed by management.
Other price risk
The Group’s mining and exploration interests are held for the purposes 
of generating additional royalties and are considered long-term, 
strategic investments. This strategy is unaffected by fluctuations in 
prices for mining and exploration equities; however, changes in market 
conditions may affect the value and recoverability of the amounts 
invested. The Group has detailed investment review processes in place 
to manage this risk to the greatest extent possible.
The royalty portfolio exposes the Group to other price risk through 
fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of hard coking 
coal and iron ore, which may affect the future cash flows received from 
the Group’s royalties.
Management

The Group’s directors have extensive experience in the mining industry,

Group’s 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Corporate governance
A full report on corporate governance can be found on

pages 20 to 22
Corporate social responsibility
Business conduct
The Group is committed to maintaining the highest standards of 
integrity in all areas of its business. The Group published a statement 
of integrity in 2011, a copy of which is available on the Group’s website. 
The Group also has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all 
of its directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisers, business 
partners, or anyone else, who may be acting on its behalf, is aware of 
their responsibilities in this area. 
The Group has a whistle blowing policy in place and its employees 
are encouraged to report any potential or apparent misconduct. 
Any employee that raises any issues honestly and in good faith will 
be supported by the Group.
Health and safety
The health and safety of the Group’s employees is a fundamental 
responsibility. The small size of the Group’s organisation allows the 
day-to-day responsibility to remain at the Board level, being monitored 
by the Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, a commitment to health 
and safety is a fundamental component of a successful mining project, 
and, as part of its investment decision process, the Group has access to 
consultants with the requisite expertise to ensure that it can consider 
and, if necessary, mitigate any such risks to the fullest extent possible.
Social and community issues
The Group acknowledges that, while its activities have little direct 
contact with communities, it can positively influence the social 
practices and policies of companies it conducts business with. Positive 
social and community relationships are essential to profitable and 
successful mineral extraction activities, and the Group endeavours to 
ensure that companies it works with have appropriate procedures in 
place to facilitate this. The Group also consults with local community 
groups where it believes its activities could have an impact to provide 
these potentially impacted groups with the opportunity to engage at 
the planning stage. With respect to its private coal interests in British 
Columbia, Canada the Group has engaged with First Nations and will 
continue to engage and consult as the projects advance. 
The environment
The Group remains committed to an environmental policy of 
collaborating fully with statutory authorities, local communities and 
special interest groups to minimise the effects of its activities on the 
natural and human environments associated with its operations, where 
appropriate. The Group complies with all relevant environmental 
legislation on its private coal interests in British Columbia, Canada and is 
assisted in this regard by a team of experienced Canadian consultants.
The Group acknowledges that it has some ability to positively influence 
the environmental practices and policies of companies it conducts 
business with. Management discussions necessarily address common 
environmental policy ideals, and the Board remains committed 
to working with its fellow mining companies to ensure that the 
environmental impact of mineral exploration and development activities 
is minimised as much as possible. In today’s world, a responsible 
approach to a project’s environmental impact is essential to the success 
of the project, and, as part of its investment decision process, the Group 
has access to consultants with the requisite expertise to ensure that it 
can consider and, if necessary, mitigate any risks in this regard to the 
fullest extent possible.

Report of the Directors
Directors’ report
Employees
The Group has 11 employees, 4 of whom are executive directors. 
More information regarding the Group’s employees can be found on
pages 15 to 16 and page 50.
Donations
It is a continuing policy of the Group not to make political or charitable 
donations. The Group’s directors and employees support philanthropic 
efforts generally using their own personal resources. The Group’s 
philosophy is that charity is a decision best made by shareholders 
with their own resources, rather than management using the Group’s 
resources to make this decision on their behalf. The Group aims 
to increase dividends and the value of the Group’s shares so that 
shareholders can make their own charitable decisions.
No donations were made to charities during the year (2010: nil).
No political donations were made during the year (2010: nil).
Policy on payment of creditors 
The Company’s policy with regard to the payment of suppliers is to: 
•	agree terms of payment at the start of business with each supplier; 
•	ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment; and
•	pay suppliers in accordance with contractual and legal obligations.
During the year to December 31, 2011 the Company took an average of 
33 days to settle its bills with suppliers (2010: 23 days). The Company 
acknowledges the importance of paying invoices promptly, especially 
those of small businesses.
Essential contracts
The Group has a number of members of staff, who due to their 
knowledge of the Group and its intellectual property, are essential 
to the continued smooth running of the business. The Group reviews 
its employment policies on an annual basis, including a review of its 
performance-related pay policies, so as to ensure these members of 
staff continue to remain incentivised and their goals remain congruent 
with those of the Group. All employee contracts contain non-compete 
agreements and also stipulate that all intellectual property remains 
that of the Group.

to the Panorama coal project and the Trefi coal project was derived, 
respectively, from the technical report entitled “Resource Estimate 
for the Discovery and Panorama Coal Properties” dated July 12, 2010 
(the “Panorama and Discovery Report”) and the technical report 
entitled “Resource Estimate for the Trefi Coal Property” dated March

“qualified person” for the purposes of NI 43-101 and is independent 
of the Company. Each of the Panorama and Discovery Report and the 
Trefi Report is available on the Company’s SEDAR profile at  
www.sedar.com.
Third party information
As a royalty holder, the Group often has limited, if any, access to non-
public scientific and technical information in respect of the properties 
underlying its portfolio of royalties, or such information is subject to 
confidentiality provisions. As such, in preparing this Annual Report, 
the Group has relied upon the public disclosures of the owners and 
operators of the properties underlying its portfolio of royalties, as 
available at the date of this Annual Report.
References in this Annual Report to websites are made as inactive 
textual references and for informational purposes only. Information 
found at the relevant websites is not incorporated by reference into 
this Annual Report. The Group makes no representation as to the 
accuracy of any such information.
Cautionary statement on forward-looking statements and 
related information
Certain statements in this Annual Report, other than statements 
of historical fact, are forward-looking statements based on certain 
assumptions and reflect the Group’s expectations and views of 
future events. Forward-looking statements (which include the phrase 
“forward-looking information”) are provided for the purposes of 
assisting readers in understanding the Group’s financial position 
and results of operations as at and for the periods ended on certain 
dates, and of presenting information about management’s current 
expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned 
that such forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for 
other purposes than outlined in this Annual Report. These statements 
may include, without limitation, statements regarding the operations, 
business, financial condition, expected financial results, cash flow, 
requirement for and terms of additional financing, performance, 
prospects, opportunities, priorities, targets, goals, objectives, 
strategies, growth and outlook of the Group including the outlook 
for the markets and economies in which the Group operates, costs 
and timing of acquiring new royalties, mineral reserve and resources 
estimates, estimates of future production, production costs and 
revenue, future demand for and prices of precious and base metals 
and other commodities, for the current fiscal year and subsequent 
periods. In addition, statements relating to “reserves” or “resources” 
are forward-looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, 
based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the resources and 
reserves described can be profitably produced in the future.
Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive
in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or 
include words such as “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “believes”, 
“estimates”, “seeks”, “intends”, “targets”, “projects”, “forecasts”, or 
negative versions thereof and other similar expressions, or future or 
conditional verbs such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “would” and “could”. 
Forward-looking statements are based upon certain material factors 
that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or 
projection, including assumptions and analyses made by the Group 
in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current 
conditions and expected future developments, as well as other 
factors that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances. The 
material factors and assumptions upon which such forward-looking 
statements are based include: the stability of the global economy; the 
stability of local governments and legislative background; the relative 
stability of interest rates; the equity and debt markets continuing to 
provide access to capital; the continuing of ongoing operations of the 
properties underlying the Group’s portfolio of royalties by the owners 
or operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past 
practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures (including 
feasibility studies, estimates of reserve, resource, production, grades, 
mine life and cash cost) made by the owners or operators of such 
underlying properties; no material adverse change in the price 
of the commodities underlying the Group’s portfolio of royalties 
and investments; no material adverse change in foreign exchange 
exposure; no adverse development in respect of any significant 
property in which the Group holds a royalty or other interest, including 
but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations and 
natural disasters; successful completion of new development projects; 
planned expansions or additional projects being within the timelines 
anticipated and at anticipated production levels; and maintenance of 
mining title. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future 
performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which 
could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, 
estimated or intended in the forward-looking statements.
By its nature, this information is subject to inherent risks and 
uncertainties that may be general or specific and which give rise to 
the possibility that expectations, forecasts, predictions, projections or 
conclusions will not prove to be accurate; that assumptions may not 
be correct and that objectives, strategic goals and priorities will not be 
achieved. A variety of material factors, many of which are beyond the 
Group’s control, affect the operations, performance and results of the 
Group, its businesses and investments, and could cause actual results 
to differ materially from those suggested by any forward-looking 
information. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited 
to current global financial conditions, royalty portfolio and associated 
risk, adverse development risk, financial viability and operational 
effectiveness of owners and operators of the relevant properties 
underlying the Group’s portfolio of royalties, royalties subject to other 
rights, and contractual terms not being honoured, together with 
those risks identified in the “Risks and uncertainties” and “Financial 
instruments” sections herein and the other risks identified in the “Risk 
Factors” section of the Group’s most recent Annual Information Form 
available on www.sedar.com and the Group’s website  
www.anglopacificgroup.com. If any such risks actually occur, they 
could materially adversely affect the Group’s business, financial 
condition or results of operations. Readers are cautioned that the list 
of factors noted in the section herein entitled “Risks and uncertainties” 
is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect the Group’s forward-
looking statements. Readers are also cautioned to consider these and 
other factors, uncertainties and potential events carefully and not to 
put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

contained and derived from publicly available information regarding 
properties and mining operations owned by third parties. The Group’s 
management relies upon this forward-looking information in its 
estimates, projections, plans, and analysis. Although the forward-
looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based upon 
what the Group believes are reasonable assumptions, there can be no 
assurance that actual results will be consistent with these forward-
looking statements. The forward-looking statements made in this 
Annual Report relate only to events or information as of the date on 
which the statements are made and, except as specifically required 
by applicable laws, listing rules and other regulations, the Group 
undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made 
or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.

Governance
Corporate governance report
Principles of Corporate Governance
The Board remains committed to a process of ongoing improvement 
in its corporate governance practice, not only in step with the evolving 
nature of good corporate governance practice, but also in step with 
the growth of the Group. There were two significant developments 
in this area in 2011 that have impacted the Group. The first was the 
introduction of The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). 
The Company believes that it complies with the Main Principles of 
the Code, except in respect of a formal annual process to evaluate 
the performance of the Board and of its Committees and individual 
directors (Main Principle B.6). In this report, the Company explains 
how it has applied the Main Principles of the Code. However, the 
Board believes that corporate governance involves more than a simple 
“box ticking” approach to establish whether the Group has met the 
requirements of a number of specific rules and regulations. Rather, 
the issue is one of applying good corporate governance principles in a 
sensible and pragmatic fashion, which has proper regard to the Group’s 
particular business profile and size. The key objective is to enhance and 
protect shareholder value.
The second development was the promotion of the Company to the 
FTSE 250 Index in April 2011. The Company’s shares continue to be 
listed on both the London and the Toronto Stock Exchanges and the 
Company’s promotion from the FTSE SmallCap Index reflects the 
strong growth of the Group. However, despite this growth, the Group’s 
organisation remains exceptionally small and compact. At December 
31, 2011, apart from the four executive directors, the Group employed 
only seven staff.
The Board
Leadership
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 
Company and meets regularly to provide entrepreneurial leadership to 
the Group and to monitor the Group’s risk management framework.  
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, two additional executive directors and three non-executive 
directors. The day to day management of the Group is delegated to  
the executive directors, including the Chairman, save for certain matters 
reserved for consideration by the Board. Other responsibilities are  
given to the Committees of the Board, as set out in the Committee 
sections below and in their terms of reference, which are available on 
the Group’s website.
The Chairman, Mr P.M. Boycott, is responsible for the leadership 
and effectiveness of the Board. The post remains an executive role, 
although the Chairman, together with one other of the executive 
directors (Mr B.M. Wides), is employed on a three days a week basis. 
The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer have distinct roles, which 
have been defined in writing and agreed by the Board. Further, the 
Board anticipates that the role of Chairman will in due course become 
a non-executive one, but the transition is being managed progressively 
so as to take maximum advantage of the directors’ expertise. During 
2011, the Chief Executive Officer took over the chairmanship of the 
Executive Committee. The Board anticipates that the transition should 
be completed over the next two to three years and that, beyond that, Mr 
P.M. Boycott and Mr B.M. Wides would act as non-executive directors.
Mr M.H. Atkinson is the Group’s Senior Independent Director (“SID”). 
The role of the SID is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and 
to serve as an intermediary for the other directors where necessary. 
He also takes the lead on meetings of the non-executive directors 
outside the formal committee structure and works with the Chairman 
to encourage constructive relations between the executive and non-
executive directors and to ensure that the non-executive directors are 
fully able to use their external experiences to constructively challenge
Anglo Pacific Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
and develop proposals on strategy and to scrutinise the performance 
of management. The SID is also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels, or 
where such channels would be inappropriate.
Effectiveness
Excluding the Chairman, and following the resignation of Mr Tack in 
September 2011, the Board is currently comprised of six directors, 
three of whom are non-executive directors. The Board considers all of 
its non-executive directors to be independent within the meaning of 
the Code. Dr J.G. Whellock and Mr A.H. Yadgaroff were appointed to 
the board on March 3, 2003 and as such, have served as non-executive 
directors for nine years. As a result, the Board has recently had to 
re-determine whether these individuals continue to be independent 
in judgement and character. At present, the Board feels that the 
personal attributes of the individuals are such that both continue to be 
independent and to offer much to the Group. With these two directors 
continuing to be viewed as independent, the Board is currently 
compliant with the Code’s provision that at least half of the board, 
excluding the chairman, should be comprised of independent non-
executive directors.
Further to the Davies Report, FTSE 350 companies have been 
encouraged to promote greater female representation on boards. The 
Group supports Lord Davies’s published strategy and hopes to make 
progress in increasing the number of females on the Board. However, 
the Board is wary of the potential superficiality of quotas and believes 
that the best approach is to continue to ensure that the appointments 
process takes account of the benefits of diversity (including gender), 
that all appointments are made on merit and that the Board 
represents the best interests of shareholders. 
The Board, through its Nomination Committee, keeps under review the 
need for new director appointments, so as to maintain an appropriate 
balance of skills and independence within the Group and to ensure that 
the Board is refreshed, as appropriate. The size of the organisation allows 
the directors to closely observe the skills, knowledge and behaviour of 
those employees who have the potential to become future leaders of 
the Group. New director appointments are made by the Board, having 
regard to the recommendations of the Nomination Committee. All 
directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity 
after their appointment. Under the terms of the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all directors are required to retire and seek re-appointment 
by shareholders at an annual general meeting on the third anniversary 
of their appointment. The current non-executive directors were 
not appointed to specified terms, but the Board intends to appoint 
future non-executive directors on a rolling three-year contract. 
Notwithstanding this, the Board also intends that all of the directors 
(including the non-executive directors) should now offer themselves for 
re-election at each annual general meeting.
Each director is required to disclose to the Board their other significant 
commitments prior to appointment and when there is any significant 
change. There is a procedure in place whereby actual and potential 
conflicts of interest are regularly reviewed. As permitted under the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company’s Articles of Association contain 
provisions that enable the Board to authorise conflicts or potential 
conflicts that individual directors may have and to impose such limits 
or conditions as the Board thinks fit. The Board considers that all of the 
directors allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. 
The Group’s directors have a wide range of skills as well as experience 
in financial, commercial and mining activities. Each director takes 
responsibility for undertaking the appropriate training required for 
developing and updating their knowledge and capabilities. Where 
appropriate, the Group provides the resources to meet the directors’

requirements. During the year, directors attended, inter alia, seminars 
and conferences on mining industry developments, the Bribery Act and 
economic trends. The nature of the Group’s business and the number 
of its employees allow the directors to have a strong understanding of 
both the Group’s operations and staff.
The executive directors and the Board Committees report and 
refer to the full Board at regular intervals on all matters relating to 
the running of the Group. The Chairman, in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for setting the Board’s agenda 
and for ensuring that the Board receives accurate, timely and clear 
information. The Chairman is also responsible for ensuring that 
adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items and, 
in particular, strategic issues which are further discussed at annual 
strategy meetings attended by all of the directors and all of the 
Company’s employees.
The Board approved the appointment of the Group’s Corporate Counsel, 
Mr P.T.J. Mason, as Company Secretary in July 2011. He is responsible for 
advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. 
All of the directors have access to his services and advice. Further, 
all of the directors may seek independent professional advice in the 
performance of their duties, at the Group’s expense.
The Code recommends that the board undertakes a formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
committees and individual directors. The Board does not currently 
have such formal standalone systems. The presence of an open 
environment where feedback is continually sought provides an 
informal process that enables the continual improvement of Board 
and Committee performance. The performance of individual executive 
directors is regularly reviewed by the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer, and is discussed in a structured way by the non-
executive directors in the context of determining annual incentive 
awards. The Board believes that these arrangements are appropriate 
and effective given the current size of the Board, the compactness of 
the organisation and the extent of collective decision-making by the 
executive directors. Each Committee and the Board is satisfied overall 
with its own effectiveness and the contribution and commitment of 
each of the directors. The Board will annually review the case for a 
more formal evaluation process, including the new proposal in the 
Code for an externally facilitated evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 
companies at least every three years.

Committees of the Board
Most of the Board’s work is conducted in Committees of either 
executive directors or non-executive directors. Each Committee deals 
with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs and has written terms of 
reference, which are available on the Group’s website.  
The Committees report to the full Board at regular intervals.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, comprising the executive directors of the 
Group, is responsible for reaching and implementing decisions on 
matters not reserved for the full Board. The Committee is now chaired 
by the Chief Executive Officer and held eight meetings during the period.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, comprising solely the independent 
non-executive directors, is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s framework of executive director 
remuneration. The Committee determines the contract terms, 
remuneration and other benefits for each of the executive 
directors (including the Chairman), including performance-related 
incentivisation awards, pension rights and compensation payments. 
It has access to the advice of independent remuneration consultants 
when required. The Committee is chaired by Mr A.H. Yadgaroff and 
held three meetings during the period. The Board itself determines 
the remuneration of the non-executive directors. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report is set out on 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises solely the independent 
non-executive directors and is chaired by Mr M.H. Atkinson. It meets 
as required in order to review the structure, size and composition of 
the Board (including its balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge) in light of developments in the leadership needs of 
the Group and in accepted best corporate governance practice. The 
Committee is responsible for identifying and nominating candidates for 
the approval of the Board. It may commission external advice or services 
as required. The Committee held two meetings during the period.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises solely the independent non-executive 
directors and is chaired by Dr J.G. Whellock. The Committee meets 
at least twice a year and may be attended, by invitation, by the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
the Company Secretary. The external auditors meet the Committee, 
in the absence of any executive directors, at least once a year. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Group’s website. 
Its prime task is to review the half-yearly and annual accounts, in the 
light of advice from the external auditors, before they are presented 
to the Board, focusing in particular on accounting policies and areas of 
management judgment and estimation. The Committee is responsible 
for monitoring the controls in place to ensure the integrity of the 
information reported to the shareholders. The Committee acts as a 
forum for discussion of internal control issues and contributes to the 
Board’s review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems and processes. The Committee also 
regularly reviews the case for an internal audit function in light of the 
growing size and complexity of the Group’s business; its present view 
is that this is not yet justified given the compact size of the Group and 
the directors’ involvement with individual transactions.
The Committee advises the Board on the appointment, performance, 
objectivity and independence of the external auditors and on their 
remuneration for both audit and non-audit work, and discusses 
the nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors. The 
Committee accepts that some non-audit work is most appropriately

undertaken by the auditors, but such work requires the prior approval 
of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Group does use other 
accounting firms for non-audit work, bearing in mind the need for 
experience, objectivity and value for money in each particular case.
During the year, the Committee met four times to consider and 
recommend the half-yearly and annual accounts and the annual report 
and to consider and review the annual audit approach and the Group’s 
internal control and risk management. The external auditors attended 
each meeting at which they presented their audit strategy and their 
findings and conclusions in respect of the half-yearly and annual 
accounts. In addition, the Committee reviewed a number of regular 
items, including the Group’s anti-corruption and whistle blowing 
policies and procedures.
page 26.
Internal control
The Board retains overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management. A statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements is set out on 
The Board has designed the Group’s system of internal control in order 
to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that its assets are 
safeguarded, that transactions are authorised and properly recorded and 
that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be 
detected within a timely period. However, no system of internal control 
can eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives or provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, or against 
fraud or unlawful behaviour. 
The key elements of the control system in operation are:
•	 The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational 
structure with clear lines of responsibility and appropriate delegation 
of authority;
•	There are established procedures for planning and approving
investments and information systems for monitoring the Group’s 
financial performance against budgets and forecasts;
•	The Chief Financial Officer is required annually to undertake a full 
assessment process, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, 
to identify and quantify the risks that face the Group’s businesses and 
functions, and to assess the adequacy of the prevention, monitoring 
and mitigation practices in place for those risks. In addition, regular 
reports about significant risks and associated control and monitoring 
procedures are made to the Audit Committee. They are responsible 
for reviewing the risk assessment for completeness and accuracy. 
The consolidated results of these reviews are reported to the Board 
to enable the directors to review the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control. The process adopted by the Group accords with 
the guidance contained in the document “Internal Control Revised 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council.
The Audit Committee receives reports from the external auditors 
on a regular basis and from the executive directors of the Group. 
The Board receives regular reports from all of its Committees.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 and up to the date 
of approval of the report and financial statements that have required 
the Board to deal with any related material internal control issues.
The directors confirm that the Board has reviewed the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control as described during the period and 
concluded that the controls and procedures are adequate.
Relations with shareholders
The Group is the only major mining royalty company in the UK and 
recognises the importance of developing a fuller understanding of its 
business model amongst investors. To this end, increased attention 
was paid to investor relations during the period, and to improving 
the effectiveness of two-way communication with fund managers, 
institutional investors and analysts, particularly those focusing on FTSE 
350 companies. During the year, the directors had several meetings with 
institutional investors whose combined shareholdings represented over 
50% of the total issued share capital of the Company. The Company is 
assisted in this initiative by its external public relations advisers.
There are over 2,000 private investors in the Group. The Board was 
pleased by the attendance at the 2011 Annual General Meeting where 
investors were able to hear at first hand a review of the Group’s results 
for 2010 and to ask about current business activity. This year’s Annual 
General Meeting will be held on April 19, 2012. The notice of the Annual 
General Meeting may be found on 
hopes that it will again be well-attended. It is anticipated that the 
chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, 
as well as the executive directors, will be available to answer any 
shareholder questions.

The Remuneration Committee comprises:
A.H. Yadgaroff (chairman)
M.H. Atkinson
J.G. Whellock
All the members of the Remuneration Committee are non-executive 
directors and are considered to be independent by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the 
Group’s policy on remuneration of its executive directors, including 
service contracts and compensation in the event of early termination. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available 
on the Group’s website at www.anglopacificgroup.com.
The remuneration strategy
The Group is characterised by a high market capitalisation relative to 
the size of its organisation, by long investment horizons, and by the 
absence of a comparable peer-group for the purpose of benchmarking 
performance. The Group’s success is highly dependent on the collective 
expertise, judgement and drive of the executive directors, particularly 
in the acquisition of further royalties.
The Remuneration Committee’s strategy accordingly puts strong 
emphasis on incentivising and retaining the executive directors with 
a remuneration package that comprises a fixed monthly basic salary, 
a significant performance-related incentive award, and a joint share 
ownership plan designed primarily to encourage long-term retention. 
The Remuneration Committee has considered the scope for a long-
term incentive plan, but the long investment horizons and absence of 
comparable UK companies make this difficult. Instead, a proportion 
of the overall package is in the form of shares, designed to ensure a 
strong alignment with the interests of shareholders. In determining 
remuneration, consideration is also given to reward levels throughout 
the Group as well as in the external employment market.

Directors’ remuneration report
The components of the package are set out below.
Company Share Option Plan
Executive directors’ remuneration
(i)  Basic salary
The basic salary component is low relative to that paid by  
FTSE 250 companies of a similar size and nature, and the 
Remuneration Committee’s aim over time is to continue steadily 
to narrow the gap with the lower quartile of basic salaries paid  
by such companies.
(ii)  Annual incentive award
The Group continues to operate an annual performance-related 
incentive plan, which creates a pool divisible between all executive 
directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee 
from time to time. The maximum award payable is capped at 
150% of basic salary. The Remuneration Committee considers 
the performance of the executive directors against a number of 
criteria, including the movement in the Company’s share price, 
the acquisition of new royalties, and the other three main key 
performance indicators outlined on 
A proportion of this award is normally payable in shares.
page 14.
(iii) Share schemes
The Group operates two share schemes: an HMRC-approved 
Company Share Option Plan (the “CSOP”) and a Joint Share 
Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”).
Company Share Option Plan
 The CSOP is open to certain employees and directors of the 
Company, as selected by the Board at its absolute discretion. 
The CSOP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on April 21, 2010.
 Share options are granted at the prevailing market price on the 
date of grant. The vesting period for the option plan is three 
years and, if an option remains unexercised after a period of 10 
years from the date of grant, the option will lapse. The exercise 
condition of the option plan stipulates that the Group’s absolute 
total shareholder return must grow at a rate of 3% per annum 
(not compounded) in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the 
vesting period.
 The market price of the shares at December 31, 2011 was 276p 
and the range during the year was 226p to 369p.
 The table below shows, for the directors who served during the 
year, the options outstanding at December 31, 2011 for which nil 
has been paid.

Joint Share Ownership Plan 
 Under the JSOP, the Remuneration Committee invites selected 
employees and directors to enter into an agreement with the 
Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust (the “Co-owner”) to 
acquire a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. 
The shares are held in the name of the Co-owner; however, the 
selected employees maintain a beneficial interest in these shares. 
The JSOP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on April 21, 2010.
 Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee 
completing three years’ service (the vesting period) and the 
Group’s absolute total shareholder return growing at an annual 
rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price 
Index over the three year vesting period. In addition, the 
Company’s share price must reach a hurdle price during the 
three year vesting period as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the time of making the award.
 Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, 
the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the employee to 
receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. 
Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales 
proceeds in excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary 
shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the 
Remuneration Committee and will not be set less than the market 
value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP 
award is made.
 The JSOP awards are limited in value such that the initial value of 
shares acquired jointly with the Co-owner under the award will not 
exceed 400% of the employee’s gross annual salary. In the first 
year of the JSOP (2010), the Board (on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee), awarded shares equivalent to 350% 
of basic salary to Mr A.C. Orchard, Mr M.J. Tack and Mr J. Theobald; 
and in 2011, a further award of 175% of basic salary was made to 
each of these individuals.
Executive directors’ service contracts
Although all of the executive directors’ service contracts are for an 
indefinite term, it is the Group’s policy that the service contracts 
do not have a notice period of more than one year. In the event of 
termination, the service contracts allow the Company to make a 
payment in lieu of notice. The service contracts of Mr J. Theobald and 
Mr A.C. Orchard also provide for an additional termination payment 
equivalent to six months’ basic salary, whereas the service contracts 
of Mr P.M. Boycott and Mr B.M. Wides simply limit payment for loss 
of office to twelve months’ basic salary. The service contracts provide 
that any such payments will be without prejudice to the director’s  
duty to mitigate his loss. No executive director has provisions in his 
service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company.  
The details of the service contracts of the executive directors in office 
at December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Non-executive directors’ terms of appointment
The Group’s non-executive directors have letters of appointment 
for an indefinite term, although they may be terminated by either 
party subject to 30 days’ notice. None of the letters have provisions 
that relate to a change of control of the Company. The fees of non-
executive directors are determined by the Board having regard to 
the commitment of time required and the level of fees in similar 
companies. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in 
the Company’s annual performance-related incentive award, share 
option schemes or pension scheme. The details of the non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment in office at December 31, 2011 are

Directors’ responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
management section of the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best 
of each person’s knowledge and belief:
•	the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group and Company; and
•	the Directors’ Report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website, 
www.anglopacificgroup.com. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board
P.M. Boycott 
Chairman
March 9, 2012
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected 
to prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the 
Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 (United Kingdom) 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors who were in office at the date of this statement confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware: 
•	 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s
auditors are unaware; and
•	the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.

We have audited the financial statements of Anglo Pacific Group PLC 
for the year ended December 31, 2011 which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated and company balance sheets, the consolidated 
and company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated and 
company cash flow statements and the related notes 1 to 32. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set 
out on 
 page 26, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided 
on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at December 31, 2011 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union;
•	 the parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
•	 the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement
pages 20 to 22 with respect to internal control and
set out on 
risk management systems in relation to financial reporting  
processes and about share capital structures is consistent with  
the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are
not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require
for our audit; or
•	 a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by
the Company.
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review:
•	 the directors’ statement, set out on
page 19, in relation to going
concern; and
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on
directors’ remuneration.

Report of the independent auditor to the directors of Anglo Pacific Group PLC  
in respect of compatibility with Canadian GAAS
29
In accordance with the requirement contained in National Instrument 
52-107 we report below on the compatibility of Canadian Generally 
Accepted Auditing Standards (“Canadian GAAS”) and International 
Standard on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs).
We conducted our audits of the Group’s financial statements for each 
of the two years ended December 31, 2011 in accordance with ISAs. 
If we had been required to conduct the audits of the Group’s financial 
statements for each of the two years ended December 31, 2011 in 
accordance with Canadian GAAS there would have been no material 
differences in the form or content of our audit reports.
Furthermore an auditors’ report prepared in accordance with reporting 
standards under Canadian GAAS on the aforementioned consolidated 
financial statements would not contain a qualification.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
1 General information
Anglo Pacific Group PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) secure natural resources royalties by acquisition and  
through investment in mining and exploration interests. The Group has royalties and investments in mining and exploration interests primarily  
in Australia, North and South America and Africa, with a diversified exposure to commodities that is strongly represented by coal, iron ore,  
gold and uranium.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange and incorporated  
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ, United Kingdom  
(registered number: 897608).
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Anglo Pacific Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 (United Kingdom) 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of coal royalties, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed  
in note 4.
2.1.1 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after January 1, 2011 that 
would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b) Significant new standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning January 1, 2011 and not  
early adopted
•	 IAS 1 (Amendments) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
IAS 1 (Amendments) requires an entity to group items presented in other comprehensive income into those that, in accordance with other 
IFRSs: (a) will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and (b) will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions 
are met. It is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012. The Group’s management expects this will change the current 
presentation of items in other comprehensive income; however, it will not affect the measurement or recognition of such items.
•	IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – effective January 1, 2013
•	IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ – effective January 1, 2013
•	IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ – effective January 1, 2013
•	IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ – effective January 1, 2013
•	IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ – effective January 1, 2013
•	IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (Revised June 2011) – effective January 1, 2013
•	Consequential amendments to IAS 27 (Revised), ‘Separate Financial Statements’ – effective January 1, 2013
•	Consequential amendments to IAS 28 (Revised), ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ – effective January 1, 2013
The Group’s management have yet to assess the impact of IFRS 13 and IAS 19. In respect of the other Standards, the directors anticipate that 
their adoption in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group. The Group does not intend to apply any  
of these pronouncements early.
2.2 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for in the parent company at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration 
arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
38
Accounts
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
(b) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 
20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially 
recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of the associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
(c) Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or 
more other partners under a contractual arrangement.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the proportionate consolidation 
method of accounting. The Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint ventures are incorporated with the similar 
items, line by line, in its financial statements.
Where a Group company transacts with a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in  
the relevant joint venture. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made  
for impairment.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those used by the Group.
(d) Transactions and loss of control or significant influence
When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change 
in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the 
retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
2.3 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the Group’s operating segments, has been 
identified as the Executive Committee which makes the strategic decisions for the Group.
2.4 Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the 
Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions (spot exchange rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the remeasurement of monetary items at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items measured at 
historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction (not retranslated). Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
(c)  all resulting exchange differences are charged/credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation reserve
in equity.

Accounts
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the currency 
translation reserve in equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are 
reclassified in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
2.5 Property, plant and equipment (excluding coal royalties)
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant 
and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Once a mining project has been established as commercially viable, 
expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised under ‘Producing assets’ together with any amount transferred 
from ‘Exploration and evaluation costs’ (note 2.7(a)).
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter. The major categories of 
property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units of production and/or straight line basis as follows:
Producing assets 
Coal tenures  
Fixtures and equipment 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Units of production 
Units of production 
4 to 10 years
2.6 Coal royalties
The Group owns a royalty entitlement to the output from the Kestrel and Crinum underground mines in Queensland, Australia, excluding 
the output from Crown areas. As the Group owns the physical right to the minerals this entitlement is treated in the consolidated financial 
statements as a tangible fixed asset under IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ and the Group has adopted the revaluation method 
accordingly. The coal royalties are valued at fair value based on future discounted cash flows calculated on a quarterly basis by an independent 
external consultant. Management consider the valuation on a quarterly basis for any indications of possible impairment considering factors such 
as pricing and production forecasts.
Any movement in the valuation of the royalties is recognised in the coal royalty revaluation reserve, excluding the effects of foreign currency 
changes, which are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and net of deferred taxation in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’.
2.7 Intangibles
(a) Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises costs that are directly attributable to:
•	researching and analysing exploration data;
•	conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling;
•	examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or
•	compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies.
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed 
assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential.
Expenditure on exploration and evaluation activities is capitalised when there is a high degree of confidence in the project’s viability and hence 
it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
The carrying values of capitalised amounts are reviewed twice per annum by management and the results of these reviews are reported to the 
Audit Committee. In the case of undeveloped projects there may be only inferred resources to form a basis for the impairment review. The review 
is based on a status report regarding the Group’s intentions for development of the undeveloped project.
Subsequent recovery of the resulting carrying value depends on successful development or sale of the undeveloped project. If a project does not 
prove viable, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project net of any related impairment provisions are written off. For developments that 
are considered viable and move to commercial production, these are transferred to producing assets.
(b) Royalty interests
Royalty interests represent the net smelter royalties acquired on the Four Mile project in South Australia, the Salamanca uranium project in 
Spain, the Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy chromite projects in Northern Ontario, Canada and a number of tenements in the Athabasca 
Basin region of Canada, together with the gross revenue royalties covering the Amapá iron ore system in Brazil, the Isua iron ore project in 
Greenland and three exploration licences, including the Railway iron ore deposit, in the central Pilbara region of Western Australia.
The Group does not own the physical rights to the minerals contained within these deposits. The royalties receivable from the interests held are 
derived from the rights attached to the underlying mineral resources. In line with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ these royalties are recognised at cost. 
The useful life of the royalty interests will be determined by reference to planned mine life on commencement of mining and the cost of the 
royalty contract will be amortised on a systematic basis over the life of the mine. Amortisation rates are adjusted on a prospective basis for all 
changes to estimates of the life of mine. Amortisation will stop when the royalty is classified as held for sale or derecognised.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
2.8 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least at each reporting date and the assessment includes variables such as the production 
profiles, commodity prices and management representations. Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of fair value less costs to sell or value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each 
asset and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The data used for impairment testing 
procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest forecasts. Discount factors are determined individually for each asset and reflect their 
respective risk profiles as assessed by management. Impairment losses for business combinations reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to that business combination first. Any remaining impairment loss is charged to the investment in the subsidiary or associate. With the 
exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. 
An impairment charge is reversed if the asset’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.
2.9 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. On initial 
recognition loans and receivables are stated at their fair value. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s trade and most 
other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that 
a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, 
which are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other available features of shared credit risk characteristics. 
The percentage of the write down is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group. Impairment of trade 
receivables are presented within ‘other losses’.
Mining and exploration interests
Mining and exploration interests are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair 
value, including transaction costs.
Mining and exploration interests are classified upon initial recognition as either available-for-sale or as assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
depending on the characteristics of the particular instrument and its purpose.
Interests classified as available-for-sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at their fair value. For available-for-sale investments, 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity within the investment revaluation reserve, until the security 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit 
or loss for the period. Unquoted investments are measured at cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. When a market price can be 
established these investments are revalued to fair value accordingly. 
For those mining and exploration interests which contain a convertible embedded derivative, these derivatives are separated and recognised 
at fair value through profit or loss with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised directly in the income statement. 
The fair values of such instruments are assessed with reference to the relevant factors, which include, inter alia, equity prices in active markets, 
commodity prices, production profiles and management representations. These assets are reviewed regularly to ensure that the initial 
classification remains correct given the asset characteristics and the Group’s investment policies. These assets may be initially recognised using 
transaction price as the best evidence of fair value at acquisition (see note 19). Options can be carried at cost if they are linked to unquoted 
equity where fair value cannot be reliably measured.
All mining and exploration interests held as available for sale are assessed for impairment at least at each reporting date and the assessment 
includes variables such as the instrument’s valuation in active markets, the company’s underlying assets as well as any potential for economic 
mineral development within the relevant company’s licences.
Royalty instruments
Royalty instruments are recognised or derecognised on completion date where a purchase or sale of the royalty is under a contract, and are 
initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Royalty instruments are classified upon initial recognition as available-for-sale or as assets at fair value through profit or loss, depending on  
the characteristics of the particular instrument and its purpose. Some royalty contracts include clauses relating to the possibility of conversion 
to equity in the company granting the royalty. These clauses are treated as embedded derivatives and are classified as fair value through profit  
or loss.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
Royalty instruments classified as available-for-sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at their fair value. For royalties classified in this 
manner gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity within the investment revaluation reserve, until the 
royalty is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is reclassified in 
the profit or loss for the period.
For royalty instruments which contain an embedded derivative, these derivatives are separated and measured as assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement. The fair values of such 
instruments are assessed with reference to the relevant factors, which include, inter alia, equity prices in active markets, production profiles, 
commodity prices and management representations. These assets are reviewed regularly to ensure that the initial classification remains correct 
given the asset characteristics and the Group’s investment policies. These assets may be initially recognised using transaction price as the best 
evidence of fair value at acquisition; however, embedded derivatives are valued at acquisition and are recognised separately from the host 
royalty instrument (see note 17).
All royalty instruments, except those held at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for impairment at least at each reporting date 
and the assessment includes variables such as the instrument’s valuation in active markets, production profiles, commodity prices and 
management representations.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition. After initial recognition these are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
2.10 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary differences arise from initial recognition of goodwill on business combinations.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2.11 Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options and jointly-owned shares) of the Company. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the options granted:
•	including any market performance conditions;
•	excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and
•	including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options and jointly-owned shares that are expected to vest. 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. 
At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options and jointly-owned shares that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
When options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited 
to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.

Accounts
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
The grant by the company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting 
period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
2.12 Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
•	“Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares.
•	 “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the
share issue.
•	 “Coal royalty revaluation reserve” represents revaluation of the coal royalty from the opening carrying value, excluding the effects of deferred
tax and foreign currency changes.
•	 “Investment revaluation reserve” represents gains and losses due to the revaluation of the investments in mining and exploration interests and
other royalties from the opening carrying values, including the effects of deferred tax and foreign currency changes.
•	“Share based payment reserve” represents equity-settled share based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
•	“Foreign currency reserve” represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
•	 “Special reserve” represents the level of profit attributable to the Group for the period ended June 30, 2002 which was created as part of
a capital reduction performed in 2002.
•	 “Investment in own shares” represents the shares held by the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust for awards made under the Joint
Share Ownership Plan (note 26).
•	“Retained earnings” represents retained profits.
2.13 Revenue recognition
The revenue of the Group comprises royalty income and amounts receivable from external customers for services excluding value added tax and 
other sales related taxes. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. The royalty income becomes receivable on 
extraction and sale of the relevant minerals, at which point the revenue is recognised.
Disposals of mining and exploration interests are disclosed net of any commissions and foreign exchange.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
2.14 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are not transferred to the lessee are charged 
against profits on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
2.15 Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
3 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal treasury objective is to provide sufficient liquidity to meet operational cash flow and dividend requirements and to allow 
the Group to take advantage of new growth opportunities whilst maximising shareholder value. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of 
financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk. The Group operates controlled treasury 
policies which are monitored by the management to ensure that the needs of the Group are met while minimising potential adverse effects of 
unpredictability of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance. 
Liquidity and funding risk
The objective of the Company in managing funding risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. At the 
year end there was no debt outstanding and the Company, with its strong balance sheet, had good access to capital markets, if required.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, royalty instruments held as financial assets, trade and other receivables and 
investments. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables, including royalty receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present the 
amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and 
the current economic environment. Where possible the Group has registered its interests against the relevant mining titles for the royalties it has 
acquired. In addition, the Group is generally entitled to full reconciliations of amounts paid and retains the right to audit the royalty returns and 
verify the calculations.
The Group’s credit risk on royalty instruments held as financial instruments, has been reviewed and the estimated current exposure is as 
disclosed in note 17 where the future contractual right to cash flow from these instruments is reflected in their fair value.
The credit risk on bank deposits is limited because the counterparties have high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of currencies and counterparties.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
In 2007, the Group created a derivative financial instrument to provide finance to an unlisted mining development company, which has 
subsequently listed (note 19). This instrument is convertible into equity in the company or royalties over the company’s properties at the 
Group’s option for a period of up to five years. In the event of default the instrument becomes repayable and the Group would rank equally 
with the company’s other unsecured creditors. The Group undertakes detailed analysis of factors which mitigate the risk of default to the 
Group on a regular basis.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s transactional foreign exchange exposure arises from income, expenditure and purchase and sale of assets denominated in foreign 
currencies. As each material commitment is made, the risk in relation to currency fluctuations is assessed by the Board and regularly reviewed. 
The Group does not consider it necessary to have a hedging programme in place at this time.
Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities, translated into Sterling at the closing rate, are as follows:

Short term exposure
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and equity in regards to the Group’s financial assets and financial 
liabilities and the Australian Dollar / Sterling and the Canadian Dollar / Sterling exchange rate.
It assumes a +/- 10% change of the Sterling / Australian Dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: 10%). A +/- 10% 
is considered for the Sterling / Canadian Dollar exchange rate (2010: 10%). The sensitivity analysis is based on the Group’s foreign currency 
financial instruments held at balance sheet date.
If Sterling had weakened against the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar by 10% this would have had the following impact:

Net result for the year
Equity
Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis above is 
considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties. If the interest 
rates the Group received had increased by one percent during the year, the net result for the year would have been increased by £268,000  
(2010: £1,215,000). If the interest rates the Group received had decreased by one percent during the year, the net result for the year would have 
been reduced by £268,000 (2010: £486,000). There would have been no impact on equity.

Other price risk
The Group is exposed to other price risk in respect of its mining and exploration interests which include listed and unlisted equity securities and 
any convertible instruments.
A sensitivity analysis based on a 26% increase or decrease in listed equity prices has been performed (2010: 15%). If the quoted stock price for 
these securities had increased or decreased by this percentage the net result for the year would have been increased / reduced by £13.4 million 
(2010: £12.9 million). Equity would have changed by £16.2 million (2010: £18.3 million).
The royalty portfolio exposes the Group to other price risk through fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the prices of iron ore, gold and 
uranium. As the directors obtain independent commodity price forecasts, the generation of which takes into account fluctuations in prices, no 
detailed analysis of the impact of fluctuations on the valuations of the royalties has been undertaken.
The Group is exposed to other price risk through its convertible instruments (note 19(b)) that can be converted into equity or royalties. The 
underlying value of the equity may change resulting in an increase or decrease in the value of the instrument. As the equity is currently unlisted 
it is not possible to quantify this risk at this stage.
The Group’s mining and exploration interests are held for the purposes of generating additional royalties and are considered long-term, strategic 
investments. This strategy is unaffected by recent fluctuations in prices for mining and exploration equities; however, interests are continually 
monitored for indicators that may suggest problems for these companies raising capital or continuing their day-to-day business activities to 
ensure remedial action can be taken if necessary.
No specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these interests and the voting rights arising from these equity instruments are utilised 
in the Group’s favour.

Capital management and procedures 
The Group’s capital management objectives are: 
•	to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern;
•	to increase the value of the assets of the Group; and
•	to enhance shareholder value in the Company and returns to shareholders.
The achievement of these objectives is undertaken by developing existing assets and identifying new royalty acquisitions. The Company will also 
undertake other transactions where these are deemed financially beneficial to the Company. 
The directors continue to monitor the capital requirements of the Group by reference to expected future cash flows. Capital for the reporting 
periods under review is summarised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Company does not presently need or have any long 
term funding.

approximately their fair value.
Fair value hierarchy
The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. 
This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in measuring the fair value of the 
financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
•	Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
•	 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie. as prices)
A
c

o
u
n
t
s
or indirectly (ie. derived from prices); and
•	 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair 
value measurement.
The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010:

There have been no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 in the reporting period.
The methods and valuation techniques used for the purposes of measuring fair value are unchanged compared to the previous reporting period.
(a) Royalty instruments
The Group’s royalty streams arising from its four royalty instruments have been classified as available for sale, with value on initial recognition 
being calculated as the total cost of the agreement less the valuation of the option to convert to shares. At reporting date the royalty streams 
have been valued on the net present value of the pre-tax cash flows discounted at a rate management considers reflects the risk associated with 
each of the projects. Note 17 details the discount rates used.
The option to convert to shares has been treated as fair value through profit or loss as designated on initial recognition at the date of acquisition 
and has been valued at December 31, 2011 utilising an option model. The key assumptions, in addition to those utilised in the royalty stream 
valuations such as mine life and expected cash flows, include the price, volatility of the project’s listed equity and where applicable the 
conversion price and redemption value of redeemable shares.
(b) Mining and exploration interests – quoted
All the quoted mining and exploration interests have been issued by publicly traded companies in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and 
Norway. Fair values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
(c) Mining and exploration interests – unquoted
All the unquoted mining and exploration interests are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined.
(d) Mining and exploration interests – royalty options

All the royalty options are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. The Group considers the progress of the 
projects related to each of the royalty options to ensure there has been no material change in the fair value since initial recognition.

(a) Gains and losses on the optionality to convert debentures are presented in ‘other losses’.
There have been no transfers into or out of Level 3 in either year.
The Group measures its entitlement to the royalty streams and any optionality embedded within the royalty instruments using discounted cash 
flow models. In determining the discount rate to be applied, management consider the country and sovereign risk associated with the projects, 
together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects of a similar nature.
Management have not undertaken detailed analysis of the impact of using alternative discount rates on the fair value of the royalty streams or 
the optionality embedded in the royalty instruments, as the rates used reflect the risks inherent in the four projects and the use of alternative 
rates would be unjustified.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below:
(a) Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals – note 2.6, note 2.7, note 2.8, note 16, note 17, note 18 and note 19.
(b) Recoverability of deferred tax assets – note 2.10 and note 23.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2011
48
Accounts
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended December 31, 2011
4.2 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are:
(a) Classification of mining and exploration interests – note 2.9 and note 19.
(b) Classification of royalty instruments and royalty interests.
 The directors review each royalty acquired to determine whether there is a contractual right to receive cash which would meet the definition 
of a financial asset, or if the royalty receivable for the interest acquired is derived from the rights attached to the underlying asset/mineral 
resource. In the latter case these are treated as an intangible asset – note 2.7(b) and note 18.
 Where a royalty agreement contains a convertible option within it, the contracts are reviewed to determine whether the assets should be 
classified as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss or can be classified as an available for sale financial asset with an embedded 
derivative – note 2.9 and note 17.
(c) Classification of the Group’s investment in Royalco Resources Limited as available for sale mining and exploration interest – note 19a.
(d) Review of assumptions underlying the independent coal industry advisors’ valuation of the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalty – note 16.
(e) Review of assumptions underlying the valuation of royalty instruments and their associated embedded derivatives – note 17.
 The directors review the latest available mine plans and obtain independent foreign exchange and commodity price forecasts to determine 
each of the royalty instruments carrying value at reporting date.
(f) Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals – note 2.6, note 2.7, note 2.8, note 16, note 17, note 18 and note 19.
 The directors expect that Empire Mining Corp will satisfactorily resolve the licensing of the Bulqiza chromite project in Albania, and therefore, 
have not impaired the 3% gross revenue royalty the Group holds over this project.
(g) Recognition of deferred tax liabilities and the continued application of relevant exemptions – note 2.10, note 11 and note 23.
(h) Treatment of unrealised losses on mining and exploration interests – note 19.
 The directors review the fair value of all quoted mining and exploration interests in light of market conditions and assess unrealised losses 
as either permanent or temporary in nature. As at December 31, 2011 the Group’s unrealised losses resulted in a negative investment 
revaluation reserve of £4.8 million. The directors consider these losses to be temporary in nature and therefore, the movement in fair value 
has been recognised directly in equity through the investment revaluation reserve.
5 Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee that are used to make 
strategic decisions.
The Committee considers the Group’s undertakings from a business perspective. This has resulted in the Group being organised into two 
operating segments – royalties and mining and exploration interests.
The royalties segment encompasses all Group activities relating directly to the royalties received from mining operations. The mining and 
exploration interests segment encompasses all Group activities relating directly to the acquisition, disposal and continued monitoring of the 
Group’s investments in listed and unlisted entities operating in mining and mineral exploration. The segment information provided to the 
Executive Committee for the reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows:

The amounts provided to the Executive Committee with respect to total assets are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial 
statements. These assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
Investments in mining and exploration interests (classified as available-for-sale financial assets or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) 
held by the Group are classified by geographic segment by reference to the country of the investee’s primary listing for quoted investments or the 
country of operations for unquoted investments.
The amounts provided to the Executive Committee with respect to total liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial 
statements. These liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
The royalty income in Australia of £32,409,000 (2010: £29,930,000) is derived from a single coal royalty.

12 Earnings per share
Earnings per ordinary share is calculated on the Group’s profit after tax of £36,669,000 (2010: £56,283,000) and the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year of 108,263,282 (2010: 108,257,718).
The diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on a profit after tax of £36,669,000 (2010: £56,283,000) and 108,274,402 shares  
(2010: 108,266,665). The numbers used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share are restated below:

The Group’s management considers royalty cash flow per share to be a useful measure of the performance of the Group’s assets. Changes in equity 
market conditions lead to annual fluctuations in gains on sale of mining and exploration interests, and while these gains can be significantly value 
accretive for shareholders, the Group’s management focus remains on increasing the Group’s cash flows from royalties. In addition, the classification 
of the Group’s royalty instruments as repayable debentures results in cash flows which are classified as repayments until the principal and interest 
are repaid. As a result, the combination of royalty income and cash received from the debenture repayments during the year form the numerator for 
this metric. Both of these components are calculated before tax.

14 Dividends
On January 12, 2011 an interim dividend of 3.95 pence per share was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2010. 
On July 6, 2011 a final dividend of 5.10 pence per share was paid to shareholders to make a total dividend for the year of 9.05 pence per share. 
Total dividends, excluding scrip, paid during the year were £8.98 million (2010: £6.68 million).
On January 11, 2012 an interim dividend of 4.25 pence per share was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2011. 
This dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The directors propose that a final dividend of 5.50 pence per 
share be paid to shareholders on July 4, 2012, to make a total dividend for the year of 9.75 pence per share. This dividend is subject to approval 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The proposed final dividend for 2011 is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on May 4, 2012. The total estimated dividend 
to be paid is £6.0 million. This will be reduced to the extent that shareholders elect to receive scrip instead of cash under any scrip dividend 
alternative. The Board will consider whether shareholders will again be given the opportunity to elect to receive a scrip dividend instead of cash 
depending on the share price at the time.

The Group’s property plant and equipment are carried at cost less depreciation with the exception of leases relating to the talc deposit 
on Shetland, Scotland held by the parent company. The producing asset on Shetland is included at a directors’ valuation of £0.8 million 
(2010: £0.8 million) plus additions which are carried at cost. An external valuation was carried out on March 26, 2001. At the date of 
transition to IFRS, the Group elected to use this valuation as deemed cost at that date.

The Group’s coal royalty entitlements comprise the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalties.
The coal royalty was valued during December 2011 at £175.1 million (A$265.9 million) by Resource Management International Pty Ltd, 
independent coal industry advisors, on a net present value of the pre-tax cash flow discounted at a rate of 7%. The net royalty income from this 
investment is currently taxed in Australia at a rate of 30%. This valuation is incorporated in the accounts and the above revaluation adjustment 
represents the difference between the opening carrying value and the external valuation, excluding the effects of foreign currency changes. 
Were the coal royalty to be realised at the revalued amount there are £2.4 million (A$3.7 million) of capital losses potentially available to offset

against taxable gains. These losses have been included in the deferred tax calculation (note 23). Were the coal royalty to be carried at cost the 
carrying value would be £0.2 million (2010: £0.2 million). The directors do not presently have any intention to dispose of the coal royalty.
17 Royalty instruments
The Group’s royalty instruments are represented by four convertible debentures which entitle the Group to the repayment of principal and a 
net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty for the life of the mine. Until such time as the principal is repaid the Group retains the option to convert the 
outstanding balance into the common shares of the grantor. Details of the Group’s royalty instruments are summarised below:

The total royalty instrument provision of £5.76 million (2010: £4.19 million) relates to the Group’s convertible debentures with Northern Star 
Mining Corp. and Mundo Minerals Limited which give rise to the royalties over the Malartic-Midway and McKenzie Break and the Engenho 
projects respectively (note 10).
On January 25, 2011 Northern Star Mining Corp. announced that it had been deemed to have filed assignments in bankruptcy. The Group has 
registered its royalty interests against the Malartic-Midway and McKenzie Break tenures and continues to pursue its rights with the receiver to 
ensure that the royalty remains attached to the property in the event of any disposal. Given the inherent uncertainty over the Group’s ability 
to retain the royalty through the bankruptcy, a provision against the royalty instrument has been made.
On October 18, 2011 Mundo Minerals Limited (“Mundo”) announced the decision to place the Engenho project on care and maintenance 
by December 2011. Mundo further announced on December 16, 2011 that its Brazilian subsidiary which holds the mining licences relating to 
the Engenho project was seeking protection from its creditors under a Brazilian Chapter 11 equivalent. The Group will pursue its rights under 
the terms of the convertible debenture. Given the inherent uncertainty over the Group’s ability to retain the royalty through the bankruptcy, 
a provision against the royalty instrument has been made.

(b) Fair value through profit and loss
The Group’s option to convert the outstanding balance of the debentures into common shares of the grantors is an embedded derivative 
requiring a separate valuation to the NSR royalty. As at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 the directors considered the likelihood of the 
options being exercised to be remote and therefore, assessed the fair value of the options to be nil. The options are classified as fair value through 
profit and loss, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value directly recognised in the income statement as detailed below:

The Group’s intangibles comprise capitalised exploration and evaluation costs and royalty interests. 
The exploration and evaluation costs comprise expenditure that is directly attributable to the Trefi and Panorama coal projects in British 
Columbia, Canada.
Royalty interests represent the net smelter royalties acquired on the Four Mile project in South Australia, the Salamanca uranium project in 
Spain, the Black Thor, Black Label and Big Daddy chromite projects in Northern Ontario, Canada and a number of exploration licences in the 
Athabasca Basin region of Canada, together with the gross revenue royalties on the Amapá iron ore system in Brazil and the Isua iron ore project 
in Greenland and three exploration licences, including the Railway iron ore deposit, in the central Pilbara region of Western Australia.
The net smelter royalties on the exploration licences in the Athabasca Basin region of Canada have been impaired as a result of the inherent 
uncertainty of these licences entering commercial production. The impairment charge has reduced the carrying value to nil (note 10). The Group 
will continue to review the development of these licences on an annual basis.
The Amapá royalty interest is the only producing interest and therefore, subject to amortisation. Amortisation of the remaining interests will 
commence once they begin commercial production. No intangible assets have been pledged as security for liabilities.

The Group’s investments are acquired as part of the Group’s strategy to acquire new royalties and are not held for the purpose of trading. 
Gains may be realised where it is deemed appropriate. The fair values of listed securities are based on quoted market prices. Unquoted 
investments and royalty options are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. In the absence of an active 
market for these securities, the Group considers each unquoted security to ensure there has been no material change in the fair value since 
initial recognition. Further guidance on fair value measurement is provided in note 3.

The Group’s investment in Northern Star Mining Corp has been fully provided for as a result of Northern Star Mining Corp’s shares being 
suspended from trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange on January 25, 2011 following the announcement of its filing for bankruptcy. The Group 
ranks equally with all other shareholders and continues to pursue the recovery of its share of funds to be returned to shareholders by the trustee 
in bankruptcy.
As at September 30, 2010, the Group concluded it had lost significant influence over Royalco Resources Limited (“Royalco”) despite maintaining 
a 32.03% equity interest and having a common director. This conclusion was reached following the Group’s inability to influence significant 
financial and operational policy decisions made by Royalco, together with losing its ability to obtain timely financial information.
On losing significant influence over Royalco, the Group’s 32.03% equity interest was remeasured to its fair value of £4,151,000 being the closing 
market price of Royalco’s shares quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange as at September 30, 2010. The remeasurement to fair value resulted 
in a gain of £498,000 being recognised in the income statement. In addition a gain of £40,000 previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income was reclassified to the income statement.
Despite maintaining a 33.78% (2010: 32.03%) equity interest in Royalco Resources Limited (“Royalco”) and having a common director, the 
Group continues to be unable to influence significant financial and operation policy decision made by Royalco. As a result the Group continues 
to conclude that it does not have significant influence over Royalco and consistent with 2010 continues to include its investment in Royalco in 
available-for-sale mining and exploration interests.

A non-repayable convertible instrument was acquired by the Group in 2007. The convertible instrument was designated as fair value through 
profit or loss. This convertible instrument was created to provide finance to a listed mining development company and is convertible into equity 
in the company or royalties over the company’s properties at the Group’s option for a period of up to five years. The instrument was initially 
recognised using cost as fair value could not be reliably determined. The Group considers that there had been no material change in the fair value 
of the instrument at the reporting date, and this will be re-examined on a regular basis considering factors such as the presence of an active 
market for the equity and valuations of the potential royalty streams. The Group has no present intention of exercising the conversion of the 
instrument in the next 12 months.

26 Share based payments
Following the approval at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, the Group operates two equity-settled share based compensation plans as follows:
•	The HMRC approved Company Share Ownership Plan (the “CSOP”); and
•	The Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”) operated through the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust.
(a) Company Share Ownership Plan 
Under the CSOP, share options are granted to directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is equal to 
the average mid market closing price of an ordinary share for the three days before the grant. The options are conditional on the employee 
completing three years’ service (the vesting period). The options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date, subject to the Group 
achieving its target growth in absolute total shareholder return over the period of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the UK Retail 
Price Index; the options have a contractual option term of ten years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle 
the options in cash.
Prior to the approval of the CSOP, the Group operated an Inland Revenue approved option plan that provided for options to be granted at a price 
equal to the quoted market price of the Group’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period for options granted under this plan was three 
years and subject to the exercise condition of the Group’s earnings per share growing at a rate of 2% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over 
the vesting period. All options granted under this plan were either exercised or surrendered during the period to December 31, 2010.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:
Outstanding at 1 January 
Granted during the year
Exercised during the year
Surrendered during the year
Forfeited during the year

Out of the 67,463 outstanding options (2010: 60,120), nil options (2010: nil) were exercisable. Options exercised in 2010 resulted in 36,923 
shares being issued at a weighted average price of £0.8125 each. The related weighted average share price at the time of exercise was £2.515 
per share. There were no related transaction costs.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model was £1.741 per option 
granted in March 2011 and £1.482 per option granted in September 2011 (2010: £1.326). The significant inputs into the model were weighted 
average share price of £3.257 and £2.953 (2010: £2.495) at the grant date in March and September 2011 respectively, exercise price shown 
above, volatility of 40% (2010: 40%), expected option life of three years (2010: three years) and an annual risk-free interest rate of 2.3% and 
1.1% for the options granted in March and September 2011 respectively (2010: 2.3%). See note 8a for the total expense recognised in the income 
statement for share options granted to directors and employees.
In accordance with the rules of the CSOP, Mr M.J. Tack forfeited all outstanding options at the time of his resignation on September 23, 2011.
(b) Joint Share Ownership Plan 
Under the JSOP, the Remuneration Committee invites selected directors and employees to enter into an agreement with the Anglo Pacific Group 
Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Co-owner’) to acquire a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The shares are held in the name of 
the Co-owner, however, the selected directors and employees maintain a beneficial interest in these shares.
Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period) and the Group’s absolute total 
shareholder return growing at an annual rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three year vesting period. 
In addition the Company’s share price must reach a hurdle price during the three year vesting period as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the time of making the award.
Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the director or employee to 
receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales proceeds in 
excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the Remuneration Committee 
and will not be set less than the market value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP award is made.
JSOP awards made during the year were as follows:
Outstanding at 1 January
Awarded in May 2010

Notice of Annual General Meeting
Explanatory notes to the proposed resolutions:
Resolution 1 – Annual report and accounts
The directors are required to present to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting the Company’s audited accounts and the directors’ and 
auditors’ reports for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Resolution 2 – Directors’ Remuneration Report
UK listed companies are required to put before their shareholders in general meeting a resolution inviting shareholders to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. The Directors’ Remuneration Report, which can be found on pages 23 to 25 of the Annual Report 2011, details the 
directors’ remuneration for the period ended December 31, 2011 and sets out the Company’s overall policy on directors’ remuneration. This 
resolution is advisory and does not affect the actual remuneration paid to any individual director. It serves to provide shareholder feedback to the 
Remuneration Committee.
As required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Company’s independent auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, have audited 
those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report capable of being audited and their report can be found on page 28 of the Annual Report 2011.
Resolution 3 – Approval of final dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after it has been approved by the shareholders. A final dividend of 5.50p per ordinary share for the year ended 
December 31, 2011 is recommended by the directors for payment to shareholders who are on the register of members at the close of business on 
May 4, 2012.
Resolutions 4-10 – Re-election of directors
The Company’s articles of association require the directors to submit themselves for election at the first opportunity after their appointment and 
from then on for re-election every three years. However, the new UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council 
recommends that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual re-election. Biographical details of each director appear on 
pages 15 and 16 of the Annual Report 2011 and details of their service contracts with the Company appear on page 24.
The board is of the opinion that the performance of each of the directors continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to his role. 
The board unanimously recommends the re-election of all of the directors.
Resolutions 11 and 12 – Reappointment and remuneration of auditors
The auditors of a company must be reappointed at each general meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 11, on the audit 
committee’s recommendation, proposes the reappointment of the Company’s existing auditors, Grant Thornton LLP, until the next general 
meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 12 is a separate resolution which gives authority to the directors to determine the auditors’ 
remuneration.
Resolution 13 – Authority to offer scrip dividend
This resolution seeks to renew the authority granted at last year’s Annual General Meeting for the directors to offer shareholders the option to 
take dividends in ordinary shares instead of cash.
Resolution 14 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution seeks a new authority, to replace the existing authority, for the directors to allot shares in the Company up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £727,928, representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at March 9, 2012. The 
authority contained in this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the 2013 Annual General Meeting or at the close of business on the date 
which is 15 months following the passing of this resolution (whichever is earlier). The directors consider that this authority is desirable to allow 
the Company to retain flexibility, although they have no present intention of exercising it.
Resolution 15 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights (special resolution)
This resolution seeks authority for the directors, pursuant to the authority to allot granted by resolution 14, to allot equity securities (as defined 
in the Act) or sell treasury shares for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. Other than 
in connection with a rights or other similar issue, the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£218,378, representing 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at March 9, 2012. No shares are currently held in treasury by the 
Company.
This resolution replaces the present authority granted at last year’s Annual General Meeting, which is set to expire at the end of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Similarly, the authority granted by this resolution will expire on the date which is 15 months after the date on which the 
resolution is passed or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting next held following the passing of the resolution. The directors 
confirm that they have no present intention of exercising this authority. However, the authority sought under this resolution provides the 
Company with the ability to continue to make acquisitions of royalties on low-cost, long-life mining assets. 
Resolution 16 – Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)
The directors are of the opinion that it would be advantageous for the Company to be in a position to purchase its own shares should market 
conditions and price justify such action. The directors have no present intention of exercising this power and intend to exercise it only if they

believe that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share. They will also have regard to whether, at the time, this represents 
the best use of the Company’s resources and is to the benefit of the shareholders generally. Other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing 
levels and the overall position of the Company will be taken into account in reaching such a decision.
Subsequently, this resolution seeks authority from shareholders to empower the directors to make limited on-market purchases. The resolution 
limits this authority to a maximum number of ordinary shares that may be acquired of 10,918,921 being 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital at March 9, 2012. The authority conferred by this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the 2013 Annual General Meeting or 
18 months from the date of the passing of the resolution (whichever is earlier).
Any shares purchased under this authority will either be cancelled or held as treasury shares. As at March 9, 2012 there were options outstanding 
over 67,463 ordinary shares, which represent 0.06% of the Company’s issued share capital at that date and would represent 0.07% of the 
Company’s issued share capital if the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares were to be exercised in full.
Directors’ recommendation
The directors believe that all of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole and the directors unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of all of the resolutions.

A member entitled to attend, speak and vote at the above meeting may appoint one or more persons as his proxy to attend, speak and 
vote instead of him at the meeting, provided that, if more than one proxy is appointed each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attaching 
to different shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A form of proxy is enclosed with this Notice. 
Completion and return of the form of proxy will not prevent a member from attending the meeting and voting in person if he so wishes.
 In order to be valid, forms of proxy for the meeting and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is executed or a 
notarially certified copy of such power or authority must be received, not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, at the 
office of the Company’s Registrars: Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex, BN99 6DA.
 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for this 
meeting by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and 
those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual (available at www.euroclear.com/CREST). The message must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (ID RA19) not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications 
Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this 
time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the proxy through other means. CREST 
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input 
of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, 
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001. 
 A person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated 
Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the member by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be appointed 
(or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not

Notes
1.
An explanation of the resolutions is given in the notice of meeting.
2.   As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, 
speak and vote at a general meeting of the Company. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out 
in these notes.
3.   To appoint as a proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting insert their full name in the space provided.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company, but must attend the meeting to represent you. You can also appoint 
more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by you. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. The following 
options are available:
(a)   To appoint the Chairman as your sole proxy in respect of all your shares, simply fill in any voting instructions in
the appropriate box and sign and date the Form of Proxy;
(b)   To appoint a person other than the Chairman as your sole proxy in respect of all your shares, delete the words
‘the Chairman of the meeting (or)’ and insert the name of your proxy in the spaces provided. Then fill in any 
voting instructions in the appropriate box and sign and date the Form of Proxy; or
(c)   To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy this form. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and
next to it the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, 
should not exceed the number of shares held by you, otherwise the appointments will be invalid). Please also 
indicate by ticking the box overleaf if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. If you wish 
to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, simply write ‘the Chairman of the Meeting’. All forms 
must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.
4.   Unless otherwise indicated the proxy will vote as he thinks fit or, at his discretion, abstain from voting. Where you
appoint someone other than the Chairman as your proxy, you are responsible for ensuring that they attend the 
meeting and are aware of your voting intentions.
5.   The Form of Proxy above must arrive not later than 48 hours before the time set for the meeting at Equiniti, Aspect 
House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex, BN99 6DA during usual business hours accompanied by any power of 
attorney or any other authority under which it is executed (if applicable).
6.   A corporation must execute the Form of Proxy under either its common seal or the hand of a duly authorised officer
or attorney.
7.
The ‘Vote Withheld’ option is to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. Such a vote is not a vote in law 
and will not be counted in the votes ‘For’ and ‘Against’ a resolution.
8.   Shares held in uncertified form (i.e. in CREST) may be voted through the CREST electronic proxy appointment
service in accordance with the procedures set out in the CREST manual. Please see the notice of meeting for more 
information on how to appoint/instruct proxies via CREST.
9.   In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the 
names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-
named being the most senior).
10.  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the
receipt of proxies will take precedence.
