<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the fourth periodic report on the human rights 
situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory submitted by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. It covers the period from 1 December 
2010 to 15 November 2011.  
</p>
<p>2. The information in the present report is based primarily on human rights 
monitoring carried out by the field presence of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
(OHCHR-OPT). Monitoring activities are implemented within the framework of 
General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 1994 and in consideration of Human 
Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 of 2009, in which the High 
Commissioner was requested to monitor, document and report on human rights 
violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza and East 
Jerusalem, and report periodically to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, the High Commissioner highlights issues of concern 
with regard to each of the three main duty-bearers in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, namely the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de 
facto authorities in Gaza. The issues addressed in the report are far from 
exhaustive of all human rights concerns in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
While issues of concern highlighted in previous reports of the High 
Commissioner remain valid, the present report focuses on a number of areas 
requiring priority attention by duty-bearers and which OHCHR-OPT intends to 
focus its work on in the coming months.  
</p>
<p>4. The report is organized in four main sections. Following this introductory 
section, section II makes a brief reference to the High Commissioner&#8223;s first 
periodic report on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (A/HRC/12/37), which provided an analysis of the applicable legal 
framework in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that remains valid. Section III 
addresses a number of human rights concerns and is organized into three 
subsections according to duty-bearer. That section also suggests steps that could 
be taken by the duty-bearers in fulfilling their obligations under international 
law. Section IV presents some conclusions and provides a number of 
recommendations for each duty-bearer.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>5. International human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The High Commissioner&#8223;s first 
periodic report on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian 
territory contains a detailed analysis of the legal framework applicable and the 
basis for the obligations of the different duty-bearers in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, namely the State of Israel as the Occupying Power, the Palestinian 
Authority and the de facto authorities in Gaza (A/HRC/12/37, paras. 5-9). This 
analysis remains valid.  </p>


<p><b> III. Human rights violations by all duty-bearers  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The de facto authorities in Gaza and Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Violations in the context of hostilities  
</b></p>
<p>6. Palestinian armed groups continued firing rockets and mortar shells at 
Israel. A total of 499 rockets, including homemade rockets, Grad rockets, and 
rocket propelled grenades, and 328 mortar shells, were fired during the reporting 
period.1<b> </b>While it was confirmed that some of these projectiles were directed at 
military objectives, the indiscriminate nature of the vast majority of these 
projectiles makes it impossible to determine the intended targets of the remaining 
ones. A significant number of these rockets and mortar shells landed in civilian 
areas within Israeli territory.  
</p>
<p>7. During the reporting period three Israeli civilians were killed by rockets 
fired from Gaza. On 7 April 2011, a guided anti-tank missile was fired from 
Gaza and hit a school bus driving near Sha&#8223;ar Hanegev Regional Council, 
southern Israel, leaving two Israelis wounded. A 16-year-old boy subsequently 
died as a result of injuries suffered from this attack.2 Hamas claimed 
responsibility for the attack, saying that it was in revenge to the killing of three 
of its militant leaders on 2 April.3 It stressed that its militants did not know that 
the bus was carrying schoolchildren.4 On 20 August 2011, a 38-year-old civilian 
was killed in Be&#8223;er Sheva when a Grad rocket struck the area he was in.5 On 29 
October 2011, a 56-year-old resident of Ashkelon was killed by shrapnel from a 
Grad rocket, while driving near his home.6<b> </b>  
</p>
<p>8. Indiscriminate attacks, such as the firing of these rockets, is contrary to 
the rules of international humanitarian law prohibiting the targeting of civilians, 
the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons and acts aimed at spreading terror 
in the civilian population.7 In addition, it has been alleged by the Government of 
Israel that such rockets and mortars are often located in and fired from densely 
populated areas. Should this be the case, it would also contravene customary 
international humanitarian law.8

<p> 7 These rules are identified in International Committee of the Red Cross, <i>Customary 
International Humanitarian Law</i>, vol. I, Jean-Marie Henkaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, 
eds. (Cambridge University Press, 2009), rules 1, 2, 11 and 71.  
</p>
<p> 8 Ibid., rule 23. </p>


<p>9. The Palestinian armed groups that fire these rockets and mortars are 
responsible for the related violations of international humanitarian law. As noted 
above, Hamas claimed direct responsibility for one of these attacks during the 
reporting period. In addition, the de facto authorities in Gaza failed to take 
measures to ensure that other such attacks were not carried out. Yet it appears 
that the de facto authorities have some capacity to stop or reduce the number of 
indiscriminate rocket attacks launched by other Palestinian armed groups. This 
can be inferred from the fact that during the reporting period there have been 
significant periods of time during which no single rocket was launched in the 
direction of Israeli territory from Gaza. This was the case, for example, in the 
period following the reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas in May 
2011 and in the period preceding the conclusion of the prisoner swap agreement 
in October 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detention and treatment of prisoners  
</b></p>
<p>10. Reports of arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of detainees and alleged 
enforced disappearances committed by different branches of the de facto 
authorities&#8223; security forces, including the internal security apparatus and the anti-
drug police, continued during the reporting period. OHCHR monitored at least 
10 cases of ill-treatment in detention, including a number of cases of torture. In 
most cases the detainees were subject to &#8220;shabeh&#8221;9 and beatings. In a number of 
cases persons suspected of sympathizing with Fatah were ill-treated and forced 
to sign an oath by which they commit not to participate in Fatah activities. In one 
case, following a dispute between Fatah- and Hamas-affiliated students at a 
university in Gaza, at least three students were repeatedly summoned for 
interviews over a period of a week by the internal security apparatus. Each time 
they were detained for several hours, subjected to shabeh and beaten. During the 
last interview they were asked to sign an oath not to participate in Fatah 
activities.  
</p>
<p>11. Some cases of detention and ill-treatment of former members of the 
Palestinian Authority security forces were reported. On 1 January 2011, a former 
member of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service (PSS) was detained in his 
home, together with a neighbour, by the de facto authorities&#8223; security forces. 
During their transfer to the Beit Lahia police station, they were beaten and once 
at the station they were subject to shabeh and beaten and interrogated in relation 
to the alleged firing of fireworks on the occasion of the anniversary of the Fatah 
movement.10 They were released the following morning. OHCHR received 
information concerning the alleged detention and disappearance of a 43-year-old 
woman by the de facto authorities&#8223; security forces in April 2011. She is a 
Palestinian Authority police officer and an active member of Fatah. Since her 
detention her family has not received information concerning her whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>12. Cases of death in custody were reported. In one of the three cases 
monitored by OHCHR, a 23-year-old man was detained by anti-drug police on 3 
June 2011, and brought to a detention centre on Salah El Din street in Deir El 
Balah, where he was subject to shabeh and beaten for four hours. He was 
admitted to the intensive care unit of the local hospital suffering from cerebral 
</p>
<p>  
 9 The practice of &#8220;shabah&#8221; is understood to include stress positions, sensory isolation, sleep 
</p>
<p>deprivation and infliction of pain, and often one or a combination of these methods for 
prolonged periods.  
</p>
<p> 10 Case monitored by OHCHR. </p>


<p>bleeding. He went into a coma and died on 12 June 2011. In another case a man 
was detained by the internal security apparatus on 14 April 2011. He died in 
detention on 19 April. At the time of death the Ministry of Interior of the de facto 
authorities indicated there would be an autopsy. Later the same day the 
authorities announced that he had died of natural causes despite the fact that his 
body showed signs of bruises on the head and his ribs were broken.   
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civil rights, including freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p>13. The de facto authorities continued to curtail freedom of expression, 
opinion and assembly. In several cases, individuals participating in academic 
conferences or workshops outside of Gaza were detained or summoned for 
interrogation following their return to Gaza and in some cases threatened or ill-
treated.11 Public assemblies were also targeted. During the reporting period the 
de facto authorities&#8223; security forces used excessive force to disperse several 
peaceful assemblies. On 11 February 2011, following Friday prayers, several 
hundred people gathered in Khan Younis protesting against social injustice and 
calling for an end to the internal political rift. The de facto authorities&#8223; security 
forces, both uniformed and in civilian clothing, intervened. They beat several 
participants, detained those who had photographed their intervention, including a 
journalist, and confiscated their equipment or deleted their photographs.12 In 
another incident on 15 March 2011, a public assembly in support of Palestinian 
unity was violently dispersed. At least 100 participants and observers were 
beaten, tents were destroyed and some 50 persons were detained. In the 
following days, other smaller demonstrations in support of Palestinian unity were 
violently dispersed, including one at Al Quds Open University.13 
</p>
<p>14. The work of journalists continued to be disrupted by the de facto 
authorities&#8223; security forces. Journalists present at the public assemblies 
mentioned above had their cameras confiscated and in some cases were arrested 
and beaten. A few days after the 15 March protest, 12 de facto authorities&#8223; 
security personnel raided the offices of Reuters, destroyed equipment, beat two 
employees and confiscated a camera. In this case the de facto authorities 
announced that they had arrested four suspects and were initiating an 
investigation. In another case a journalist received a call from someone 
identifying himself as the head of the internal security apparatus in Khan Younis, 
who accused him of incitement against the de facto authorities and referred to a 
number of his articles as &#8220;provocative&#8221;. On 17 February 2011, the journalist was 
summoned for an interview with the internal security apparatus during which he 
was coerced to sign a document by which he made a commitment to act 
professionally and to refrain from acts of incitement against the government.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. The death penalty  
</b></p>
<p>15. The de facto authorities continued to carry out executions and to issue 
death sentences. While international human rights law does not prohibit capital 
punishment, it limits it to the most serious crimes, which is interpreted to mean 
those where there was an intention to kill and which resulted in loss of life. 
Death sentences should only be issued following a trial in a court that offers the

 12 Case monitored by OHCHR. 
 13 Case monitored by OHCHR.  </p>


<p>defendant all procedural guarantees of a fair trial, including the right to appeal 
the conviction and the sentence.  
</p>
<p>16. During the reporting period the de facto authorities carried out three 
executions. All were carried out without the ratification of the death sentences by 
the President of the Palestinian Authority, which is a requirement under the 
Palestinian Basic Law. On 26 July 2011, the de facto authorities carried out two 
death sentences by hanging Mahmud Abu Qenas and Rami Abu Qenas. The two 
had been found guilty in 2004 of murder and collaboration with Israel. On 4 May 
2011, Abd al-Karim Mohammed Abed Shrair was executed by firing squad, 
having been found guilty of collaborating with Israel.14 The common use by de 
facto authorities&#8223; security forces of torture and ill-treatment before and during 
interrogation and the use of military tribunals to try civilians cast serious doubt 
on the respect of fair trial guarantees in cases in which the death penalty is 
imposed in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>17. According to information collected by OHCHR, the de facto authorities&#8223; 
courts delivered at least seven death sentences since the beginning of 2011. All 
of these sentences were handed down by military courts.15 On 11 October, the 
High Military Court in Gaza sentenced to death Rebhi Ahmed Rebhi Badawi, a 
35-year-old man, after conviction on charges of spying for the Israeli Defence 
Forces (IDF). On 12 October, two more death sentences were issued by the High 
Military Court, against Belal Sa&#8223;ady Al Masri (22), from Beit Lahia, and Jehad 
Abdullah As Sabea&#8223; (23), from the town of Ash Sheikh Zayed. The three were 
reportedly sentenced to death after being convicted of having been involved in 
the detonation of an explosive device that led to the killing of one person and the 
injury of several others on 5 February 2009. These sentences can still be 
appealed.16  
</p>
<p><b> B. The Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Law enforcement in the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to life 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the reporting period, the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported 3,745 search and arrest operations by 
IDF in the West Bank, during which 2,748 Palestinians were arrested and/or 
detained. A number of cases documented by OHCHR indicate that IDF often use 
live ammunition against unarmed Palestinians. The resort to the use of live 
ammunition in IDF search and arrest operations resulted in the death of four 
unarmed Palestinian civilians.

<p>19. On 7 January 2011 at approximately 3.30 a.m., a large number of IDF 
troops surrounded a house in Hebron, silently broke into the second floor of the 
house and immediately rushed for the bedroom. Three soldiers entered the 
bedroom and immediately opened fire at close range on Omar Qawasmeh, a 66-
year-old man who was asleep in his bed. Approximately 14 bullets were fired at 
him. According to accounts collected by OHCHR, when the soldiers realized that 
they had targeted the wrong floor they proceeded to the first floor of the house 
where they arrested the intended target of the raid. IDF announced that it would 
investigate the killing and on 19 January, announced that it would terminate the 
career of one of the soldiers involved in the operation.17 
</p>
<p>20. On 13 July 2011, at around 5 a.m., 21-year-old Ibrahim Omar Sarhan 
from el-Far&#8223;a refugee camp was shot in the leg by an IDF soldier and 
subsequently bled to death. According to the account collected by OHCHR, the 
victim and his cousin had finished dawn prayers at a mosque in el-Fa&#8223;ra camp 
and were walking home. A number of IDF soldiers appeared at the end of the 
narrow alley where the victim and his cousin were walking. The cousin was 
quickly physically immobilized by some of the soldiers while the victim turned 
around and started running away. An IDF soldier fired in the direction of the 
victim, who was hit in the thigh but continued running away until he reached a 
neighbor&#8223;s place. IDF entered the house where the victim was lying, almost 
unconscious, and started providing first aid to the victim. An ambulance arrived 
at the scene and took the victim to al-Rafidiya hospital in Nablus where, upon 
arrival, the victim was pronounced dead. The accounts collected by OHCHR and 
the circumstances of the incident indicate that the victim was not involved in any 
violent act against IDF during their operation in the camp.   
</p>
<p>21. On 1 August 2011, at approximately 2:30 a.m., IDF troops entered 
Qalandia refugee camp to conduct a search and arrest operation targeting three 
teenagers accused of stone throwing, arson and destruction of property. Some 
camp residents, alerted to the presence of IDF in the camp, had gathered on the 
adjacent roofs and started throwing stones at the soldiers. This lasted 
approximately 30 minutes. The soldiers then left the courtyard, firing several 
hundred rounds in many directions, while advancing toward the road that leads 
out of the camp. At the same time in an adjacent street, in which the situation 
was calm and no stone throwing was taking place, another group of soldiers was 
making its way towards the group of stranded soldiers, when they came face to 
face with five unarmed young men. According to the accounts collected by 
OHCHR, one of the soldiers immediately opened fire in the direction of the 
young men, killing 25-year-old Ali Hasan Abed Khaleefah and 22-year-old 
Mo&#8223;atasim Essa Othman Odwan and wounding another.  
</p>
<p>22. On 23 September 2011, in Qusra, in the northern West Bank, an unarmed 
Palestinian civilian was shot dead by IDF following clashes between settlers and 
Palestinians. Clashes erupted after IDF refused to remove a group of settlers who 
had trespassed into privately owned Palestinian land. The soldiers focused their 
efforts instead on removing the Palestinians. Eyewitness accounts collected by 
OHCHR indicate that the soldiers formed a line and stood in between the settlers, 
some of whom were armed, and the Palestinians. IDF used tear gas to disperse 
the Palestinians, then resorted to rubber bullets against the Palestinians and

<p>finally used live fire, which led to the death of 36-year-old Essam Kamal Badran 
Oudeh, a father of seven children. The use of live fire by IDF was confirmed by 
its spokesperson.18 It was subsequently reported in the media that the commander 
of the IDF unit involved in the death of the Palestinian civilian was relieved from 
his post but remained in the IDF.19 
</p>
<p>23. The use of live ammunition by IDF at checkpoints in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory against unarmed individuals is also cause for concern. For 
example, on 2 January 2011 an unarmed man crossing the Al-Hamra checkpoint 
was shot and killed. The man was passing through the security check and had 
handed over his identification to an Israeli soldier. When he was about to clear 
the checkpoint, a female soldier who stood behind a concrete block started to 
shout at him in Hebrew and shot him in the leg. The man fell to the ground. He 
then got up with his hands up; at this point other soldiers at the checkpoint 
opened fire. One bullet hit him in the chest. At the arrival of the ambulance crew 
he was pronounced dead. IDF announced three weeks later that an operational 
investigation had concluded that the soldiers had acted in conformity with rules 
of engagement.20 
</p>
<p>24. On 11 November 2011, an Israeli citizen was driving in the Hebron 
Governorate. IDF, having received information about a suspicious vehicle, had 
set up a temporary checkpoint. The vehicle driven by the victim failed to stop at 
the checkpoint as signalled by the soldiers. One of the soldiers then opened fire 
in the direction of the vehicle, killing its driver and injuring two passengers. In a 
press statement IDF indicated that the soldier felt that his life was threatened. 
IDF ordered an investigation.21  
</p>
<p>25. As emphasized by the Secretary-General in his report on Israeli practices 
affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem (A/66/356), &#8220;the use of firearms against 
unarmed persons raises serious concerns with regard to the open-fire regulations 
and training received by the Israeli security forces. In the West Bank, occupying 
forces act in a law-enforcement capacity. They are bound by article 6 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and should act in 
accordance with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials&#8221; (para. 15). The use of firearms is authorized in extremely 
limited circumstances, namely self-defence or defence of others against 
imminent threat of death or serious injury and only if less extreme means are 
insufficient.22 The Secretary-General added that &#8220;thorough, prompt, independent 
and impartial investigations of the use of firearms by law enforcement officials, 
and the taking of appropriate judicial and disciplinary sanctions when necessary, 
are essential to ensure the accountability of security forces&#8221; (para. 17). The

</p>
<p> 22 Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, 1990, 
principle 9.  </p>


<p>circumstances of the killings mentioned above indicate the necessity for Israeli 
security forces to reassess open-fire regulations with a view to preventing such 
incidents. Furthermore, the issue of lack of accountability remains a serious 
concern.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Discriminatory practices underlying settlement expansion and impunity for 
</b></p>
<p><b>settler violence  
</b></p>
<p>26. Despite the illegality of settlements under international law, Israeli 
settlement expansion continued in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and 
was accompanied by a regime of policies detrimental to the rights of 
Palestinians. About half a million Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, including 
East Jerusalem.23 Throughout the reporting period the Government of Israel 
continuously announced plans for new construction and the expansion of existing 
settlements in the occupied West Bank, including in East Jerusalem.24 Moreover, 
Israeli-imposed restrictions specifically targeting Palestinian construction are 
blatantly discriminatory (A/66/364, para. 8). 
</p>
<p>27. While Israeli settlement expansion continues, Palestinians throughout the 
West Bank, particularly in Area C and in East Jerusalem, continue to face 
significant restrictions on construction, which severely affects their needs and 
rights. As noted by the Secretary-General, Israel continues &#8220;to impose 
restrictions on land allocation and planning for Palestinian construction. Israel&#8223;s 
discriminatory planning restrictions result in the lack of building permits for the 
Palestinian population in the West Bank forcing them to build without building 
permits and live under the constant threat of eviction and demolition&#8221; (A/66/364, 
para. 10).25 According to OCHA, the total number of Palestinian structures 
demolished by Israeli authorities during the reporting period is 574, including 
203 residential structures, which led to the displacement of at least 957 
Palestinians. In its consideration of Israel, the Human Rights Committee 
concluded that the planning regimes in the West Bank, in particular in Area C 
and in East Jerusalem, are discriminatory and disproportionately favour the 
Israeli population of those areas (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, para. 17).  
</p>
<p>28. Violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers continued to be reported 
throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Attacks by settlers against 
Palestinians and their property take various forms, including attacks with live 
ammunition and baseball bats, the cutting of trees, stone throwing and the 
vandalizing and torching of mosques, in addition to other various types of 
assault. According to OCHA, the weekly average of settler attacks against 
Palestinian communities resulting in Palestinian injuries and property damage 
increased by 40 per cent in 2011 in comparison to 2010 and by more than 165

<p>per cent compared to 2009.26 In 2011, almost 10,000 Palestinian-owned trees, 
mainly olive trees, were damaged or uprooted by Israeli settlers, severely 
affecting the livelihood of hundreds of Palestinian families.27  
</p>
<p>29. During the reporting period, OHCHR closely monitored the situation in 
the village of Qusra, in the northern West Bank, which witnessed a spike in 
settler violence during 2011 and particularly during September. The attacks took 
various forms and are emblematic of the phenomenon of settler violence 
throughout the West Bank. On 6 October 2011, at least 200 trees belonging to 
four Palestinian families were uprooted and/or damaged in Qusra. On 23 
September 2011, as noted above, following clashes between Palestinians and 
settlers, an unarmed Palestinian civilian was shot dead with live ammunition by 
IDF. During the same incident, two minors were detained by IDF for two hours 
in a tent located between the village and the Esh Kodesh outpost, during which 
they were beaten by both IDF soldiers and settlers and insulted. On 16 
September 2011, one unarmed Palestinian was injured with live fire by a settler 
after armed settlers trespassed onto his land. During the same incident, one minor 
was injured in his leg when the settlers released their dog on the minor. On 5 
September 2011, a mosque in the village was vandalized and torched. Insulting 
graffiti was sprayed on its walls. On 26 August 2011, a Palestinian minor was 
injured by live ammunition used by IDF following clashes between settlers and 
Palestinians. On 7 March 2011, at least 12 Palestinians sustained serious injuries 
as a result of live fire shot by both IDF and armed settlers. During this incident, 
accounts collected by OHCHR indicate that the injured Palestinians were 
assaulted simultaneously by both IDF and armed settlers (A/66/364, para. 24).  
</p>
<p>30. The failure of IDF to protect Palestinians and their property from violence 
by Israeli civilians continues to be a growing concern. The lack of accountability 
for these violent acts, which is exacerbated by the existence of a dual legal 
system - civil courts for Israeli civilians and a less protective military justice 
system for Palestinians suspected of involvement in crimes - contributes to 
increased tension between Palestinians and Israelis (ibid, para. 31). OHCHR 
documented several cases where IDF appeared to provide direct support to 
settlers when they attacked Palestinian communities and focused their efforts in 
dispersing Palestinians or removing them from their lands rather than preventing 
Israeli settlers from trespassing onto private Palestinian land and attacking 
Palestinians and their property. Reports of the Government of Israel suggest that 
this failure may in some instances be a result of the insufficient knowledge of 
some IDF soldiers about their duty to protect Palestinians (ibid., para. 30). At the 
same time, it should be noted that IDF in many contexts does successfully act to 
prevent incidents and to ensure accountability, which suggests that the required 
capacity is available.  
</p>
<p>31. Filing a complaint against settlers or IDF is often a complicated and 
intimidating process for many Palestinians. Many refrain from filing complaints 
and limit themselves to reporting the case to the Palestinian authorities. 
However, Palestinian authorities have no jurisdiction with regard to settlers and 
can only document the damages and/or injuries and send written complaints to

Bank have the sole responsibility, capacity and jurisdiction to ensure effective 
prevention and accountability for settler violence in the West Bank.

<p><b> 3. The Wall and the case of Al-Walaja  
</b></p>
<p>32. In the advisory opinion <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i> of 9 July 2004 issued upon the request of 
the General Assembly, the International Court of Justice concluded that the 
construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and its associated 
regime contravene international law (para. 42). The Court also concluded that 
Israel is obligated to cease construction of the Wall inside the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, to dismantle the existing portions which lie inside the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, and to make reparations for damages caused by 
the construction of the Wall (paras. 150-153). As of July 2011, the total length of 
the Wall was approximately 708 km, which is more than twice the length of the 
320-km Green Line (the 1949 Armistice Line) between the West Bank and 
Israel. According to OCHA, when completed as per the planned route, 85 per 
cent of the Wall will run inside the West Bank. Almost 62 per cent of the Wall is 
now completed.28 Israel has not complied with the advisory opinion of the 
International Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p>33. The situation of the village of Al-Walaja illustrates the situation of many 
communities affected by the Wall. Al-Walaja is located 9 km south-west of the 
Old City of Jerusalem and has a population of about 2,200 people. In 2006, the 
Israeli authorities confirmed to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) the plan of Israel to encircle the 
village with the Wall, effectively isolating it as an enclave between Jerusalem 
and the Etzion settlement block.29 Construction of the Wall resumed in 2010, 
after years of inactivity, and hundreds of trees of different types were uprooted to 
make way for the Wall, depriving dozens of families from an important source of 
income. Since July 2011, the Israeli authorities uprooted at least 90 olive trees 
and at least 100 trees of different types from the lands of the village of Al-
Walaja, directly affecting the livelihoods of many Palestinian families.30 The 
community of the village continues to challenge the legality and the effects of 
the Wall by petitioning the Israeli High Court, so far in vain.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. The situation of Bedouin communities 
</b></p>
<p>34. Pressure levied by the Israeli authorities on Bedouin communities living 
in Area C of the West Bank increased during the reporting period. The Secretary-
General recently noted that &#8220;over the last 30 years the Bedouin community has 
experienced gradual, systematic dispossession of its land. Today Bedouins face 
constant attempts to displace them from their homes and increasingly restricted 
access to natural resources&#8221; (A/66/356 para. 44). Recent plans announced by the 
Israeli authorities targeting the transfer of 20 Bedouin communities, including a 
total of 2,300 people, from the Jerusalem periphery are of immediate concern.

<p>Half of the communities in question live along road No. 1, which connects 
Jerusalem with the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea, and the other half 
live inside and on the outskirts of the &#8220;E1&#8221; area planned for the expansion of the 
settlement of Ma&#8223;ale Adumim.31  
</p>
<p>35. Some reports indicate that this plan may be implemented as early as 
January 2012 and that it is the first step of a larger plan to transfer up to 27,000 
Bedouins from their communities in Area C.32 OHCHR met with representatives 
of some Bedouin communities in September 2011. The communities expressed 
their concerns with the implications of the planned transfer. More than 80 per 
cent of the members of these communities are already refugees. The 
communities have already lost land in the past due to settlement expansion and 
most have pending demolition orders against their homes. Currently, none have 
access to electricity networks and just about half are connected to water 
networks. The communities have clearly expressed to OHCHR that the Israeli 
Civil Administration has not consulted them for this transfer plan. The 
communities fear the transfer will lead to a further deterioration of their living 
conditions, loss of livelihood, loss of tribal cohesion and erosion of their 
traditional lifestyles. Furthermore, according to OCHA, the proposed transfer site 
is situated close to the municipal dumping site and is likely to pose health 
hazards to the communities.33   
</p>
<p>36. If the proposed plan to transfer 20 Bedouin communities is not desired by 
the vast majority of these communities it would, if implemented, constitute 
forced transfer of population, which is strictly prohibited under international 
humanitarian law. Elements of this also raise a number of human rights concerns 
enshrined in both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Should 
some communities be willing to be transferred, they should be involved in 
genuine consultations, alternatives should be discussed, and their way of life, 
livelihood and culture must be preserved. Their informed consent (in a language 
they understand), obtained without coercion or pressure, is required. In any case, 
consent of the communities to be moved by no means justifies the expansion of 
settlements or related activities which remain illegal under international law.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Gaza  
</b></p>
<p>37. The Israeli blockade, now in its fifth year, continued to significantly 
impact the human rights situation in Gaza. Severe restrictions on the movement 
of people and goods, on land and sea, remain in place. The effects of such 
measures include: increased poverty and unemployment, a decline in 
infrastructure and the quality of services, such as health care, education, water 
and sanitation, and serious erosion of the coping mechanisms of families and 
communities.34 Restrictions on exports continued, as did limitations on imports

<p>of certain materials qualified by Israel as &#8220;dual-use&#8221; items, impeding 
reconstruction, maintenance and expansion of civilian infrastructure destroyed 
during Operation Cast Lead and as a result of ongoing military operations.35 
There was also a delay in the construction of three wastewater treatment plants. 
The inability to build new schools/classrooms due to the lack of construction 
material in combination with the growing population has led to a double- and 
triple-shift system of holding classes, which negatively affects the quality of 
education that children receive. About 85 per cent of schools in Gaza run on the 
system of double or triple shifts, leading to a reduction in class time and the 
elimination of extracurricular activities.36 The unemployment rates continue to 
increase, with an estimated 26 per cent of the people, including 38 per cent of the 
youth, being unemployed.37 Due to ongoing restrictions on the import of 
construction materials, the lack of alternative employment opportunities, and 
huge housing and infrastructure needs, the tunnel economy continues to grow.  
</p>
<p>38. Palestinians continued to face serious threats to life, liberty and security 
on a regular basis as a result of various forms of violence, including conflict-
related violence (such as incursions, bombardments/air strikes and levelling 
operations by Israeli security forces) and the use of live ammunition to enforce 
the access to restricted areas on land and at sea. Such acts, which usually take 
place with impunity, have resulted in death, injury, displacement, disability 
and/or psychological trauma, as well as extensive damage to civilian 
infrastructure38 and Palestinian land and property.  
</p>
<p>39. In some cases, IDF failed to take precautions to avoid the loss of civilian 
life. It has also failed to observe the principles of proportionality and distinction. 
OHCHR investigated four cases of civilians killed by IDF in Gaza where 
necessary measures to prevent the casualties were not taken. On 22 March 2011, 
an Israeli mortar shell struck a civilian residence in Al-Tufah neighbourhood, 
eastern Gaza city, killing four civilians, including two children, and wounding 12 
others.<b> </b>Earlier that day three mortar shells targeting IDF stationed at the Green 
Line had been launched from the area.39 The shells had caused no physical 
injuries or damage. While IDF seems to have been responding to the earlier 
attack from the area, it is alleged it did so several hours later. This time frame 
should have allowed IDF to use all means at its disposal to properly assess 
whether a military objective was still present in the area so long after the initial 
attack as well as the risk to civilians in the targeted area and allowed it to choose 
weapons which could have minimized this risk. On 8 April 2011, an IDF missile 
struck a house in Abassan Al Kabira in Khan Younis, killing a mother (40 years 
old) and her daughter (19 years old), and injuring two children who were sitting 
in the courtyard. Witnesses interviewed by OHCHR noted that no mortar shell or 
rocket attacks at Israeli targets had taken place from that area on the day of the 
strike or before.

<p>40. Major obstacles continue to prevent most Palestinians from seeking 
accountability. The statute of limitations under Israeli law requires that a 
complaint for civil damages must be brought within two years of the date of the 
incident, or the right to compensation is lost. The restrictions on movement and 
the large number of victims have meant that victims are often unable to submit 
their cases within the required time frame. Restrictions on movement have also 
meant that victims or witnesses have been unable to appear in court (when 
needed) or access legal counsel in Israel, while requests by lawyers to enter Gaza 
have also been consistently denied. Reports indicate that since July 2007, no 
individuals from Gaza have been allowed to travel to appear before the court. In 
addition, the setting of a high court fee and a court insurance/guarantee before 
the case can begin, and its application only to Palestinian claimants, serves to 
limit, and ultimately deny, access to justice. Few victims can afford to pay the 
court insurance, an estimated NIS 10,000 (US$ 2,800), which has led to cases 
being dismissed and closed.40  
</p>
<p><b> C.  The Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Detention and treatment in detention  
</b></p>
<p>41. According to the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights 
(ICHR), the Palestinian General Intelligence Agency announced that it would 
stop trying Palestinian civilians before military courts. The decision, which 
entered into effect on 16 January 2011, also puts an end to the practice of 
detaining persons without a warrant from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, a 
practice that contravened the Palestinian Code of Criminal Procedure.41 In a 
meeting with PSS in February 2011, OHCHR was informed that on 31 
December 2010, the decision to stop the use of military courts had entered into 
force. All detainees would be tried by civil courts with the exception of people 
held prior to that date. After a review of the files of persons held in Juneid Prison 
in Nablus, PSS released 19 detainees and six detainees were referred to civil 
courts in Nablus. OHCHR was also informed that PSS had issued strict 
instructions on the treatment of detainees. Accounts collected by OHCHR from 
detainees in Juneid Prison indicate that treatment of detainees in that prison had 
generally improved.  
</p>
<p>42. Despite these positive developments, OHCHR continued to receive 
reports of arbitrary detention and ill-treatment in detention by security services 
of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. ICHR received a total of 398 
complaints by Palestinians who claimed that they were deprived of their freedom 
and were arbitrarily detained by members of the security agencies operating in 
the West Bank between January and April 2011.42 In the meantime, several 
orders of release issued by the Palestinian High Court of Justice due to illegality 
of detention were not implemented by the executive authorities in the West Bank

<p>in violation of Palestinian Basic Law (art. 106). In August 2011, ICHR 
documented 17 complaints regarding the non-implementation of decisions issued 
by both the Palestinian High Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance in 
the West Bank.43 In some cases, although Palestinian Authority security agencies 
implement the High Court&#8223;s decisions on the release of detainees, they frequently 
nullify the practical effects by detaining released persons under the pretext of 
other charges. Therefore, release orders are implemented, but affected persons 
are summoned and detained again. Although arbitrary detention in the West 
Bank is outlawed by the Palestinian Basic Law and the Law of Penal Procedure 
No. 3 of 2001,44 the situation on the ground is different. Executive authorities 
need to take effective measures against arbitrary detention.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Civil rights, including freedoms of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>43. Freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by the Palestinian Basic 
Law. However, during the reporting period some Palestinian actors took action 
in some cases to curtail this right. Palestinian security services in the West Bank 
curtailed the freedom of journalists and media professionals. Announcements in 
April 2011 on possible Fatah and Hamas reconciliation had a positive impact on 
journalists&#8223; freedom to exercise their profession. This also allowed for the return 
of journalists and other personnel of Palestine TV to the Gaza Strip, and of Al-
Aqsa TV to the West Bank.  
</p>
<p>44. During the protests calling for national unity that were organized in 
March 2011 in different cities and towns in the West Bank, violations by PSS 
and the General Intelligence Agency against journalists in the West Bank were 
reported. On 15 March, a group of unidentified persons attacked journalists in 
plain sight of security services personnel stationed near the protest tent at Al-
Manara Square in Ramallah. Based on the complaints received by ICHR from 
two journalists (one foreign and one Palestinian), the Palestinian Authority 
policemen did not try to protect them. The Palestinian Centre for Development 
and Media Freedoms (MADA), with which OHCHR met, reported that attacks 
on journalists &#8220;continued to hinder their work and endanger their lives&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>45. In August 2011, the Prosecutor-General of the Palestinian Authority 
decided to stop airing a Palestine TV show called <i>Watan ala Watar</i> (Homeland 
on a String). Palestine TV was ordered to stop airing the satirical programme as 
it allegedly offended and humiliated a large number of Palestinians. In the same 
month, Professor Abdel Sattar Qassem was arrested and held in custody 
following the publishing of an article. He was later released following a personal 
appeal to the President of the Palestinian Authority. 
</p>
<p>46. The Islamic Liberation Party (Hizb al-Tahrir) annually commemorates the 
fall of the Islamic Caliphate. The commemoration usually takes the form of a 
series of lectures ending with a central conference and a march in Ramallah. The 
intervention of Palestinian Authority security forces this year resulted in clashes 
with members of the party. In June 2011 the party received confirmation by 
relevant authorities of the Palestinian Authority that they had no objection to the 
demonstration planned for 2 July 2011. On the appointed day, members of the

commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of the fall of the Islamic Caliphate. 
Despite having submitted a written notice of the march in Ramallah, Palestinian 
Authority security forces violently dispersed it, along with several other marches 
in a number of West Bank towns. One of the victims of these incidents in Hebron 
city informed OHCHR that he was severely beaten by 10 to 12 members of 
Palestinian Authority security forces before being apprehended.

</b></p>
<p><b>develop over the coming months. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to the de facto authorities in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The de facto authorities must ensure respect for international 
humanitarian law by members of its armed groups and groups under its 
</b></p>
<p><b>control, in particular in relation to the prohibition of targeting civilians, 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian objects and civilian areas and to ending the use of indiscriminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>weapons. The de facto authorities must avoid locating military assets in 
</b></p>
<p><b>densely populated areas and seek to remove those already in place.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>Clear and unambiguous orders must be issued to all the security 
forces in Gaza prohibiting the use of torture and/or cruel, inhuman or 
</b></p>
<p><b>degrading treatment, and the de facto authorities must ensure that members 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the security forces respect these orders by investigating promptly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thoroughly and impartially all allegations of ill-treatment and by imposing 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate disciplinary and penal sanctions against those found 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The freedoms of opinion, expression and assembly of residents of 
Gaza, including journalists, must be respected. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The de facto authorities must cease the use of military tribunals to try 
civilians and should positively consider imposing an immediate moratorium 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the use of the death penalty with a view to its ultimate abolishment.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to the Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Government of Israel must take all necessary measures to 
prevent further incidents of excessive use of force during law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations by its security forces, including during search and arrest 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations. This should include a comprehensive review of regulations on </b></p>


<p><b>the use of live ammunition in law enforcement operations carried out by all

<p><b>Israeli security forces, including the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) so as to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that these regulations are in line with the international legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations of Israel.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The Government of Israel must ensure the accountability of the 
members of its security forces, in particular by conducting investigations 
</b></p>
<p><b>that meet international standards of promptness, independence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartiality, and thoroughness into all credible allegations of violations, and

<p><b>immediately cease the transfer of its civilian population into occupied 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory. The Government should cease its discriminatory policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices affecting Palestinians, including </b>those that violate Palestinians&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>right to adequate housing.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Government of Israel must take all necessary measures to 
prevent attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>property in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Attacks by settlers 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Israeli security forces against Palestinian civilians and their property in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the West Bank must be duly investigated by the Israeli authorities and those 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible held accountable. Victims also have to be appropriately 
</b></p>
<p><b>compensated.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Government of Israel must take all necessary measures to ensure 
that Palestinian victims of alleged crimes by Israeli settlers can file and 
</b></p>
<p><b>follow up on complaints. They must be able to do so in complete safety. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government must ensure that the principle that all persons are equal before 
</b></p>
<p><b>the law and entitled without discrimination to the equal protection of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>law is fully enforced in all its practices. Israeli police stations should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>easily accessible to Palestinians. An adequate and efficient complaint-filing 
</b></p>
<p><b>system should be set up between the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Authority in cases where Palestinians are not able to access Israeli police 
</b></p>
<p><b>stations.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The Government of Israel must fully comply with the advisory 
opinion of the International Court of Justice with regard to the Wall.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Government of Israel should cancel any plans to transfer 
Bedouin communities from the West Bank that may amount to forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer and/or forced evictions. Any attempts to carry out a transfer should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be carried out only with the free, prior and informed consent of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and in conformity with international human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Methods used by IDF to enforce access restrictions on land and sea in 
Gaza need to be reviewed. These methods need to be in line with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international legal obligations of Israel and should never include the use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>live ammunition against civilians.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Government of Israel should ensure that any attack by IDF fully 
respects international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>distinction, proportionality and precautions. </b></p>


<p>61. <b>The Government of Israel must fully lift the blockade of Gaza, with 
due regard to legitimate security concerns. This should include measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate the movement of people to and from Gaza, permitting goods to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>exported from Gaza, and ensuring that materials for reconstruction can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>delivered to Gaza.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations to the Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Palestinian Authority must ensure that all its law enforcement 
agencies/security services adhere to international standards and refrain 
</b></p>
<p><b>from arbitrarily arresting persons, including without a warrant from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the Public Prosecutor. Files currently in the hands of the military 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial authorities need to be referred to the competent civil authorities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Palestinian Authority must also ensure that conditions and treatment in 
</b></p>
<p><b>its detention facilities are in conformity with international standards.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Palestinian Authority must ensure that civil society 
organizations, human rights defenders and journalists can carry out their 
</b></p>
<p><b>work in a safe and secure environment in accordance with applicable 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards. The freedoms of expression, 
</b></p>
<p><b>association and assembly are a central cornerstone in a free and open 
</b></p>
<p><b>society, and the Palestinian Authority should take all necessary measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect and respect these freedoms.  
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
