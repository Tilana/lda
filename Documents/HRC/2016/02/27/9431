<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolution 1/4 of 30 June 2006, and recalling also all Commission on 
Human Rights and General Assembly resolutions on the right to development, in particular the 
urgent need to make the right to development a reality for everyone, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Charter of the United Nations, and the core human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note </i>of the efforts under way in the framework of the Working Group on the 
Right to Development with the support of the high-level task force on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to development to develop a set of criteria for the periodic evaluation of global partnerships 
as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the eighth session of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development (A/HRC/4/47); 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Decides</i>: </p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To act to ensure that its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development 
and the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and, in this regard, to agree on a 
programme of work that will lead to raising the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 
and 10 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, to the same level and on a par with 
all other human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To endorse the road map outlined in paragraphs 52 to 54 of the report of the 
eighth session of the Working Group on the Right to Development, which would ensure that 
the criteria for the periodic evaluation of global partnerships, as identified in Millennium </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/L.11/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>Development Goal 8, prepared by the high-level task force and being progressively developed 
and refined by the Working Group, is extended to other components of Millennium 
Development Goal 8, by no later than 2009; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) That the above criteria, as endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as 
appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the 
implementation of the right to development; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) That, upon completion of the above phases, the Working Group will take 
appropriate steps for ensuring respect for and practical application of these standards, which 
could take various forms, including guidelines on the implementation of the right to 
development, and evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal standard of a 
binding nature, through a collaborative process of engagement; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To renew the mandate of the Working Group on the Right to Development for a 
period of two years, and that the Working Group shall convene annual sessions of five working

</p>
<p><b>4/5. Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of 
all human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and 
expressing in particular the need to achieve international cooperation in promoting and 
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without  
distinction, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986, 
</p>
<p><i> Realizing</i> that globalization is not merely an economic process, but that it also has social, 
political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions, which have an impact on the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that globalization should be guided by the fundamental principles that 
underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equality, participation, accountability, 
non-discrimination, at both the national and international levels, respect for diversity, tolerance 
and international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that, while globalization offers great opportunities for sustained economic 
growth and development of the world economy and offers new perspectives for the integration of 
developing countries into the world economy, at present its benefits are very unevenly shared 
and costs unevenly distributed, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>that developing countries face special difficulties in meeting the challenge of 
globalization and especially that the least developed countries have remained marginalized in the 
globalizing world economy, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/L.11/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap between the 
developed and the developing countries, which adversely affects the full enjoyment of human 
rights, particularly in the developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the deep fault line between the rich and the poor that divides human 
society and the ever-increasing gap between the developed and the developing countries pose a 
major threat to global prosperity, security and stability, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role of the State, 
may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human rights is first and foremost 
the responsibility of the State, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the shared responsibility to assist countries and people excluded from or 
disadvantaged by globalization, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes</i> that development should be at the centre of the international 
economic agenda and that coherence between national development strategies and international 
obligations and commitments will contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for 
development, which is conducive to the full realization of all human rights for all; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly urges</i> the international community to take stock of the slow progress 
with regard to the Millennium Development Goals, with a view to taking all necessary and 
appropriate measures, including enhanced official development assistance, the search for a 
durable solution to the external debt problem, market access, capacity-building, and 
dissemination of knowledge and technology, in order to achieve successful integration of 
developing countries in the global economy; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the need to broaden and strengthen the full and effective participation of 
developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting with a view to 
ensuring equitable distribution of growth and sustainable development gains in a globalizing 
world economy; </p>

<p> A/HRC.4/L.11/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Underlines</i> the need for the treaty bodies, special rapporteurs/representatives, 
independent experts and working groups of the Council, within their mandates, to take into 
consideration the content of the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue again at its future session. 
</p>
<p><i>31st meeting 
30 March 2007</i> 
</p>
<p>[Adopted by a recorded vote of 34 to 13.  See chap. III.]

<p><b>4/6. Strengthening of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on 
Human Rights, in particular Assembly resolutions 48/141 of 20 December 1993 and 55/234 
of 23 December 2000, and Commission resolutions 1998/83 of 24 April 1998, 1999/54 of 
27 April 1999, 2000/1 of 7 April 2000, 2002/2 of 12 April 2002 and 2004/2 of 8 April 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>paragraph 5 (g) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in 
which the Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the General Assembly in 
its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with satisfaction </i>that the regular budget resources of the Office of the 
High Commissioner will be doubled by 2010,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> that the unearmarked contributions of donors are on the 
increase, which gives the Office of the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of 
resources for its operational activities in accordance with the resolutions of the Council<b> </b>and other 
relevant United Nations organs and bodies, and with a view to treating all human rights in a fair 
and equal manner, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/L.11/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and 
equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the 
consideration of human rights issues and, in this context, underlining the need for continuing to 
ensure the implementation of these principles by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in the fulfilment of her mandate and the activities of her Office, 
</p>
<p><i> Encouraging</i> the High Commissioner, within her mandate as set out in General Assembly 
resolution 48/141, to continue to play an active role in promoting and protecting all civil, 
cultural, economic, political, social rights and the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in 
June 1993 at the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), recognized the 
necessity for an adaptation and strengthening of United Nations human rights machinery in 
accordance with current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the High Commissioner shall be a person of high moral standing and 
personal integrity and shall possess expertise, including in the field of human rights, and the 
general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures and different legal systems necessary 
for impartial, objective, non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the 
High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of General Assembly<b> </b>resolution 61/159,<b> </b>and the relevant reports of the 
High Commissioner (A/HRC/4/93) and the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU/REP/2006/3) concerning 
the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the decision of the Secretary-General in his note on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the High Commissioner (A/61/115/Add.1) to the effect </p>

<p> A/HRC.4/L.11/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the management review of the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2006/3 contained 
in A/61/115) will therefore be submitted to the Human Rights Council&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> of the need for further and continued support and consideration of the 
programmes and activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes</i> that the Office of the High Commissioner is a common office for all 
</p>
<p>and should therefore reflect a diversity of backgrounds and, in this context, recalls that the Office 
of the High Commissioner, as part of the United Nations Secretariat, is governed by Article 101 
of the Charter of the United Nations concerning staffing policies, which is essential for ensuring 
the implementation of the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the 
consideration of human rights issues; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>2. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to give due consideration to geographical rotation

</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner in this regard to provide all States with adequate<b> 
</b>financial and budgetary information on the Office by, inter alia,<b> </b>holding informal briefings on 
voluntary contributions, including their share of the overall full-cost budget of the human rights 
programme, and their allocation; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/L.11/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reiterates</i> the need to ensure that all necessary financial, material and personnel 
resources are provided from the regular budget of the United Nations without delay to the 
United Nations human rights programme to enable the Office of the High Commissioner to carry 
out its mandates efficiently, effectively and expeditiously; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the voluntary contributions to the Office of the High Commissioner, in 
particular those from developing countries, and in this context calls upon donors to take into 
account the High Commissioner&#8217;s call for unearmarked contributions; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the tasks of the High Commissioner include promoting 
and protecting the realization of the right to development and that the Office of the 
High Commissioner should devote adequate resources and staff to its follow-up, with a view 
to enhancing activities of the Office for its effective realization; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon</i> the High Commissioner to continue to emphasize the promotion and 
protection of economic, social and cultural rights in the activities of her Office and, in that 
regard, encourages the High Commissioner to continue to strengthen her relationship with the 
appropriate bodies, funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also calls upon</i> the High Commissioner to continue to strengthen the management 
structure of her Office, including human resource management, and to improve the 
responsiveness of her Office in all priority areas, especially economic, social and cultural rights, 
which require particular research and analytical capacity; 
</p>
<p> 12.<b> </b><i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to enhance international cooperation for the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of all human rights and to engage in a dialogue with all Governments 
in the implementation of her mandate with a view to securing respect for all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Declares</i> that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request 
of Governments with a view to developing national capacities and national ownership in the field 
of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and 
protecting all human rights and democracy; </p>

<p> A/HRC.4/L.11/Add.1 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need for an increase in the allocation of resources from within the 
United Nations regular budget for advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Invites</i> the High Commissioner to continue to provide information on cooperation

</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to take further measures to implement the 
recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit with a view to improving the geographic balance 
of the staff composition of her Office at all levels;

Fifth Committee resolution 61/244 that the Secretary-General present to the General Assembly, 
in consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner, proposals to address the imbalance in 
the geographic distribution of the staff in that Office;
