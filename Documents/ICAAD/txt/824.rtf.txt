15.     
In the case of Barnes vs St. Helens Metropolitan BC (2006) EWCA Civ. 132 refers to uncontrollable situations by him. It is submitted Section 51 (1) of the Interpretation Act, should be applicable in this case by not taking into consideration the date of incident occurred and Learned Master has failed to take into account the date of incident.

16.

It is also submitted by the Learned Counsel. Section 4 of the Limitation Act is pleaded and Master listed the case for 4th March 2011 under Order 25 Rule 9 of the High Court Rules on the application made by the First Defendant Strike Out for want of Prosecution.

21.     
Master made his order on the basis of the materials filed before him as quoted in para 11 of the Ruling by the Master.

22.     
Subsequently, Plaintiff filed an affidavit on 22nd September 2011 and two issues arise:

(a)     
 Fresh evidence was adduced by the Plaintiff;

(b)     
 The receipt (proforma) filed with the affidavit is a lodgement document which does not indicate a case number or reference to the case.

23.     
The said document was not forwarded to the Master at that stage.

24.     
Counsel drew attention to the following matters in his written submissions:

i)      
 Para 12 of the written submissions. This case is a personal injury as a result of medical negligence;

ii)     
 Even if the submissions made by the Plaintiff is admitted on Limitation Act writ of summons lodged on 10th March and it is out of limitation time period;

iii)    
 Statement of Claim does not plead Medical Negligence;

iv)     
 The affidavit to be considered is 19th March 2011;

v)      
 Fresh evidence cannot be adduced at this stage;

vi)     
 Para 31 and 32 of the submissions deals with strike out principles and Plaintiff has not given any excuse for inordinate delay;

25.     
It is also submitted by the Counsel that there is no possibility of succeeding in this action. Master was correct in his ruling and Master exercised his discretionary power, on the materials available before him.

26.     
Counsel also drew attention to para 19 and 20 of the submissions and stated "Even if 10th March 2006 is considered as correct date, plaintiff cannot maintain this action" and Master has exercised his powers correctly.

27.     
Further it was submitted having Master reached the decision on the limitation point, this court need not to consider further grounds raised by the Plaintiff relating to the for want of Prosecution and written submissions of 1st Defendant address this issue too.

F.      
Reply by the Plaintiff's Counsel

28.     
Learned Counsel stated that there was an affidavit dated 2nd August 2011 annexed to Plaintiff's Affidavit of 19th October 2011 and it shows plaintiff was trying to file the affidavit on 2nd August 2011 (drawn attention to para 10 of Affidavit filed on 19th October 2011.

29.     
Authorities cited in para 14 and 15 of the submissions confirm the position that there is no undue delay.

30.     
Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Affidavit of 5th May 2011 filed by the 1st Defendant, no evidence is adduced by defendant to make the decision by the Master.

G.      
Consideration of the Appeal

31.     
There are following issues to be addressed on the Master's Ruling:

1.      
 Whether the Plaintiff is out of Limitation period and also for want of prosecution [Section 4(1) of the Limitation Act].

2.      
 Whether there is no reasonable cause of action disclosed against it and/or the Claim is frivolous and/or vexatious.

3.      
 Whether there is inordinate and inexcusable delay on the part of the Plaintiff and such action or likely to cause or have caused serious prejudice to 1st Defendant.

32.     
The summons to strike out the statement of claim and dismissal of action is made under Order 18 Rule 18(1) of the High Court Rules, 1988.

33.     
Order 18 Rule 18(1) states:

"(i)    
The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be Struck Out or Amended any pleadings or indorsement of any writ in the action or anything in any pleadings or in the indorsement on the ground that:-

(a)     
It discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be; or
(b)     
It is scandalous frivolous or vexatious; or
(c)     
It may prejudice embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
(d)     
It is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgement to be entered accordingly, as the case may be."

34.     
Learned Master made order:

(i)     
 Plaintiff to file affidavit in reply against the Defendant's claim to strike off the case.

35.     
The following matters were raised in the present case:

(i)     
 Whether the Action is time barred.

Plaintiff has admitted the following in his statement of claim:

(a)     
 Plaintiff's wife was admitted to Suva Private Hospital with a swollen thyroid goiter for treatment on 7th March 2006 to the First Defendant's Hospital (It is stated in the para 5 of the Statement of Claim as 2nd Defendant's Hospital, which is incorrect). The operation performed by the Second Defendant. It is also incorrectly stated in para 5 of the Claim as First Defendant). Since this incorrect averment is not an issue taken up at the hearing before Master, I am not taking this matter for consideration in this Leave to Appeal application.

(b)     
 An operation was performed by the Second Defendant on 7th March 2007.

(ii)    
 14 days thereafter to the Defendant file affidavit in reply.

36.     
Plaintiff failed to file an affidavit in reply against the claim by 1st Defendant to strike out and dismiss the action.

37.     
Hearing of the 1st Defendant's strike out application was taken up on 4th August 2011 and Ruling was given by the Learned Master on 13th September 2011:

(a)     
 To Strike Out the Plaintiff's action;

(b)     
 Awarding cost assessed summarily in a sum of $500 and Plaintiff was ordered to pay the cost to the Defendant.

H.      
Findings

38.     
Plaintiff submits that the writ of summons filed on 10/3/2009 and this position cannot be accepted. The only document forwarded by the Plaintiff is the proforma filed with regard to lodgement of documents which does not indicate any case number. This document too was not filed before the Master and adduced as fresh evidence, in the Leave to Appeal Application filed before this Court.

39.     
Accordingly, I hold that writ of summons is filed on 19th March 2009 which is outside the limitation period. The Plaintiff has quoted Cauchi vs Air Fiji Limited HBC 0331. 2001 (11th March 2004) which decision cannot be accepted since said decision was made under different circumstances.

40.     
Further Plaintiff filed this case on 19th March 2011. The alleged cause of action has arisen on 7th March 2006 and limitation period ended on 8th March 2011. When exclude the date of incident and the writ of summons case would have filed latest on 8th March 2011.

41.     
Writ of Summons was filed on 19th March 2011 and I concede with Master that case was filed outside the limitation period. In a personal injury case cause of action arises on the date incident occurred. The incident may result in the death. 

42.     
But I am of the view and agree with the Master, limitation period commence from the date of the operation was performed i.e. 7th March 2000.

43.     
I quote relevant paragraph in Section 4(1) of the Limitation Act Cap 345:

4(1)....................................................

Provided that:

(i)     
 In case of action for damage for Negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether duly exists by virtue of provision made by or under any act or independently or any contract or any such provision) where the damages claimed by the Plaintiff for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty consists of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to any person, this subsection shall have effect as if for reference to six years there were substituted a reference to three years and...............

This case is admittedly personal injury case and the limitation period is 6 years from the date of incidence which resulted death subsequently.

44.     
The case quoted by the Plaintiff's counsel Barnes vs St. Helens Metropolitan B.C. [2006] EWCA Civ 1372 cannot be considered in relation to this case. In the said case reason for entertaining the application based on where the Court Registry failed to accept the claim documents when it was forwarded to the Clerk. In this matter writ of summons was filed only on 19th March 2011 which was after 12 days from the date of expiration of limitation period.

45.     
As I stated earlier in this Judgement, the limitation period ended on 8th March 2011 the new evidence of the proforma issued by the clerk of the Registry is dated 10/3/2008 and even this document is accepted the claim of the Plaintiff Applicant is time barred.

46.     
In the circumstances, Plaintiff Applicant cannot maintain the action filed and I agree with the Master's Ruling which extensively deal with the strike out principles. There is no necessity to consider other grounds pleaded by the Plaintiff Applicant since I concede the Action is time barred.

47.     
Accordingly, application for leave to appeal is dismissed and order the Plaintiff should pay summarily assessed costs of $1000 to the Defendant.

Delivered on 26th January, 2012
