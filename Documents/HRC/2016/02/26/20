<p>Agenda item 10

<p><b>Technical assistance and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Cambodia, Rhona Smith 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>Cambodia and its people have been served by special procedure mandate holders 
</p>
<p>since 1993. In September 2014, the Human Rights Council considered the final report of 
</p>
<p>the previous Special Rapporteur, Surya P. Subedi. The appointment of the present Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was made by the Council in March 2015 and came into effect on 1 May 2015. 
</p>
<p>An initial visit scheduled for May 2015 had to be postponed for logistical reasons and 
</p>
<p>cannot be rescheduled before the Council meets in September 2015. As the present report 
</p>
<p>was finalized on 8 June 2015, in order to meet the reporting schedule for the thirtieth 
</p>
<p>session of the Council, it reflects progress over the past year within the tenure of the former 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur only. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, the first to be submitted by the newly appointed Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, was prepared pursuant to Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 24/29. The Special Rapporteur was appointed in March 2015, 
</p>
<p>took up her appointment on 1 May 2015 and, owing to logistical difficulties, was unable to 
</p>
<p>undertake the scheduled initial visit before the present report was submitted. 
</p>
<p>2. The outgoing Special Rapporteur, Surya P. Subedi, undertook a visit to Cambodia 
</p>
<p>from 17 to 25 January 2015, during which he met with a wide range of stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including representatives of the Government, the opposition political parties, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and citizens. The details of his visit and his views thereon are contained in his 
</p>
<p>final press statement.1 
</p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, several periodic reports submitted by Cambodia were 
</p>
<p>considered by United Nations treaty bodies. The Human Rights Committee considered the 
</p>
<p>second periodic report of the country (CCPR/C/KHM/2) and issued its concluding 
</p>
<p>observations (CCPR/C/KHM/CO/2). The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered 
</p>
<p>the progress Cambodia had made in implementing the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and issued its 
</p>
<p>concluding observations thereon (CRC/C/OPAC/KHM/CO/1). It also considered the 
</p>
<p>progress Cambodia had made in implementing the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and 
</p>
<p>issued its concluding observations thereon (CRC/C/OPSC/KHM/CO/1). 
</p>
<p>4. The initial reports of Cambodia on the implementation of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance are due in 2015. The periodic reports of 
</p>
<p>Cambodia on the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination are overdue. In preparation for the third periodic report of Cambodia on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment, the Committee against Torture published its list of issues prior to 
</p>
<p>reporting (CAT/C/KHM/Q/3) and is awaiting the State&#8217;s response. 
</p>
<p>5. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of Their Families is the only one of the nine core human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties that Cambodia has signed but not yet ratified. However, during the second cycle of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review, Cambodia accepted recommendations to consider ratification 
</p>
<p>of that instrument.<footnote name="2">See A/HRC/26/16, paras. 118.<footnote name="6">See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15907&amp;LangID=E. </footnote>-118.8. </footnote> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Communications  
</b></p>
<p>6. With respect to individual communication procedures, Cambodia has ratified the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women. However, no communications were received under that procedure during 
</p>
<p>the reporting period.

</p>

<p>7. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, during the reporting period, the former Special Rapporteur addressed a number of 
</p>
<p>communications to the Government on the following cases of concern. 
</p>
<p>8. On 22 August 2014, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Cambodia was joined by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
</p>
<p>right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
</p>
<p>context, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders in sending a letter of allegation to the Government of 
</p>
<p>Cambodia. The letter drew attention to the land appropriation, denial of justice, judicial 
</p>
<p>harassment, intimidation and frequent attacks on residents of Lor Peang and Boeung Kak 
</p>
<p>villages in Ta Ches commune. Over 400 hectares issued on title to local company KDC 
</p>
<p>International in 2007 allegedly overlap or encroach on some 200 hectares of villagers&#8217; land. 
</p>
<p>On 23 June 2014, 22 families filed a complaint with the Phnom Penh Municipal Court 
</p>
<p>claiming they were threatened or harassed into accepting inadequate compensation. In early 
</p>
<p>July 2014, KDC International began constructing a concrete wall around the contested land. 
</p>
<p>In August, a group of community members marched to Phnom Penh to protest the arrest of 
</p>
<p>two other community members, and were allegedly dispersed violently by 300 to 400 
</p>
<p>police officers armed with shields, electric clubs and wooden sticks. The allegation letter 
</p>
<p>drew attention to a previous joint allegation letter sent in 2011 by the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in Cambodia, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights defenders.<footnote name="3">See A/HRC/18/51, p. 42 (case no. KHM 1/2011). </footnote> That previous letter outlined defamation concerns, 
</p>
<p>and the current letter expressed regret that no response had been received.  
</p>
<p>9. On 30 April 2015, a joint letter of allegation was sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in Cambodia and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
</p>
<p>as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination in this context. The letter concerned the Bunong indigenous community and 
</p>
<p>addressed the appropriation of land and denial of access to justice and the right to titling of 
</p>
<p>communal land. The Binh Phuoc Rubber Company had been issued an economic land 
</p>
<p>concession in October 2011 that covered land occupied by Bunong indigenous families. 
</p>
<p>Approximately 211 families, or about 1,000 people, including children, were affected. 
</p>
<p>Community members claimed they had not been consulted prior to the issuance of the 
</p>
<p>economic land concession, in spite of legal requirements to do so. In early December 2014, 
</p>
<p>representatives of the company allegedly bulldozed property that the families used for 
</p>
<p>agricultural activities and seasonal residence. At the end of March 2015, armed police 
</p>
<p>allegedly accompanied representatives of the company who bulldozed forest land, 
</p>
<p>community farm land and roughly 170 temporary residential structures used seasonally by 
</p>
<p>community members. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern about ensuring that 
</p>
<p>claims contesting ownership to the land received fair assessment by an appropriate court or 
</p>
<p>dispute resolution mechanism, and asked that until such assessment was conducted, any 
</p>
<p>further clearing or development be suspended. 
</p>
<p>10. No response to either of the allegation letters was received from the Government of 
</p>
<p>Cambodia during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>11. With respect to the pending law on associations and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association reiterated his call to the Government to include civil society in the drafting 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>process.4 The heads of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality 
</p>
<p>and the Empowerment of Women and the United Nations Population Fund in Cambodia 
</p>
<p>also wrote an opinion piece encouraging further consultation and debate on this law in May 
</p>
<p>2015.<footnote name="5">See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15996&amp;LangID=E.
