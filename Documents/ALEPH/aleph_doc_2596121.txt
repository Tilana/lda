Commenting on the results, EVRAZ Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Frolov, said:
"Overall, the first half of 2016 can be divided into two distinct parts for EVRAZ and the sector. In the first quarter conditions
were largely unchanged from the end of 2015, but in the second quarter, steel market conditions improved, and the Group
demonstrated a stronger performance, largely due to a supportive pricing environment in its main markets.
In regards to health and safety, EVRAZ continues its efforts to improve injury reporting transparency and prevent fatalities.
Throughout its work, the Group remains committed to its ultimate goal of reaching zero fatalities at all sites.
Structural overcapacity remains a challenge for the steel industry and EVRAZ continues to pursue its cost-cutting
initiatives.  These initiatives resulted in an incremental contribution of US$138 million to EBITDA in H1 2016.
EVRAZ remains focused on net debt reduction and refinancing. The Group has extended the overall duration of its debt
and will comfortably cover maturities in 2016 and 2017 using a combination of currently available liquidity and future free
cash flow generation.
Given the higher prices and stronger domestic demand in the second quarter, EVRAZ' outlook for the rest of the year is
cautiously optimistic."

UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic goals IN 2016
EVRAZ remains committed to its strategy of being a leader in infrastructure steel products globally and in the Russian
coking coal market. The strategy focuses on five success factors: Health, Safety & Environment, Human Capital, Customer
Focus, Asset Development and EVRAZ Business System.
HEALTH, SAFETY & ENVIRONMENT
The safety of employees is and always will be EVRAZ' first priority. The Group's strategic goal is to achieve and maintain a
lost-time injury frequency ratio (LTIFR) of less than one. In this Period, initiatives focused on providing additional safety
training, continuing the equipment electricity isolation programme and initiating a system to detect and manage critical
risks. The LTIFR was 2.48x in H1 2016, compared with 1.94x in H1 2015, due to increased reporting transparency.
Tragically, there were four fatal accidents at facilities in the Period. Throughout its work, EVRAZ remains committed to its
ultimate goal of reaching zero fatalities at all sites.
HUMAN CAPITAL
EVRAZ prioritises the development of its people, providing a competitive salary linked to productivity, and the long-term
target is to involve 80% of the workforce in development programmes. For the Period, efforts focused mainly on the "From
Foreman to Managing Director" programme, which aims to evaluate and develop operations management to create a
management candidate pool at plants. In response to market conditions, the Group has undertaken a headcount reduction
programme and streamlined administrative functions. Overall, the workforce decreased from 84,467 people on 31
December 2015 to 79,106 on 30 June 2016, down 6%, reflecting the general and administrative cost reduction programme,
efficiency improvements and asset optimisation.
CUSTOMER FOCUS
Customer-focused sales and product development policy are the key to sustaining domestic market leadership and
expanding EVRAZ international presence with value-added products. In the local market, the Group makes great effort to
provide flexible shipment terms and additional services and develop long-term relationships with clients. Despite the
Russian steel market contracting by 2% in H1 2016 compared with H1 2015 and intense competition in long steel
products, EVRAZ was able to sustain its strong positions, with market share of 16% for rebar, 65% for beams and 27% for
railway wheels. The market share for rails declined to 77%, as a competitor ramped up a mill during the Period. In
overseas sales development, EVRAZ received certifications for rebar to enter the European market, expanded its product
mix to increase sales to the US, certified new types of wheels to serve Czech Railways, started the production of wheelsets
with Slovenia's SZ-VIT and increased high-speed premium rail exports. As a result, the Group increased overseas
(excluding CIS) exports of railway products to 34 thousand tonnes, up 16% year-on-year. Construction steel product
exports showed a slight decline, of 4%, to 414 thousand tonnes. Altogether, customer focus initiatives generated additional
EBITDA of US$46 million during the Period.
ASSET DEVELOPMENT
EVRAZ encourages asset development through a cost improvement programme and selective investment projects. Its
efficiency programme generated US$138 million of additional EBITDA during the Period, through yield improvements,
supply chain management and general and administrative expense reductions, as well as numerous projects to optimise
operations. The investment project pipeline focused mainly on the North American large-diameter pipe (LDP) business,
where the Group is enhancing its steelmaking abilities, building a new LDP rolling mill and improving its coating abilities.
EVRAZ invested US$77 million in development CAPEX in H1 2016 and expects to spend another US$60 million in H2
2016.
EVRAZ BUSINESS SYSTEM
The EVRAZ Business System, is a fundamental part of corporate strategy and incorporates the business principles and
tools of the 'lean' management philosophy to manage change and create a culture of continuous improvement within the
Group. This year, EVRAZ continues to develop the system and focus efforts on the Siberia division, where maintenance
and inventory management projects are being piloted.
Market outlook
Global markets
Global steel producers experienced positive pricing sentiment during the first six months of the year. Steel prices, based on
HRC (hot-rolled coil) FOB China contracts, surged by 53% from the beginning of the year to a peak of US$430/t in April
and then retreated by 18% to US$352/t in June. The rally was driven by a combination of Chinese government investment
stimulus, low inventory levels and speculative activity on futures markets. However, the average price was US$351/t in H1
2016, down 7% compared to H1 2015
Chinese steel export volumes remained high at 57.3 million tonnes in H1 2016, up 9% from 52.4 million tonnes in H1 2015.
This created pressure for European and North American domestic steel producers, leading Western governments to
launch trade investigations and introduce protectionary measures against several countries regarding HRC, rebar, plate
and tubular products.
Iron ore prices were mostly in line with the positive dynamics of steel, especially in Q2 2016, when the CFR China 62%
iron ore price peaked at US$70/t in April. However, despite iron ore price volatility during the Period, prices averaged
US$51/t in H1 2016, down 16% compared with US$61/t in H1 2015. The seaborne market remains oversupplied, with
major iron ore producers likely to supply 60 million tonnes of incremental capacity in 2016. Chinese iron ore imports
amounted to 494 million tonnes in H1 2016, up 9% from 453 million tonnes in H1 2015, due to stable steel demand and
domestic iron ore capacity closures.
The coking coal market was also driven by the changing sentiment in global steel markets, as well as a temporary deficit of
high-grade coking coal on seaborne routes, which led to a price recovery. Based on spot FOB Australia contracts, the hard
coking coal price reached US$100/t at the end of April. The price averaged US$86/t in H1 2016, compared with US$98/t in
H1 2015. Chinese coking coal imports increased by 25% to 27 million tonnes in the Period, while India imported 22 million
tonnes, up 3% from 21 million tonnes in H1 2015. Given the promising forecasts for the development of the Indian steel
industry, EVRAZ believes that this may support coking coal prices in the long term, even with moderate imports in China.
On the supply side, Australian and Russian projects coming online are expected to partly replace volumes from high-cost
and financially leveraged producers in North America and China.
Global vanadium demand was estimated at around 42.3 kmtV in H1 2016, down 2% compared with 43.2 kmtV in H1 2015.
Despite a slight recovery in demand since March, primarily driven by Chinese steel producers, overall consumption fell
amid delayed demand in the EU and US. The average LMB FeV price was US$16.52 per kgV in H1 2016, 23% lower than
US$21.52 per kgV in H1 2015.
Russian Steel
Russian steel consumption fell by 2% to 16.9 million tonnes in H1 2016, primarily due to reduced demand for long and
tubular products. In particular, demand decreased by 14% for rebar and 3% for angles and channels, although
consumption of beams improved by 16%. Meanwhile, rail consumption increased to 525 thousand tonnes in H1 2016, up
34% from 391 thousand tonnes in H1 2015, driven by higher demand from Russian Railways. Demand for flat products
was strong, rising by 5% to 4.4 million tonnes in H1 2016.
With domestic consumption stifled, Russian export volumes increased slightly to 14.5 million tonnes in H1 2016. Rouble
weakness in the Period also made Russian export sales more attractive. Domestic crude steel production remained mostly
unchanged at 35.3 million tonnes in H1 2016.
Russian steel prices were influenced by the dynamics of the global steel market and local currency fluctuations. During the
Period, the CPT Moscow rebar price surged by 130%, from US$230/t in January to US$529/t in May, but settled back to
US$460/t in June. The CPT Moscow rebar price averaged US$360/t in H1 2016, down 9% compared with H1 2015. The
price for channels decreased to US$365/t in H1 2016, down 22% from US$467/t in H1 2015. Based on CPT Moscow,
HRC averaged US$376/t, down 12% from US$427/t in H1 2015, and plates averaged US$384/t, down 18% from US$467/t
in H1 2015.
ukraine
Relative stability in Ukraine led to internal steel consumption growth of 40% to 1.8 million tonnes in H1 2016, from 1.3
million tonnes in H1 2015. However, this was from an extremely low level in 2015 reflecting the economic and political
instability. Export volumes increased to 9.0 million tonnes, up 3%, due to favourable export conditions such as a surge in
prices and the hryvnia devaluation. Ukrainian crude steel production rose by 10% to 12.4 million tonnes in H1 2016, from
11.6 million tonnes in H1 2015.
North America
US steel product consumption totalled 48.9 million tonnes in H1 2016, down 8% from 53.5 million tonnes in H1 2015.
Demand fell by 3% for long products, 2% for flat products and 45% for tubular products. While LDP demand was fairly
strong during the Period, the fundamentals of the rail market were less positive, given moderate CAPEX of the Class-I
railroads due to lower traffic and a surplus inventory of rails in the system. North America consumed 586 thousand tonnes
of rails in H1 2016, 19% lower than during H1 2015. Demand for wire rod and plate was steady, although the OCTG market
remained weak given the lower oil prices.
Steel product imports, which impacted the North American steel industry in 2015, dropped to 13.6 million tonnes in H1
2016, down 29% year-on-year, amid anti-dumping duties and pending trade cases against certain producers. US steel
production decreased slightly to 40 million tonnes in H1 2016 due to the temporary idling of certain steel mills.
Amid lower imports and idled domestic capacity, North American local steel prices rose in H1 2016, although the averages
were still lower than a year before. Between January and June 2016, the AMM Chicago shredded scrap index and the
CRU Midwest plate index both jumped by around 40%. Nevertheless, overall average index prices in H1 2016, declined
by 11% to US$604/t for flat products, 30% for OCTG and 16% for rebar when compared to the same period in 2015.
Coal
Russian coking coal concentrate consumption remained largely unchanged at 19.2 million tonnes in H1 2016, compared
with 19.3 million tonnes in H1 2015. Exports rose by 10% to 10.0 million tonnes in H1 2016, from 9.1 million tonnes in H1
2015, as increased shipments to Ukraine, Japan and South Korea replaced sales to China.
Overall Russian coking coal mining volumes were stable at 36.4 million tonnes. The high-vol coking coal segment faced a
temporary supply deficit due to an accident at Vorkutaugol's Severnaya mine and several longwall moves by local
producers.
In H1 2016, local coking coal prices rose, driven by global benchmark trends, although they were still lower than in H1
2015. Premium coking coal (Zh grade) decreased to US$73/t FCA Kuzbass, down 21% from US$93/t in H1 2015. Semi-
hard coking coal (GZh grade) averaged US$57/t, down 9% year-on-year.
2016 YEAR-END OUTLOOK
EVRAZ expects its results to be affected by the positive dynamics in the global steel markets.
While the Group does not anticipate significant improvements in Russian steel demand in H2 2016 due to moderate
investment activity and economic environment, it anticipates that current steel prices will gradually increase to the average
seen in 2015. In H2 2016, the North American segment will likely experience headwinds from large volumes of dumped
and subsidized large diameter pipe imports into Canada, which will extend onto 2017 - 2018 should no trade remedies be
put into place against unfairly traded LD pipe from China and Japan this October. In addition, results may be negatively
impacted by delays in approvals of key large pipeline projects in the US and Canada and continuing weak demand for
rails. In H2 2016, EVRAZ expects coking coal concentrate prices to be supported by stable demand on the domestic
market and key export destinations, as well as the temporary high-vol grades coal deficit.
The Group continues to pursue customer focus and cost-cutting initiatives. As a result, EVRAZ expects positive free cash
flow and progress towards reducing net debt in absolute terms by the year-end.
Financial review
Statement of operations
EVRAZ consolidated revenues decreased by 27.6% to US$3,543 million in H1 2016, compared with US$4,894 million in
H1 2015, primarily due to lower prices and depressed demand in the Period.
In H1 2016, revenues from the Steel segment (including intersegment) decreased, amounting to 60.8% of the Group total
revenue before elimination. The fall was mainly attributable to lower revenues from sales of steel products, which declined
by 29.5% year-on-year, largely due to a drop in average sales prices (down 23.7%). Revenues from sales of steel products
were also impacted by changes in the Group's sales volumes, which declined from 6.6 million tonnes in H1 2015 to 6.2
million tonnes in H1 2016. This was due to the worsening conditions on global steel markets, capital repairs on blast
furnace #1 at EVRAZ ZSMK and the deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium.
Revenues from the Steel, North America segment fell by 33.4% year-on-year in H1 2016. Revenues from sales of steel
products dropped by 33.6%, driven by lower sales volumes (down 19.7%), declining prices (down 13.9%). The key drivers
of these were, in turn, significant reductions in EVRAZ North America's sales of oil country tubular goods (OCTG) and rails
resulting from subdued energy exploration activity, a decrease in Class-1 railroad maintenance spending and higher
inventories at distributors.
Revenues from the Coal segment remained broadly unchanged year-on-year in H1 2016 with increased volumes partly
offset by lower sales prices. Sales volumes reflected greater production due to the productivity improvement and
favourable market conditions.
In H1 2016, the Steel segment's EBITDA declined due to negative steel price trends globally and a decrease in sales
volumes amid depressed demand. This was partly offset by lower expenses in US dollar terms due to rouble depreciation
in H1 2016 vs H1 2015, the effects of cost-cutting initiatives implemented in H1 2016 as part of ongoing productivity
improvements program and lower prices for raw materials (coking coal, scrap, iron ore).
The Steel, North America segment's EBITDA was impacted by lower sales volumes and prices stemming from a downturn
in the OCTG and rail markets.
The Coal segment's EBITDA increased due to the positive impact of rouble devaluation in H1 2016 vs H1 2015 on the cost
base and effects of cost-cutting initiatives. The negative trend in sales prices was offset by higher sales volumes.
The "Eliminations" line in the EBITDA table below mostly reflects unrealised profits or losses that relate to the inventories
on the balance sheet of the Steel, North America segment produced by the Steel segment.

*In 2015, the management changed the definition of segment expenses and EBITDA to make these indicators more
comparable with Russian steel peers. Segment expenses and EBITDA have now been adjusted to exclude social and
social infrastructure maintenance expenses. As a result, the Group restated EBITDA for both financial reporting and
management accountings  purposes for the six months ended 30 June 2015. The effect is to increase segment EBITDA by
$10m to $932m, comprising an increase of $9m in Steel and $1m in Coal.

Total
Selling and distribution expenses decreased by 21.4% in H1 2016, mostly due to lower third-party sales volumes (down
9.9%) and the local currencies depreciation (down 7.6%). Another factor was the deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and
Vanadium Limited following the loss of control.
General and administrative expenses declined by 25.1% in H1 2016. This reflected the reduced staff costs following the
weakening of the local currencies (down 11.3%), accompanied by headcount optimisation at EVRAZ North America, the
Russian steel mills and the coal companies (down 6.9%) and deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited.
The impairment charge in the Period included a US$16 million impairment relating to EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. and a US$19
million reversal of the impairment at EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli as result of the further testing.
In H1 2016, foreign exchange gains rose, as the rouble regained ground. Russian subsidiaries have US dollar-
denominated bank loans. In addition, there are some intra-group debts between subsidiaries with different functional
currencies and, consequently, gains (or losses) of one subsidiary recognised in the Statement of Operations are not offset
by the exchange differences of another subsidiary with a different functional currency.
Interest expenses incurred by the Group increased, as debt was refinanced at higher interest rates, including issuing
rouble bonds that bear higher coupons, than dollar denominated debt. Interest expenses for bank loans, bonds and notes
amounted to US$222 million in H1 2016, compared with US$209 million in H1 2015.
The share of losses of joint ventures and associates amounted to US$22 million in H1 2016 and US$28 million in H1
2015. This is predominantly related to the impairment of investments in Timir. Please refer to Note 7 of the financial

Losses on financial assets and liabilities amounted to US$10 million and included, among other things, US$274 million of
unrealised gains and US$250 million of realised losses on changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as
hedging instrument, namely cross-currency swaps for rouble-denominated bonds. This effect was offset by a US$41
million loss on repaying debt, which is primarily a premium on repurchasing US dollar denominated bonds.
In the Period, the Group's income tax expense fell to US$41 million, compared with US$101 million in H1 2015, as a result
of the lower operational results.

saving from 0.75% to 1.1%.
Construction of a new mill at EVRAZ Regina has been in progress since Q2 2015 and is due to be
completed in Q3 2016. Expected to add 150kt of tubular product capacity.
Mezhegey (phase 1) was launched in Q2 2016. Capacity of 1.5 mtpa.
The Sheregesh mine's output is due to reach 4.8 mtpa of raw ore.
Construction of a new grinding ball mill at EVRAZ NTMK has been in progress since Q2 2015 and
is due to be completed in Q2 2018. Expected to increase ball production to 300kt by 2018.
Financing and liquidity
At the beginning of 2016, total debt was US$6,724 million. The Group continued to focus its efforts on reducing debt and
extending its maturity profile.
In January and February 2016, EVRAZ prepaid certain bilateral facilities with a total principal of around US$130 million. In
April, EVRAZ prepaid €60 million of the outstanding principal under its credit facility with Gazprombank. In May, EVRAZ
prepaid c.US$21 million of the total principal of its US$125 million facility with UniCredit. Also in May, EVRAZ prepaid
c.US$80 million of its US$500 million syndicated pre-export financing facility.
In H1 2016, EVRAZ partly repurchased US$744 million in principal of its 2017 and 2018 Eurobonds in the market during
two tender offers. The total cash outflow amounted to US$779 million.
In May and June 2016, EVRAZ repaid the 8.40% rouble notes due and settled the liabilities under the related swap
contracts. The total cash outflow amounted to US$430 million.
In March, EvrazHolding Finance LLC issued RUB15 billion (around US$221 million at the exchange rate on the
transaction date) in five-year exchange-traded bonds due in 2021 with a 12.60% coupon payable semi-annually. The
proceeds from the issue were used to refinance EVRAZ' existing debt, thus not increasing overall debt.
In April, EVRAZ entered into a multi-currency facility agreement with VTB Bank governing the general terms and
conditions of loans of up to seven years with a total borrowing limit of US$300 million equivalent. US$150 million was
utilised under the facility in the form of a loan repayable in 12 equal quarterly instalments starting April 2020. The loan was
used to refinance EVRAZ' existing debt.
In June, Evraz Group S.A. issued a US$500 million Eurobond due in 2022 with a 6.75% coupon payable semi-annually.
The proceeds from the issue were used to fund the tender offer for the Eurobonds due in 2017 and 2018, and part was
reserved to finance the redemption at make whole of the outstanding Evraz Group S.A. Eurobonds due in 2017.
As a result of these actions, as well as scheduled repayments of bank loans, total debt in H1 2016 decreased by
US$540 million to US$6,184 million as at 30 June 2016, while net debt decreased by US$33 million to US$5,316 million,
compared with US$5,349 million as at 31 December 2015. Interest expenses accrued in respect of loans, bonds and notes
amounted to US$222 million in H1 2016, compared with US$209 million in H1 2015. However, due to the fall in EBITDA,
net debt to LTM EBITDA reached 4.9 times, compared with 3.7 times as at 31 December 2015.
As at 30 June 2016, debt with financial maintenance covenants comprised a syndicated pre-export financing facility and
various bilateral facilities with a total outstanding principal of around US$1,829 million. The maintenance covenants under
these facilities include the two key ratios calculated on the basis of EVRAZ plc's consolidated financials: a maximum net
leverage and a minimum EBITDA interest cover. In H1 2016, EVRAZ signed amendments to these facilities, whereby the
testing of financial ratios was suspended for three semi-annual testing periods starting H1 2016, subject to compliance with
certain additional restrictions on indebtedness and dividends. As a result, currently only one of the outstanding facilities
has the minimum EBITDA interest cover ratio tested against a comfortable level of 1.5x.
As at 30 June 2016, EVRAZ had the only one facility, with a total outstanding principal of US$83 million, that contained
maintenance financial covenants tested on the financial statements of Evraz Group S.A. The maintenance covenants
under this facility include a maximum net leverage tested on a bi-annual basis.
As at 30 June 2016, EVRAZ was in full compliance with its financial covenants.
As at 30 June 2016, cash amounted to US$868 million and short-term loans and the current portion of long-term loans
stood at US$546 million.
Cash-on-hand and committed credit facilities are sufficient to cover all of EVRAZ refinancing requirements for the
remainder of 2016 and 2017.
key recent developments
·     In August 2016, Evraz Group S.A. called its remaining 2017 Eurobonds by exercising a make whole call. The total cash
used in this transaction amounted to US$188 million.
·     In July and August, Evraz Group S.A. repurchased through open market operations and cancelled US$9 million in
aggregate principal of 6.75% notes due in 2018 and US$12 million in aggregate principal of 9.50% notes due in 2018. The
total cash used in these transactions amounted to US$23 million.
·     In August 2016, the Group has signed new loans with Gazprombank with amounts of approximately RUB18 billion and
€180 million. This loan is designed to refinance the existing credit facility with this bank. Upon completion of refinancing
maturities of the facility with Gazprombank in a split of 30% to 70% will shift to 2021 and 2022, respectively.

The Steel segment's revenues, including intersegment sales decreased, mainly due to lower revenues from sales of steel
products. The main drivers were lower average prices (down 23.7%) and sales volumes (down 5.8%).
Revenues from external sales of semi-finished products fell by 36.6% due to lower average prices (down 29.0%) and sales
volumes (down 7.6%). Lower slab volumes, mainly to the European and American markets, were partly offset by increased
billet shipments to Africa.
Revenues from sales of construction products to third parties dropped due to lower average prices (down 17.8%), reduced
volumes (down 5.5%) mainly due to weaker demand in the CIS (including Russia). Given the latter, prices did not increase
following the rouble's devaluation versus the US dollar in H1 2016.
Revenues from external sales of railway products decreased due to lower average prices (down 17.8%), partly offset by
higher sales volumes (up 4.7%). Sales volumes slightly increased in Russia, driven by purchases from Russian Railways,
while sales volumes to Asia, CIS and Americas were also higher.
External revenues of flat-rolled products dropped. This was mostly due to lower sales volumes (down 27.4%) and average
prices (down 18.0%) following the deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium.
Revenues from external steel product sales in Russia decreased by 19.5% compared with H1 2015, mainly due to lower
prices, while sales volumes fell slightly by 0.3%. However, the share of Russian sales in external steel product sales
increased from 44.7% in H1 2015 to 50.3% in H1 2016, mainly due to a shift from Europe and North America to the
domestic market.
Steel segment revenues from sales of iron ore products including intersegment sales fell by 18.8% due to lower average
iron ore prices (down 20.5%),  deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium and lower sales to CIS and European
markets, partially offset by higher sales volume (up 1.7%). Prices for iron ore products declined in H1 2016 in line with
global benchmarks. In the Period, around 68.9% of EVRAZ's iron ore consumed in steelmaking came from own operations,
compared with 65.5% in H1 2015, predominantly due to a 6.3% increase in iron ore production.
Steel segment revenues sales of vanadium products including intersegment sales declined by 32.8%. This was due to a
decrease in average prices (down 36.2%) partly offset by higher sales volumes (up 3.4%).

The Steel segment's cost of revenue decreased by 25.0% year-on-year. The main reasons for the decline were as follows:
•      The cost of raw materials fell by 23.9%, primarily due to a decline in prices, as well as lower consumption of materials
due to lower steel production volumes. The decline in raw material costs was also attributable to the deconsolidation of
Highveld Steel and Vanadium and cost-cutting initiatives, which reduced consumption.
•      Auxiliary material costs decreased by 22.8%, primarily due to the rouble's weakness and deconsolidation of Highveld
Steel and Vanadium (down US$10 million).
•      Lower service costs were driven by the deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium (down US$38 million), as
well as the weakness of the rouble and hryvnia.
•      Transportation costs decreased primarily due to the rouble's weakness and lower sales volumes.
•      Staff costs fell by 29.5%, largely due to the rouble and hryvnia weakness and headcount optimisation. An additional
contributor was the deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium.
•      Depreciation and depletion costs dropped, driven mainly by local currency depreciation and the deconsolidation of
Highveld Steel and Vanadium. The decline was partly offset by an increase in depreciation costs due to the
commissioning of crusher and conveyor mining at EVRAZ ZSMK in Q4 2015.
•      Lower energy costs were driven by the rouble and hryvnia devaluation, as well as the deconsolidation of Highveld
Steel and Vanadium (down US$26 million). Lower energy costs were partly offset by an increase in tariffs in local
currencies.
•      Other costs increased primarily due to changes in intrasegment URP, which reflects intragroup sale price dynamics
amid external price trends. This was partly offset by the cost of goods for resale and a decrease in allowances for
inventories.
Steel segment gross profit
The Steel segment's gross profit decreased by 41.1% year-on-year in H1 2016, driven primarily by lower revenues from
sales of steel products.
Operational update
Steel: Russia
EVRAZ ZSMK
·     EVRAZ ZSMK increased the guarantee on its head-hardened rails by 1.5 times to 700 million tonnes gross. The new
guarantee is double any other in the world. This will reduce infrastructure servicing costs for buyers.
·     In March 2016, the 60E1 rails were certified according to India's IRS standard, allowing the first shipment of 6,500
tonnes to be made in April-May.
·     In March 2016, a new type of rail section, 50E6, was launched and successful welding tests were conducted. The aim
is to expand rail export sales in Taiwan. The first shipment of 1,000 tonnes was delivered in July.
·     In May 2016, Deutsche Bahn conducted an audit on EVRAZ ZSMK's quality management system (HPQ).
·     The first delivery of DIN rebar was made to Germany (3,500 tonnes), where margins for that product are higher than in
Asia.
·     EVRAZ ZSMK increased its coke sales to around 85,000 tonnes in H1 2016, up 29% year-on-year.
·     In May, EVRAZ ZSMK conducted upgrade work on blast furnace #1 ahead of the beginning of the construction season
in Russia. The work was completed ahead of schedule and was planned for May due to the cold winter in the region where
the plant is located.
EVRAZ NTMK
·     In January, a new W21 beam was launched to boost sales in Europe and America.
·     In April, together with Slovenia's SZ-VIT, EVRAZ NTMK launched a new type of rolled transport product: wheelsets
aimed at increasing sales of various wheels (BA314 and others).
·     In May 2016, a new beam, a Н-bearing pile (305х305), was launched for the Hong Kong market, and the first delivery,
of 3,000 tonnes, was made in July 2016.
·     In July 2016, a new project to build blast furnace #7 was launched. Up to US$170 million will be invested in the project,
most of which in 2017-18.
Steel: Ukraine
EVRAZ DMZ
·     Numerous initiatives to increase pig iron production were successfully completed.
·     EVRAZ DMZ continued to implement numerous initiatives aimed at reducing water consumption and discharge as well
as air emissions from the BOF shop.
·     Commercial production of four new steel profiles was launched.
·     In H1 2016, EVRAZ DMZ sold 466,000 tonnes of steel products (57% of which was billets, and 35% construction and
structural steel), compared with 462,000 tonnes in H1 2015.
Steel: Kazakhstan
EVRAZ Caspian Steel
In H1 2016, EVRAZ Caspian Steel reduced production costs for finished steel products (by around 2%) and improved
productivity (by around 10%), bringing the indicators closer to the targets.
Steel: Italy
EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli
In H1 2016, a rolling mill was relaunched after production was suspended in August 2013. Output in the Period amounted
to 8 thousand tonnes of flat products.
Iron ore
Operations at the core iron ore business in Russia, EVRAZ KGOK, were stable in H1 2016. The facility mined 30.3 million
tonnes of iron ore (up 1.1 million tonnes compared with H1 2015) and produced 5.0 million tonnes of saleable iron ore
products (down 36,000 tonnes), including 1.7 million tonnes of sinter and 3.3 million tonnes of pellets.
Evrazruda produced 2.2 million tonnes of concentrate in H1 2016 (up 574,000 tonnes compared with H1 2015) from 2.6
million tonnes of self preconcentrate and 0.5 million tonnes of third-party preconcentrate (from Ruda Hakasii). The third-
party preconcentrate was bought to maximise the utilisation of the enrichment facility.
In H1 2016, EVRAZ Sukha Balka in Ukraine produced 1.4 million tonnes of lumpy ore, selling 61% domestically and 39%
abroad. Work was conducted on the dry magnetic separation facilities to improve iron ore quality.
Vanadium
The pulp filtration area at EVRAZ Vanady Tula was fully upgraded, resulting in cost savings and securing better yields at
the mill. Together with an equipment upgrade, this substitution increased recovery rates by around 3% year-on-year. FeV
80 production increased by around 15% year-on-year.
Oxide production at EVRAZ Stratcor was mothballed due to the high cost of own oxide production. This allows the focus to

EVRAZ Nikom boosted FeV production by around 6% year-on-year by increasing the number of heats per month.
EVRAZ NTMK finished the construction of slag crushing and milling equipment. Testing is to be completed in Q3 2016.
The new equipment will enable slag of fraction -0.16 mm or -50 mm to be supplied to customers. This will save money for
transportation and third-party conversion.

The segment's revenues from steel product sales decreased, driven by lower sales volumes (down 19.7%) and average
sales prices (down 13.9%).
Revenues from tubular product sales decreased by 34.3%, primarily due to lower sales volumes (down 22.2%) and
average prices (down 12.1%). The decrease in sales volumes was driven by weaker OCTG demand, caused by a
slowdown in drilling activities due to the falling oil price.
Railway product revenues declined by 45.8%, driven by a decline of 34.3% in volumes and 11.5% in average prices. The
rail market fundamentals were less positive, given moderate CAPEX of the Class-I railroads due to lower traffic and a
surplus inventory of rails.
Flat-rolled product revenues fell, mainly due to lower average prices (down 12.0%) and sales volumes (down 4.2%).
Revenues from sales of construction products fell due to lower sales volumes (down 17.9%) and average prices (down
20.7%).

* Includes primarily allowances for inventories, goods for resale, certain taxes and transportation
Cost of revenue decreased by 35.2% year-on-year in H1 2016. The main drivers were as follows:
•      Raw material costs decreased by 44.9%, primarily due to lower consumption of raw materials (scrap, coke, ferroalloys
and other). The main reasons for this were lower volumes of crude steel and finished products (primarily tubular products
and rails), cost-cutting initiatives that reduced consumption and declining raw material prices.
•      Costs of semi-finished products fell by 44.6%, primarily due to a decline in prices for purchased slab and decrease in
consumption of coils resulting from lower tubular production volumes.
•      Auxiliary materials dropped by 23.5%, as a cost-cutting plan was implemented and production volumes of crude steel
and finished products dropped year-on-year.
•      Service costs declined by 13.9%, as production volumes fell year-on-year in H1 2016.
•      Energy costs decreased, driven by lower production volumes and energy consumption.
Steel, North America segment gross profit
The segment's gross profit decreased by 21.8% year-on-year in H1 2016, primarily due to lower sales volumes amid a
downturn on the tubular and rail markets.
Operational update
In H1 2016, end markets for our products exhibited mixed results, with robust demand for wire rod, steady demand for LDP
and plate, continued weakness in the OCTG segment and a lacklustre performance in the rail business. Overall,
commodity prices staged a recovery, underpinned by favourable rulings on trade cases and low inventories in the
distribution channel. Between January and June 2016, the AMM Chicago shredded scrap index and the CRU Midwest
plate index both surged by around 40%.
In H1 2016, output of finished saleable steel products and raw steel at EVRAZ's North American operations declined by
18% and 19% year-on-year respectively. Steel production was adjusted downwards to match lower demand through a
combination of maintenance outages and production curtailments at the Regina and Pueblo steelmaking facilities.
Additionally, during Q1 2016, we executed fixed cost reduction initiatives that we estimate will produce around US$26
million in savings during 2016.
During H1 2016, Class-1 railroad maintenance spending retrenched from the record levels seen in 2015. Together with the
high rail inventories, this resulted in lower overall demand. The Pueblo rail mill utilisation during the period declined to
around 67%, compared with full utilisation in H1 2015.
Regarding tubular products, LDP production increased by 16%, partly offsetting declines of 77% for OCTG, 38% for small-
diameter line pipe (SDP) and 88% for seamless pipe.
Delays by customers in obtaining regulatory approvals for their pipeline projects translated into lower than expected LDP
demand during the period. On June 22, the Canada Border Service Agency announced preliminary duties of 127% against
LDP from China and of 20% to 97% against LDP from Japan.
OCTG, SDP, and seamless pipe continued to be challenged during the period by subdued energy exploration activity and
high inventories at distributors. Production at the Canadian OCTG facilities was down 77% year-on-year. The EVRAZ
Pueblo seamless mill was idled in March 2016, resulting in a decline in seamless pipe production of 88% year-on-year. In
Canada,  distributor inventories of some OCTG products appear to be sufficiently depleted and together with stabilizing rig
counts stabilising indicate better fundamentals for the second half of the year.
Flat-rolled product saleable volumes are in line with the same period last year, despite a planned outage of around 20
days at the Portland, Oregon plate mill to complete repairs to the re-heat furnace lining. In contrast to H1 2015, the flat
division was materially accretive to EBITDA in H1 2016, as the benefits of higher plate prices and low relief values of slab
in inventory improved metal spreads. During April, the US Department of Commerce initiated investigations on dumping
and subsidisation of Carbon and Alloy Steel Cut-To-Length Plate from numerous countries.
In H2 2016, EVRAZ North America will continue responding to market conditions through aggressive cost structure
management and  optimising inventory. Additionally, it will continue working on  ramping up the new LDP mill, and on the
steelmaking and rolling mill upgrades in Regina.

Overall revenues in the segment increased slightly in H1 2016, despite lower sales prices, due to the recovery of global
demand supported by a temporary domestic supply deficit following the accident at Vorkutaugol's Severnaya mine. Sales
volumes increased due to the productivity improvement and favourable market conditions in H1 2016 compared with H1
2015.
Internal sales of coal products decreased due to lower average prices (down 4.3%) and sales volumes (down 0.3%).
External sales of coal products increased, mainly due to higher sales volumes (up 15.1%), partly offset by lower average
prices (down 11.8%).
In H1 2016, the Coal segment's sales to the Steel segment amounted to US$201 million, or 36.9% of sales, compared with
US$210 million and 38.8% of sales in H1 2015.
During the Period, around 49.5% of the coking coal consumed by EVRAZ's steelmaking operations came from own
operations, compared with 46.2% in H1 2015.

The main drivers of the year-on-year decrease in the segment's cost of revenues were as follows.
·     The cost of auxiliary materials and services was almost flat year-on-year in H1 2016 in US dollar terms. The positive
effect of the rouble weakness (down US$13 million), as well as the effect of cost-cutting initiatives, was offset by higher
consumption of auxiliary materials due to an increase in volumes.
·     Transportation costs declined due to the rouble devaluation.
·     Staff costs decreased due to the rouble weakness (down US$17 million) and asset optimisation initiatives.
·     Depreciation and depletion costs decreased, mostly due to the rouble weakness (down US$16 million), partly offset by
increase in depreciation costs due to higher volumes.
·     Energy costs fell due to the effect of currency movements (down US$4 million), partly offset by higher electricity prices
in local currencies.
·     Other costs increased, primarily due to changes in goods for resale.
Coal segment gross profit
The Coal segment's gross profit amounted to US$200 million in H1 2016, up from US$148 million in H1 2015. The gross
profit margin rose, primarily due to the effect of the rouble depreciation on costs and cost-cutting initiatives.
Operational update
The Coal segment continues to implement a production efficiency improvement programme. The main priorities in 2016
are to:
·     enhance overall equipment effectiveness at longwalls and the Raspadsky open pit
·     increase the rate of development work compared with 2015
·     improve washing efficiency (growth of concentrate yields)
In H1 2016, EVRAZ's raw coking coal output totalled 11.0 million tonnes, up 1.6 million tonnes year-on-year.
Raspadskaya
In H1 2016, raw coking coal output from Raspadskaya amounted to 4.9 million tonnes (including 2.6 million tonnes from
the Raspadskaya mine). The Raspadsky open pit mined 2 million tonnes, 0.7 million tonnes higher than in H1 2015. The
main reason was favourable market conditions in 2016, which avoided the need to suspend mining activities, as in 2015.
Output from the Raspadskaya-Koksovaya mine in H1 2016 amounted to 0.28 million tonnes of K-grade raw coking coal.
The mine continues to develop room-and-pillar operations.
Yuzhkuzbassugol
In H1 2016, Yuzhkuzbassugol mined 5.9 million tonnes of raw coking coal, up 1.8 million tonnes year-on-year. The main
drivers were:
·     Stable longwall operations, with higher output per face compared with 2015
·     Optimisation of the longwall move schedule at the Uskovskaya and Esaulskaya mines
Mezhegeyugol
In H1 2016, Mezhegeyugol launched room-and-pillar mining operations. Raw coking coal output amounted to 0.2 million
tonnes, compared with 0.1 million tonnes in H1 2015.

Appendixes
Appendix 1
EBITDA
EBITDA is determined as a segment's profit/(loss) from operations, adjusted for social and social infrastructure
maintenance expenses, impairment of assets, profit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, foreign exchange gains/(losses) and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense.
In 2015, the management changed the definition of segment expense and EBITDA to make them more comparable with
the indicators of Russian steel peers. Starting from 2015, segment expense in the consolidated financial statements does
not include social and social infrastructure maintenance expenses and profit/(loss) from operations is adjusted for these
expenses in arriving at EBITDA. As a result, the Group restated EBITDA for both financial reporting and management
accountings  purposes for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
Appendix 2
Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow represents EBITDA, net of non-cash items, less changes in working capital, income tax paid, interest paid
and social and infrastructure maintenance, covenant reset charges, conversion premiums, premiums on early repurchases
of bonds and realised gain/(losses) on interest payments under swap contracts, interest income and debt issue costs, less
capital expenditure, including recorded in financing activities, purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, proceeds
from sale of disposals classified as held for sale, net of transaction costs, less purchases of treasury shares for participants
of the incentive plans, plus other cash flows from investing activities. Free Cash Flow is not a measure under IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to other measures of financial position. EVRAZ's calculation of Free Cash Flow
may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
Appendix 3
Cash and short-term bank deposits
Cash and short-term bank deposits is not a measure under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to other
measures of financial position. EVRAZ's calculation of cash and short-term bank deposits may be different from the
calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Total debt
Total debt represents the nominal value of loans and borrowings plus unpaid interest, including those related to the
disposal groups classified as held for sale, finance lease liabilities and the nominal effect of cross-currency swaps on
principal of rouble-denominated notes. Management uses this measure because it represents the Group's interest-bearing
financial obligations. Total debt is not defined in the international financial reporting standards, therefore, EVRAZ's
calculation of total debt may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be
limited. This calculation differs from that used for covenant compliance calculations.

Net debt
Net debt represents total debt less cash and liquid short-term financial assets, including those related to disposal groups

Independent Review Report to EVRAZ plc
Introduction
We have been engaged by EVRAZ plc (the Company) to review the condensed set of financial statements in the interim
report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 which comprises the Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Operations, Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Interim Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position, Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Interim Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and related notes 1 to 14. We have read the other information contained in
the interim report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
information in the condensed set of financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard on Review
Engagements 2410 (UK and Ireland) 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The Directors are
responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the
United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements
included in this interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34,
'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the interim
financial report based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (UK and Ireland),
'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries,
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial
statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.

Selected Notes
to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Six-month period ended 30 June 2016
1.       Corporate Information
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of EVRAZ
plc on 17 August 2016.
EVRAZ plc ("EVRAZ plc" or "the Company") was incorporated on 23 September 2011 as a public company under the laws
of the United Kingdom with the registered number 7784342. The Company's registered office is at 5th Floor, 6 St. Andrew
Street, London, EC4A 3AE, United Kingdom.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the "Group"), is involved in the production and distribution of steel and related
products and coal and iron ore mining.  In addition, the Group produces vanadium products. The Group is one of the
largest steel producers globally.
Lanebrook Limited (Cyprus) is the ultimate controlling party of the Company.
2.       Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard ("IAS") 34 "Interim Financial Reporting", as adopted by the European Union. Accordingly, these
interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required for a
complete set of financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, which were prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined by Section 435 of
the Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the full year is based on the statutory accounts for the financial year
ended 31 December 2015. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been filed with the Registrar of
Companies. The auditor's report under section 495 of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to those accounts was
unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without
qualifying their report and did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
Operating results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending 31 December 2016.
Going Concern
These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Group's activities in all of its operating segments continue to be affected by the uncertainty and instability of the current
economic environment (Note 12). In response, the Group implemented a number of cost cutting initiatives, reduced capital
expenditures, continues to reduce the level of debt and proactively manages its debt covenants compliance.
Based on the currently available facts and circumstances the directors and management have a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2.       Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Restatement of Financial Statements
Reclassification of Expenses
In 2016, the Group reclassified property tax accrued and paid by the production subsidiaries from general and
administrative expenses to the "cost of revenue" caption. The Group also reclassified staff costs of certain categories of
personnel and the related expenses from cost of revenue to general and administrative expenses.
The reclassifications were made to better reflect the nature of these costs in the current business environment and in order
to make the financial statements more comparable with industry peers.
The effects of the restatement on the previously reported amounts are set out below.

Changes in Accounting Policies
In the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting
policies and methods of computation as compared with those applied in the complete consolidated financial statements for
year ended 31 December 2015, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of existing IAS
as of 1 January 2016.
New/Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2016:
§  Amendments to IAS 19 - Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
IAS 19 requires an entity to consider contributions from employees or third parties when accounting for defined benefit
plans. Where the contributions are linked to service, they should be attributed to periods of service as a negative benefit.
This amendment is not relevant to the Group, since none of the entities within the Group has defined benefit plans with
contributions from employees.
2.       Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Changes in Accounting Policies (continued)
§  Amendments to IAS 1 - Disclosure Initiative
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify existing IAS 1 requirements:
Ø The materiality requirements in IAS 1
Ø The requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial position and the
statements of profit or loss and OCI
Ø That specific line items in the statements of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be
disaggregated
Ø That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements
Ø That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in
aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit
or loss.
§  Amendments to IFRS 11 - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in
which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business
combinations accounting. The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not
remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained. In
addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when the parties
sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate controlling party. The
amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional
interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2016, with early adoption permitted.
§  Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are
generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed
through use of the asset. As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment
and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets.
§  Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 - Bearer Plants
The amendments change the accounting requirements for biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants. Under
the amendments, biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants will no longer be within the scope of IAS 41.
Instead, IAS 16 will apply. After initial recognition, bearer plants will be measured under IAS 16 at accumulated cost
(before maturity) and using either the cost model or revaluation model (after maturity). The amendments also require that
produce that grows on bearer plants will remain in the scope of IAS 41 measured at fair value less costs to sell. For
government grants related to bearer plants, IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government
Assistance will apply. The amendments are retrospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group as the Group
does not have any bearer plants.
§  Amendments to IAS 27 - Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
The amendments allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates in their separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity
method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively.
2.       Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Changes in Accounting Policies (continued)
§  Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle
The amendments relate to IFRS 2 "Share-based Payment, IFRS 3 "Business Combinations", IFRS 8 "Operating
Segments", IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment" and "IAS 38 Intangible Assets", IAS 24 "Related Party Disclosures".
§  Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle
The amendments relate to IFRS 5 "Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations", IFRS 7 "Financial
Instruments: Disclosures", IAS 19 "Employee Benefits", IAS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting".
The amendments described above had no significant impact on the financial position and performance of the Group or the
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet
effective.
3.       Segment Information
As disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, in the second half of 2015,
management changed the definition of segment expense and EBITDA to make these indicators more comparable with
Russian steel peers. Segment expense and EBITDA were adjusted to not include social and social infrastructure
maintenance expenses. As such, the comparative segment information for the first half of 2015 has been restated
accordingly.
The following tables present measures of segment profit or loss based on management accounts.

4.       Impairment of Non-current Assets
The Group recognised impairment losses as a result of the impairment testing at the level of cash-generating units. In
addition, the Group made a write-off of certain functionally obsolete items of property, plant and equipment.
For the purpose of the impairment testing as of 30 June 2016 the Group assessed the recoverable amount of each cash-
generating unit ("CGU") where indicators of impairment were identified.
4.       Impairment of Non-current Assets (continued)
In the first half of 2016, based on the analysis of market changes and cash inflow dependence between the assets and
new business organisational structure, management redefined the composition of cash generating units of Steel North
America for the purposes of impairment testing. The assets of EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada, which were
previously allocated to cash-generating units based on individual plant level, were merged into 5 new units based on
principal markets served by each cash-generating unit:
§ Large diameter pipes;
§ Oil Country Tubular Goods (casing and tubing);
§ Seamless pipes;
§ Flat rolled products (plates and coils);
§ Long products (rails, rod and bar products).
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on
the actual operating results and business plans approved by management and appropriate discount rates reflecting the
time value of money and risks associated with respective cash-generating units. For the periods not covered by
management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by extrapolating the respective business plans'
results using a zero real growth rate. The key assumptions used by management in the value-in-use calculations with
respect to the cash-generating units to which the goodwill was allocated and where indicators of impairment existed are
presented in the table below.

4.       Impairment of Non-current Assets (continued)
As a result of impairment testing, the Group recognised a $16 million impairment loss with regards to EVRAZ Stratcor Inc.
and made a partial reversal of impairment of EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli in the amount of $19 million.
Discount Rates
Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit. The discount rates
have been determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers. Reasonably possible
changes in discount rates could lead to an impairment at EVRAZ Sukha Balka, EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. and EVRAZ Inc. NA
cash-generating units. If the discount rates were 10% higher, this would lead to an impairment of $69 million.
Sales Prices
The price assumptions of the products sold by the Group were estimated using industry research using analysts' views
published by Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, RBC, UBS, VTB during the period from April to
June 2016. The Group expects that the nominal prices will grow with a compound annual growth rate of (7.0)%-6.6% in
2016 - 2021 and 2.0%-2.5% in 2022 and thereafter. Reasonably possible changes in sales prices in the 2nd half of 2016
and 2017 could lead to an impairment at EVRAZ Sukha Balka and EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. cash-generating units. If the prices
assumed for the 2nd half of 2016 and 2017 were 10% lower, this would lead to an impairment of $4 million.
Sales Volumes
Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products would increase by 12.2% in 2017 and future dynamics will
be driven by gradual market recovery and changes in assets' capacities. Reasonably possible changes in sales volumes
in the 2nd half of 2016 and 2017 could lead to an impairment at EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. If the sales volumes were 10% lower
than those assumed for the 2nd half of 2016 and 2017, this would lead to an impairment of $5 million.
Cost Control Measures
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management. A
reasonably possible deviation of cost from these plans could lead to an impairment at EVRAZ Sukha Balka and EVRAZ
Stratcor Inc. cash-generating units. If the actual costs were 10% higher than those assumed for the 2nd half of 2016 and
2017, this would lead to an impairment of $17 million.
The unit's recoverable amount would become equal to its carrying amount if the assumptions used to measure the
recoverable amount changed as follows:

The Group assessed the recoverability of its investment in Timir at 30 June 2016. The recoverable amount of the asset was
based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on the business plans approved by management
and an appropriate discount rate reflecting the time value of money and risks associated with the asset. The period of the
forecast was 25 years. The discount rates were 11.78%. As a result, in the 1st half of 2016, the Group partially impaired its
investment in Timir. The major drivers that led to impairment were the decrease in the expected long-term prices for iron
ore, the increase in the amount of the required capital expenditures to maintain the production at the budgeted capacities
and the postponement of the start of production for 2 years.
7.       Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates (continued)
In the value-in-use calculation management assumed that the railway tariffs for the iron ore transportation in the Yakutia
region, which are established by the local railway companies, will be reduced to the general level of the tariffs in Russia.
These tariffs have not been agreed yet by the parties. If the assumption were not valid, this would lead to an additional
impairment of $58 million which would give a $21 million effect on the share of profits/(losses) of joint ventures and
associates recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.
8.       Related Party Disclosures
For the Group related parties include associates and joint venture partners, key management personnel and other entities
that are under the control or significant influence of the key management personnel, the Group's ultimate parent or its
shareholders. In considering each possible related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the
relationship, not merely the legal form.

Earnings per Share
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the
net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the
period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potential
dilutive ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following reflects the profit and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

notes were used to finance the purchase of 7.40% notes due 2017, 9.50% notes due 2018, 6.75% notes due 2018 and
7.75% bonds due 2017 at the tender offer settled on 17 June 2016 and to refinance other current indebtedness of the
Group.
In March 2016, the Group completed a placement of bonds in the total amount of 15,000 million Russian roubles ($233
million at 30 June 2016), which bear interest of 12.60% per annum and mature on 23 March 2021. The currency risk
exposure of these bonds was not hedged.
Repurchase of Notes and Bonds
In the first half of 2016, the Group partially repurchased 7.40% notes due 2017 ($109 million), 9.50% notes due 2018 ($216
million), 6.75% notes due 2018 ($259 million) and 7.75% bonds due 2017 ($160 million). The premium over carrying value
on the repurchase in the amount of $5 million, $19 million, $6 million and $5 million, respectively, was charged to
the Gain/(loss) on financial assets and liabilities caption of the consolidated statement of operations.
In addition, the Group fully settled its 8.40% rouble bonds due 2016, there was no gain or loss on this transaction.
Unutilised Borrowing Facilities
As of 30 June 2016, the Group had unutilised bank loans in the amount of $1,132 million, including $198 million of
committed facilities.
12.     Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Environment of the Group
The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia. The
Group's major subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, the USA and Canada. Russia and Ukraine are considered to be
developing markets with higher economic and political risks. Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of
demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions.
The global economic recession resulted in a significantly lower demand for steel products and decreased profitability. In
addition, the political crisis over Ukraine led to an additional uncertainty in the global economy. The unrest in the
Southeastern region of Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia caused the depreciation of national
currencies and economic slowdown in Russia and Ukraine. In addition, a significant drop in crude oil prices negatively
impacted the Russian economy. The combination of the above resulted in increased inflation and uncertainty regarding
economic growth. If the Ukrainian crisis broadens and further sanctions are imposed on Russia, this could have an
adverse impact on the Group's business.
Management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the Group's business in the current
circumstances.
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect the Group's results and financial
position in a manner not currently determinable.
12.     Commitments and Contingencies (continued)
Taxation
Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can
occur frequently. Management's interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group
may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities.
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable. Where uncertainty exists, the Group has
accrued tax liabilities based on management's best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits, which will be required to settle these liabilities. Possible liabilities which were identified by management at the
end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different interpretations of the tax laws and other regulations and
are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $21 million.
Contractual Commitments
At 30 June 2016, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of production equipment and construction works
for an approximate amount of $144 million.
In 2010, the Group concluded a contract for the construction of an air separation plant and for the supply of oxygen and
other gases produced by a third party at this plant for a period of 20 years. Due to a change in plans of the third party
provider and in management's assessment of the extent of sales of gases to third parties the Group no longer considers
this supply contract to fall within the scope of IFRIC 4 "Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease". At 30
June 2016, the Group has a committed expenditure of $553 million over the life of the contract.
Social Commitments
The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure
development in towns where the Group's assets are located. The Group budgeted to spend approximately $24 million
under these programmes in the second half of 2016.
Environmental Protection
In the course of the Group's operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings. The
quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and
regulations, improvements in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the
assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation or
settlement.
The Group has a number of environmental claims and proceedings which are at an early stage of investigation.
Environmental provisions in relation to these proceedings that were recognised at 30 June 2016 amounted to $12 million.
Preliminary estimates available of the incremental costs indicate that such costs could be up to $263 million. The Group
has insurance agreements, which are expected to provide reimbursement of the costs to be actually incurred. Management
believes that, as of now, an economic outflow of the additional costs is not probable and any pending environmental claims
or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In addition, the Group has committed to various environmental protection programmes covering periods from 2016 to 2022,
under which it will perform works aimed at reductions in environmental pollution and contamination. As of 30 June 2016,
the costs of implementing these programmes are estimated at $114 million.
Legal Proceedings
The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in
aggregate, a significant effect on the Group's operations or financial position. At 30 June 2016, possible liabilities were
estimated at $8 million.
13.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation
technique:
§ Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
§ Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable,
either directly or indirectly; and
§ Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, short-term accounts
receivable and payable, short-term loans receivable and payable and promissory notes, approximate their fair value.
