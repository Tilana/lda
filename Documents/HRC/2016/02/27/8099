<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth

</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Philippines: Hungary, Qatar and Uganda. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1 and

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, 
Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to the Philippines through the troika. These questions are available on the

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation stated that the Philippine Government welcomed this UPR as 
an opportunity to engage in open and constructive dialogue with the members, observers 
and stakeholders of the United Nations Human Rights Council and the international 
community, and to share the actions taken to implement the recommendations it had 
accepted during the 2008 UPR, as well as advancements in the promotion, protection and 
fulfilment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. It stated that President Aquino&#8217;s Social Contract with the Filipino People, a 16-point 
agenda, was built on a strong foundation of respect for human rights. The key results areas 
of the Social Contract are anti-corruption and good governance; poverty alleviation and 
empowerment of the poor; achieving inclusive economic growth; building just and lasting 
peace and promoting the rule of law; and protecting the environment, with gender equality 
as a cross-cutting concern. 
</p>
<p>7. Under its progressive development orientation, the Philippines maintains that all 
growth must be inclusive, and that the benefits of a growing economy must be felt by each 
and every citizen. The Philippines quadrupled the budget for its Pantawid Pamilya 
programme<i>, </i>a conditional cash-transfer programme which is an investment in human 
capital provided to poor households to keep their children in school and to keep them 
healthy, and for mothers to receive pre- and post-natal health care. From the initial 232 </p>


<p>million dollars, its budget is now 912 million dollars, and from 800,000 families, it now 
covers more than three million families throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>8. The Philippines has strengthened its Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and 
Nutrition programme by encouraging facility-based deliveries and training itinerant 
community health teams on basic and comprehensive emergency maternal obstetric and 
newborn care<i>.</i> In order to address teenage pregnancies, peer facilitators provide youth-
friendly health-care services, including comprehensive sexuality education. 
</p>
<p>9. Some 5.2 million poor households are now covered by the Philippine health 
insurance programme, and the Philippines is committed to achieving universal health 
coverage by 2016. 
</p>
<p>10. The Philippines has expanded the coverage of its Social Pension programme and 
increased its budget allocation by nearly seven million dollars to improve the conditions of 
indigent senior citizens. 
</p>
<p>11. Since 2008, 16,000 core shelters have been built to provide assistance to families 
displaced by natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation stated that the Philippines continued to work hard to increase access 
to quality education and employment. The education sector received the largest increase in 
the Government expenditure programme in the amount of 867 million dollars. As a 
component of the Philippine National Action Plan for Education for All, implementation of 
compulsory kindergarten plus 12 years of formal basic education has been launched. With 
the aim of reducing the dropout rate and improving student survival, it has implemented 
Alternative delivery modes and the Alternative learning system have been launched, as well 
as a Training-for-work scholarship programme to help job-seekers upgrade their skills and 
competencies. 
</p>
<p>13. Agrarian reform has been allocated an additional 349 million dollars for the 
completion of land acquisition and distribution over a five-year period from July 2009 to 
July 2014. Farmer beneficiaries have been provided easier access to credit, physical 
infrastructure support and legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>14. Since the UPR in 2008, the Philippines has ratified the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court and Protocol I Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. 
The Philippines is the first country in Southeast Asia to ratify the 1954 Convention Relating 
to the Status of Stateless Persons. The Philippines is now a State party to eight core 
international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>15. Since 2008, the Philippines has taken concrete measures to harmonize its domestic 
legislation with its obligations under the relevant international human rights treaties to 
which it is a State party. It enacted the Magna Carta of Women in 2009, a comprehensive 
law which strengthens the Philippines&#8217; legal and institutional framework in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The 
Philippines adopted an Anti-Torture Act which is compliant with its obligations under the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>16. Several new laws have been passed to ensure consistency with the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, such as the Act providing for the legitimation of children born to 
parents below the marriageable age; the Anti-Child Pornography Act and an Act providing 
for an administrative rather than a judicial process to declare a child legally available for 
adoption. </p>


<p>17. The Philippines has adopted a landmark domestic law to address crimes against 
international humanitarian law, genocide and other crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>18. The Philippines has also amended its Migrant Workers&#8217; Act and Labour Code to 
better protect its Filipino migrants overseas and strengthen adherence of host governments 
to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and lift the restrictive provisions against night work for women. 
</p>
<p>19. There has been a general improvement in gender-sensitive handling of cases relating 
to violence against women and children. There are over 27,000 violence against women 
(VAW) desks in villages throughout the country, over and above the 1,868 women and 
children protection desks in police stations nationwide, staffed by 3,240 female police 
personnel. Women and children protection units in regional and district government 
hospitals are being upgraded to better serve victims of rape and domestic violence. The 
Supreme Court has trained over 2,000 judges and court personnel on the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and gender sensitivity. 
</p>
<p>20. The Philippines has adopted its 2nd National Plan of Action for Children (2011-
2016) and is implementing the Juvenile Justice Welfare Act of 2006 in accordance with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>21. The protection cluster of the Philippines&#8217; National Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Management Council conducts rapid assessment and family tracing of separated, 
unaccompanied, missing, reintegrated or dead children, and provides child-friendly spaces, 
mental health and psycho-social support and debriefing activities in times of emergencies. 
</p>
<p>22. Concerted interagency actions have resulted in a dramatic decrease in reported 
incidents of extrajudicial killings and torture in the Philippines. Task Force Usig, a special 
unit under the Philippine National Police, along with independent stakeholders and 
international partners have independently verified that incidents of extrajudicial killings 
have clearly declined. 
</p>
<p>23. The Department of Justice has issued its Operational Guidelines on Evidence-
Gathering, Investigation and Case Build-Up for cases of political and media-related 
killings. The Philippines has also partnered with the international community in capacity-
building and forensic training for prosecutors in evidence-gathering and case build-up, 
which has helped to increase the number of convictions in cases of extrajudicial killings. 
The European Union-Philippines Justice Support Programme is an example of such a 
partnership. 
</p>
<p>24. Human rights offices in both the Armed Forces and the National Police play an 
important role in fostering a culture of human rights in the security sector. Members of the 
security forces are regularly trained on human rights and international humanitarian law. 
These responsibilities are embodied in the Internal Peace and Security Plan of the Armed 
Forces of the Philippines, which was the product of multi-stakeholder consultations. 
</p>
<p>25. In order to enhance the exercise of the right to freedom of expression, the Philippine 
Supreme Court has adopted a policy whereby libel convictions should be punished only 
with a fine. There is also a pending bill to decriminalize libel. 
</p>
<p>26. In compliance with its obligations, the Philippines is in the process of constituting a 
multi-stakeholder national preventive mechanism, to be led by the independent 
Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>27. The Anti-Torture Act provides for the Commission on Human Rights of the 
Philippines to investigate torture complaints and assist in the prosecution of these 
complaints. </p>


<p>28. Pursuant to its Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities, the Philippines recognizes 
and upholds the rights of persons with disabilities, including their right to participate in 
political and public life. 
</p>
<p>29. The Philippines continues to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples 
and indigenous cultural communities and observes the provisions of the Indigenous Peoples 
Rights Act. It advocates responsible mining through the application of more stringent rules 
under a new mining policy that takes into account the impact of extensive mining 
operations on indigenous peoples and the environment. 
</p>
<p>30. With regard to trafficking in persons, the delegation stated that there has been a total 
of 72 convictions, with 87 persons convicted since the Anti-Trafficking Law was enacted in 
</p><p>2003. Since June 2010, when President Benigno Aquino came to power, 57 persons have 
been convicted in 43 convictions, representing an increase in successful prosecution of 
nearly 150 per cent in terms of convictions, and 190 per cent in terms of individuals 
convicted within such a relatively short time. 
</p>
<p>31. Measures taken with regard to protection, recovery and reintegration of victims of 
trafficking include rescue, counselling, financial and legal assistance, skills training, 
auxiliary services and temporary shelter. The Philippines has invited the Special Rapporteur 
on trafficking in persons to visit the country this year. 
</p>
<p>32. At the regional level, the Philippines is actively pursuing the adoption of a 
Convention on Trafficking in Persons by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) and supports the formulation of an ASEAN Declaration on Human Rights and 
the work of the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights and the 
ASEAN Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and 
Children.
