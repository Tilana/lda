Summary of the Complaint
1. The complaint is submitted by INTERIGHTS, Anton Katz and Max du Plessis (Complainants) on behalf
of Mr Kenneth Good (victim), against the Republic of Botswana (Respondent State).
2. The complaint states that Mr Kenneth Good, an Australian national, teaching at the University of
Botswana, had his employment terminated after his expulsion from Botswana on 31st May 2005.
3. It is submitted that in February 2005, in his capacity as Professor of Political Studies at the University of
Botswana, the victim co-authored an article concerning presidential succession in Botswana. The article
criticised the Government, and concluded that Botswana is a poor example of African presidential
succession.
4. The Complainants submit that, on 18th February 2005, the President of Botswana, exercising the powers
vested in him by section 7(f) of the Botswana Immigration Act, decided to declare the victim an undesirable
inhabitant of, or visitor to, Botswana. The victim was not given reasons for this decision, nor was he given
any opportunity to contest it.
5. On 7th March 2005, the victim launched a constitutional challenge in the Botswana High Court. On 31st
May 2005, the High Court dismissed the application ruling that Section 7 (f) of the Botswana Immigration
Act relates to what the President considers to be in the best interest of Botswana, and Sections 11(6) and
36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the merits.
6. On 31st May 2005, the victim was deported from Botswana to South Africa.
7. On 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal of the Republic
of Botswana. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing the victim's appeal.
The Court of Appeal held that the President, in making such declarations, is empowered to act in what he
considers to be the best interest of the country, without judicial oversight.
8. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana. No
further right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this court.

Complaint
9. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Articles 1, 2, 7 (1) (a), 9, 12 (4), and 18
of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.

Law
Admissibility
Complainants' submission

47. The Complainants submit that the requirements set in Article 56 of the African Charter have been
satisfied, as the author of the communication has been identified and relevant details of the Communication
have been provided to the Commission, including details of those individuals and organisations
representing the victim. According to the Complainants, the communication is compatible with the
Constitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. The communication is presented in a
polite and respectful language, and is based on information provided by the victim and on court documents,
not on media reports. The Complainants state that the present communication has not been submitted to
any other international human rights body for investigation or settlement.
48. The Complainants claim that on 7th March 2005, the victim launched an application challenging the
constitutionality of the Botswana Immigration Act. The application, which challenged the President's
decision to expel him from Botswana, was dismissed by the High Court of Botswana in a unanimous
judgment. They submit that the High Court in its judgment found that the President's declaration under
Section 7(f) of the Immigration Act relates to what the President considers to be in the best interests of
Botswana and Sections 11(6) and 36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the
merits.
49. The Complainants submit further that on 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal
to the Court of Appeal, in which he sought an order setting aside both the judgment appealed against and
the decision of the President of 18th February 2005. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a
judgment dismissing the victim's appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the President in making such
declarations is empowered to act in what he considers to be the best interests of the country, without
judicial oversight and that the Parliament which decreed that the President's decisions are not subject to
disclosure did not act ultra vires in doing so.
50. The Complainants aver that both Courts found that the President, in making his declaration that the
victim was an "undesirable inhabitant or visitor to Botswana", is empowered to act in what he considers to
be the best interests of the country, without judicial oversight. The Courts ruled that in terms of the Act, the
President's decisions are not subject to disclosure or challenge in a court of law and he did not act ultra
vires.
51. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana and no
further right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this Court.
52. As a result of the above, the Complainants argue that all domestic remedies available in the
Respondent State have been exhausted for the purpose of Article 56(5). They also submit that the
communication is brought before the Commission within three months of having exhausted such domestic
remedies, pursuant to Article 56(6).
Respondent State's Submissions

53. In its submissions, the Respondent State challenges the Commission's existence and its competence
to hear the case. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the
Commission was established within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and that the OAU ceased to
exist in July 2001, and no provision was made for the continuance of the work of the Commission in the
3

Constitutive Act of the African Union (AU) that took over from the OAU.
54. The State further submits that Article 5
× Article 5 Organs of the Union
1. The organs of the Union shall be: (a) The Assembly of the Union; (b) The Executive Council; (c) The
Pan-African Parliament; (d) The Court of Justice; (e) The Commission; (f) The Permanent Representatives
Committee; (g) The Specialised Technical Committees; (h) The Economic, Social and Cultural Council; (i)
The Financial Institutions;
2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.
of the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and that the
AU did not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1) (d)
× The functions of the Assembly shall be to:...d. Establish any organ of the Union;
of the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The
Respondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.
55. However, the Respondent State does not challenge the existence of the African Charter, which it
considers a "mere instrument of noble ideals which unfortunately is devoid of any operational structures...".
56. With respect to the Commission's competence rationae materae (subject matter of the communication),
the Respondent State holds that the communication concerns immigration matters which are not part of the
mandate of the Commission spelled out in Article 45 of the Charter. The State submits further that in terms
of [popup=Article 13] Functions of the Executive Council
1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the
Member States, including the following:

1. foreign trade;
2. energy, industry and mineral resources;
3. food, agricultural and animal resources, livestock production and forestry;
4. water resources and irrigation;
5. environmental protection, humanitarian action and disaster response and relief;
6. transport and communications;
7. insurance;
8. education, culture, health and human resources development;
9. science and technology;
10. nationality, residency and immigration matters;
11. social security, including the formulation of mother and child care policies, as well as policies
relating to the disabled and the handicapped;
12. establishment of a system of African awards, medals and prizes.
2. The Executive Council shall be responsible to the Assembly. It shall consider issues referred to it and
monitor the implementation of policies formulated by the Assembly.
3. The Executive Council may delegate any of its powers and functions mentioned in paragraph 1 of this
Article to the Specialised Technical Committees established under Article 14 of this Act.[/popup] of the
Constitutive Act, it is the Executive Council which is responsible for immigration matters.
57. The Respondent State argues that in case the Commission finds itself to be in existence and to have
jurisdiction over the matter, the communication should notwithstanding be declared inadmissible for
non-compliance with Article 56 of the African Charter.
58. It is the State's view that the communication is not compatible with the African Charter. It submits that
not all the elements of the communication have been disclosed to the State, placing the latter "in an
untenable position where it does not know the exact nature of the Complaint against it," and that therefore
the communication is irregular and/or non-compliant with Rule 104(e) as read with Article 56(2) of the
African Charter.
59. The Respondent State also states that Article 23(1) of the African Charter recognises peoples' rights to
national and international peace and security, and that Article 12(2) allows States Parties to restrict the right
to freedom of movement by means of law for the "protection of national security, law and order...". The
4

State holds that the interpretation of these provisions is that "States must be left alone and allowed to deal
with matters of peace and national security". The Respondent State submits that the matter before the
Commission involves national security and that the Commission has no competence over it.
60. The Respondent State further submits that the decision to expel the victim was taken by the President
in accordance with the law as required under Article 12(4) of the African Charter.
61. The Respondent State argues that the victim's expulsion was confirmed by the courts and that the
State has the obligation under Article 26 of the Charter to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and
cannot interfere with their rulings.
62. The Respondent State also states that the victim's appeal to courts in Botswana was dismissed with
costs, which he has not yet paid, and that by instituting proceedings before the Commission he is just trying
to escape his obligation in Botswana. The State concludes that the communication is frivolous and
vexatious, and that it should be rejected and held inadmissible.
63. The Respondent State further submits that the victim did not avail himself of the possibility offered to
him to resort to the President to review the decision expelling him. It is therefore the State's submission that
local remedies have not been exhausted.
64. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Respondent State prays the Commission to declare the
communication inadmissible.
Response of the Complainants to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility

65. The Complainants submit that the fact that the OAU ceased to exist does not affect the existence of the
Commission, and that the latter continues to exist de facto and de jure. De facto, the work of the
Commission was not hindered or suspended as a result of the coming into force of the AU Constitutive Act:
it continued considering communications; holding sessions; undertaking visits to State Parties, including the
Respondent State, which continues to collaborate with it. De jure, the AU Assembly, by its decision, ruled
that the Commission "shall henceforth operate within the framework of the African Union".
66. The Complainants argue that the African Charter established the Commission and the fact that the
African Charter is still in force, as the Respondent State did acknowledge, is tantamount to recognising the
existence of the African Commission.
67. With respect to the disclosure of documents to the State, the Complainants argue that the
communication is not based on media reports but on the information provided by the victim and on court
documents, and that only two judgments have been enclosed because they are the only ones relevant at
the particular stage of the proceedings and from the point of view of exhaustion of domestic remedies.
68. The Complainants also challenge the argument of the Respondent State that the Commission does not
have jurisdiction over immigration matters. They submit that that Article 45(2) mandates the Commission to
protect human rights generally, without leaving out the rights of immigrants or people facing deportation,
noting that Article 12 of the Charter makes clear reference to migration.
69. The Complainants finally submit that the other points of the State's submission relate to the merits and
should not be considered at this stage of the procedure, adding that the communication meets all the
admissibility requirements and should be declared admissible.
Respondent State's reaction to the Complainant's response to its submissions

70. In an oral submission during the 40th Ordinary Session of the Commission, and by letter dated 22nd
March 2007, the Respondent State submitted that the additional submission on admissibility by the
Complainants should be purged from the record of proceedings because the invitation to make additional
submission was a misuse of the procedure under Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure. It is
the Respondent State's view that no reason was given for inviting the Complainants to submit and that the
letter was signed by a Finance and Administration Officer (FAO), who is not a member of the Commission,
and in inviting the Complainants to submit, the FAO unlawfully participated in the deliberations or decisions
of the Commission.
71. The Respondent State goes on to reiterate its statement that the Commission is an emanation of the
Charter, which established it to work within the OAU. The dissolution of the OAU, the State submits,
deprived the Commission of the legitimacy and authority as mechanism for the settling of disputes.
According to the Respondent State, in the absence of an amendment to Article 30 of the African Charter to
enable the Commission to operate within the AU, and without an AU decision integrating the Commission
as an organ of the AU, the African Commission lacks legal basis to continue performing its mandate under
5

the African Charter.
Decision of the Commission on the Respondent State's challenge of its existence and competence

72. Considering that the Respondent State contests the existence of the African Commission and its
jurisdiction to hear the matter complained of, the Commission will deal with those two points before dealing
with the admissibility of the communication.
73. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the Commission was
established within the OAU, and that the OAU ceased to exist in July 2001 and no provision was made for
the continuance of the work of the Commission in the Constitutive Act of the African Union that took over
from the OAU.
74. According to the Respondent State, Article 5
× 1. The organs of the Union shall be:
1. The Assembly of the Union;
2. The Executive Council;
3. The Pan-African Parliament;
4. The Court of Justice;
5. The Commission;
6. The Permanent Representatives Committee;
7. The Specialised Technical Committees;
8. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council;
9. The Financial Institutions;

2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.
of the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and the AU
did not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1)(d)
× 1. The functions of the Assembly shall be to: (d) establish any organ of the Union
of the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The
Respondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.
75. In terms of Article 30 of the African Charter, "An African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, ...
shall be established within the Organisation of African Unity to promote human and peoples' rights and
ensure their protection in Africa". It is the Commission's view that having been established by the African
Charter, the termination of a treaty other than the Charter cannot affect its existence.
76. The Commission would like to emphasise that although it was established by the African Charter and
not a direct emanation of the OAU Charter, it was operating within the framework of the OAU, the latter
being the main political organisation on the continent. As an organisation working within the framework of
the OAU, the Commission relied on the OAU for its funding and its staffing,1 and for the execution of its
decisions against Members States found to be in violation of the Charter2 . With the coming into force of the
Constitutive Act, all the "assets and liabilities" of the OAU "... and all matters relating thereto'' including
relevant institutions established within the OAU, were devolved to the AU3 . That is why, the Heads of State
and Government of the AU, at their first Ordinary Session held in Durban, South Africa, from 8th to 10th July
2002, accepted to take over the obligations the OAU used to bear vis-?-vis the African Commission. In its
decision on the Interim Period, the Assembly of the African Union decided that "the African Commission on
Human and Peoples' Rights and the African Committee of Experts on Rights and Welfare of the Child shall
henceforth operate within the framework of the African Union"4 .
77. As a matter of fact, the AU assumed towards the Commission the same obligations as previously borne
by the OAU. The AU appoints the 11 Members of the Commission, provides staff to the Secretariat, funds
the day-to-day work of the Commission, and adopts the reports submitted by the Commission. Moreover,
Member States of the AU (which are also State Parties to the African Charter), including the Respondent
State, continue to cooperate with the African Commission, by submitting their reports under Article 62 of the
Charter, by hosting sessions and missions of the Commission, and by actively participating in the
communication procedures when complaints are brought against them before the Commission.
78. The Commission takes note of the fact that, although it challenges the existence of the Commission as
6

a monitoring body, the Respondent State does not contest the existence of the Charter itself. The
Commission observes that, unlike some other international human rights systems where the substantive
rights and their monitoring bodies are dealt within two complementary but different instruments, in the
African system, the same instrument, the African Charter, makes provisions for substantive rights and
organises their monitoring mechanism5 . Under the Charter, therefore, States Parties are not given the
option of recognising the substantive rights without accepting the jurisdiction of the African Commission,
which was established to promote and protect those rights.
79. The Commission concludes that the termination of the OAU Charter and subsequent dissolution of the
OAU does not affect its existence. The Commission is still in existence and performs its activities within the
framework of the AU.
80. Regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission over immigration matters, the Commission is of the view
that there is no provision in the African Charter or in the Constitutive Act excluding the jurisdiction of the
African Commission over such matters. The jurisdiction of the Commission is founded by Article 45 of the
African Charter which reads: "The functions of the Commission shall be [to]: 2. Ensure the protection of
human and peoples' rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter."
81. This provision should be read together with the relevant substantive provisions of the Charter to find out
whether, under its protection mandate, the Commission has jurisdiction over a given matter. Regarding
specifically immigration matters, Article 12 of the Charter states that:
1. "Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a
2.
State provided he abides by the law.
3. Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his
country. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of
national security, law and order, public health or morality.
4. Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries
in accordance with the law of those countries and international conventions.
5. A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be
expelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law.
6. The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is
aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups."
82. It appears from the provision of Article 45(2), read together with Article 12, that the Commission has
jurisdiction when some human rights related to immigration are involved. The mandate of the Commission
in that case is to make sure that, immigration policies and practices do not infringe upon those rights.
Hence, the Commission finds that it has jurisdiction over immigration matters.
83. The Commission is of the view that the competence given to it over immigration matters under Article
45(2) and Article 12 of the Charter, does not overlap with the mandate of the Executive Council, under
Article 13(1)(j)
× 1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to
the Member States, including the following: (j) nationality, residency and immigration matters;
of the Constitutive Act, over the same matters because the two bodies do not perform the same kind of
activity. While the Commission is an international quasi-judicial institution established to promote and
protect the rights enshrined in the African Charter, the Executive Council is a political organ, which
"coordinate[s] and take[s] decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the member states [of the
African Union], including...nationality, residency and immigration matters"6 .
84. Having dealt with the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent State regarding the existence
and jurisdiction of the Commission, the latter will now proceed to make a determination on the admissibility
or otherwise of this communication.
The Commission's analysis on admissibility

85. The admissibility of communications submitted before the African Commission in accordance with
Article 55 is governed by the requirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. In terms of Article 56:
"Communications relating to human and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55 received by the
Commission, shall be considered if they:

7

1. Indicate their authors even if the latter requests anonymity,
2. Are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter,
3. Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its
institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity,
4. Are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media,
5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly
prolonged,
6. Are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the
date the Commission is seized with the matter, and
7. Do not deal with cases which have been settled by those States involved in accordance with the
principles of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or
the provisions of the present Charter."
86. The African Commission is of the view that this communication establishes a prima facie violation of the
provisions of the African Charter, and is compatible with both the Constitutive Act of the African Union and
the African Charter. The African Commission also does not believe that there has been any use of a
disparaging or insulting language against the Government of the Republic of Botswana or any of its
institutions or the African Union.
87. Regarding the disclosure of documents, the Commission finds that the documents submitted by the
Complainants in support of the claim sufficiently prove that the communication is not based on fiction or on
news disseminated by the mass media. The Commission concurs, therefore, that the condition of Article
56(4) has been met. The Commission also notes that all the documents submitted by the Complainants
have been disclosed to the Respondent State.
88. The Commission recalls its established jurisprudence whereby the exhaustion of local remedies
referred to in Article 56(5) 'entails remedy sought from the courts of a judicial nature.'7 Such a judicial
remedy shall be effective and shall not be subordinated to the discretionary power of public authorities8 .
The Commission has also affirmed on several occasions that it is not necessary, for the sake of meeting
the condition of Article 56(5), to seek 'remedies from a source which does not operate impartially and have
no obligation to decide according to legal principles' 9 .
89. In the present communication, the victim challenged the decision expelling him from Botswana before
the domestic courts. His application before the High Court of Botswana was dismissed, as was a further
appeal that he filed with the Court of Appeal, the highest judicial authority in Botswana. The Commission
finds therefore that all local remedies have been exhausted. The Commission is of the view that the
presidential review referred to by the Respondent State is not of a judicial nature and is subject to the
discretionary power of the President, the very authority that ordered the expulsion of the victim. The
Commission considers that such a remedy is not effective and the victim is not obliged to utilise it.
90. The Commission further finds that the other arguments10 submitted by the State against the
admissibility of the communication are based on substantive rights protected under the Charter, including
the rights, the violation of which is complained of by the applicant, to such an extent that dealing with them
at this stage of the procedure would be pushing the Commission to jump the gun to consider the
communication on the merits. The Commission therefore will not pronounce on them but would rather deal
with them at the appropriate stage.
91. From the above submissions, this Commission is of the view that the present communication
sufficiently complies with the requirements under Article 56, relating to the admissibility of communications
before the African Commission and thus decides to declare the communication admissible.
Merits
Respondent State's preliminary objection to the Commission's procedure

92. At the 42nd Ordinary Session of the Commission, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection
regarding the Commission's procedure in the handling of complaints/communications. The main thrust of
the State's objection is that the Commission's procedure relating to the handling of communications was
not followed with regards to the present communication. According to the State, Rule 119 of the
Commission's Rules of Procedure was not respected, and as a result, both parties to the communication,
the Respondent State and the Complainants, made submissions to the Commission at almost the same
8

time, making it difficult to respond to issues raised by either party.
93. The Respondent State submits that the Commission had asked both parties to submit their arguments
on the merits, giving both parties the same deadline. Both parties sent their arguments to the Secretariat of
the Commission at almost the same time, and the Commission then forwarded the submissions of either
party to the other for comments, if any.
94. The Respondent State contends that this procedure deprives it from properly addressing the issues
raised by the Complainants as it was not availed a copy of the Complainants' submission prior to the
Respondent State making its own submission. In the words of the Respondent State "it prejudices
Botswana greatly in that the applicant has effectively been afforded an undue opportunity to strengthen his
case, to the extent that the submissions filed by him raise very many new matters of fact and law which our
arguments, as is to be expected, do not deal with". The Respondent State concluded that the
Complainants' supplementary submissions on the merits be purged off the record.
95. Referring to Rule 119 of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure, the State maintains that it was
supposed to have submitted first and the Complainants given the opportunity to reply within a time fixed by
the Commission, in accordance with Rule 119 (3).
96. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue raised by the Respondent State before
proceeding to make a determination on the merits of the communication.
African Commission's decision on the preliminary objection

97. In the present communication, after declaring the case admissible at the Commission's 41st Ordinary
Session, the Secretariat, by Note Verbale of 20th June 2007, and letter of the same date, informed both
parties and requested them to submit their arguments on the merits within three months from the date of
notification. On 5th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' submissions on the merits of
the communication. On 12th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on
the merits. On 22nd October 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the submissions of the Respondent State to
the Complainants, and the Complainants to the Respondent State.
98. The purpose of requiring parties to make submissions to the Commission is so that they appreciate the
concerns of each other and try to address them as best as they can. That is why the Commission adopted
Rules of Procedure governing, among other things, the receipt and consideration of communications.
99. Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure seek to guide the Commission regarding the
procedure to adopt after a communication has been declared admissible. In terms of Rule 119 (1) "if the
Commission decides that a communication is admissible...its decision and text of the relevant documents
shall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned...The author of the communication
shall also be informed of the Commission's decision...". Rule 119 (2) provides further that the State Party
"... shall within the ensuing three months, submit in writing to the Commission, ...measures it was able to
take to remedy the situation".
100. From the above two paragraphs of Rule 119, it is the view of the Commission that when a
communication is declared admissible, both parties must be notified of the decision. While the African
Charter obliges the Commission to submit its decisions and other relevant texts relating to its decision on
admissibility to the State Party, it simply requires the Commission to inform the author of the
communication. This presupposes that the Respondent State is the one that is expected to make
submissions on the merits, to, in the words of the Charter, provide "explanations or statements elucidating
the issue under consideration and indicating, if possible, measures it was able to take to remedy the
situation".
101. This interpretation is supported when one turns to Rule 119 (3) which provides that 'all explanations or
statements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be communicated... to the author
of the communication, who may submit in writing additional information and observations within a time limit
fixed by the Commission'.
102. It is clear from the above, that after declaring a communication admissible, both parties are informed
of the decision, but the Respondent State is further requested to make submissions on the matter being
considered. After the State would have submitted, then the submission is availed to the author of the
communication for his/her comments. The Respondent State seems to be satisfied that the Note Verbale of
20th June inviting it to make submissions on the merits "was the correct step".
103. However, the Respondent State contends that if the Complainants were also invited to make
submissions on the merits "that was a defective step and clearly the Commission will be guilty of breaking
9

its own procedural rules".
104. The procedure of letting one party submit first and inviting the other to respond will give both parties
the opportunity to address the issues or concerns of the other. This exchange of submissions between the
State and the author of the communication can continue until the Commission is satisfied that it has had
enough information to make a decision on the matter.
105. The African Commission thus concurs with the Respondent State that when parties are asked to
submit at the same time, it does not give both of them the opportunity to respond to issues that are raised
by the other party.
106. This notwithstanding, the practice of the Commission is clear. Where it receives submissions from one
party, it sends the same to the other party for their comments. Thus, even if the parties make submissions
at the same time, the other party is not prejudiced in any way because they are still given an opportunity to
respond to the submissions before the Commission can make a determination. This was the situation with
respect to the present communication.
107. The Secretariat received the State's submissions on 12th October 2007 and sent same to the
Complainants on 22nd October 2007. Thus, the Respondent State was sent the Complainant's submissions
and the Complainants were sent the State's submissions, and both parties were entitled to send comments,
if any.
108. Thus, even though Rule 119 was not followed to the letter, the Respondent State has not indicated
how it was prejudiced by this lapse, to the advantage of the Complainants. The Respondent State has been
given an equal opportunity to respond to the submissions of the Complainants just as the Complainants
have been given an opportunity to respond to the State's submissions.
109. The Commission accordingly takes note of the fact that Rule 119 of its Rules of Procedure was not
followed to the letter, and undertakes to ensure that it is complied with in the future. It holds that since the
Respondent State has been given time to respond to the Complainants' submission, its argument that the
Complainants' submissions on the matter be purged from the record cannot stand. The African Commission
accordingly requests both parties to submit their responses, within three months, on the arguments made
by either party.

Complainants' submissions on the merits

110. The Complainants allege that the existence and application of the Botswana Immigration Act has
violated Articles 1, 2, 7(1) (a), 9, 12(4) and 18 of the African Charter.
Alleged Violation of Article 1

111. With respect to the alleged violation of Article 1 of the African Charter, Complainants submit that the
Charter was adopted and acceded to voluntarily by African States and that once ratified, States Parties to
the Charter are legally bound by its provisions, adding that States wishing not to be bound ought to have
refrained from ratifying.
112. The Complainants refer to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which states
that "a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to
the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose". The Complainants also
make reference to Legal Resources Foundation v Zambia11 where the Commission stated that the African
Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each other. The African Charter must
also be interpreted, in light of international norms and consistently with the approach of the other regional
and international human rights bodies.
113. The Complainants assert that the fact that the African Charter has not been incorporated into
Botswana domestic law may preclude persons in Botswana from relying on the provisions of the Charter
before local courts but does not affect recourse to the Commission under the African Charter. States are
bound by their ratification of the African Charter whether monist or dualist and even where it revokes the
domestic effect of the Charter12 . Consequently, they argue, all the provisions of the African Charter
addressed below indicate the Respondent State's failure to respect the African Charter and to ensure its full
implementation in violation of Article 1 of the same.

10

Alleged Violation of Articles 7(1)(a)&12(4)

114. The Complainants allege that the victim was deprived by law from accessing information relating to
the reasons for his being declared a threat to national security, which in turn denied judicial authorities the
right to review the President's decisions. Together, these denials, according to the Complainants, amount
to a clear violation of the right to appeal to competent judicial organs, a situation that affects the right to be
heard. In this regard, they contend that the right to be heard entails the right to challenge in a court of law,
decisions that affect the individual's fundamental rights13 .
115. Depending on Sections 7(f), 11(6) and 36 of the Botswana Immigration Act, the Complainants aver
that the courts that determined the victim's application and appeal prior to and following his expulsion,
found that he had no right to any information regarding the President's decision, and that the courts had no
power to question the reason for his expulsion and that there was no legal limit to the unfettered discretion
of the President.
116. According to the Complainants, the victim was not afforded any meaningful opportunity to challenge
his expulsion either by way of hearing before the expulsion order was made, or by way of appeal after the
order was made. He was not provided with the reasons for his expulsion and was accordingly not afforded
an opportunity to challenge those reasons or provide evidence which might contradict them. He was neither
given any remedy in respect of the violations of his rights. These decisions and the underlying provisions of
Sections 11(6) and 36 of the Immigration Act, according to the Complainants, are inconsistent with basic
principles of due process enshrined in Article 7 of the African Charter.
117. The Complainants aver that any decision passed "in accordance with the law" as provided under
Article 12(4) of the African Charter should fulfil the following three requirements: one, it should be provided
in a clear and accessible law to offer predictability and to guard against arbitrariness; two, it "...must be
made by a court or an administrative authority on the basis of a law affording protection against arbitrary
expulsion through the establishment of corresponding procedural guarantees"14 In relation with this they
refer to the Commission's decision in Modise v Botswana15 where the Commission stated that "in
accordance with law" requires not only strict conformity with national law, but also with the principles of the
African Charter and other international norms. Third, he contends that the procedural guarantees under
Article 12(4) enshrine the right to meaningful judicial oversight of administrative decisions.
118. With regard to the issue of national security, the Complainants submit that while the victim's case
raises no genuine issue of "national security", it is noted that, even where such legitimate concerns do
arise, they do not provide a basis to set aside the rights protected in the African Charter. They argue that
while legitimate security concerns can be taken into account in interpreting the African Charter, they cannot
erode the essence of the rights protected, including the right protected under Article 12(4). The
Complainants refer to Commission nationale des droits de l'Homme et des libertés v Chad16 where the
Commission stated that the African Charter does not allow States Parties to derogate from their treaty
obligations even during emergency situations. They also refer to Amnesty International v Zambia17 where
the Commission found a violation of Article 12(4) where the national court did not consider Zambia's
obligations under the African Charter and failed to rule on the ground that the Complainant was likely to
"endanger peace and good order in Zambia". According to the Commission, "there was no judicial inquiry
on the basis in law and in terms of administrative justice for relying on this 'opinion' of the Minister of Home
Affairs for the action taken".
119. The Complainants contend that the President did not give reasons for the victim's deportation, neither
did he explain or justify his decision and considerations of national security. The President, according to the
Complainants, applied a law which afforded him an apparently limitless power to make a declaration which
has the effect of causing an individual to become [[span class="JQ-quotes"]]"a prohibited immigrant". This
power is attended by a blanket denial of information as to the basis for its exercise. A law of this breadth
and potentially all encompassing scope, the Complainants argue, lacks the clarity and precision required of
