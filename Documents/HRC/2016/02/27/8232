<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution S-18/1, the Human Rights Council condemned the continued 
widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by 
the Syrian authorities and urged the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to meet its 
responsibility to protect its population, to immediately put an end to all human rights 
violations, to stop any attacks against civilians and to comply fully with its obligations 
under international human rights law. The Council also requested the Secretary-General to 
present a report on the implementation of resolution S-18/1 to the Council at its nineteenth 
session. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request. It contains information on 
the actions of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic taken to implement the relevant 
provisions of resolution S-18/1 as informed by the Government, particularly through notes 
verbales sent on 24 January and 10 February 2012 (A/HRC/19/G/4), and on relevant 
actions taken by the international community.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution S-18/1 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Actions by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 11 January 2012, members of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) met with representatives of the Permanent 
Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic in Geneva to enquire about the status of 
implementation of Human Rights Council resolution S-18/1. OHCHR enquired in 
particular about the status of implementation of paragraph 9 of the resolution, in which the 
Council called upon the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with OHCHR, including 
through the establishment of a field presence in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Ambassador 
of the Syrian Arab Republic informed OHCHR that, for the time being, his Government 
was not yet ready to cooperate with OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>3. On 16 January 2012, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note 
verbale to the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic referring to Human Rights 
Council resolution S-18/1, in particular paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15 and 16 thereof, in 
which the Council requested actions from the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. In 
the note verbale, OHCHR requested information on any steps taken or envisaged by the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic on the implementation of the said actions.  
</p>
<p>4. On 24 January and 10 February 2012, the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab 
Republic addressed two separate notes verbales to OHCHR.1 OHCHR is not in a position to 
verify the accuracy of the information submitted by the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic.  
</p>
<p>5. In its note verbale of 10 February 2012, the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic reiterated its position, namely, that a campaign of deception and exaggeration had 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In addition to the notes verbales, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, between 14 and 20 
</p>
<p>February 2012, shared with OHCHR several other reports and documents containing statistics and 
tables on armed attacks on health facilities, educational institutions and transport infrastructure, as 
well as casualty figures in the Syrian military, police and law enforcement bodies as a result of acts of 
alleged terrorist armed groups. OHCHR is unable to attest to the factual accuracy of the information 
provided. The same material was also shared with the commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic. </p>


<p>accompanied the current crisis in the country. According to the Government, the purpose of 
the campaign was to prolong the crisis, as part of a particular political agenda. The 
Government also stated that the campaign was supported by generous financial 
contributions from Arab and Western countries for the purpose of arming groups whose 
main objective was &#8220;to exploit Syrian blood&#8221;. The Government referred to paragraph 29 of 
the report of the League of Arab States observer mission, which had confirmed the 
&#8220;presence of media exaggerations in the reporting on the nature of incidents, the number of 
the dead and injured in events and the demonstrations taking place in some cities&#8221;. 
Furthermore, paragraph 28 of the same report referred to &#8220;the release of false reports from 
several entities regarding bombings and violence in some areas&#8221; and that &#8220;when the 
observers were deployed to those areas to verify those reports, they discovered that they 
were unfounded.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to paragraph 3 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
urged the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to meet its responsibility to protect its 
population, the Government affirmed that it fully realized its responsibility towards its 
people and reaffirmed its efforts to respond to the people&#8217;s legitimate demands for reform 
</p>
<p>in accordance with the Constitution and the State&#8217;s obligations under human rights law. The 
</p>
<p>Government claimed, however, that armed terrorist groups disguised under different names 
had perpetrated crimes against Syrians, and that these groups had attempted to have these 
crimes blamed on the Government instead. The Government pointed out that it was 
constantly working to stop the attacks carried out by armed terrorist groups funded from 
abroad. In that context, the Government urged the international community to support its 
efforts by requesting that those who funded the terrorist groups stop their blatant 
interference in Syrian affairs.  
</p>
<p>7. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to release immediately all prisoners 
of conscience and arbitrarily detained persons, and to grant access for independent 
international monitors to all places of detention, the Government, in its note verbale of 10 
February 2012, explained that four amnesty decrees had been issued, resulting in the release 
of thousands of individuals detained in the context of recent events in the country and who 
did not have Syrian blood on their hands. The Government also pointed out that it had 
released individuals who had been sentenced for charges relating to disrespect for the 
authority of the State or for belonging to parties banned for criminal activities. The 
Government pointed out that it had allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross 
and the League of Arab States observer mission access to Syrian prisons. OHCHR notes 
that, in a separate note verbale dated 24 January 2012 and addressed to OHCHR, the 
Government maintained that 553 detainees had been released on 5 November 2011, 1,180 
on 15 November, 912 on 30 November, 755 on 28 December and 552 on 5 January 2012. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>b</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to initiate prompt, independent and 
impartial investigations in accordance with international standards to end impunity, ensure 
accountability and bring perpetrators to justice, the Government claimed in its note verbale 
of 10 February 2012 that the President of the Syrian Arab Republic, in his speech of 10 
January 2012, had given assurances that there would not be any impunity for anyone and 
that a small number of individuals who had been arrested for murder and other crimes were 
being investigated. The Government also stated that it had formed a national investigative 
commission, which to date had received 4,073 complaints. The commission, the 
Government maintained, was working seriously to prepare objective and accurate reports to 
redress the victims of injustice, while avoiding jumping to conclusions based on fabricated 
and inaccurate information. The Government again referred to the speech of the President 
of 10 January 2012, during which he stated that &#8220;there are no orders from any level of the 
State to open fire on any citizen&#8221; and that &#8220;the use of live fire is not permitted unless in </p>


<p>self-defence and in the defence of citizens&#8221;. The Government explained that the observer 
mission of the League of Arab States had confirmed that, in many cases, the Syrian forces 
had been provoked and forced to shoot in self-defence. The Government added that, in 
paragraph 26 of its report, the observer mission mentioned that the use of force by armed 
groups against the Government forces had resulted in the killing and injuring of a number 
of Syrian forces. The Government further maintained that it had suffered from the enforced 
disappearance of civilians and members of military and security forces in the context of the 
current events, stating that, between 19 December 2011 and 18 January 2012, 178 cases of 
kidnapping by armed groups had been reported (136 civilians, 15 military personnel and 27 
from the authorities). According to the Government, those kidnapped were subjected to 
torture, including electrocution, beating, burning, psychological and physical abuse, and 
rape. The kidnappings had, in several cases, resulted in the killing of those kidnapped, 
whose bodies were then dumped. Armed groups claiming to be carrying arms to defend the 
Syrian people had actually demanded ransom for the release of some 54 people.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>e</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to allow unhindered access to 
medical care without any discrimination or control, and not to intervene in hospitals to 
arrest or abduct any wounded protestors, the Government reiterated its commitment to 
respect the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest standard of physical and 
mental health. The Government pointed out that, according to the Ministry of Health, the 
majority of those admitted by Syrian hospitals had been wounded as a result of gunfire to 
the back of the head or were dead bodies that had been subjected to abuse and had their 
hands and legs severed by armed gangs.2 According to the Government, many of the bodies 
could not be identified because they were severely disfigured. It also stated that medical 
workers had been threatened, kidnapped, raped and murdered. Many of the hospitals, such 
as the national hospital in Homs, had been subjected to terrorist attacks and shelled with 
rocket-propelled grenades. The Government added that armed gangs had killed the deputy 
head of the Syrian Red Crescent on his way to the city of Idlib. It explained that there were 
cases where the terrorists had been given medical treatment by ambulance crews, but once 
the armed groups were informed thereof, they would break into hospitals and humiliate 
doctors and nurses and forcibly take the injured to field hospitals, mosques and private 
homes. In this regard, in its note verbale of 10 February 2012, the Government 
categorically rejected the allegations pertaining to the arrest by the authorities of injured 
persons in hospitals, and described them as fabrications of the media. It also claimed that 
security forces had not impeded any medical or ambulance crew transporting injured 
persons or the provision of ambulance services; on the contrary, the security forces had 
provided ambulances with assistance and protection from terrorist armed groups. The 
Government further stated that the security forces had not arrested nor interrogated the 
patients receiving medical treatment in hospitals. Moreover, none of the medical employees 
or crews had been harassed, threatened or arrested by the army or security forces.  
</p>
<p>10. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>f</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to allow independent and 
international media to operate in the Syrian Arab Republic without undue restrictions, 
harassment or intimidation, to allow access to the Internet and the telecommunications 
network, and to lift censorship on reporting, the Government explained that the Ministry of 
Information had granted 147 permits to Arab and international media in the period from 12 
and 15 January 2012 to give them an opportunity to witness the reality in the country. It 
also explained that the Ministry had done its utmost to facilitate their travel, operation and 
</p>
<p>  
 2 A comprehensive report from the Syrian Ministry of Health was shared with OHCHR on 13 February 
</p>
<p>2012. </p>


<p>protection throughout the Syrian Arab Republic. The Government regretted the fact that, 
despite its efforts, some journalists had been attacked by terrorist armed groups, such as in 
the case of a French journalist and the injuring of his colleague on 12 January 2012, in 
addition to the injury of eight Syrians in the same attack. The Government added that it had 
immediately launched an investigation into this incident, providing a list of existing media 
outlets in the Syrian Arab Republic in an annex to its note verbale of 10 February 2012. In 
that note verbale, the Government also pointed out that other journalists had been harassed, 
threatened and attacked by armed groups in order to force them to broadcast false news, 
such as the killing of journalist Shukri Abu Al Burghol by terrorist groups in Daria (suburb 
of Damascus), the burning of the house owned by Nedal Hmeedy, correspondent of the 
Lebanese satellite television station Al Jadeed, after he was threatened, and also the 
complete razing of the house owned by media personality Ali Jamalo and that of the 
journalist Mustafa Al Meqdad. The Government stated that everyone had been granted free 
access to Internet services, including social networks. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>g</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to respect human rights defenders 
and ensure that there were no reprisals against persons who had cooperated with the 
commission of inquiry, the Government stressed its commitment to respect the rights of 
genuine human rights defenders. In its note verbale of 10 February 2012, the Government 
stated that the Syrian Arab Republic had enacted a new law in 2011 to allow new political 
parties. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>h</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to ensure timely, safe and 
unhindered access for humanitarian actors and the safe passage of humanitarian and 
medical supplies into the country, the Government pointed out that armed groups had tried 
to prevent the arrival of food to the Syrian people by bombing energy supply infrastructure, 
including oil and gas facilities, and by killing drivers transporting food, medicine and 
gasoline. The Government maintained that terrorist groups had made these attacks to create 
the impression that there was a humanitarian crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic, and thus to 
justify what they called a safe humanitarian passage for the transportation of humanitarian 
and medical aid to the Syrian people. In its note verbale of 10 February 2012, the Syrian 
Arab Republic rejected these attempts as aimed merely at justifying foreign intervention in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to paragraph 4 (<i>i</i>) of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to facilitate the voluntary return of 
Syrian refugees and internally displaced persons, the Government reiterated its commitment 
to protect the rights of refugees. It stated, however, that, in the current context, terrorist 
groups were the ones terrorizing populations in specific areas and who had deliberately 
attempted to create sectarian internal displacement, and forced those living in border areas 
to cross into other countries. In some parts of the Syrian Arab Republic, armed terrorist 
groups had cleansed cities and neighbourhoods of specific minority groups who had long 
lived in those areas. The Government also maintained that terrorist groups had also targeted 
mosques and monasteries.  
</p>
<p>14. With regard to paragraph 6 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
urged the Syrian authorities to respect the popular will, aspirations and demands of its 
people, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic claimed that it had taken steps to 
reinforce frameworks aimed at encouraging the expression of the political will of the people 
in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Government stated that it had 
established a committee to redraft the Constitution, which had finalized its work. The newly 
drafted Constitution, which would provide for the establishment of a multiparty system, </p>


<p>human rights and the peaceful transition of power through elections, would be put to a 
referendum in a few weeks. It reported that legislative elections would follow in the 
summer. The Government also stated that additional steps had been taken, including the 
adoption of a local election law in early 2011, which was followed by the election of the 
local council in a democratic and transparent fashion. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to paragraph 7 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
urged the Syrian authorities to take immediate steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals 
in the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular of diplomatic staff, as well as the protection of 
their property, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to its obligations in that regard. 
It added that it was unfortunate that some of the embassies had been subject to attacks by 
angry citizens in disagreement with the position of these countries towards the Syrian Arab 
Republic. Nonetheless, the authorities had taken immediate steps to stop these attacks and 
to prevent any further ones on foreign embassies. In the note verbale of 10 February 2012, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made its apologies for what had happened and stated that it 
had formed a committee that was collaborating closely with the concerned embassies to 
assess damage and offer compensation. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to paragraph 9, in which the Human Rights Council called upon the 
Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with OHCHR, including through the establishment of a 
field presence in the Syrian Arab Republic, the Government stated that it was ready to 
cooperate with various human rights mechanisms within the parameters of their mandates, 
the State&#8217;s international obligations and respect for Syrian sovereignty. The Government 
also stated that it had demonstrated its readiness to cooperate by sharing information and 
material with OHCHR, in the hope that OHCHR could grasp the reality of the situation in 
the Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to paragraph 13 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called upon the Syrian authorities to implement the Plan of Action of the League of Arab 
States in its entirety, without further delay, and urged the Syrian Arab Republic to sign a 
draft protocol on the mission of the League&#8217;s observers to the Syrian Arab Republic, the 
Government stated that it had cooperated with the League to the fullest extent possible, 
including the work plan that had been agreed upon in Doha by the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic and the follow-up committee of the League. Moreover, it had signed 
the League&#8217;s protocol in December 2011, after which the observer mission started its work. 
</p>
<p>The Government had facilitated the work of the observer mission, which itself had 
acknowledged this cooperation. Specifically, the observer mission noted in paragraph 73 of 
its report the &#8220;responsiveness of the Government to ensure the success of the mission and to 
remove obstacles that the mission might face. The Government side has facilitated the 
proceedings of meetings and interviews with any party, and has not imposed any 
restrictions on the movements of the mission or on its meetings with the Syrian citizens, 
either from the opposition or from supporters.&#8221; The Government added that it had accepted 
to extend the work of the observers for a month, until 24 February 2012; the League 
decided, however, to suspend the work of the mission.  
</p>
<p>18.  With regard to paragraph 15 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
urged the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate with all relevant thematic special procedures 
mandate holders, including by allowing country visits, the Government reaffirmed its 
commitment to work with the special procedures mandate holders and had continued to 
provide them with necessary information. The Government regretted the fact that the 
mandate holders had issued predetermined positions against the Government and had joined 
the unfair campaign of propaganda against the Syrian Arab Republic led by armed groups 
and unfriendly countries.  </p>


<p><b> B. Actions by the international community 
</b></p>
<p>19.   In paragraph 10 of its resolution S-18/1, the Human Rights Council decided to 
establish the mandate of Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Syrian 
Arab Republic once the mandate of the commission of inquiry ended, to monitor the 
situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic as well as the implementation of the 
recommendations made by the commission of inquiry addressed to the authorities of the 
Syrian Arab Republic and of the resolutions of the Council on the situation of human rights 
in the Syrian Arab Republic. In response to this decision, the consultative group to the 
President of the Council reviewed all applicants for the post of Special Rapporteur, and 
submitted its recommendations to the President on 13 February 2012. The President will 
appoint the candidate at the nineteenth session of the Council. The Special Rapporteur will 
assume his/her functions upon the conclusion of the mandate of the independent 
commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic. Once appointed, OHCHR will provide 
the mandate holder with the support of a secretariat. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to paragraph 16 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
called upon the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with the commission of inquiry, 
including by granting it access to the country, it should be noted that, to date, the 
commission has not been allowed access to the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to paragraph 19 of the resolution, in which the Human Rights Council 
decided to transmit the report of the commission of inquiry to the Secretary-General for 
appropriate action and transmission to all relevant United Nations bodies, the Secretary-
General transmitted the commission&#8217;s report to the Security Council on 14 December 2011.
