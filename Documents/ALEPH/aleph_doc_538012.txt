Update of Operations 
 
Average production during the fourth quarter of 2006 was approximately 253 BOE’s/day.  Oil 
production in the quarter declined as a result of decreased production volumes at Macleans 
Creek as the wells stabilized.  Gas production was hindered by declines due to facility 
restrictions at Westrose as facility upgrades occurred in October. A new well drilled and tied-
in late December at Carbondale added approximately 160 BOE/day resulting in an exit rate of 
440BOE/day with 550 BOE/day behind pipe and/or choked back production. 
 
Fair Sky has developed a large number of prospects in the three core areas held by the 
company. Development of these opportunities over the coming year will allow the company, 
along with the addition of production presently behind pipe, to show a marked increase in 
production and accordingly increased sales volumes. 
 
For fiscal 2007, Fair Sky’s opportunities for exploration and development include the 
potential for drilling or re-completing approximately 30 or more gross wells at a cost of 
approximately +$28 million including additional land purchases, well completions and tie-ins.  
The extent of execution on this program is dependent upon, among other things the weather, 
availability of services and equipment, initial exploration success and capital resources.   
 
In the fourth quarter, the company saw commodity prices beginning to rise while at the same 
time service costs came off their peak.  Both of these factors should favorably affect the 
economics of the company’s capital spending program and we are closely monitoring them 
both. Management believes that the high quality of its asset base can provide a meaningful 
capital program that will be tailored to the natural gas and oil price environment, service cost 
environment and availability of finances.

Peace River Arch 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Macleans Creek production was 70BOES/day, without 
producing significant water. Production is expected to stabilize at these rates based on 
analogous wells in the area.  Also, wells in this area have shown significant longevity with 
many upwards of 20+ years. In the long term Fair Sky may look at enhancing recovery on the 
properties through water injection to increase reservoir pressure. Macleans Creek production 
royalty rates are subject to a royalty holiday until June, 2007.
At Boundary Lake, a pipeline route was surveyed in the fourth quarter and construction began 
in the first quarter of 2007. Production is scheduled to begin after break-up once all regulatory 
approvals for the facility are obtained by the partner. This will allow production from the 
previously announced gas well that was drilled and tested at 5.3 mmcf/day (FSK 60% WI).  
Initial production from the well is expected to be approximately 2.5mmcf/day (1.5mmcf/day 
net to Fair Sky) with potential production increases through 2007 as facility capacity allows.  
Fair Sky purchased an 100% working interest in an additional section (640 acres) to 
compliment the 1280 acres already obtained in the area. Additional drilling locations are 
being evaluated and a seismic program may be initiated in 2007.
Central Alberta 
 
As of December 31, 2006, Fair Sky is producing approximately 2700mcf/d (net) from 7 gas 
wells in the Carbondale (Morinville), Willingdon (Boian) and Westrose areas with various 
working interests as compared to 1300mcf (net) for the third quarter. This included additional 
production from a new Carbondale well drilled and tied-in late December. During the fourth 
quarter, the company’s production from its wells encountered typical declines. 
 
At Boian, the company reached agreements, obtained regulatory and land owner consents, 
and constructed a separate line bypassing third party facilities to send the gas directly to a 
sales pipeline.  The new line was placed in operation in January of 2007 and additional 
production will be added as work-over work on the existing well is completed. 
 
In the Carbondale area, the company continues to develop potential drilling locations and 
acquire additional land. A new 100% working interest gas well was drilled and tied in late 
December at Carbondale which added approximately 160 BOE/day.  Several new well 
locations are in the process of being licensed, including an exploratory Leduc reef well 
forecast to be drilled in second quarter 2007. Several additional drilling locations are being 
identified for future drilling. 
 
At Westrose, the company continued to produce from its Glaucanite and Colony gas wells. 
Downtime due to facility maintenance and normal well work over operations reduced average 
production in the quarter. Regulatory approval for Glaucanitic downspacing for drilling 
locations is being addressed is expected in fiscal 2007.  
 
On Fair Sky’s Swan Hills Edge play an additional section was acquired (FSK 33.3% WI) to 
expand the existing jointly owned acreage to 3200 acres of land on trend with an existing oil 
and gas field near Grande Prairie, Alberta. Analogous pools in the area have produced in 
excess of 45 million barrels of oil and gas. Purchased seismic data was interpreted in the 
fourth quarter and a geophysical program was initiated in 2007 to record additional data to 
identify prospect locations and produce drilling locations for late 2007.
Central Saskatchewan
4
In December, 2006 and January, 2007, Fair Sky drilled and cased four additional wells to 
make a total of five wells now drilled and cased in the Moose Jaw area of Central 
Saskatchewan. The wells have all encountered significant gas shows while drilling and log 
analysis indicated shallow gas in the Belly River and Manville zone and deeper oil in the 
Bakken zone. The company began its completion program on the wells but activity was halted 
due to break-up and road bans. Depending on completion results a significant exploration and 
development program is anticipated for 2007. 
 
Utah (Uranium) Property 
 
During the fourth quarter, Fair Sky Resources Inc. completed the transfer of its 100% interest 
in a mineral property in Southern Utah USA to Fair Sky Minerals Inc. (“Minerals”) a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Fair Sky Resources.  
 
An airborne geophysical survey including airborne radiometrics, Electric Magnetic Survey 
and Magnetic Coverage over its energy property in Southern Utah was completed.  The 
survey identified a uranium anomaly on property owned 100 % by Fair Sky Minerals Inc.   
 
It is the intent of the company to dispose of Minerals in order to crystallize its value in the 
entity and focus 100% of management’s efforts on the oil and gas company.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Fair Sky Resources Inc.
For the year ended December 31, 2006 
 
The following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is dated April 26, 2007 and 
has been prepared by management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) and should be read in conjunction with the Annual Audited 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Fair Sky Resources Inc. ("Fair Sky" or the "company") 
for the year ended December 31, 2006 and Fair Sky’s statement of reserves data and other oil 
and gas information, both available on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com. 
 
This MD&A refers to operating netback which is not a recognized measure under GAAP. 
Management believes that in addition to net income (loss) and cash flow from operating 
activities, operating netback is a useful supplemental measure as it demonstrates the 
company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to repay debt or fund future growth through 
capital investment. Investors are cautioned, however, that this measure should not be 
construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as an 
indication of Fair Sky’s performance. Fair Sky’s method of calculating this measure may 
differ from the method used by other companies and, accordingly, this measure may not be 
comparable to measures used by other companies. 
 
ADVISORY:  Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels ("bbl") of oil equivalent 
("boe") using six thousand cubic feet ("mcf") of natural gas equal to one boe.  This 
conversion conforms to NI51-101.  Use of the term boe may be misleading, particularly if 
used in isolation.  A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency 
conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value 
equivalency at the wellhead. 
 
 
Forward-Looking Information 
 
Certain  statements  contained  in  this  MD  &  A  constitute  forward-looking  statements.  Such 
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors 
which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Fair Sky to be materially 
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such 
forward-looking  statements.  Such  risk,  uncertainties  and  assumptions  include,  among  other 
things:  general  economic  and  business  conditions;  changing  foreign  exchange  rates;  the 
receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals;  the  availability  of  sufficient  capital;  the  estimated 
cost and availability of funding for the continued exploration and development of Fair Sky's 
prospects; political and economic conditions; and commodity prices.

In the fourth quarter, Fair Sky showed a decrease in total revenues due to a decrease in 
production at Macleans Creek as the wells stabilized after initial flush production.  As well, 
the partner at Westrose carried out facility upgrades over the month of October and sales 
showed a decline due to softening in prices. One new well was drilled and tied in at 
Carbondale in late December with initial production of 1000mcf/d (100% FSK WI). 
 
 Total Assets increased by approximately $4,000,000 in the quarter as a result of the 
company’s drilling program.  Five wells were drilled and cased in the month of December 
along with one completion and tie in.

Sales of oil decreased in the fourth quarter based on decreased production volumes at 
Macleans Creek as the wells stabilized.  Gas sales were hindered by declines in prices and 
facility restrictions at Westrose due to facility upgrades in October.  Fourth quarter production 
averaged 253 BOE/day compared to 328 BOE/day in the third quarter. A new well was 
drilled and tied-in late December at Carbondale which added approximately 160 BOE/day 
resulting in an exit rate of 520 BOE/day gross (440BOE/day net) with approximately 550 net 
BOE/day behind pipe and/or choked back production, a significant percentage of which is 
from the Boundary Lake area. 
 
Sales of oil and gas increased substantially over fiscal 2005 as Fair Sky’s first significant 
producing asset only came online in the fourth quarter of 2005.  During 2006, the company 
brought 2 (100% WI) oil wells and 3 gross (2.6 net) gas wells on production.  At year end, 
these wells were producing 440 net BOE/day for the company compared to the fiscal 2005 
exit rate of 48 net BOE/day. 
 
Oil prices averaged $61.48/bbl for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $64.58 for fiscal 2006 
compared to $44.74 for fiscal 2005. Gas sold for $ 6.94 for the fourth quarter of 2006 and 
$6.43 for fiscal 2006 compared to $9.64 for fiscal 2005. Natural gas liquids prices were 
$42.97 for the fourth quarter and $51.35 for fiscal 2006.

G&A rose due to a number of minor issues during the fourth quarter.  Costs related to 
yearly expenses previously not accrued were recorded related to listing fees and the 
audit fees.  Approximately $50,000 was expensed from current assets after a review 
of the balances by the new accounting team.  Expenses also increased as a result of 
the increased investment the company made in staffing during the quarter.  With the 
recent additions, management believes the company has the foundation in place to 
develop the large productive land base now held in three key areas of Western Canada 
and execute on its business strategy.  Going forward, per BOE G&A costs should 
decline as the G&A cost increases required to support future production growth 
should be minimal. 
 
Liquidity & capital resources 
 
As of December 31, 2006, the company had a net bank indebtedness of $3,905,081 compared 
to $3,937,547 at September 30, 2006 and a cash balance of $6,286,936 at December 31, 2005. 
Working capital deficiency, including bank indebtedness, was $6,039,459 at the end of 
December 2006.   The working capital deficiency is a function of the high number of wells 
drilled in December and is supported by the company’s $7,200,000 credit facility. 
 
As a small exploration oil and gas company, Fair Sky continues to require greater funds than 
its operations can provide to fully exploit its inventory of opportunities.  As such, the
10
company intends to address further capital needs through further financings from the capital 
markets, positive cash flow from operations, increased credit facilities and recurring reviews 
of non-core properties for potential disposal.  The extent to which the company can execute 
on its business plan in fiscal 2007 will be dependent on the level of funding that can be raised 
during the year. 
 
On April 11, 2007, the company announced the offering for a private placement of 2,500,000 
shares on a flow-through basis at a price of $2.05 per share for gross proceeds of $5,125,000.  
On April 17, 2007 the company closed on the first $2,999,969 of the offering and efforts 
continue to market the rest of the offering. 
 
At December 31, 2006 the company had various tax pools totalling $19.4 million available 
for use in future years to reduce taxable income.  
 
 
Commitments

Note 1
Note 2
-  Nature of Operations
Fair Sky Resources Inc. (the “company”) commenced operations in 2004.  The 
company’s  principal  business  activities  include  the  evaluation,  acquisition, 
exploration and development of oil and gas properties in Western Canada.
-  Significant Accounting Policies
a)  Property and equipment
i.
Petroleum and natural gas properties and production equipment
The company follows the Canadian accounting standards guideline on full 
cost  accounting  for  its  petroleum  and  gas  operations,  whereby  all  costs 
associated with the acquisition of, exploration for and the development of 
petroleum  and  natural  gas  reserves,  including  asset  retirement  costs,  are 
capitalized and accumulated in a single Canadian cost centre.  Such costs 
include 
acquisition,  drilling,  geological  and  geophysical 
expenditures,  lease  rentals  on  non-producing  properties,  equipment  costs 
and  overhead  expenses  directly  related  to  exploration  and  development 
activities.
lease
Proceeds from the disposition of petroleum and natural gas properties are 
accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  capitalized  costs,  with  no  gain  or  loss 
recognized, unless such disposition would alter the rate of depletion and 
depreciation by 20% or more.
Depletion and depreciation
ii.
Depletion  and  depreciation  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  is 
calculated  using  the  unit  of  production  method  based  upon  production 
volumes, before royalties, in relation to total proved petroleum and natural 
gas reserves, as estimated by independent engineers. In determining costs 
subject  to  depletion,  the  Company  includes  estimated  future  costs  to  be 
incurred  in  developing  proved  reserves  and  excludes  estimated  salvage 
values. The cost of undeveloped properties are excluded from costs subject 
to depletion until it is determined that proved reserves are attributable to 
the property or impairment has occurred. For depletion and depreciation 
purposes,  natural  gas  volumes  are  converted  to  equivalent  oil  volumes 
based upon a relative energy content of six thousand cubic feet of natural 
gas to one barrel of oil.
iii.
Mineral property interests
Direct costs relating to the acquisition, exploration and development of 
mineral properties, including interest on borrowings directly related to a 
property, are capitalized on an area of interest basis.  When the company 
is  the  operator  of  a  project  and  incurs  costs  on  behalf  of  joint  venture 
partners, these costs are periodically charged back to the partners and are 
recorded  as  operator  recoveries.    Operator  recoveries  are  credited  to 
exploration  costs.    Cumulative  expenditures  will  be  charged  against 
income,  through  unit-of-production  depletion,  when  properties  are 
developed to the stage of commercial production.  Where the company's 
exploration  commitments  for  an  area  of  interest  are  performed  under
option  agreements  with  a  third  party,  the  proceeds  of  any  option 
payments under such agreements are applied to the area of interest to the 
extent of costs incurred.  The excess, if any, is credited to operations.  If 
an  area  of  interest  is  abandoned  or  management  determines  there  is  a 
permanent and significant decline in value, the related costs are charged 
to operations.
Office equipment
iv.
Office  equipment  is  stated  at  cost.    Depreciation  is  provided  using  the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
5 years
5 years
3 years
over the lease term
Furniture 
Office equipment 
Computer hardware 
Leasehold improvements
v.
Ceiling test
Under the full cost method of accounting, a “ceiling test” is performed to 
recognize  and  measure  impairment,  if  any,  of  the  carrying  amount  of 
petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties.  Impairment  is  recognized  if  the 
carrying amount of petroleum and natural gas properties, less the cost of 
undeveloped  properties  not  subject  to  depletion,  exceeds  the  estimated 
undiscounted future cash flows from the Company’s proved reserves. The 
future cash flows are based on a forecast of prices and costs, as provided 
by  an  independent  third  party.  If  recognized,  the  magnitude  of  the 
impairment is then measured by comparing the adjusted carrying amount 
to the estimated discounted future cash flows from the company’s proved 
and probable reserves. The future cash flows are discounted at the risk-free 
interest rate, using forecasted prices and costs, and are exclusive of indirect 
costs  such  as  interest  charges,  general  and  administrative  expenses  and 
future income taxes.
vi.
Mineral properties
An  independent  valuation  is  performed  to  recognize  and  measure 
impairment,  if  any,  of  the  carrying  amount  of  mineral  properties.   
Impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of properties exceeds the 
estimated value of the properties.
b)  Asset retirement obligations
The  fair  value  of  estimated  asset  retirement  obligations  (“ARO”)  is 
recognized  in  the  financial  statements  in  the  period  in  which  they  are 
identified and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The ARO 
includes  the  costs  of  abandonment  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  wells, 
dismantling  and  removing  tangible  equipment,  and  returning  land  to  its 
original  condition.  The  asset  retirement  cost,  equal  to  the  estimated  fair 
value of the asset retirement obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of 
the  related  long-lived  asset.  Asset  retirement  costs  for  petroleum  and 
natural gas assets are amortized using the unit of production method and 
are  included  in  the  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  on  the 
statement of operations.
Increases in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of 
time are recorded as accretion expense on the statement of operations. Any 
revisions to the original estimate of cost or the timing of the cash outflows 
may  result  in  a  charge  to  the  ARO.  Actual  expenditures  incurred  to 
abandon petroleum and natural gas properties reduce the ARO liability.
c)  Joint operations
Substantially  all  of 
the  company's  exploration,  development  and 
production  activities  are  conducted  jointly  with  others.    These  financial 
statements  reflect  only  the  company's  proportionate  interest  in  such 
activities.
d)  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, balances with banks and 
short-term deposits with original maturities of less than three months.
e)  Flow-through equity instruments
The  resource  expenditure  deductions  for  income  tax  purposes  related  to 
exploration  and  development  activities  funded  by  flow-through  share 
arrangements are renounced to shareholders. To recognize the foregone tax 
benefits to the company, the carrying value of the shares issued is reduced 
by the tax effect of the tax benefits renounced to subscribers. The tax effect 
is  recorded  on  the  date  that  the  renouncement  forms  are  filed  with  the 
taxation authorities.
f)  Stock-based compensation
The  company  follows  the  fair  value  method  of  accounting  for  stock 
options  granted  to  directors,  officers,  employees  and  consultants.  Fair 
value  is  determined  at  the  grant  date  using  the  Black-Scholes  option 
pricing  model.  The  value  attributed  to  options  is  recognized  over  the 
vesting period as stock based compensation expense with a corresponding 
credit to contributed surplus. The contributed surplus balance is reduced as 
the options are exercised with the amount initially recorded being credited 
to share capital.
g)  Revenue recognition
Revenue from petroleum and natural gas is recognized based on volumes 
delivered to customers at contractual delivery points and rates. The costs 
associated  with  the  delivery,  including  operating  transportation,  and 
production based royalties are recognized in the same period in which the 
related revenue is earned.
h)  Income taxes
The company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. 
Under this method, future tax assets and liabilities are determined based on 
differences  between  financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and 
liabilities, and measured using the substantively enacted tax rates and laws 
that  will  be  in  effect  when  the  differences  are  expected  to  reverse.  The
effect  on  future  tax  assets  and  liabilities  of  a  change  in  tax  rates  is 
recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  in  which  the  change  becomes 
substantively  enacted.  A  valuation  allowance  is  recorded  against  any 
future income tax asset if the company is not “more likely than not” to be 
able  to  utilize  the  tax  deductions  associated  with  the  future  income  tax 
asset.
i)  Per share amounts
Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing earnings (loss) 
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the 
period.  Diluted  per  share  amounts  reflect  potential  dilution  that  could 
occur  if  securities  or  other  contracts  to  issue  common  shares  were 
exercised or converted to common shares. The treasury stock method of 
calculating  diluted  per  share  amounts  is  used  whereby  any  proceeds 
received from the exercise of in-the-money stock options or warrants are 
assumed  to  be  used  to  purchase  common  shares  of  the  company  at  the 
average market price during the year.
j)  Measurement uncertainty
The  timely  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with 
Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles 
that 
management make estimates that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, 
revenues  and  expenses  as  they  primarily  relate  to  unsettled  transactions 
and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, actual 
results could differ from those estimated.
requires
Specifically,  the  amounts  recorded  for  depletion,  depreciation  and 
amortization  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties,  the  provision  for 
asset  retirement  obligation  costs,  the  ceiling  test  calculation  and  the  tax 
provision  are  based  on  estimates  of  proved  reserves,  production  rates, 
commodity  prices,  future  costs  and  other  relevant  assumptions.  The 
amounts  recorded  relating  to  fair  values  of  stock  options  are  based  on 
estimates of future volatility of the company’s share price, expected lives 
of the options, expected dividends to be paid by the company, and other 
relevant  assumptions.  By  their  nature,  these  estimates  are  subject  to 
measurement  uncertainty  and  the  effect  on  the  financial  statements  of 
changes in such estimates in future periods could be significant.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the company capitalized general 
and administrative expenses in the amount of $244,284 (2005 - $Nil) related 
to exploration and development expenditures.
As  at  December  31,  2006,  costs  totaling  $1,232,946  related  to  mineral 
property interests have been excluded from assets subject to depletion, while 
estimated future development costs of $390,000 (2005 - $276,000) related to 
proven reserves, were included in the calculation of depletion expense.
In 2005, the company acquired an interest in certain mineral claims in Iron 
County  of  the  State  of  Utah.  The  company  incurred  additional  mineral 
property  expenditures  of  $815,164  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006 
consisting of additional mineral claim costs and geological and geophysical 
expenditures.
The company performed a ceiling test calculation at December 31, 2006 to 
assess recoverable value of property and equipment. The oil and gas prices 
used in the calculation are based on the benchmark commodity price forecast 
of our independent reserve evaluators in the January 1, 2007 reserve report as 
follows:

Based  on  these  assumptions,  the  undiscounted  value  of  future  net  revenues 
from the company’s proved reserves exceeded the carrying value of property 
and equipment as at December 31, 2006.
-  Bank Indebtedness
The  company  maintains  an  operating  credit  facility.    The  maximum  amount 
available  under  the  facility  is  $7,200,000  and  facility  bears  interest  at  prime 
plus one eighth of one percent.  Security on the credit facility is a minimum
amount  of  $10,000,000  over  the  Dedicated  Lands  as  reported  in  the  reserve 
report.
-  Asset Retirement Obligations
The company’s asset retirement obligations result from net ownership interests 
in  petroleum  and  natural  gas  assets  including  well  sites.    The  company 
estimates the total discounted amount of the cash flows required to settle its 
asset  retirement  obligations  is  approximately  $441,909  (2005  -  $205,662) 
which  has  been  discounted  using  a  credit  adjusted  risk  free  rate  of  6.125% 
(2005  –  6.25%).  An  inflation  factor  of  1.5%  has  been  applied  to  estimated 
asset  retirement  costs.  The  undiscounted  value  of  the  obligations  is 
approximately $833,491 (2005 - $367,739).  These obligations are to be settled 
based on the economic lives of the underlying assets, which currently extend 
up  to  16  years  into  the  future  and  will  be  funded  from  general  corporate 
resources at the time of abandonment.

Note 10  -  Earnings per common share
The weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
was  10,969,389  (2005  –  5,935,049).    Using  the  treasury  method  of 
calculating  diluted  earnings  per  share,  the  potential  common  shares 
outstanding  during  the  year  was  11,379,685  (2005  –  5,974,981).   Potential 
common shares consist of common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock 
options and warrants, but are excluded from the calculation if their effect is 
anti-dilutive.
Note 11  -  Acquisition and Amalgamation of Primax Capital Corp.
Primax Capital Corp. (“Primax”) was acquired by the company on March 21, 
2006  in  order  to  facilitate  the  conversion  to  a  publicly  listed  company.  
505,000 shares and 50,500 options of the company were issued in return for 
100% of outstanding capital of Primax.  On acquisition and amalgamation, 
Primax had cash on hand of $669,808 and other assets valued at $30,322.
Note 12  -  Financial Instruments
a)  Fair values
The  company’s  financial  instruments  recognized  in  the  balance  sheet 
consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  accounts  receivable,  accounts
payable,  bank  debt  and  accrued  liabilities.  The  carrying  value  of  these 
accounts approximates their fair value due to the relatively short periods to 
maturity of these instruments.
b)  Commodity price risk
The company's operations are at risk to commodity price fluctuations for 
the delivery of natural gas and crude oil. The company has not entered 
into any hedging arrangements.
c)  Credit risk
Substantially  all  the  company's  accounts  receivable  are  with  customers 
and joint venture partners in the oil and gas industry and are subject to 
normal industry credit risks.
Note 13  -  Subsequent events
On  April  17,  2007,  the  company  closed  on  the  private  placement  of 
1,463,400 common shares issued on a flow through basis for $2.05 per share 
for total proceeds of $2,999,969.
ADVISORY:  Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels ("bbl") of oil equivalent ("boe") 
using six thousand cubic feet ("mcf") of natural gas equal to one boe.  This conversion conforms to 
NI51-101.  Use of the term boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A boe conversion 
ration of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at 
the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
