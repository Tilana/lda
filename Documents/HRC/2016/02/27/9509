</p>
<p>*  This document was submitted late so as to include the most up-to-date information possible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In accordance with the mandate entrusted to her in Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 2002/18, 2003/13, 2004/11 and 2005/12 and which the Human Rights Council 
extended in its decision 1/102, the Personal Representative of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights made several attempts to contact the Cuban authorities to 
initiate a dialogue with them in order to fulfil her mandate of examining the situation of human 
rights in Cuba. 
</p>
<p> The Personal Representative of the High Commissioner has received no reply from 
the Cuban authorities.  On the contrary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeated the 
Government&#8217;s refusal to recognize her mandate at a meeting of the Human Rights Council 
on 26 September 2006. 
</p>
<p> Despite these difficulties, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner has 
made an effort to carry out an objective and impartial assessment of the evolution of the situation 
in Cuba in relation to civil and political rights, in accordance with her mandate.  She gave a 
hearing to non-governmental organizations.  She familiarized herself with all the documents 
relating to Cuba which were made available to her by the Office of the High Commissioner and 
the special rapporteurs.  She also familiarized herself with the 2005 report of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p> Positive aspects must once again be noted in the sphere of economic, social and cultural 
rights, especially in the areas of education and health, where the Cuban authorities are making 
major efforts, in particular as regards funding. 
 Their efforts are all the more significant given the disastrous and lasting economic and 
social effects - compounded in 2004 - of the embargo imposed on the Cuban population over 
40 years ago, as well as its impacts on civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p> The scope of the embargo has been increased as a result of tighter economic and financial 
restrictions that significantly limit the movement of persons, which the United States of America 
imposed in May 2004.  They included, in particular, weight restrictions on registered luggage, 
family visits limited to one every three years, fewer educational exchanges and restrictions on 
sporting exchanges. 
</p>
<p> On 8 November 2006, with the support of an overwhelming majority of Member States, 
the General Assembly adopted resolution 61/11 on the necessity of ending the economic, 
commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. 
</p>
<p> The tension between Cuba and the United States of America has created a climate which 
is far from conducive to the development of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.  
United States laws and the funding provided for &#8220;building democracy in Cuba&#8221; make members 
of the political opposition on the island appear to be sympathetic to foreign influences and 
provide the Cuban authorities with an opportunity to tighten repression against them. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> It is worth recalling the unprecedented wave of repression that was unleashed in 
March-April 2003 in Cuba, the pretext being the active role played by the United States Interests 
Section in Havana vis-&#224;-vis the political opposition.  Nearly 80 members of civil society were 
arrested.  They were tried and sentenced to very long prison terms ranging from 6 to 28 years, 
either under article 91 of the Criminal Code, or on the basis of article 91 combined with the 
provisions of Act No. 88 on acts &#8220;contrary to the independence and integrity of the State&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The prosecution cited the publication of articles or interviews in the media, 
communication with international non-governmental organizations and exiles in the 
United States or in Europe, possession of audio or video cassettes originating from the 
United States Interests Section in Havana, and communication with groups which were not 
officially recognized - trade unions, professional associations and independent Cuban academic 
groups. 
</p>
<p> Those arrested were tried in very short order:  a few weeks, or even a few days, in trials 
not open to the public.  The accused were assisted by counsel who did not belong to an 
independent bar association.  They are currently being held in conditions affecting their physical 
and mental health which are all the more worrying as the Cuban authorities have provided the 
High Commissioner and the special rapporteurs who signed the urgent appeals with very brief 
information about them, or none. 
</p>
<p> In 2005 and 2006, more people were arrested and given disproportionate sentences for 
expressing dissident political opinions. 
</p>
<p> The appeal to the Cuban authorities made by the Personal Representative of the 
High Commissioner on 28 July 2005 has gone unanswered. 
</p>
<p> Nine urgent appeals were made in 2006, either separately or jointly, by special 
procedures (Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health). 
 The Personal Representative of the High Commissioner has drawn up 
10 recommendations intended to put an end to the current situation through restoration of the 
guaranteed fundamental rights of citizens in the country and international protection of those 
rights through Cuba&#8217;s accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as 
well as its two optional protocols and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 2002/18, the Commission on Human Rights requested the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take the steps necessary to send a 
personal representative with a view to cooperation between her Office and the Government of 
Cuba in the implementation of the resolution.  In its resolution 2003/13, the Commission, after 
expressing its satisfaction with the appointment of Christine Chanet as Personal Representative 
of the High Commissioner, requested the Government of Cuba to receive her and provide her 
with all the facilities necessary for her to fulfil her mandate.  The Commission reiterated that 
request in its resolution 2004/11.  In its resolution 2005/12, the Commission renewed the 
mandate of the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner.  The Human Rights Council 
decided in 2006 to extend her mandate, in its decision 1/102. 
</p>
<p>2. On 6 February and 12 May 2003, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner, 
by a letter addressed to the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva, invited the Cuban authorities to meet her with a view to planning a constructive 
dialogue with her.  On 30 May 2003, the High Commissioner sent a letter backing up this 
request.  On 26 June 2003, the Cuban authorities notified the High Commissioner that they did 
not recognize the Personal Representative&#8217;s mandate. 
</p>
<p>3. Nevertheless, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner has attempted to 
establish contact with the Cuban authorities each year, most recently on 19 and 28 July 2005.  
Her requests, like the previous ones, met with no response. 
</p>
<p>4. In these circumstances, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner gathered 
information from the Commission&#8217;s thematic special rapporteurs who had had occasion to 
inquire into the situation of human rights in Cuba during the period under consideration, and 
from non-governmental organizations.  She also studied the 2005 report of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights on the subject. 
</p>
<p><b>I. FACTORS HINDERING THE REALIZATION 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA 
</b></p>
<p>5. The economic, trade and financial embargo on Cuba, which has been in force for 
over 40 years, has been regularly condemned by the United Nations General Assembly over the 
past 14 years.  Notwithstanding the resolutions that have been adopted, the initial blockade was 
strengthened in 1992 by the Torricelli Act (Cuban Democracy Act) and in 1996 by the 
Helms-Burton Act (Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act). 
</p>
<p>6. In its resolution 58/7 of 4 November 2003, the General Assembly requested the 
Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the 
United Nations system, to prepare a report on the impact of the embargo against Cuba, in the 
light of the purposes and principles of the Charter and international law.  In his reports of 
28 August and 5 October 2004 (A/59/302, Parts I and II), the Secretary-General transmitted the 
replies from Governments and United Nations organs and agencies on the implementation of this 
resolution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. The restrictions imposed by the embargo help to deprive Cuba of vital access to 
medicines, new scientific and medical technology, food, chemical water treatment and 
electricity.  The disastrous effects of the embargo in terms of the economic, social and cultural 
rights of the Cuban people have been denounced by the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health Organization (see all the reports 
issued by these specialized agencies in 2002). 
</p>
<p>8. The embargo, and particularly the Torricelli and Helms-Burton acts, also have serious 
impacts in terms of the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens, by provoking a reaction on the 
part of the Cuban authorities, who take the opportunity offered by a foreign State&#8217;s interference 
in Cuban domestic policy to adopt repressive laws, such as Act No. 88 on &#8220;protection of Cuba&#8217;s 
national and economic independence&#8221;.  As the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Cuba, Carl-Johan Groth, noted in 1997 in his report to the Commission at its fifty-third 
session, by means of the above-mentioned laws &#8220;the United States of America assumes the right 
to be the outside party that determines the rules for converting the current totalitarian system into 
a different, more pluralist one&#8221; (E/CN.4/1997/53, para. 46). 
</p>
<p>9. As a result, many Cuban citizens who are regarded by the Government of Cuba as being 
involved in this effort are identified as &#8220;mercenaries working for foreign interests&#8221; who should 
be punished under repressive laws such as Act No. 88. 
</p>
<p>10. President Carter, when preparing his report of 21 May 2002 following his visit to Cuba, 
pointed out that the best-known dissidents are unanimous in opposing the strengthening of a very 
hard United States line towards Cuba, as well as any funding of their activities - which might 
substantiate the claim, long upheld by President Castro, that they are &#8220;lackeys of Washington&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. The difficulties the Cuban population has encountered as a result of the embargo have 
been compounded since 2004, particularly as a result of the tighter economic and financial 
restrictions imposed by the United States in May.  These measures are supplemented by 
significant limitations on the movement of persons and goods.  Consequently: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Family visits by Cuban-Americans are limited to one every three years instead of 
one a year; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Family members can only send parcels to their immediate relatives; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The authorized daily allowance visitors can bring into Cuba has been cut by 
two thirds. 
</p>
<p>These restrictions constitute arbitrary interference in the private and family lives of individuals 
and a disproportionate hindrance to their freedom of movement, thereby infringing on the 
exercise of their fundamental rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.</b> <b> POSITIVE ASPECTS 
</b></p>
<p>12. Despite a particularly unfavourable environment, the efforts of the Government of Cuba, 
especially in the budgetary field, have enabled it to maintain a sound health system which has 
helped to lower infant mortality and extend the life expectancy of all its citizens. 
</p>
<p>13. Where education is concerned, 100 per cent of children attend school, and data from the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and UNESCO place Cuba among the 
leading United Nations Member States in respect of school success rates, particularly in 
mathematics. 
</p>
<p>14. Illiteracy (now 0.2 per cent) is being wiped out. 
</p>
<p>15. In efforts to combat discrimination against women, the level of female employment in the 
public sector has stood at 49.6 per cent since 1996, and there has been a steady rise in the 
proportion of women in the National Assembly and the judiciary, and in decision-making posts. 
</p><p>16. Cuba has ratified a number of conventions in the field of human rights and has submitted 
reports to the appropriate treaty organs. 
</p>
<p>17. In 2004, the Cuban authorities released 18 prisoners on health grounds, and, in 2006, 
H&#233;ctor Palacios Ru&#237;z was released on parole on health grounds. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SUBJECTS OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p>18. One subject of concern relates primarily to the arrest of almost 80 persons in 
March-April 2003 in what the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention regards as arbitrary 
detention.  In its opinion No. 9/2003, the Working Group categorized them as persons detained 
in contravention of articles 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (see 
E/CN.4/2004/3/Add.1).<b>  </b>These persons were arrested while working as journalists, writers, 
members of associations, human rights defenders or members of opposition trade unions and 
political parties. 
</p>
<p>19. Most of those detained support the Varela project, which involves the collection of 
signatures for the organization of a referendum on changing the electoral system and fostering 
other legislative reforms. 
</p>
<p>20. The charges levelled against the accused persons fall in some cases solely under 
article 91 of the Cuban Criminal Code, covering acts contrary to the independence or integrity of 
the State, and in others under article 91 combined with Act No. 88, on protection of Cuba&#8217;s 
national and economic independence. 
</p>
<p>21. Several of the accused persons have been charged with such actions as receiving funds 
from foreign countries or engaging in activities deemed to be subversive by the State, giving 
interviews to Radio Mart&#237;, a network broadcasting from the United States, communicating with 
international human rights organizations, possessing radio or video equipment, or participating in 
trade unions, associations or academic groups deemed to be &#8220;counter-revolutionary&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. These persons were tried in very short order, sometimes within a few days, denying them 
sufficient time to prepare their defence.<b>  </b>Neither independent counsel nor diplomats nor foreign 
journalists were allowed to attend these trials.<b>  </b>Prison terms ranging from 6 to 28 years were 
imposed. 
</p>
<p>23. Moreover, in 2005 and 2006 more people were arrested and convicted for openly 
expressing dissident political opinions.<b>  </b>These people continued to suffer harassment, 
intimidation and censorship after their release. 
</p>
<p>24. On 28 July 2005, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner sent a letter to 
Cuba seeking information on the situation of 9 persons still being held following the arrest 
of 33 persons by the security services during a demonstration in front of the French Embassy in 
Havana on 22 July 2005.<b>  </b>On 26 July 2005, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Chairperson of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention had sent an urgent appeal on the same subject. 
25. The persons concerned are:<b>  </b>Santiago Valdeolla P&#233;rez, Julio C&#233;sar L&#243;pez Rodr&#237;guez, 
Francisco Mour&#233; Saladrigas, Oscar Mario Gonz&#225;lez, Miguel L&#243;pez Santos, Jes&#250;s Adolfo Reyes, 
Ra&#250;l Mart&#237;nez Prieto, Ricardo Medina Salabarria and Ren&#233; G&#243;mez Manzano. 
</p>
<p>26. The Personal Representative of the High Commissioner has not received any response to 
her request for information made on 28 July 2005. 
</p>
<p>27. In May 2005, a number of journalists and members of the European Parliament were 
deported from Cuba. 
</p>
<p>28. According to Amnesty International, Ren&#233; Montes de Oca Martija, Roberto de Jes&#250;s 
Guerra P&#233;rez, Emilio Leyva P&#233;rez, L&#225;zaro Alonso Rom&#225;n and Manuel P&#233;rez Soria are due to go 
on trial on 19 and 20 December 2006 for public disorder.  They were arrested on 13 July 2005 
for participating in a peaceful demonstration.  There are serious concerns over the trial since, as 
noted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Cuban legal system offers no 
guarantees of independence. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent nine urgent 
appeals to the Cuban authorities in 2006; the Cuban authorities either did not reply, or disputed 
the reported events. 
</p>
<p>30. The Personal Representative of the High Commissioner is alarmed at the allegations of 
ill-treatment in detention submitted by families of prisoners.<b>  </b>Food and hygiene are substandard 
and medical care either unavailable or inappropriate.<b>  </b>Some prisoners are kept in solitary 
confinement, while others are subjected to dangerous levels of overcrowding with ordinary 
prisoners.<b>  </b>There have been several reports of guards humiliating and even striking prisoners.<b>  
</b>Relatives encounter many problems when trying to arrange visits to prisoners. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. Several prisoners have been on particularly stressful hunger strikes.<b>  </b>In that regard, the 
Personal Representative of the High Commissioner has taken note of the appeal in favour of 
three hunger strikers issued on 29 September 2005 by the European Union. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>32. The difficulties resulting from the embargo have been exacerbated during the reporting 
period. 
</p>
<p>33. According to opinion No. 9/2003 of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, 59 people are still in arbitrary detention.<b>  </b>Further arrests and detentions in 2005 
and 2006 should be added to this total. 
</p>
<p>34. In addition, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner considers that the 
suffering inflicted on the people of Cuba as a result of the embargo is compounded by 
restrictions on the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals; the Cuban authorities have 
the power to eliminate such restrictions.<b>  </b>With the aim of securing the progress called for in the 
above-mentioned resolutions, the Personal Representative of the High Commissioner herewith 
reiterates her recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>35. <b>The Personal Representative of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
recommends that the Government of Cuba should take the following measures: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Halt the prosecution of citizens who are exercising the rights guaranteed 
under articles 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Release detained persons who have not committed acts of violence against 
individuals and property; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Review laws which lead to criminal prosecutions of persons exercising 
their freedom of expression, demonstration, assembly and association, and in 
particular Act No. 88 and article 91 of the Criminal Code, in order to bring these 
provisions of the law into line with the above-mentioned provisions of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Uphold, without exceptions, the moratorium on the application of the death 
penalty introduced in 2000, with a view to the abolition of the death penalty; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Reform the rules of criminal procedure to bring them into line with the 
requirements of articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Establish a standing independent body with the function of receiving 
complaints from persons claiming that their fundamental rights have been violated; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (g) Review the regulations relating to travel into and out of Cuba in order to 
guarantee freedom of movement as defined in article 13 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Authorize non-governmental organizations to enter Cuba; 
 (i) Foster pluralism in respect of associations, trade unions, organs of the press 
and political parties in Cuba; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its 
optional protocols and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. </b></p>
