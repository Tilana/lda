Occupied Palestinian Territory and the firing of crude rockets, which resulted in the loss of 
two civilian lives and some injuries in southern Israel; </p>

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also calls for</i> urgent international action to put an immediate end to the grave

</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory government, 
responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, including women and members of

such a foundation is an indispensable condition for the full realization of human rights, including 
the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that democracies have embedded institutional advantages incontestably 
favourable to sustainable development, and that when based on the respect for human rights,

necessary checks and balances on Government power,

<p> (<i>d</i>) To address the specific needs of the families of disappeared persons; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reminds</i> States that: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) As proclaimed in article 2 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearances, no State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) All acts of enforced or involuntary disappearance are crimes punishable by 
appropriate penalties, which should take due account of their extreme seriousness under 
criminal law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) They should ensure that their competent authorities proceed immediately to conduct 
impartial inquiries in all circumstances where there is reason to believe that an enforced 
disappearance has occurred in territory under their jurisdiction; 
 (<i>d</i>) If there is reason to believe that an enforced disappearance has occurred in territory 
under their jurisdiction, all the perpetrators of that disappearance must be brought to justice; 
 (<i>e</i>) Impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced disappearances 
and a major obstacle to the elucidation of such cases; 
 (<i>f</i>) As proclaimed in article 11 of the Declaration, all persons deprived of liberty must be 
released in a manner permitting reliable verification that they have actually been released and, 
further, have been released in conditions in which their physical integrity and ability fully to 
exercise their rights are assured; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Its thanks to the many Governments that have cooperated with the Working Group

<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to take legislative, administrative, legal and other steps, including when 
a state of emergency has been declared, at the national and regional levels and in cooperation 
with the United Nations, if appropriate through technical assistance, and to provide the Working 
Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in 
preventing enforced and involuntary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set 
forth in the Declaration;

those organizations to continue their cooperation; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue:

<p><b>7/14.  The right to food 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous resolutions on the issue of the right to food, in particular 
General Assembly resolution 62/164 of 18 December 2007 and Council resolution 6/2 of 
27 September 2007, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights in this 
regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition and the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger is 
recognized, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, adopted 
in Rome on 13 June 2002, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/78 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National 
Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with 
the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the 
World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political 
or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation 
and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food 
security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced </i>that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities 
to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the 
same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to 
global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and 
economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that there has been virtually no progress made on reducing hunger and that it could increase 
dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, given the 
anticipated increase in the world&#8217;s population and the stress on natural resources, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
exacerbating destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on the realization of the right 
to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests 
and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and 
livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the theme &#8220;The right to food&#8221;, chosen by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations to mark World Food Day on 16 October 2007, </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/78 
 page 41 
 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the Final Declaration adopted at the International Conference on Agrarian 
Reform and Rural Development of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
in P&#244;rto Alegre, Brazil, on 10 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and 
therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international 
levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, 
consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from 
hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that more than 6 million children still die every year from 
hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 854 million 
undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the 
absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according 
to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce 
enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world&#8217;s present population; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, 
that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable 
childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from 
malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination 
against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, 
including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that 
women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed 
themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a 
gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms 
addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are 
inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the full 
realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free 
from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt 
national plans to combat hunger, and recognizes in this regard the great efforts and positive 
developments with respect to the right to food in some developing countries and regions, 
including those highlighted in the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/62/289); </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/78 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural 
development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing 
countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation 
and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are 
small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, 
given the increasing cost of inputs, and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds 
and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; and that support by 
States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element key to food 
security and provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national 
efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and 
through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, 
and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also stresses </i>its commitments to promote and protect, without discrimination, the 
economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with international 
human rights obligations and taking into account, as appropriate, the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and 
representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep 
concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, 
and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately 
high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous 
discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization 
of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international 
assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, towards a better realization 
and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms 
for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or natural or man-made 
disasters affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
 15. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for 
developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security 
policies; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Recognizes </i>the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round 
negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international 
conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/78 
 page 43 
 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their international 
policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have 
a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and 
Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of 
financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the 
number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all 
international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim 
of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to 
food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations 
Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people 
at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and 
food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread 
of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in 
particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as 
natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the 
achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary 
responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Calls upon </i>Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant 
stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently 
occurring across Africa and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the 
World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including Southern Africa; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the 
right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common 
projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and 
to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the 
private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring 
sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; </p>

the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians and the construction 
of bypass roads, which change the physical character and demographic composition of the 
occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation 
of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
War of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that Convention; settlements are a 
major obstacle to the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of 
an independent, viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State; </p>

</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli so-called E-1 plan aimed at expanding the Israeli settlement of

East Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and isolating its 
Palestinian population;

<p> (<i>c</i>) The implications for the final status negotiations of the announcement by Israel that 
it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create 
a fait accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would be tantamount to de facto 
annexation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West Jerusalem 
and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev, in violation of international law and relevant 
United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the 
restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated closure of 
the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have created an extremely precarious humanitarian 
situation for the civilian population and impaired the economic and social rights of the 
Palestinian people;

Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem

expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and related activities;

</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges </i>the full implementation of the Access and Movement Agreement 
of 15 November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of the Rafah and Karni crossings, 
which are crucial to the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, as well as the access of 
United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Demands </i>that Israel implement the recommendations regarding the settlements made 
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her report to the Commission on 
Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to the occupied Palestinian territories, 
Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114); </p>

Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian 
civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem;

fourth and sixth sessions (A/HRC/4/19 and A/HRC/6/6), in which he draws the attention of 
Member States to the serious nature of the defamation of all religions and to the promotion of the 
fight against these phenomena by strengthening the role of interreligious and intercultural 
dialogue and promoting reciprocal understanding and joint action to meet the fundamental 
challenges of development, peace and the protection and promotion of human rights, as well as 
the need to complement legal strategies, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating </i>the call made by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to Member States to wage a systematic

and respecting the complementarity of all the freedoms embodied in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights,

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at the recent serious instances of deliberate stereotyping 
of religions, their adherents and sacred persons in the media and by political parties and groups 
in some societies, and at the associated provocation and political exploitation; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of religions 
becomes an aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms 
of target groups and their economic and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Expresses concern </i>at laws or administrative measures that have been specifically 
designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, thereby stigmatizing them and legitimizing

enforcement bodies, the military, civil servants and educators, in the course of their official 
duties, respect all religions and beliefs and do not discriminate against persons on the grounds

provided; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, everyone has the 
right to freedom of expression, and that the exercise of this right carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities, and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but only those provided by 
law and necessary for the respect of the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of 
national security or of public order, or of public health or morals; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulates that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the 
freedom of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to 
religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Deplores </i>the use of printed, audio-visual and electronic media, including the

<p><b>7/25.  Prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as well as other 
relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the sixtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and succeeded by the 
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next day, provides an important 
opportunity for the international community to draw the attention of all States to the significance 
of the Convention and to invite them to redouble their efforts for the prevention and punishment 
of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the crime of genocide<b> </b>is recognized in the Convention as an 
odious scourge which has inflicted great losses on humanity and that further international 
cooperation is required to facilitate the timely prevention and punishment of the crime of 
genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, recognized as such 
by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in the 1948 Convention, and 
bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law might result in genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into consideration </i>that States parties to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of 
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 have 
agreed that no statutory limitation shall apply to such crimes, including the crime of genocide, 
irrespective of the date of their commission, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that impunity for such crimes encourages their occurrence and is a fundamental 
obstacle to the furtherance of cooperation among peoples and the promotion of international 
peace and security, and that fighting impunity for such crimes is an important factor in their 
prevention, </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/78 
 page 71 
 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community in the 
past 60 years, including within the United Nations system, in developing relevant mechanisms 
and practices to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, thereby contributing to the effective 
implementation of the Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, in which the 
Assembly declared genocide a crime under international law, and all subsequent resolutions 
within the United Nations system that have contributed to the establishment and development of 
the process of prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, including Assembly 
resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging with appreciation</i> that genocide is defined among the most serious crimes 
of concern to the international community as a whole in the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, and anticipating that the functioning of the Court with a high number of 
ratifications of the Statute and the functioning of other relevant international criminal tribunals 
will help increase accountability for the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Council is mandated by the General Assembly to address situations of 
violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, and to make 
recommendations thereon, and that it should also promote the effective coordination and 
mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the important contribution of the United Nations human rights 
system to efforts towards preventing situations in which the crime of genocide could be 
committed, </p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its full support for the mandate of the Special Adviser of the 
Secretary-General on the prevention of genocide, who acts, inter alia, as an early warning 
mechanism to prevent potential situations that could result in genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation </i>of the presentation of the reports of the Secretary-General 
submitted to the Council on the implementation of the Five-Point Action Plan and the activities 
of the Special Adviser (E/CN.4/2006/84 and A/HRC/7/37), as well as of the convening of 
two interactive dialogues with the Special Adviser at both the third and current sessions of 
the Council, </p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> the significance of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide as an effective international instrument for the prevention and 
punishment of the crime of genocide; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Expresses its appreciation</i> to all States that have ratified or acceded to the 
Convention, and in particular to the States that have done so in the years following the adoption 
of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/62 of 20 April 2005; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/78 
page 72 
 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon </i>States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention to consider 
doing so as a matter of high priority and, where necessary, to enact national legislation in 
conformity with the provisions of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Reiterates </i>the responsibility of each individual State to protect its population from 
genocide, which entails the prevention of<b> </b>such a crime, including incitement to it, through 
appropriate and necessary means; 
</p>
<p> 5.<b> </b><i>Stresses</i> the importance of enhanced international cooperation, including through the 
United Nations system and through regional organizations, aimed at fostering the principles 
enshrined in the Convention; </p>
<p> 6.<i> Calls upon</i> all States, in order to deter future occurrences of genocide, to cooperate, 
including through the United Nations system, in strengthening appropriate collaboration among 
existing mechanisms that contribute to early detection and prevention of massive, serious and 
systematic violations of human rights, which if not halted, could lead to genocide; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role of the Secretary-General in contributing to prompt 
consideration of early warning or prevention cases, as mandated by Security Council 
resolution 1366 (2001) of 30 August 2001, and the functions of the Special Adviser, who, in 
accordance with his mandate, collects existing information, in particular from within the 
United Nations system, liaises with the United Nations system on activities for the prevention of 
genocide and works to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to analyse and manage 
information relating to genocide or related crimes; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the decisions of the Secretary-General and of the General Assembly, as 
contained in its resolution 62/238, to retain the mandate of the Special Adviser, to upgrade his 
position to the level of Under-Secretary-General and to strengthen his office; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Adviser in the 
performance of his work, to furnish all relevant information requested and to react promptly to 
his urgent appeals; </p>
<p> 10. <i>Underlines</i> the important role of the United Nations human rights system, including 
of the Council, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
relevant special procedures and treaty bodies in addressing the challenge of collating 
information on massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights, and thereby 
contributing to a better understanding and early warning of complex situations that might lead 
to genocide; 
</p>
<p> 11.<i> Encourages</i> the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to further enhance the systematic exchange of 
information between their offices and between the Special Adviser and all relevant special</p>

persons belonging to the national, ethnic, racial or religious groups as outlined in article II of the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance, when addressing complex situations that might lead to 
genocide as defined in the Convention, of a prompt and comprehensive examination of a set of 
multiple factors, including legal factors, the existence of groups at risk, the massive, serious and 
systematic violation of human rights, and the resurgence of systematic discrimination, the 
prevalence of expressions of hate speech targeting persons belonging to national, ethnic, racial or 
religious groups, especially if they are uttered in the context of an actual or potential outbreak of 
violence; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> States to make use of appropriate international and regional forums to 
address the issue of prevention of genocide, including, inter alia, the annual meetings of regional 
and thematic organizations and their related human rights machinery, the preparatory process for 
the Review Conference on the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action and any conferences commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights;

submitted to the Council in order to obtain the views of States, relevant United Nations

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent being

far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw 
from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981 to 
impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has 
resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/78

deterioration in the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied 
Syrian Golan and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli settlement in the occupied Arab 
territories and expressing regret at the constant refusal of Israel to cooperate with and to receive 
the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, international law 
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 
and the relevant provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied 
Syrian Golan,

of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the 
basis of the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for 
the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
 <i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights

</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions of 
the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, particularly Security 
Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel 
to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void 
and without international legal effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its 
decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and 
emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be 
allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan and to desist from its 
repressive measures against them, and from all other practices that obstruct the enjoyment of 
their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, some of 
which are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied 
Territories; </p>

<p> 4. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan to visit 
their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra checkpoint and under

</p>
<p> 7. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be 
taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character and legal status of the 
occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and 
of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have 
no legal effect;

<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all

</p>
<p><b>7/28.  Missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>60. At the time the Council adopted draft resolution A/HRC/7/L.33 (resolution 7/28), it had 
before it the statement of programme budget implications below. Inadvertently, the Council was 
not informed at the meeting that the resolution as amended would not entail any programme </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/78 
 page 193 
 
</p>
<p>budget implications, since it did not include the appointment of an independent expert. 
Subsequently, the Secretariat informed the Council that it would inform the General Assembly, 
in a report on the revised estimates of decisions taken by the Council, on the required 
amendments to the statement to reflect the new terms of the resolution, which do not entail any 
additional resources. 
</p>
<p>61. Under the terms of paragraphs 11 and 25 of its draft resolution 7/L.33, the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Would decide to hold a panel discussion on the question of missing persons at its 
ninth session and to invite the experts of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 
delegates of Governments and non-governmental organizations, as well as national human rights 
institutions and international organizations to participate therein; 
</p>
<p> (b) Would decide also to appoint an independent expert on missing persons to study the 
best practices including cases and facts on missing persons with the purpose of presenting that 
study to the Council at the ninth session. 
</p>
<p>62. For purposes of these estimates, it was assumed that the Council would dedicate a part of 
its ninth session to the panel discussion; the conference servicing costs of the panel were 
therefore expected to be met within the conference servicing entitlements of the Council. Travel 
and daily subsistence allowance requirements for the ICRC experts headquartered in Geneva to 
implement the activities called for in paragraph 24 were also not required. 
</p>
<p>63. Pursuant to the adoption of the draft resolution by the Council, a total amount of $53,500 
would be required to implement the activities, arising from the terms of the resolution as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the independent expert for consultations, one country study and to present a 
report to the panel at the Council ($16,000); 
</p>
<p> (b) Staff costs at the P-3 level for three months to assist the independent expert 
($37,500). 
</p>
<p>64. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the independent expert 
referred to above have not been included under section 23, Human Rights, of the programme 
budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Although it was anticipated that<b> </b>an additional amount of 
$53,500 would be required for the biennium 2008-2009 under section 23, no additional 
resources were requested as the Secretariat would, to the extent possible, absorb the 
additional requirements within the appropriations for section 23, Human Rights, for the 
biennium 2008-2009. 
</p>
<p>65. A consolidated statement of requirements arising from the continuing review by the 
Council in response to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and potential absorptive capacity 
from reduced requirements arising from the amended programme of work under the programme 
budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be reported to the Assembly. The Assembly will also be 
informed at that time of the continuing requirements beyond the biennium 2008-2009 relating to 
decisions made by the Council. </p>

<p> (a) Decided to renew the mandate of the independent expert for a period of one year,
