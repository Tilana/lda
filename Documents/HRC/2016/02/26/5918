</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution 9/2. Human rights and international solidarity 
</b> 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Council on the issue of human rights and international solidarity, including Commission 
</p>
<p>resolution 2005/55 and Council resolutions 6/3 and 7/5, and taking note of the reports presented 
</p>
<p>by the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity, in particular his latest one 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/9/10), 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
</p>
<p>conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>and of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June 1993, 
</p>
<p>States pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
</p>
<p>development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
</p>
<p>international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of 
</p>
<p>obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that 
</p>
<p>sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a 
</p>
<p>complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential 
</p>
<p>in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive 
</p>
<p>development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually 
</p>
<p>and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
</p>
<p>maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of </p>

<p>page 2 
 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
</p>
<p>adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, 
</p>
<p>friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political 
</p>
<p>systems, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing 
</p>
<p>countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
</p>
<p>community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, to 
</p>
<p>make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
</p>
<p>globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
</p>
<p>individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
</p>
<p>particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
</p>
<p>agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
</p>
<p>loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
</p>
<p>vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated to official 
</p>
<p>development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to allocate 
</p>
<p>0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance, and recognizing 
</p>
<p>the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of developing 
</p>
<p>countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
</p>
<p>with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
</p>
<p>sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity to establish new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
</p>
<p>intragenerational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, </p>

<p>   page 3 
 
<i> Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
</p>
<p>component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their responsibilities 
</p>
<p>towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for present and future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
</p>
<p>and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of 
</p>
<p>solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges 
</p>
<p>must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
</p>
<p>principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve 
</p>
<p>help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world problems 
</p>
<p>through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure that the 
</p>
<p>needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, and to 
</p>
<p>hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
</p>
<p>promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their development 
</p>
<p>endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full realization of all human 
</p>
<p>rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, and 
</p>
<p>that it shall be implemented without any conditionality, and on the basis of mutual respect, in full 
</p>
<p>compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular 
</p>
<p>respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated with the 
</p>
<p>fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
</p>
<p>international cooperation in this field; </p>

<p>page 4 
 
 6. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
</p>
<p>organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
</p>
<p>individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the independent 
</p>
<p>expert in his mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him and to give serious 
</p>
<p>consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to visit their 
</p>
<p>countries, to enable him to fulfil his mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft 
</p>
<p>declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in further 
</p>
<p>developing guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting 
</p>
<p>this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all major 
</p>
<p>United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social 
</p>
<p>fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other 
</p>
<p>relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of his 
</p>
<p>mandate; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests </i>the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare inputs to 
</p>
<p>contribute to the elaboration of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
</p>
<p>international solidarity, and to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and 
</p>
<p>principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to submit a report on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>present resolution to the Council at its twelfth session; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to continue its examination of this issue at its twelfth session under 
</p>
<p>agenda item 3.
