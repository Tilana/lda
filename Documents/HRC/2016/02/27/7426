</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was held during the twenty-seventh session of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, on 15 September 2014. It was opened by Jane Connors, Director of the 
</p>

</p>
<p>Federation for Women and Family Planning.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening statement 
</b></p>
<p>5. In her opening statement, Ms. Connors highlighted the fact that the family and the 
</p>
<p>rights of its members were referred to in a range of human rights treaties, in relation to their 
</p>
<p>civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. The treaties provided the normative 
</p>
<p>foundation for the discussion on how to understand protection of the family and its 
</p>
<p>members. They included the rights of adults to marry and found a family, the free and 
</p>
<p>informed consent requirement for entering into marriage, women&#8217;s right to equality within </p>


<p>families, and the provision of protection for children, persons with disabilities and older 
</p>
<p>persons as members of the family. She noted the importance of accepting the diverse forms 
</p>
<p>and functions of families among and within countries, including married couples with or 
</p>
<p>without children; cohabiting couples and their children; single parents and their children; 
</p>
<p>families headed by grandparents or including grandparents; older children caring for 
</p>
<p>siblings and other children; registered partnerships with or without children; and same-sex 
</p>
<p>parents and their children. 
</p>
<p>6. Ms. Connors observed that, despite international legal obligations, women continued 
</p>
<p>to experience discrimination within the family, largely because of stereotypical gender roles 
</p>
<p>that envisaged women as caregivers and men as breadwinners. Consequently, women were 
</p>
<p>often denied equal rights in respect of issues related to marriage, divorce and distribution of 
</p>
<p>marital property, inheritance, custody and adoption. Other serious human rights concerns 
</p>
<p>affecting women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities included violence 
</p>
<p>within families that often went unreported or was accepted and remained unpunished. 
</p>
<p>7. She stressed that the family was the very first unit in which the idea that every 
</p>
<p>individual was entitled to human rights should be fostered and promoted, and accordingly 
</p>
<p>States were required to provide it with the widest possible protection and assistance. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Connors recognized that protection was linked to rights, such as the rights to work, an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living, social security, health, education and cultural rights. As such, 
</p>
<p>one key issue was the burden of unpaid and undervalued care responsibilities within the 
</p>
<p>family. Predominantly undertaken by women, those responsibilities could hamper women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>ability to participate in education and work on an equal basis with men. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>women were economically and socially disadvantaged in both the family and the wider 
</p>
<p>community, and, together with their family, were at heightened risk of poverty. 
</p>
<p>8. Of particular concern was the situation of single-parent families, usually headed by 
</p>
<p>women. Ms. Connors noted that such women carried a double burden of care 
</p>
<p>responsibilities and were frequently employed in precarious jobs without adequate social 
</p>
<p>security coverage.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Presentations of the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>9. Aslan Abashidze outlined the relevant international standards, including article 16, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 3, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which stipulated that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by 
</p>
<p>society and the State&#8221;, and article 10, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provided that &#8220;the widest possible protection 
</p>
<p>and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental 
</p>
<p>group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the 
</p>
<p>care and education of dependent children. Marriage must be entered into with the free 
</p>
<p>consent of the intending spouses&#8221;. He highlighted the fact that article 10 specified that the 
</p>
<p>protection of families included providing assistance to families, and special care to mothers 
</p>
<p>and children, without any discrimination for reasons of parentage or other conditions.  
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Abashidze also highlighted States parties&#8217; obligations under article 2, paragraph 
</p>
<p>1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including the 
</p>
<p>need to take steps to progressively achieve economic and social rights. That should include 
</p>
<p>preventing retrogressive measures that could negatively affect the family, such as 
</p>
<p>cancelling child benefits. He further highlighted the fact that States must protect individual 
</p>
<p>family members from violence and forced separation, and ensure that social assistance was 
</p>
<p>available to families, including affordable housing and where necessary, special measures 
</p>
<p>for mothers and infants.  </p>


<p>11. Hiranthi Wijemanne focused her intervention on the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, noting that the protection of the family was of direct and particular importance to 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. The preamble of that Convention stated that the family was the 
</p>
<p>fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of 
</p>
<p>its members and, as such, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance. It did 
</p>
<p>not refer to a single form of family, instead referencing a variety of different forms. The 
</p>
<p>Convention clearly recognized children as rights-holders, which entailed the right of 
</p>
<p>children not to be discriminated against on any grounds, including the type of family in 
</p>
<p>which they grew up; the right to be heard; and the right to preserve their identity, including 
</p>
<p>nationality, name and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful interference. 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Wijemanne highlighted the fact that, while families could help promote and 
</p>
<p>protect children&#8217;s rights, many faced significant hurdles, including economic crises, job 
</p>
<p>loss, temporary employment, lack of regular income and deprivation of basic services. 
</p>
<p>Owing to poverty and other factors, some children were separated from their parents. In 
</p>
<p>that regard, she highlighted the obligations of States to provide families with protection and 
</p>
<p>support to prevent separation. 
</p>
<p>13. She drew attention to the fact that families could be dangerous places for children, 
</p>
<p>who could experience and/or witness physical and sexual violence, and harmful traditional 
</p>
<p>practices such as child, early and/or forced marriage, so-called honour killings and female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation. In that context, she underscored the fact that article 19, paragraph 1, of 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child obliged States parties to take all appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures to protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, 
</p>
<p>including sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment. 
</p>
<p>14. Karen Bogenschneider described her work organizing family impact seminars, 
</p>
<p>including presentations, briefing papers and discussion sessions that communicated family-
</p>
<p>focused, research-based information to policymakers on timely topics, including child and 
</p>
<p>elder care, parenting, poverty and youth crime. In particular, the seminars encouraged 
</p>
<p>policymakers to build consensus by focusing on the family&#8217;s well-being by asking 
</p>
<p>questions such as: What might the impact of that policy be on families? Would the policy 
</p>
<p>be more effective if families were involved? How does the policy affect individuals&#8217; 
</p>
<p>responsibilities towards other family members? How might it impact family stability? She 
</p>
<p>concluded by suggesting three questions, based on her experiences, for the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council to consider. First, could the Council emphasize those issues on which agreement 
</p>
<p>and consensus were most likely to be reached? Secondly, if so, would that bring more 
</p>
<p>countries to the table, and would there then be more potential for strengthening family-
</p>
<p>centred policies? Third, could the Council involve researchers to help identify which 
</p>
<p>research-based family policies and programmes existed and the impact they might have on 
</p>
<p>family well-being? 
</p>
<p>15. In her presentation, Rosa In&#233;s Floriano Carrera emphasized the importance of taking 
</p>
<p>care of the family unit in conflict and post-conflict situations, since it was usually the 
</p>
<p>family that was most affected by forced migration, disappearances, forced recruitment by 
</p>
<p>armed groups and, in some cases, by members of the same family fighting on different 
</p>
<p>sides. Unless the response took into consideration that complexity, it might do more harm 
</p>
<p>than good, and could bring about further family disintegration. She highlighted the need for 
</p>
<p>both aggregate and disaggregated approaches that recognized individual needs, and 
</p>
<p>suggested that the responses should focus on protecting the family and family links, and on 
</p>
<p>creating a secure base environment. 
</p>
<p>16. Zitha Mokomane outlined some of the challenges families currently faced, and ways 
</p>
<p>to help protect families. The challenges included poverty, the changing structures of 
</p>
<p>families owing to migration, instability and/or dissolution, the breakdown of traditional 
</p>
<p>family structures and non-marital childbearing, and family unfriendly workplace conditions </p>


<p>structured around the assumed existence of a &#8220;male breadwinner/female caregiver&#8221; model. 
</p>
<p>Among the possible pathways to address those challenges, she suggested ensuring income 
</p>
<p>and basic social security, including through cash transfer programmes; developing and 
</p>
<p>effectively implementing evidence-based policies; improving the nexus between 
</p>
<p>policymakers and researchers; and including a stand-alone goal on the family in the post-
</p>
<p>2015 development agenda with measurable, family-focused targets. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Interventions by Council members, observer States and other observers 
</b></p>
<p>17. All participants emphasized the importance of the family. A number of delegations 
</p>
<p>stressed the importance of families as key means of ensuring welfare and stability, 
</p>
<p>promoting traditional values in society and protecting human rights. Others recognized the 
</p>
<p>need to focus discussions on the protection of individuals&#8217; rights within the family, 
</p>
<p>observing that human rights abuses might be experienced in the family by more vulnerable 
</p>
<p>family members such as women, children and the elderly. They also acknowledged the 
</p>
<p>importance of recognizing the diversity of families, which could include same-sex unions, 
</p>
<p>single parents, and adoptive or foster parents.  
</p>
<p>18. Many delegations emphasized the fact that the family should be protected as the 
</p>
<p>fundamental and natural unit of society, and referenced several international and regional 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments in that regard. They recalled that the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explicitly and 
</p>
<p>unambiguously obliged all States to provide protection and support for the family as the 
</p>
<p>natural and fundamental unit of society. Several also referred to article 18 of the African 
</p>
<p>Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which provided that the family was the natural unit 
</p>
<p>and basis of society and obliged States to take care of and protect the physical and moral 
</p>
<p>health of the family.  
</p>
<p>19. Some delegations noted that States had a duty to assist the family unit as the 
</p>
<p>custodian of morals and traditional values recognized by the community, and called on 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including United Nations mechanisms, NGOs and national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, to put the family at the core of their agendas. They perceived the<b> </b>family as an 
</p>
<p>instrumental social unit that contributed to social cohesion, development and human rights, 
</p>
<p>as well as to the preservation of identity, culture and traditional values. They highlighted 
</p>
<p>evidence-based research demonstrating that well-protected families helped improve respect 
</p>
<p>for the rights of women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities, and played a 
</p>
<p>role in eradicating violence against women, reducing child labour and exploitation, and 
</p>
<p>lowering dropout rates from primary education. Several speakers raised the possible role 
</p>
<p>that families could play in promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty, and 
</p>
<p>called for such an influential social institution not to be ignored in the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda. 
</p>
<p>20. Several delegations regretted that, 20 years after the International Year of the 
</p>
<p>Family, some countries were reluctant to recognize the value of the family unit and accept 
</p>
<p>their respective legal obligations. The point was made that different challenges had cast a 
</p>
<p>negative shadow on the status of the family in society, increased its vulnerability to 
</p>
<p>disintegration and decreased its resilience. The family as a leading societal institution 
</p>
<p>should never be perceived as a force which aimed to oppose the interests, rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms of individuals.  
</p>
<p>21. Several delegations drew attention to situations in which homes had been 
</p>
<p>demolished, land confiscated and families broken apart. They highlighted the role of 
</p>
<p>terrorist groups in undermining the rights of families and individuals, including by 
</p>
<p>depriving children of the care of family members and placing huge financial burdens on </p>


<p>families who lost their main breadwinner. The impact of economic sanctions on the family 
</p>
<p>was also raised.  
</p>
<p>22. Several delegations highlighted the importance of the family in their cultures and 
</p>
<p>communities, and its contribution to stability. They outlined some of their achievements in 
</p>
<p>protecting the family through legislation, recognizing it as the natural and fundamental 
</p>
<p>group unit of society, entitled to protection by law.  
</p>
<p>23. Other delegations reiterated that the diversity of families was recognized in General 
</p>
<p>Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions and in the legislation of many countries. 
</p>
<p>That diversity could comprise single-parent families formed by choice or resulting from 
</p>
<p>divorce, separation, or death; child-headed households; extended and intergenerational 
</p>
<p>families; and same-sex couples, all of which required different support. They called on the 
</p>
<p>international community to respect that diversity, which should be reflected in family-
</p>
<p>centred policies and programmes. Several delegations indicated that they had been reluctant 
</p>
<p>to support the holding of the panel discussion, as Human Rights Council resolution 26/11 
</p>
<p>did not refer to family diversity and the individual rights of family members.  
</p>
<p>24. Many delegations noted that individuals within families needed and were entitled to 
</p>
<p>protection. They were the rights-holders, not the family, and as such, States bore the 
</p>
<p>primary responsibility to ensure that their rights were adequately protected, no matter what 
</p>
<p>form their family took. Citing the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) report 
</p>
<p>entitled &#8220;Hidden in Plain Sight&#8221;, which drew attention to the violence that could occur 
</p>
<p>within families in all regions of the world, many delegations highlighted the fact that the 
</p>
<p>family was not always the safest place for individuals, especially women, children and the 
</p>
<p>elderly. Specific examples included forcing female victims of sexual assault to marry the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator of the assault, and child, early and forced marriages, which were recognized by 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council as violations, abuse or impairment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>25. Several delegations clarified that States were obliged to promote and provide 
</p>
<p>support to the family in order to ensure that it could undertake its care responsibilities. They 
</p>
<p>indicated that States must consider the social and economic factors, and implement policies 
</p>
<p>that helped provide for a balance between work and family responsibilities. Otherwise, they 
</p>
<p>ran the risk of limiting parents&#8217; ability to take care of their children. They also asserted that 
</p>
<p>particular attention and assistance should be given to families in vulnerable situations, such 
</p>
<p>as single-parent families, poor families with elderly members, families affected by child 
</p>
<p>abuse and domestic violence, same-sex unions and others.  
</p>
<p>26. One delegation raised the situation of indigenous communities in which there were 
</p>
<p>complex and intricate family kinship systems that often did not fall within the framework of 
</p>
<p>the so-called &#8220;nuclear family&#8221;. The point was made that the appreciation of family diversity 
</p>
<p>in all its forms went hand in hand with forging strong and productive partnerships with 
</p>
<p>local indigenous communities, in order to ensure that government interventions were 
</p>
<p>tailored, culturally appropriate, genuinely accessible and aimed at achieving the best 
</p>
<p>possible outcome. Panellists were asked whether they had any additional recommendations 
</p>
<p>of ways to ensure that policies relating to families and their members protected the diversity 
</p>
<p>of indigenous and kinship families.  
</p>
<p>27. Observers highlighted the diversity of families and recalled that States must ensure 
</p>
<p>that children and other family members were not discriminated against because of the form 
</p>
<p>their family took. States and the Human Rights Council were asked to focus on the human 
</p>
<p>rights of individual members of the family, including children. Some observers also drew 
</p>
<p>attention to the situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and intersex persons who might be 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to being disowned, abused or forced to undergo involuntary psychological or 
</p>
<p>medical treatment by their families.  </p>


<p>28. Several observers highlighted the fact that the protection of the family should be 
</p>
<p>understood as supporting and strengthening families to ensure the fulfilment of the rights of 
</p>
<p>all their members. They observed that many States had failed to protect families adequately, 
</p>
<p>and called for family-friendly policies that recognized and promoted the capacity of strong 
</p>
<p>family bonds, the birthright of all humanity, to serve as a source of society capital and 
</p>
<p>stability for the wider fabric of the universal human family. The point was made that 
</p>
<p>without safe family-based care, children were at greater risk of various forms of 
</p>
<p>exploitation.  
</p>
<p>29. One observer stated that, as recognized in United Nations human rights treaties, the 
</p>
<p>family was the natural and fundamental group unit of society, and as such was entitled to 
</p>
<p>comprehensive and the widest possible protection and support by society and the State. 
</p>
<p>30. Delegations and observers posed numerous questions to the panellists, including 
</p>
<p>how States could improve the well-being of families and counter stereotypical views of 
</p>
<p>gender roles within the family. They requested examples of initiatives aimed at ensuring 
</p>
<p>equality, especially gender equality between family members, and asked the panellists to 
</p>
<p>share their experiences on how victims of domestic violence could be supported in claiming 
</p>
<p>their rights. The panel was also asked to suggest concrete measures that could be taken to 
</p>
<p>protect members of the family against abuse and how States could avoid discrimination 
</p>
<p>against families that did not conform to majority family patterns. They asked what States 
</p>
<p>and the Human Rights Council could do to address better the reality of family diversity and 
</p>
<p>how they could help encourage families to transmit values that were consistent with human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Responses of the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>31. In response to the questions, Ms. Mokomane reiterated the importance of a stand-
</p>
<p>alone goal on the family in the post-2015 development agenda and/or of mainstreaming 
</p>
<p>issues related to the family in all other goals. She referred to the example of one State 
</p>
<p>which, with a view to mainstreaming HIV issues, had included HIV coordinators in every 
</p>
<p>government administration and department. Building on the remarks of other panellists, she 
</p>
<p>also stressed the importance of evaluating the impact of policy decisions on families and 
</p>
<p>the need for family-friendly policies. In particular, she cited problems with work concepts 
</p>
<p>that continued to be based on the male breadwinner model, despite the fact that more 
</p>
<p>women worked and had child-rearing responsibilities than had previously been the case. 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Floriano<b> </b>stressed the need to consider the relationship between family members, 
</p>
<p>including any patterns of violence and power. She highlighted the importance of ensuring 
</p>
<p>that public policies responded to new realities, and the role of civil society organizations in 
</p>
<p>the protection of families, particularly in following up on loopholes and gaps that 
</p>
<p>government institutions had failed to address. 
</p>
<p>33. Ms. Bogenschneider underscored the role that family impact analysis could play in 
</p>
<p>the context of each of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, 
</p>
<p>reducing family poverty could involve examining how to improve parenting, childcare and 
</p>
<p>job opportunities for families. Family issues could also be a distinct goal. Family impact 
</p>
<p>assessments could also help identify areas for new policies, such as preparing youth for 
</p>
<p>successful employment, and/or improving mentoring between generations. 
</p>
<p>34. Highlighting the situation of disadvantaged families, Ms. Wijemanne<b> e</b>mphasized 
</p>
<p>that top-down programmes did not always reach those most in need. She called on States to 
</p>
<p>turn such policies around and create family-friendly interventions with community workers 
</p>
<p>who could reach out and identify disadvantaged families and issues of concern. She 
</p>
<p>stressed the fact that, where there was violence within families, there needed to be </p>


<p>accessible services, observing that victims might not want to be in contact with law 
</p>
<p>enforcement. There was also a need for investment in skill development and access to 
</p>
<p>psychosocial services. 
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Abashidze referred to the relevant human rights standards, including article 10 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. He also 
</p>
<p>emphasized States parties&#8217; obligations under article 2 to achieve progressively the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant and to adopt legislative measures to the 
</p>
<p>maximum of their available resources. That included adopting relevant criminal legislation 
</p>
<p>to hold those responsible for domestic violence fully accountable, and establishing 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation centres. He made clear that the principles of equality and non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>applied to everyone in relation to all rights.
