MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
Mines Management, Inc., an Idaho corporation (“Mines Management”), Hecla Mining Company, a Delaware corporation
(“Hecla”), and HL Idaho Corp., an Idaho corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla (“Merger Sub”), have entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 23, 2016, as amended on June 29, 2016 and July 29, 2016 (as
amended and as it may be further amended from time to time, the “merger agreement”) pursuant to which Merger Sub will
merge with and into Mines Management with Mines Management surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Hecla (the “merger”).
If the merger is completed, Mines Management stockholders will have the right to receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla
common stock for each share of Mines Management common stock. Any stockholders entitled to receive a fractional share
of Hecla common stock shall receive cash in lieu of such fractional share. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be
adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the merger.
Based on the estimated number of shares of Mines Management common stock outstanding on the record date for the
special meeting of Mines Management stockholders, Hecla expects to issue approximately 9,024,790 shares of Hecla
common stock to Mines Management stockholders in the merger. Upon completion of the transaction, it is projected that
holders of Mines Management common stock will own approximately 2.28% of Hecla’s outstanding common stock, while
existing stockholders of Hecla will continue to own the remaining 97.72%. Mines Management common stock is currently
listed for trading on the NYSE MKT LLC under the symbol “MGN” and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol
“MGT.” Following completion of the merger, Hecla common stock will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “HL”
and Mines Management common stock will cease to be listed for trading.
Mines Management will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on September 12, 2016 in conjunction with the proposed
merger. Hecla’s stockholders are not required to approve the proposed merger.
At the special meeting of Mines Management stockholders, Mines Management stockholders will be asked to consider and
vote on (i) a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement (the “merger proposal”), (ii) a proposal to adjourn the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve
and adopt the merger proposal (the “adjournment proposal”) and (iii) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the
compensation that may become payable to Mines Management’s named executive officers in connection with the merger
(the “compensation proposal”). Approval and adoption of the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal and the
compensation proposal each requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Mines Management
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter, and a
quorum must be present at the special meeting.
Mines Management cannot complete the merger unless its stockholders approve and adopt the merger proposal. Your
vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend the
special meeting in person, please submit a proxy as promptly as possible by (1) accessing the Internet website
specified on your proxy card, (2) calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card or (3) marking, signing,
dating and returning all proxy cards that you receive in the postage-paid envelope provided, so that your shares
may be represented and voted at the special meeting.
After careful consideration, the Mines Management board of directors, on May 21, 2016, unanimously approved,
adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and the merger, directed that the merger agreement be
submitted to the stockholders of Mines Management for approval and adoption and determined that the terms of
the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests of Mines Management’s stockholders.
The Mines Management board of directors accordingly unanimously recommends that the Mines Management
stockholders vote “FOR” each of the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal.
The obligations of Mines Management and Hecla to complete the transactions are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
several conditions set forth in the merger agreement. More information about Mines Management, Hecla and the merger is
contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. Mines Management and Hecla encourage you to read this entire proxy
statement/prospectus carefully, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 24, as well as the
information incorporated herein by reference.
We look forward to the successful completion of the merger.
Sincerely,
Glenn M. Dobbs
Chief Executive Officer

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Set forth below are questions that you, as a stockholder of Mines Management, may have regarding the merger, the
adjournment proposal, the compensation proposal and the special meeting, and brief answers to those questions. You are
urged to read carefully this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus in their entirety, including the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus, and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, because this
section may not provide all of the information that is important to you with respect to the merger and the special meeting.
You may obtain a list of the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus in the section titled
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 108.
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
A: Mines Management and Hecla have agreed to a merger, pursuant to which Mines Management will merge with Merger
Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla. Mines Management will continue its existence as the surviving entity and
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla, but will cease to be a publicly traded company. This transaction is sometimes
referred to throughout this proxy statement/prospectus as the “merger.” Please see “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption
of the Merger Agreement—Effects of the Merger” on page 41 of this proxy statement/prospectus and “Proposal 1: The
Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement” on page 67 of this proxy statement/prospectus.
A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A.
In order to complete the merger, Mines Management stockholders must vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Mines Management is holding a special meeting of its stockholders to obtain such stockholder approval and adoption.
Mines Management stockholders will also be asked to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the payments that will
or may be paid by Mines Management to its named executive officers in connection with the merger.
In the merger, Hecla will issue shares of its common stock as the consideration to be paid to holders of Mines Management
common stock. This document is being delivered to you as both a proxy statement of Mines Management and a prospectus
of Hecla in connection with the merger. It is the proxy statement by which the board of directors of Mines Management is
soliciting proxies from you to vote on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. It is also the
prospectus by which Hecla is offering the shares of Hecla common stock it will issue to you in the merger.
Q: How does the board of directors of Mines Management recommend that its stockholders vote?
A: Mines Management’s board of directors unanimously approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement
and the merger, directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Mines Management for approval
and adoption and determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests
of Mines Management’s stockholders. The Mines Management board of directors accordingly unanimously recommends
that the Mines Management stockholders vote “FOR” each of the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal and the
compensation proposal. See “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Recommendation of
Mines Management’s Board of Directors; Mines Management’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.
Q: Am I being asked to vote on anything else?
A: Yes. Mines Management’s board of directors is asking you to consider and vote on the adjournment proposal and the
compensation proposal. See “Proposal 2: Possible Adjournment to Solicit Additional Proxies If
Table of Contents
1
Necessary or Appropriate” on page 84 of this proxy statement/prospectus and “Proposal 3: Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on
Compensation” beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q: Why are Mines Management stockholders being asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the
compensation that may be paid or become payable to Mines Management’s named executive officers in
connection with the completion of the merger?
A: The rules promulgated by the SEC under Section 14A of the Exchange Act require Mines Management to seek a non-
binding, advisory vote with respect to certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to Mines Management’s
named executive officers in connection with the merger. For more information regarding such payments, see the section
entitled “Proposal 3: Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Compensation” beginning on page 85.
Q: What will Mines Management stockholders receive in the transaction?
A: If the transaction is completed, holders of Mines Management common stock will be entitled to receive 0.2218 of a share
of Hecla common stock for each share of Mines Management common stock they hold at the effective time. Any
stockholders entitled to receive a fractional share of Hecla common stock shall receive cash in lieu of such fractional share.
This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the
merger. Following the completion of the merger, Mines Management common stock will cease to trade on the NYSE MKT
LLC (“NYSE MKT”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”).
Q: What will happen to outstanding Mines Management options and warrants in the merger?
A: At the effective time, each option to purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time that has an exercise price per share greater than or equal to the product of the closing
price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date and 0.2218 will be
cancelled without any payment being made in respect thereof. At the effective time, each other option to purchase shares of
Mines Management common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (all of which are vested) will be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive shares of Hecla common stock (without interest, and subject to deduction for
any required withholding tax, with cash being paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Hecla common stock) with a value
equal to (i)(a) the product of the closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately
preceding the closing date and 0.2218 minus (b) the exercise price per share under such option multiplied by (ii) the
number of shares subject to such option. At the option of Hecla, in lieu of paying all or a portion of the amounts due to a
holder of options with shares of Hecla common stock, Hecla may substitute for such shares an equivalent amount in cash.
At the effective time, and in accordance with the terms of any warrant to purchase shares of Mines Management common
stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, such warrant will either be cancelled in accordance with its
terms or a replacement warrant will be issued giving the holder the right to purchase a number of shares of Hecla common
stock (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, and no issuance of fractional shares and
the number of such shares rounded down) equal to the product of (i) 0.2218 and (ii) the number of shares of Mines
Management common stock subject to such warrant, with an exercise price of $4.8765 per share of Hecla common stock,
pursuant to and in accordance with such holder’s warrant (as amended).
Q: What happens if the market price of shares of Hecla common stock or shares of Mines Management common
stock changes before the closing of the merger?
A: No change will be made to the exchange ratio of 0.2218 if the market price of shares of Mines Management common
stock or shares of Hecla common stock changes before the closing of the merger.

Q: How will Mines Management stockholders receive the merger consideration to which they are entitled?
A: After receiving the proper documentation from you, following the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will
forward to you (if you are the holder of record) or to your broker, bank, trust company or other nominee (each, a “broker”) the
shares of Hecla common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares to which you are entitled. For additional information
about the exchange of Mines Management shares of common stock for Hecla shares of common stock, see the section
entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Exchange of Shares in the Merger” beginning
on page 64.
You do not need to take any action at this time. Please do not send your Mines Management stock certificates with
your proxy card.
Q: How does Hecla common stock differ from Mines Management common stock?
A: Your rights as a Hecla stockholder will be different than your rights as a Mines Management stockholder. A chart
comparing your rights as a Mines Management stockholder to your rights as a Hecla stockholder is included in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Please see “Comparative Rights of Hecla Stockholders and Mines Management Stockholders”
beginning at page 87 of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q: Will the shares of Hecla common stock issued in connection with the merger be listed for trading on a stock
exchange?
A: Hecla’s outstanding common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Hecla has filed an
application to have the Hecla shares issued as part of the merger approved for listing on the NYSE upon notice of
issuance.
Q: When does Mines Management expect the transaction to be completed?
A: Hecla and Mines Management are working to complete the merger as quickly as practicable and currently expect that it
will be completed in the third quarter of 2016, promptly after the special meeting.
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction?
A: Mines Management is not expected to recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the
merger. Mines Management stockholders that are U.S. holders are not expected to recognize any gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes upon the merger, except for any gain or loss attributable to the receipt of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Hecla common stock received in the merger.
The aggregate tax basis of the Hecla common stock received in the merger (including fractional shares deemed received
and redeemed) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of Mines Management common stock
surrendered for the Hecla common stock, and the holding period of the Hecla common stock (including fractional shares
deemed received and redeemed) will include the period during which the shares of Mines Management common stock
were held.
Mines Management has received the opinion of Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization described in Section 368 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
You are encouraged to read the opinion, which is attached as Appendix C. In addition, you should also read the discussion
in the section entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger” on page 62 of this proxy statement/prospectus and consult your own tax advisors as to
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger, as well as the effects of state, local and foreign tax laws.

Q: What vote of Mines Management stockholders is required to approve and adopt the merger?
A: Approval and adoption of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Mines
Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the
proposal, and a quorum must be present at the special meeting. Only holders of record of Mines Management common
stock at the close of business on July 5, 2016, which is referred to as the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 35,857,893 shares of Mines Management common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Q: Are any stockholders already committed to vote in favor of the merger?
A: Yes. Pursuant to shareholders agreements with Hecla, Mines Management’s stockholder Silver Wheaton Corp. and the
following directors and officers of Mines Management have each agreed to vote the shares of Mines Management common
stock (as set forth in such shareholder’s shareholders agreement) that they directly, indirectly or beneficially own or control
at the special meeting in favor of the merger: Glenn Dobbs, Douglas Dobbs, Nicole Altenburg, Russell Babcock, Roy
Franklin and Robert Russell. Shares representing approximately 17.6% of Mines Management common stock (which
include 1,322,621 shares of Mines Management common stock subject to currently exercisable options) are subject to the
shareholders agreements as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. For a more complete description of the
Shareholders Agreements, see “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Shareholders
Agreements” beginning at page 67 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The form of Shareholders Agreement is also
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix D.
Q: Are there any risks to me in approving and adopting the merger?
A: Yes. You should carefully review the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 24.
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
A: If the merger is not approved and adopted by the Mines Management stockholders or the merger does not occur for any
other reason, neither Mines Management nor its stockholders will receive any shares of Hecla common stock. Instead,
Mines Management will remain an independent public company, and Mines Management’s common stock may continue to
be quoted on the NYSE MKT and TSX. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management.” Further, if the
merger does not occur under specified circumstances, Mines Management may be required to pay Hecla a termination fee
and reimburse Hecla for its expenses incurred under the merger agreement as described in the section entitled “Proposal 1:
The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses”
beginning on page 81. Mines Management is experiencing severe financial challenges, and stockholders should carefully
review the discussion of such challenges set forth in “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management”
beginning on page 29 and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. If the merger is not completed, Mines
Management would have to seek additional financing, which may be unavailable, or consider other alternatives, including a
bankruptcy filing.
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights?
A: No. Under Idaho law, holders of Mines Management common stock will not be entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights.
Therefore, holders of Mines Management common stock as of the record date that are against the merger may vote against
approval and adoption of the merger agreement but may not exercise dissenters’ or appraisal rights. See “No Appraisal
Rights” beginning on page 96.
Q: When and where will the special meeting of Mines Management stockholders be held?
A: The special meeting of Mines Management stockholders will be held at the Lincoln Building, 811 W. Riverside, 2nd floor
conference room, Spokane, Washington 99201, on Monday, September 12, 2016, at 2:00 p.m., local time.

Q: Who can attend and vote at the special meeting?
A: All Mines Management stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive
notice of, to attend and to vote at the special meeting.
Q: How can I attend the special meeting?
A: All of Mines Management’s stockholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Please be prepared to provide
identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, before being admitted to the special meeting. If you hold your shares in
“street name,” that is, if you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a broker, you will
need to provide proof of ownership to be admitted to the special meeting. A brokerage statement or letter from your broker
proving ownership of the shares on the record date for the special meeting are examples of proof of ownership. To help
Mines Management plan for the special meeting, please indicate whether you expect to attend by responding affirmatively
when prompted during Internet or telephone proxy submission or by marking the attendance box on your proxy card.
Q: What constitutes a quorum at the special meeting?
A: The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Mines Management common
stock entitled to vote at the special meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote
occurs when a broker that holds shares on behalf of a “street name” stockholder returns a valid proxy card, but does not
vote on a particular matter because it does not have discretionary authority to vote on that particular matter and has not
received voting instructions from the “street name” stockholder.
Q: What should I do now in order to vote on the proposals being considered at the special meeting?
A: Mines Management stockholders as of the record date may vote by proxy by
•
completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage
paid envelope;
•
accessing the Internet website specified on your proxy card; or
•
calling the toll-free number specified on your proxy card.
If you hold shares of Mines Management common stock in “street name,” which means that your shares are held of record
by a broker, please refer to the voting instruction form used by your broker to see how to vote your shares.
Additionally, you may also vote in person by attending the special meeting. If you plan to attend the special meeting and
wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held
in “street name” and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must bring a proxy from the record holder of the shares
authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, you should submit
your proxy card or voting instruction form as described in this proxy statement/prospectus.
Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?
A: No. If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a broker (that is, in “street name”),
your broker cannot vote your shares on any of the proposals to be considered at the special
Table of Contents
5
meeting as all such proposals are “non-routine” matters. You should instruct your broker as to how to vote your shares,
following the directions from your broker provided to you. Please check the voting form used by your broker. If you do not
provide your broker with instructions, your shares of Mines Management common stock will not be voted on any proposal at
the special meeting. Please note that you may not vote shares held in “street name” by returning a proxy card directly to
Mines Management or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you provide a legal proxy, which you must obtain
from your broker.
Q: What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote?
A: Mines Management cannot complete the merger unless its stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby. Because approval and adoption is based on the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast by holders of Mines Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, assuming a quorum is present, a Mines Management stockholder’s failure to
vote or the failure of a Mines Management stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker to give
voting instructions to such broker will have no effect on the merger proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If a Mines
Management stockholder marks his or her proxy or provides voting instructions to abstain, it will have no effect on the
merger proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Q: What will happen if I sign my proxy without specifying my voting preference?
A: If you submit a signed proxy without specifying the manner in which you would like your shares to be voted, your shares
will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the adjournment proposal and “FOR” the compensation proposal.
Q: Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a holder of
record, you can do this in one of three ways:
•
you can send a signed notice of revocation;
•
you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or through the Internet); or
•
you can attend the special meeting and vote in person, which will revoke any proxy previously given, or you may
revoke your proxy in person, but your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given.
If you provide a written notice of revocation, you must submit it to the Corporate Secretary of Mines Management
no later than the beginning of the special meeting. If you grant a new proxy by telephone or Internet voting, your
revised instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 11, 2016. If your shares are held
in “street name” by your broker, you should contact your broker to change your vote or revoke your proxy.
Q: What happens if I transfer my shares of Mines Management stock before the special meeting?
A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the date that the merger
is expected to be completed. If you transfer your Mines Management shares after the record date for the special meeting,
you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but you will have transferred the right to receive the merger
consideration in the merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares through the effective
time of the merger.
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting?
A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the special meeting, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction forms. For example, if you hold
Table of Contents
6
your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage
account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you
will receive more than one proxy card. For each and every proxy card and voting instruction form that you receive, please
vote as soon as possible by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-prepaid
envelope enclosed for that purpose or by accessing the Internet website or by calling the toll-free number specified on your
proxy cards.
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
A: If you have any questions about the merger or the merger agreement or how to submit your proxy, or if you need

SUMMARY
This summary highlights selected information from this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read carefully the
entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus because the
information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to the merger
agreement, the merger and the other matters being considered at the special meeting. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 108. Each item in this summary refers to the page of this proxy statement/prospectus on
which that subject is discussed in more detail.
The Parties (See page 35)
Hecla. Hecla Mining Company is a Delaware corporation with its shares of common stock traded on the NYSE under the
symbol “HL.” Hecla is a U.S.-based precious and base metals mining company engaged in the exploration, acquisition,
development, production and marketing of silver, gold, lead and zinc. In business since 1891, Hecla is among the oldest
U.S.-based precious metals mining companies. Hecla produces both metal concentrates, which it sells to smelters, and
unrefined gold and silver bullion bars (doré), which is either sold as doré or refined before sale to precious metals traders.
Hecla’s executive offices are located at 6500 N. Mineral Drive, Suite 200, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho 83815-9408, and its
telephone number is (208) 769-4100.
Merger Sub. HL Idaho Corp. is an Idaho corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla. Upon completion of the
merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Mines Management, with Mines Management surviving as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Hecla. Merger Sub has not conducted any significant activities other than those incidental to its
formation and the matters contemplated by the merger agreement in connection with the merger.
Mines Management. Mines Management, Inc. is engaged in the business of acquiring and exploring, and if exploration is
successful, developing, mineral properties, primarily those containing silver and associated base and precious metals.
Mines Management was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on February 20, 1947. Mines Management’s
principal mineral property interest, the Montanore Project, is held by its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Newhi, Inc. and
Montanore Minerals Corp. Mines Management’s properties, including the Montanore Project, are currently in the
exploration stage; none of its properties are currently in production.
The Montanore Project is located in northwestern Montana and from 1988 to 2002 was owned by Noranda Minerals
Corporation (“Noranda”). During that time the project received an approved Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”),
Record of Decision (“ROD”) and all of its primary environmental permits, and conducted pre-evaluation construction
activities on the property. From 1988 to 2002, Mines Management held royalty rights to a portion of the deposit. In 2002,
Noranda announced that it was abandoning the project, and subsequently transferred to Mines Management by quitclaim
deed the patented and unpatented mining claims that control the mineral rights, and all drill core and intellectual property
including geologic, environmental and engineering studies, relating to the Montanore Project.
If the merger described in this proxy statement/prospectus is not consummated, Mines Management will be required to seek
additional capital or consider other alternatives, which could include liquidating some or all of its assets in order to fund its
liquidity requirements. Bankruptcy is also a possibility. There is no assurance Mines Management’s financing efforts would
be successful under current market conditions.
Mines Management common stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “MGN” and the TSX
under the symbol “MGT.”

Mines Management’s executive offices and principal place of business are located at 905 West Riverside Avenue, Suite
311, Spokane, Washington 99201, and its telephone number is (509) 838-6050. Mines Management’s registered agent in

Management” beginning on page 97.
The Merger (See page 68)
Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in accordance with Idaho law, the merger agreement
provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Mines Management. Mines Management will survive the merger and
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla.
Merger Consideration (See page 68)
The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, each share of Mines Management common stock issued and
outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time (excluding shares of Mines
Management common stock that are owned immediately prior to the effective time by Mines Management, Hecla, Merger
Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, which will be cancelled and cease to exist) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock.
Treatment of Options and Warrants (See page 69)
Stock Options. At the effective time, each option to purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time that has an exercise price per share greater than or equal to the product
of the closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date and
0.2218 will be cancelled without any payment being made in respect thereof. At the effective time, each other option to
purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (all of
which are vested) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive shares of Hecla common stock (without interest, and
subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, with cash being paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Hecla

The Special Meeting; Stockholders Entitled to Vote; Required Vote (See page 37)
Meeting. The special meeting will be held at the Lincoln Building, 811 W. Riverside, 2nd floor conference room, Spokane,
Washington 99201 on Monday, September 12, 2016, at 2:00 p.m., local time. At the special meeting, Mines Management
stockholders will be asked to vote on the following proposals:
•
•
•
Merger proposal: To approve and adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this
proxy statement/prospectus, and the transactions contemplated thereby;
Adjournment proposal: To approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary to solicit additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special
meeting; and
Compensation proposal: To approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the payments that will or may be paid
by Mines Management to its named executive officers in connection with the merger.
Stockholders Entitled to Vote. Only Mines Management stockholders of record at the close of business on July 5, 2016
will be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date of July
5, 2016, there were 35,857,893 shares of Mines Management common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
meeting. Each holder of Mines Management common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned
as of the record date. As of the close of business on the record date of July 5, 2016, Mines Management’s directors and
executive officers had the right to vote approximately 2,904,318 shares of the then-outstanding Mines Management
common stock at the special meeting, collectively representing approximately 8.1% of Mines Management common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Required Vote. To approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, a majority of the
votes cast by holders of Mines Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal must vote in favor of the proposal, and a quorum must be present at the special
meeting. A Mines Management stockholder’s failure to vote will have no effect on the merger proposal, assuming a quorum
is present. If you are a Mines Management stockholder and you mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have
no effect on this proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
To approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes
to approve and adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting, a majority of the votes cast by holders of Mines
Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the
proposal must vote in favor of the proposal, and a quorum must be present at the special meeting. A Mines Management
stockholder’s failure to vote will have no effect on the adjournment proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you are a
Mines Management stockholder and you mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have no effect on this
proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
To approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the payments that will or may be paid by Mines Management to its named
executive officers in connection with the merger, a majority of the votes cast by holders of Mines Management common
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal must vote in
favor of the proposal, and a quorum must be present at the special meeting. A Mines Management stockholder’s failure to
vote will have no effect on the advisory vote, assuming a quorum is present. If you are a Mines Management stockholder
and you mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have no effect on this proposal, assuming a quorum is
present.
Shareholders Agreements (See page 67)
In connection with the merger agreement, Hecla entered into shareholders agreements with Silver Wheaton Corp., a
stockholder of Mines Management, and the following directors and officers of Mines Management:
Table of Contents
13
Glenn Dobbs, Douglas Dobbs, Nicole Altenburg, Russell Babcock, Roy Franklin and Robert Russell. In the shareholders
agreements, each of these stockholders has agreed to vote his, her, or its shares of Mines Management common stock (as
set forth in such shareholder’s shareholders agreement) in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement. As of
the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, there were 6,562,199 shares of Mines Management common stock (which
include 1,322,621 shares of Mines Management common stock subject to currently exercisable options) subject to the
shareholders agreements, which represent approximately 17.6% of the outstanding shares of Mines Management common
stock as of that date. No separate consideration was provided to any of the stockholders who are parties to the
shareholders agreements in order to induce them to enter into the shareholders agreements.
No Dissenters’ or Appraisal Rights (See page 96)
Under Idaho law, holders of Mines Management common stock will not be entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights.
Therefore, holders of Mines Management common stock as of the record date that are against the merger may vote against
approval and adoption of the merger agreement but may not exercise dissenters’ or appraisal rights. See “No Appraisal
Rights” beginning on page 96.
Regulatory Matters (See page 64)
Neither Mines Management nor Hecla is required to obtain any approvals from any federal or state regulatory authorities to
consummate the merger. Hecla must comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and NYSE rules and
regulations in connection with the issuance of shares of Hecla common stock in connection with the merger, including the
filing with the SEC of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part. In addition, the parties
will be required to file a statement of merger with the Secretary of State of Idaho in order to effectuate the merger.
Recommendation of Mines Management’s Board of Directors and Their Reasons for the Merger (See page 48)
After careful consideration, the Mines Management board of directors, on May 21, 2016, unanimously approved, adopted
and declared advisable the merger agreement and the merger, directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of Mines Management for approval and adoption and determined that the terms of the merger agreement and
the merger are advisable and in the best interests of Mines Management’s stockholders. For the factors considered by the
Mines Management board of directors in reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement, see the section
entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Recommendation of Mines Management’s
Board of Directors; Mines Management’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 48. The Mines Management board
of directors unanimously recommends that the Mines Management stockholders vote “FOR” each of the merger
proposal, the adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal.
Opinion of the Financial Advisor to Mines Management’s Board of Directors (See page 51)
In connection with the transaction, Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“CG”), Mines Management’s financial advisor, delivered its
opinion as of May 21, 2016 to the Mines Management board of directors, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Mines Management common stockholders of the consideration to be
received by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.
The full text of the written opinion of CG is included in this document as Appendix B. You should read the opinion carefully
in its entirety for a description of the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by
CG. The opinion of CG was provided for the information and assistance of the Mines
Table of Contents
14
Management board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transaction. The opinion of CG is not a
recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or as to any action that a stockholder should take with respect to
the transaction.
Hecla Stockholder Approval is Not Required (See page 41)
Hecla stockholders are not required to adopt the merger agreement or approve the merger or the issuance of Hecla
common stock in connection with the merger.
Ownership of Hecla After the Merger (See page 41)
Hecla will issue approximately 9,024,790 shares of Hecla common stock to former Mines Management stockholders
pursuant to the merger. Based on the number of shares of Hecla common stock outstanding as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, immediately following the completion of the merger, Hecla expects to have approximately
395,477,900 shares of common stock outstanding. Mines Management stockholders are therefore expected to hold
approximately 2.28% of the aggregate number of shares of Hecla common stock outstanding immediately after the
merger.
Interests of Directors and Officers of Mines Management in the Merger (See page 60)
Mines Management’s directors and officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of Mines Management stockholders generally. The members of Mines Management’s
board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and
negotiating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to Mines Management’s stockholders
that the merger agreement be approved and adopted.
These interests include:
•
Certain officers of Mines Management may receive payments in connection with the merger pursuant to
employment agreements with Mines Management. Assuming that the closing of the merger had occurred on July
27, 2016, and the employment of each of the officers of Mines Management was terminated immediately following
the merger, they would be entitled to receive the following aggregate payment amounts: Glenn Dobbs—
$1,116,275; Douglas Dobbs—$718,275; and Nicole Altenburg—$228,275.
•
The directors and officers of Mines Management are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage
under the merger agreement after the effective time.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (See page 62)
Mines Management is not expected to recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of the merger. Mines Management stockholders that are U.S. holders are not expected to recognize any gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the merger, except for any gain or loss attributable to the receipt of
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Hecla common stock received in the merger. The aggregate tax basis of the
Hecla common stock received in the merger (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed) will be
equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of Mines Management common stock surrendered for the
Hecla common stock, and the holding period of the Hecla common stock (including fractional shares deemed
received and redeemed) will include the period during which the shares of Mines Management common stock were
held.
Mines Management has received the opinion of Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP that the merger will qualify as a tax-
free reorganization described in Section 368 of the Code. You are encouraged to read the opinion, which is
Table of Contents
15
attached as Appendix C. In addition, you should also read the discussion in the section entitled “Proposal 1: The
Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”
beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement/prospectus and consult your own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger, as well as the effects of state, local and foreign tax laws.
Accounting Treatment of the Merger (See page 64)
In accordance with GAAP, Hecla will account for the merger using the acquisition method of accounting for
business combinations.
Certain Differences in the Rights of Stockholders (See page 87)
Mines Management stockholders will own shares of Hecla common stock following the completion of the merger,
and their rights associated with those shares of Hecla common stock will be governed by Hecla’s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, which differ in a number of respects from the Mines Management’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws. In addition, Mines Management is an Idaho corporation, while Hecla is a Delaware
corporation, and the rights of stockholders of Delaware corporations differ in certain respects from those of
stockholders of Idaho corporations. See “Comparative Rights of Hecla Stockholders and Mines Management
Stockholders” beginning on page 87.
Conditions to Completion of the Merger (See page 79)
Hecla and Mines Management currently expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2016, subject to
receipt of required Mines Management stockholder approval and adoption and to the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement described below.

Table of Contents
Termination Fees (See page 81)
Following termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances Mines Management will be required
to pay Hecla a termination fee of $1,000,000, plus all of Hecla’s actual and reasonably documented fees and
expenses in an amount not to exceed $200,000 (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as described in “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of
the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on page 81.
Litigation Relating to the Merger (See page 66)
Since the announcement of the merger, Mines Management, members of the Mines Management board of
directors, Merger Sub and Hecla were named as defendants in three putative stockholder class actions, brought by
purported stockholders of Mines Management, challenging the proposed merger. Two of the lawsuits were filed in
the Superior Court in Spokane County, Washington, and are captioned O’Rourke v. Dobbs, et al., No. 16202116-1
(Spokane Cnty, Wash. June 6, 2016) and Schubert v. Dobbs, et al., No. 16202667-7 (Spokane Cnty, Wash. July 14,
2016) (together, the “state lawsuits”). The other lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Washington, and is captioned Assad v. Mines Management, Inc., et al., No. 16-cv-00256-SMJ (E.D. Wash.
July 12, 2016) (the “federal lawsuit”).
The plaintiffs in the state lawsuits generally claim that (i) the members of the Mines Management board of directors
breached their fiduciary duties to Mines Management stockholders by authorizing the merger with Hecla for what
the plaintiff asserts is inadequate consideration and pursuant to an inadequate process and with inadequate
disclosures and (ii) Hecla and Merger Sub aided and abetted the other defendants’ alleged breach of duties. The
plaintiffs seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger, rescind the transaction or obtain rescissory damages if
the merger is consummated, obtain other unspecified damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
The plaintiff in the federal lawsuit generally claims that (i) Mines Management and the members of the Mines
Management board of directors issued a proxy statement containing false and misleading statements and (ii) the
members of the Mines Management board of directors, Hecla and Merger Sub are liable as controlling persons of
Mines Management. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger, rescind the transaction or obtain
rescissory damages if the merger is consummated, require the members of the Mines Management board of
directors to disseminate a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that
states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, obtain
other unspecified damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation matters with certainty, each of Mines Management, its
directors, Hecla and Merger Sub believe that each of the lawsuits are without merit, and the parties intend to
vigorously defend against all claims asserted.
Interim Credit Agreement (See page 66)
As discussed in “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management” and elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus, Mines Management is experiencing severe financial challenges. In an effort to address
Mines Management’s short-term liquidity needs, Hecla and Mines Management have entered into the Interim Credit
Agreement, pursuant to which Hecla has agreed to provide one or more secured loans to Mines Management in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $2,300,000. Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 5% and
will be due and payable on the earlier of September 30, 2016, the date the merger is consummated or other
specified events discussed in “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interim Credit
Agreement” beginning on page 66. The loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of Mines Management,
including the Montanore Project, and the equity interests in Newhi, Inc., Montanore Minerals Corp. and Montmin
Resources Corp. Even if Mines Management borrows the maximum amount available under the Interim Credit
Agreement, it currently expects that it would still run out of cash by the end of September 2016 if the merger does
not occur.

(1) Hecla declared and paid all quarterly dividends on its Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Hecla Series
B”) shares for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 totaling $0.6 million for each of those years.

(2) In the fourth quarter of 2010, Hecla recorded an accrual of $193.2 million to reflect its liability for environmental
obligations in Idaho’s Coeur d’Alene Basin pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the Coeur d’Alene Basin
environmental litigation and the State of Idaho on the financial terms of settlement of the litigation and related claims.
The settlement was finalized in September 2011 and payment of the financial obligations was completed in 2014.
(3) On April 12, 2013, Hecla completed an offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes due
May 1, 2021 in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In
2014, an additional $6.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes were issued to Hecla’s pension plan.
(4) In September 2011 and February 2012, Hecla’s board of directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that has
two components: (1) a dividend that links the amount of dividends on common stock to Hecla’s average quarterly
realized silver price in the preceding quarter, and (2) a minimum annual dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock,
in each case, payable quarterly, when declared. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Hecla’s
most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on potential dividend amounts under the first component
of the policy at various silver prices. The following table summarizes the common stock dividends declared by Hecla’s
board of directors for the years ended 2013, 2014 and 2015:

Because the average realized silver price for the first quarter of 2016 and each quarter of 2013, 2014 and 2015 was
below the minimum threshold of $30 according to the policy, no silver-price-linked component was declared or
paid. However, on February 25, 2013, Hecla’s board of directors declared a special common stock dividend of
$0.01 per share, in addition to the minimum dividend of $0.0025 per share, for an aggregate dividend of $3.6 million.
Prior to 2011, no dividends had been declared on Hecla’s common stock since 1990. Hecla cannot pay dividends
on its common stock if it fails to pay dividends on Hecla Series B shares. The declaration and payment of common
stock dividends, whether pursuant to the policy or in addition thereto, is at the sole discretion of Hecla’s board of
directors, and there can be no assurance that Hecla will continue to declare and pay common stock dividends in
the future.
(5) The cash dividend declared for the fourth quarter of 2010 on Hecla’s 6.5% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock was
paid in January 2011 and represented the last dividend paid on the 6.5% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which
automatically converted to shares of Hecla common stock on January 1, 2011.
(6) The increase in the number of employees in 2013 was due largely to the acquisition of Aurizon Mines Ltd. in June 2013.
(7) As a result of an order from the Mine Safety and Health Administration to remove built-up cementitious material from the
Silver Shaft, production was temporarily suspended at the Lucky Friday unit during all of 2012. Limited production
resumed in early 2013 and has generally been at historical levels since September 2013. See Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, The Lucky Friday Segment in Hecla’s most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Comparative Per Share Information
The following table sets forth, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the three months ended March 31,
2016, selected per share information for Mines Management common stock on a historical basis and, for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, selected per share information for Hecla
common stock on a historical basis and unaudited pro forma information using the acquisition method of
accounting assuming (i) the merger occurred on the dates indicated, (ii) each option to purchase shares of Mines
Management common stock outstanding on August 4, 2016 that has an exercise price per share less than $1.42
was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive shares of Hecla common stock with a value of $6.61 per share,
and (iii) all severance due to Messrs. Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs and Ms. Altenburg in connection with the
merger was paid in the form of Hecla common stock with a value of $6.61 per share. The Mines Management
unaudited pro forma combined equivalents show how each share of Mines Management common stock would
have participated in the combined company’s earnings (loss) from continuing operations and book value if the pro
forma events had occurred on the relevant dates and were calculated by multiplying the corresponding Hecla
unaudited pro forma combined data by the exchange ratio of 0.2218. You should read the data with (i) the historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes of Mines Management appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus, and (ii) the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Hecla contained
in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q

RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus,
including the matters addressed in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 8, you should carefully consider the following risks before deciding whether to
vote for the merger proposal. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with the business of
Hecla because these risks will also affect Hecla after the merger is final. Descriptions of some of these risks can be
found in Hecla’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, updated by any
subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement/prospectus. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 108.
Risk Factors Relating to the Merger
The merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the
merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of Hecla and Mines
Management.
The completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is subject to certain conditions,
including (1) approval and adoption by Mines Management stockholders, (2) the effectiveness of certain filings with
the SEC, (3) the absence of certain legal impediments and (4) other customary closing conditions. See “Proposal 1:
The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the
Merger” beginning on page 79. Hecla and Mines Management cannot assure you that the merger will be
consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. Hecla and Mines Management have
expended and will continue to expend a significant amount of time and resources on the merger, and a failure to
consummate the merger as currently contemplated, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on Hecla’s and
Mines Management’s businesses and results of operations.
If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Hecla or Mines Management may be adversely affected
and Hecla and Mines Management will be subject to several risks, including the following:
•
•
•
•
Mines Management being required, under certain circumstances, to pay Hecla a termination fee of $1,000,000
plus certain of Hecla’s expenses in an amount not to exceed $200,000. See “Proposal 1: The Approval and
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses” beginning on
page 81;
having to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction, such as legal,
accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees and integration costs that have already been
incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing;
under the merger agreement, Mines Management being subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its
business, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain business strategies in the future if the merger is
not completed;
under the Interim Credit Agreement, the amounts loaned to Mines Management are secured by the Montanore
Project, and the associated promissory note could mature as early as September 30, 2016. Therefore, if the
merger does not close, Mines Management faces the prospects of quickly needing to repay amounts due under
the Interim Credit Agreement—currently $1.4 million—or remedial actions, which could include bankruptcy or
foreclosure;
•
the focus of management of each of the companies on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that
could be beneficial to the companies;
•
the market price of Hecla common stock or Mines Management common stock could decline to the extent that the
current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed; and
24
Table of Contents
•
if the merger agreement is terminated and Mines Management’s board of directors seeks an alternative strategic
transaction, stockholders of Mines Management cannot be certain that Mines Management will be able to find a
party willing to enter into a strategic transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Hecla
has agreed to in the merger agreement;
in each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the merger completed. In addition, if the
merger is not completed, Hecla and/or Mines Management may experience negative reactions from the financial
markets and from their respective employees and other stakeholders. Hecla and/or Mines Management could also
be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to perform their respective obligations under
the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Hecla and Mines Management cannot assure their respective
stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and
stock prices of Hecla or Mines Management.
The fairness opinion rendered to Mines Management’s board of directors by CG was based on CG’s financial
analysis and considered factors such as market and other conditions then in effect, and other information made
available to CG, as of the date of the opinion. As a result, the opinion does not reflect changes in events or
circumstances after the date of such opinion. Mines Management’s board of directors has not obtained, and does
not expect to obtain, an updated fairness opinion from CG reflecting changes in circumstances that may have
occurred since the signing of the merger agreement.
The fairness opinion rendered to Mines Management’s board of directors by CG was provided in connection with,
and at the time of, the evaluation of the merger and the merger agreement by Mines Management’s board of
directors. The opinion was based on the financial analyses performed, which considered market and other
conditions then in effect, and other information made available to CG, as of the date of the opinion, which may have
changed, or may change, after the date of the opinion. Mines Management’s board of directors has not obtained an
updated opinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus from CG and does not expect to obtain an
updated opinion prior to completion of the merger. Changes in the operations and prospects of Hecla or Mines
Management, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Hecla
or Mines Management, and on which the fairness opinion was based, may have altered the value of Hecla or Mines
Management or the prices of Hecla common stock or Mines Management common stock since the date of such
opinion, or may alter such values and prices by the time the merger is completed. The opinion does not speak as
of any date other than the date of the opinion. For a description of the opinion that CG rendered to the Mines
Management board of directors, please refer to “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement
—Opinion of Mines Management’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 51.
The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either Hecla’s or Mines
Management’s stock price.
Upon the closing of the merger, each share of Mines Management common stock (other than shares owned by
Mines Management, Hecla or Merger Sub, which will be cancelled) will be converted into the right to receive 0.2218
of a share of Hecla common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. This exchange ratio was fixed in the
merger agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Hecla common stock or Mines
Management common stock. Changes in the price of Hecla common stock prior to the effective time of the merger
will affect the value of Hecla stock that Mines Management stockholders will receive in the merger. Stock price
changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond the control of Hecla or Mines
Management), including, without limitation, the following:
•
changes in Hecla’s or Mines Management’s businesses, operations, performance and prospects;
•
changes in market assessments of the business, operations and prospects of Hecla or Mines Management;
•
investor behavior and strategies, including market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be
completed;
Table of Contents
25
•
•
interest rates, metals prices, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the
price of Hecla’s and Mines Management’s common stock; and
federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses in which
Hecla and Mines Management operate.
The price of Hecla common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from its price on the date the merger
agreement was executed, on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of the special meeting of
Mines Management. As a result, the market value represented by the exchange ratio will also vary.
Any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the merger.
In addition to the required Mines Management stockholder approval and adoption, the merger is subject to a
number of other conditions beyond Hecla’s and Mines Management’s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise
materially adversely affect its completion. Hecla and Mines Management cannot predict whether and when these
other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, obtaining the required approval and adoption could delay the
completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the
merger could cause Hecla not to realize some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve if the merger is
successfully completed within its expected timeframe. See the section entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning
on page 79.
The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror of Mines
Management or could result in any competing proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be.
The merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict Mines
Management’s ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage competing third-party proposals to
acquire all or a significant part of Mines Management. In addition, Hecla generally has an opportunity to offer to
modify the terms of the merger and the merger agreement in response to any competing acquisition proposals that
may be made before Mines Management’s board of directors may withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Hecla) its recommendation. In some circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, Mines
Management may be required to pay a termination fee to Hecla and/or reimburse Hecla for certain expenses. For
additional information, see the sections entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement
—The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals” beginning on page 74, “—Changes in Board
Recommendations” beginning on page 76, “—Termination” beginning on page 80 and “—Termination Fees and
Expenses” beginning on page 81.
These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a
significant part of Mines Management from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if it were prepared
to offer greater value than provided for under the merger agreement, or might result in a potential competing
acquiror proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added
expense of the termination fee and/or reimbursement of certain expenses that may become payable in certain
circumstances, which would represent an additional cost for a potential third party seeking a business
combination with Mines Management.
The merger will involve substantial costs.
Hecla and Mines Management have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses
relating directly to the transaction, including fees and expenses payable to legal, accounting and financial advisors
and other professional fees relating to the transaction, insurance premium costs, fees and costs relating to
regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs, fees
and expenses.

Mines Management’s officers and directors have interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of Mines Management’s stockholders generally.
Officers of Hecla and Mines Management negotiated, with oversight and input provided by their respective boards
of directors, the terms of the merger agreement. Hecla’s board of directors approved the merger agreement and the
issuance of shares of Hecla common stock to Mines Management stockholders in connection with the merger and
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and the
issuance of shares of Hecla common stock to Mines Management stockholders in connection with the merger, are
advisable and in the best interests of Hecla and its stockholders. Mines Management’s board of directors approved
and adopted the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are advisable and in the best interests of Mines Management and its stockholders. In considering these
facts and the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that Mines
Management’s officers and directors may have interests in the transactions that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of Mines Management’s stockholders. See the section entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval
and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Mines Management’s Directors and Named Executive Officers
in the Merger” beginning on page 60.
Mines Management stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable, enable stockholders, in connection with certain mergers, to
demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in the merger. Under Idaho law, stockholders do not
have appraisal rights if, among other circumstances, the shares of stock they hold at the record date are listed on
the NYSE or the NYSE MKT.
Because Mines Management common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, Mines Management stockholders will not
be entitled to appraisal rights under Idaho law in the merger with respect to their shares of Mines Management
common stock.
In connection with the announcement of the merger agreement, putative class action lawsuits have been filed and
are pending as of the date hereof, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the merger, and an adverse ruling in any
of these lawsuits may prevent the merger from being effective or from becoming effective within the expected time
frame.
While Mines Management’s and Hecla’s respective directors and management teams believe that the allegations in
the complaints are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against these allegations, Mines Management and
Hecla cannot assure you as to the outcome of these, or any similar future lawsuits, or the amount of the costs
associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation
or settlement of these claims. If any plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction with respect to the merger,
such an injunction may prevent the completion of the merger on the agreed upon terms, in the expected time frame
or altogether. Whether the plaintiffs’ claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts
management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of the businesses of Hecla and
Mines Management. For more information about litigation related to the merger, see “Proposal 1: The Approval and
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Litigation Related to the Merger” beginning on page 66.
Risk Factors Relating to Hecla Following the Merger
Hecla will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger.
Hecla and Mines Management expect to incur transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. In addition to
transaction costs related to the merger, Hecla will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as
it integrates the Mines Management business with that of Hecla.
Table of Contents
27
After completion of the merger, Hecla may fail to realize anticipated benefits.
The success of the merger will depend, in part, on Hecla’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the
acquisition of Mines Management, in particular its Montanore Project. Even if the Montanore Project receives all of
its necessary permits and successfully resolves the current and any future litigation related to its permitting and
development, there is no assurance that it will be successfully developed or operated, including, among other
reasons, because financing necessary to develop the project may be unavailable. Thus, if Hecla is not able to
successfully integrate Mines Management into Hecla’s operations within the anticipated timeframe, or at all, the
anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. For
example, Hecla has viewed ownership of both its Rock Creek project and Mines Management’s nearby Montanore
Project as the principal benefit of the merger. However, the proximity and any other relationship between those two
projects could make obtaining all necessary permits for one or both of the projects to be more expensive or time
consuming, or any such permit might not be obtained at all.
After completion of the merger, Mines Management may experience negative developments or outcomes in any of
its pending litigation matters.
Mines Management is a party to several lawsuits which may impact its ability to access, develop or operate the
Montanore Project. Mines Management is currently involved in three different lawsuits each of which involves
potential defects in title or parties seeking to limit Mines Management’s access to the properties comprising the
Montanore Project. In addition, Mines Management has intervened in three lawsuits challenging environmental
permits granted with respect to the Montanore Project. Should a development or outcome from one of these or any
other lawsuit limit Mines Management’s ability to access, develop or operate the Montanore Project, then Hecla
would likely be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Mines Management. See “Risk
Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management—The title to some of Mines Management’s properties may
be uncertain or defective” beginning on page 32 and “Information Regarding Mines Management—Legal
Proceedings” beginning on page 102.
The market price of Hecla common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the merger.
The market price of Hecla’s common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the merger for a number
of reasons, including the unsuccessful integration of Mines Management and Hecla, the failure of Hecla to achieve
the perceived benefits of the merger, including financial results, difficulties in the Montanore permitting process or
declines in the mining industry, the market prices of silver, gold or copper, Hecla’s business or the economy as a
whole. These factors are, to some extent, beyond the control of Hecla and Mines Management.
The shares of Hecla common stock to be received by Mines Management stockholders as a result of the merger
will have different rights from the shares of Mines Management common stock currently held by Mines
Management stockholders.
Upon completion of the merger, Mines Management stockholders will receive shares of Hecla common stock and
their rights as stockholders of Hecla will be governed by Delaware law and Hecla’s certificate of incorporation and
Hecla’s bylaws. The rights associated with Hecla common stock are different from the rights associated with Mines
Management common stock, articles of incorporation and bylaws. See the section entitled “Comparative Rights of
Hecla Stockholders and Mines Management Stockholders” beginning on page 87 for a discussion of the different
rights associated with Hecla common stock.
Hecla will continue to face other existing and future business and financial risks.
Hecla faces numerous risks associated with its business, financial structure and related matters. These risks are
described under Item 1A, Risk Factors in Hecla’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated
herein by reference and which you should read and carefully consider, and may be updated in Hecla’s Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q.

If the merger does not qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the
stockholders of Mines Management may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the merger.
Although Hecla and Mines Management intend that the merger qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may assert that the merger fails to
qualify as such. If the Internal Revenue Service were to be successful in such assertion, or if for any other reason
the merger were to fail to qualify as a “reorganization,” each U.S. holder (as defined on page 63) of shares of Mines
Management common stock would recognize gain or loss with respect to its shares of Mines Management
common stock based on the difference between (i) that U.S. holder’s tax basis in such shares and (ii) the fair
market value of the shares of Hecla common stock received (and any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of
Hecla common stock). For additional information, see the section entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption
of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” beginning on page 62.
Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management
If the merger is not completed, Mines Management will require additional external financing to fund its continuing
business activities in the future, and the terms of any such financing, if obtained, may have negative effects on
Mines Management’s flexibility and future transactions.
Mines Management is an exploration stage mining company and currently does not have sufficient capital to
continue its business activities as planned through 2016 or to fund the activities needed to establish the economic
feasibility of the Montanore Project. Mines Management had approximately $0.4 million in cash and cash
equivalents as of March 31, 2016, which is insufficient to fund its business and operations through 2016. Mines
Management anticipates that its expenses in 2016 would total approximately $1.6 million for regulatory and
environmental monitoring activities and $2.0 million of general and administrative expenses, assuming that Mines
Management were able to obtain sufficient capital to continue operations. Mines Management estimates that,
following the completion of environmental mitigation activities, the costs of completing the exploratory drilling
program at the Montanore Project will be approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million, plus general and administrative
expenses during the period in which the drilling program is being conducted. Uncertainties surrounding the
exploratory drilling program and the permitting process could require the drilling program to take longer and cause
costs to increase. Mines Management’s cash on hand is not sufficient to continue its business through 2016 or to
commence the exploratory drilling program and a bankable feasibility study, and external financing will be
required.
If the merger is not completed, Mines Management plans to continue its efforts to secure external financing but it
presently does not have agreements from any source under which such financing will be received, and its recent
efforts to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all, other than from Hecla in connection with the merger, have
been unsuccessful. There can be no assurance that Mines Management will be successful in obtaining external
financing or entering into a sale of Mines Management, a sale or joint venture of the Montanore Project, or other
type of transaction that will permit it to repay amounts due to Hecla under the Interim Credit Agreement or continue
its business, or that the terms of any such financing or transaction would not make future financings or
transactions more difficult or otherwise limit Mines Management’s flexibility or opportunities in the future. There
can be no assurance that any financing obtained will not be highly dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, it is
uncertain that the amount of any financing that might be obtained would enable Mines Management to repay
amounts due to Hecla under the Interim Credit Agreement or continue its business and operations for more than a
few months. If no additional funding can be secured, Mines Management may not be able to remain in business or
to complete a transaction with respect to the Montanore Project or any other transaction. Finally, the amounts
owed to Hecla under the Interim Credit Agreement—currently $1.4 million—are secured by the Montanore Project,
and if Mines Management is unable to repay Hecla, it could face the prospects of losing title to Montanore through
foreclosure or other similar remedial measures.

If Mines Management is unable to comply with the NYSE MKT continued listing requirements, its common stock
could be delisted from the NYSE MKT equities market. Delisting could negatively affect its stock price and
investors’ ability to make transactions in its securities.
On July 1, 2015, Mines Management received a letter from NYSE MKT stating that Mines Management was not in
compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(a)(i-iv) of the NYSE MKT Company
Guide (the “Company Guide”). In order to maintain its listing, Mines Management submitted a plan on August 3,
2015, in accordance with the NYSE MKT’s requirement, which addresses how it intends to regain compliance with
the financial impairment standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(iv) of the Company Guide by December 31, 2015 and
the equity standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(i)-(iii) of the Company Guide by December 31, 2016. During
September 2015, the NYSE MKT accepted the Company’s compliance plan and granted Mines Management until
September 30, 2015 to regain compliance with the financial impairment standards. On October 21, 2015, the NYSE
MKT notified Mines Management that Mines Management had made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to
regain compliance with financial impairment standards by the end of the revised plan period of December 31, 2015.
In January 2016, the NYSE MKT granted Mines Management a further extension to regain compliance with financial
impairment standards to March 31, 2016. In April 2016, the NYSE MKT granted Mines Management an additional
extension to June 30, 2016 because Mines Management had made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to
regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iv) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide by the end of the revised plan period
and, in July 2016, the NYSE MKT granted an additional extension to August 31, 2016. If the merger is not
completed, it is uncertain that Mines Management will be able to obtain sufficient external financing to continue its
business and operations for more than a few months, which would be unlikely to satisfy the NYSE MKT financial
impairment listing requirements.
There can be no assurance that Mines Management common stock will remain listed on the NYSE MKT. If Mines
Management is delisted from the NYSE MKT, Mines Management anticipates that its common stock will trade over
the counter. If Mines Management common stock is delisted from the NYSE MKT, its stockholders may face
material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a decrease in the price of its common stock and
reduced liquidity in the trading market for its common stock. Some stockholders may sell their shares, and Mines
Management’s ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future may be negatively
affected. Mines Management would no longer be able to use a short form Form S-3 registration statement (i) for a
primary offering, if Mines Management public float is not at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the
date of filing the Form S-3, or a re-evaluation date, whichever is later, and (ii) to register the resale of its securities
by persons other than Mines Management. If Mines Management were unable to utilize a Form S-3 registration
statement for primary and secondary offerings of Mines Management common stock, Mines Management would be
required to file a Form S-1 registration statement, which, due to regulatory review periods, could delay Mines
Management’s ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock Mines
Management could undertake and could increase the expenses of any offering.
If Mines Management common stock were delisted and determined to be a “penny stock,” a broker-dealer may find
it more difficult to trade Mines Management common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or
dispose of Mines Management common stock in the secondary market.
If Mines Management common stock were removed from listing with the NYSE MKT, it may be subject to the so-
called “penny stock” rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security
that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on
a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules impose
additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If Mines Management
common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade
Mines Management common stock, and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of Mines
Management common stock on the secondary market.

Mines Management has no proven or probable reserves.
Mines Management is currently in the exploration stage and has no proven or probable reserves, as those terms
are defined by the SEC, on any of Mines Management’s properties, including the Montanore Project. The
mineralized material identified to date in respect of the Montanore Project has not demonstrated economic viability
and Mines Management cannot provide any assurance that mineral reserves with economic viability will be
identified on that property.
In order to demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves under SEC guidelines, it would be necessary
for Mines Management to advance the exploration of the Montanore Project by significant additional delineation
drilling to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized material with satisfactory continuity. If successful, the
results of this drilling program would provide the basis for a feasibility study demonstrating with reasonable
certainty that the mineralized material can be economically extracted and produced. Mines Management does not
currently have sufficient data to support a feasibility study of the Montanore Project, and in order to perform the
drilling to support such a feasibility study, Mines Management must first obtain external financing and complete
environmental mitigation activities to continue its exploration efforts. It is possible that, even if Mines Management
obtains sufficient geologic data to support a feasibility study on the Montanore Project, the data will lead it to
conclude that none of the identified mineral deposits can be economically and legally extracted or produced. If
Mines Management cannot adequately confirm or discover any mineral reserves of precious metals at the
Montanore Project, it may not be able to generate any revenues.
Even if Mines Management discovers mineral reserves at the Montanore Project in the future that can be
economically developed, the initial capital costs associated with development and production of any reserves
found is such that Mines Management might not be profitable for a significant time after the initiation of any
development or production. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit once discovered is dependent on a
number of factors beyond Mines Management’s control, including particular attributes of the deposit such as size,
grade and proximity to infrastructure, as well as metal prices. In addition, development of a project as significant as
the Montanore Project will likely require significant debt financing, the terms of which could contribute to a delay of
profitability.
Even if Mines Management’s exploration efforts at the Montanore Project are successful, Mines Management may
not be able to raise the funds necessary to develop the Montanore Project.
If Mines Management’s exploration efforts at the Montanore Project are successful, a Preliminary Economic
Assessment completed in November 2010 indicated that it would cost approximately $550.0 million in additional
financing to develop and construct the Montanore Project. If and when an updated assessment is completed, this
amount could increase significantly. Sources of external financing could include bank debt financing, smelter
offtake financings, equity financing or the sale of all or a portion of the Montanore Project. Even if a bankable
feasibility study is completed, commodity prices, the then-current state of financial markets or other factors may
render financing for the development of the Montanore Project difficult or impossible. Financing has become
significantly more difficult to obtain in the current market environment. There can be no assurance that Mines
Management will commence production at the Montanore Project or generate sufficient revenues to meet its
obligations as they become due or obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and Mines
Management may not be able to secure the financing necessary to begin or sustain production at the Montanore
Project. If Mines Management cannot adequately finance its exploration of the Montanore property and its
subsequent development, Mines Management will not be able to generate any revenues. In addition, should Mines
Management incur significant losses in future periods, it may be unable to continue as a going concern, and
realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in other than the normal course of business may be at amounts
significantly different than those included in Mines Management’s periodic reports.
Additional permits will be required and may be delayed during advancement of the Montanore Project.
In the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of
existing operations or for the commencement of new operations. Although the final RODs were
Table of Contents
31
issued on February 12, 2016, additional permits will be required for advancement of the Montanore Project.
Obtaining these permits has been and continues to be a complex and time consuming process involving
numerous jurisdictions and often involves additional work and studies, public hearings, litigation and other costly
undertakings. Mines Management has been engaged in renewing or pursuing permits since early 2005. Obtaining
required permits for the Montanore Project has been and may continue to be more difficult due to its location within
the Cabinet Wilderness Area and its proximity to a core habitat of certain protected species, including the grizzly
bear and bull trout. In addition, Hecla is seeking to permit its Rock Creek mining project near the Montanore
Project, and the impact of that operation on the environment and on wildlife in the area was taken into
consideration in Mines Management’s permitting determinations and has lengthened its permitting process and
made those determinations more difficult. Private political groups have been active in opposing permitting of
projects in and near the Cabinet Wilderness Area and have taken and may in the future take actions to oppose or
delay the Montanore Project. For example, Save Our Cabinets, Earthworks and Defenders of Wildlife filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(“USFWS”) challenging the issuance of the Montanore biological opinion. Two other lawsuits challenging the
permitting of the Montanore Project have since been filed. See “Information Regarding Mines Management—Legal
Proceedings” beginning on page 102.
Mining projects require the evaluation of environmental impacts for air, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural,
historical, geological, geotechnical, geochemical, soil and socioeconomic conditions. Permits are required for,
among other things, storm-water discharge, air quality, wetland disturbance, dam safety (for water storage and/or
tailing storage), septic and sewage and water rights appropriation, and compliance must be demonstrated with the
Endangered Species Act and the National Historical Preservation Act. Permitting costs through March 31, 2016
have totaled approximately $46.8 million, and it is possible that the costs and delays associated with compliance
with such standards and regulations could become such that Mines Management would be unable to raise
sufficient funds to proceed with the further exploration, development or operation of a mine at the Montanore
Project.
Mines Management has a history of losses and expects losses to continue.
As an exploration stage company that has no production history, Mines Management has incurred losses since its
inception, and it expects to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. For the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014, Mines Management incurred losses of $2.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively. As
of March 31, 2016, Mines Management had an accumulated deficit of $90.3 million. There can be no assurance that
Mines Management will achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
The title to some of Mines Management’s properties may be uncertain or defective.
Although the Montanore deposit is held by patented mining claims, a significant portion of Mines Management’s
United States mineral and surface use rights consist of “unpatented” mining and millsite claims created and
maintained in accordance with the General Mining Law. Unpatented mining and millsite claims are unique U.S.
property interests and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests
because the validity of unpatented mining and millsite claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out
of the complex federal and state laws and regulations that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented
mining and millsite claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges
by third parties or contests by the federal government. The validity of an unpatented mining or millsite claim, in
terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal
and state statutory and decisional law. In addition, there are few public records that definitively control the issues
of validity and ownership of unpatented mining and millsite claims. Mines Management has not filed a patent
application for any of its unpatented mining and millsite claims that are located on federal public lands in the
United States and, under current law and possible future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents
may not be available. Mines Management has obtained a title opinion on some of the patented mining claims
covering the Montanore deposit, but not on all of its patented mining claims. Mines Management has not obtained
title opinions on any of its unpatented mining or millsite claims.
Table of Contents
32
Mines Management’s ability to conduct exploration, development, mining and related activities may also be
impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies. With respect to unpatented millsites, for example,
the ability to use millsites and their validity has been subject to greater uncertainty since 1997. In November of
1997, the Secretary of the Interior approved a Solicitor’s Opinion which concluded that the General Mining Law
imposed a limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed or used in connection with each associated
and valid unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Subsequently, however, on October 7, 2003, the new Secretary
of the Interior approved an Opinion by the Deputy Solicitor which concluded that the mining laws do not impose a
limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed in connection with each associated unpatented or
patented lode mining claim. Current federal regulations do not include the millsite limitation. There can be no
assurance, however, that the Department of the Interior will not seek to re-impose the millsite limitation at some
point in the future.
Other actions have been periodically brought, including one action that is currently ongoing, against the
Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S.
Forest Service (USFS), seeking to impose the five-acre millsite limitation, as well as to require mining claimants to
pay fair market value for their use of the surface of federal lands where those claimants have not demonstrated the
validity of their unpatented mining claims and millsites. To date, such actions have not been successful, but there
can be no assurances they or other actions will not be in the future.
In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law,
as well as legislation that would make comprehensive changes to the law. Although no such legislation has been
adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If adopted, such
legislation, if it included concepts that have been part of previous legislative proposals, could, among other things,
(i) adopt the millsite limitation discussed above, (ii) impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation
that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental compliance and reclamation
requirements, (iv) establish a mechanism that would allow states, localities and Native American tribes to petition
for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for
administrative determinations that mining would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the
federal lands in question could not be prevented and (vi) impose royalties on silver and copper production or fees
on tons of material moved from unpatented mining claims located on federal lands or impose fees on production
or tons of material moved from patented mining claims. If adopted, such legislation could have an adverse impact
on earnings from Mines Management’s operations, could reduce estimates of any reserves Mines Management
may establish and could curtail its future exploration and development activity on federal lands or patented claims.
While Mines Management does not believe that title to any of its properties is defective, title to mining properties is
subject to potential claims by third parties claiming an interest in them. For example, in September 2007, Mines
Management filed a declaratory judgment action captioned Mines Management, Inc., Newhi, Inc. and Montanore
Minerals Corp. v. Tracie Fus et al., Cause No. DV 07-248 in Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Lincoln
County. In this action, Mines Management sought a court judgment against certain of the defendants that the
unpatented mining claims of such defendants allegedly located above portions of Mines Management’s adit and
overlapping certain of its patented and unpatented mining claims, millsites and tunnel sites are invalid. The
defendants then asserted trespass claims against Mines Management relating to Mines Management’s use of
certain of its mining claims, millsites and the adit. The parties participated in a mediation in 2009, which resulted in
a settlement with seven of the ten defendants. In mid-March 2013 the court issued an order (i) enforcing the
settlement with seven of the ten defendants, (ii) enjoining Mines Management from trespassing on certain mining
claims owned by one of the defendants and (iii) finding that the mining claim of another defendant is valid and
superior to certain of Mines Management’s claims. The claims with respect to which Mines Management was
enjoined from trespass do not overlap the adit. The mining claim that the court determined was valid and superior
to certain of Mines Management’s claims overlaps portions of the adit and portions of certain of its patented claims
and unpatented mill sites and tunnel sites. Mines Management appealed to the Montana Supreme Court with
respect to certain portions of the order. The Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mines Management,
remanding the case to the district court with instructions to vacate the injunction
Table of Contents
33
and to conduct further proceedings. Mines Management does not believe that this order, if re-entered by the
district court, would affect its ability to use the adit or to conduct exploration and development operations as
currently planned once Mines Management has obtained the required permits. See further details regarding this
action under “Information Regarding Mines Management—Legal Proceedings” beginning on page 102.
Mines Management is obligated by a right of first refusal agreement relating to its future silver production that may
affect the willingness of third parties to enter into silver purchase agreements with it.
In November 2007, Mines Management entered into a right of first refusal agreement with a significant stockholder
that granted to that stockholder a 20-year right of first proposal and a right to match third-party proposals to
purchase a silver stream, i.e., all or any portion of silver mined, produced or recovered by Mines Management in the
State of Montana. The right does not apply to trade sales and spot sales in the ordinary course of business or
forward sales. The existence of this agreement may make other potential buyers less likely to negotiate with Mines
Management to purchase silver Mines Management produces since they would be subject to this right of first
refusal.

Overview. Mines Management, Inc. is engaged in the business of acquiring and exploring, and if exploration is
successful, developing, mineral properties, primarily those containing silver and associated base and precious
metals. Mines Management was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on February 20, 1947. Mines
Management’s principal mineral property interest, the Montanore Project, is held by its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Newhi, Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. Mines Management’s properties, including the Montanore property, are
currently in the exploration stage; none of its properties are currently in production.
Mines Management common stock is currently listed for trading on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “MGN” and
the TSX under the symbol “MGT.”
Mines Management’s executive offices and principal place of business are located at 905 West Riverside Avenue,
Suite 311, Spokane, Washington 99201. Mines Management’s registered agent in Idaho is located at 921 S. Orchard
St., Suite G, Boise, Idaho 83705.
Additional information about Mines Management and its subsidiaries is set forth under “Information Regarding
Mines Management” beginning on page 97.
Montanore Project. The Montanore Project is located in northwestern Montana and from 1988 to 2002 was owned
by Noranda. During that time the project received an approved EIS, ROD and all of its primary
Table of Contents
35
environmental permits, and conducted pre-evaluation construction activities on the property. From 1988 to 2002,
Mines Management held royalty rights to a portion of the deposit. In 2002, Noranda announced that it was
abandoning the project, and subsequently transferred to Mines Management by quitclaim deed the patented and
unpatented mining claims that control the mineral rights, and all drill core and intellectual property including
geologic, environmental and engineering studies, relating to the Montanore Project.
In May 2006, Mines Management acquired two Noranda subsidiaries that held title to the property providing access
to the 14,000 foot Libby adit and related permits. The Libby adit, when extended, will provide access to the
Montanore deposit for Mines Management’s planned underground exploration and delineation drilling program.
Mines Management submitted revisions to the operating permit that allowed it to reopen the Libby adit in 2006 and
to proceed with dewatering and rehabilitation of the adit. In March 2008, Mines Management obtained authorization
from the State of Montana to resume the exploration activities started by the previous owner. Until the
environmental review process for the Montanore Project was completed, Mines Management was prohibited from
conducting exploration activities at the Libby adit.
Since 2003, Mines Management has spent approximately $77.2 million on evaluation and updating of data,
including that originating from previous owners, permitting activities, acquisition of equipment, construction of site
infrastructure and development and construction of a dewatering system. As currently planned, the advanced
exploration and delineation drilling program includes the following:
•
Development and advancement of the Libby adit by 3,000 feet to access the Montanore deposit;
•
Drifting of approximately 10,000 feet and establishment of drill stations; and
•
Diamond core drilling of approximately 50 holes totaling approximately 50,000 feet.
Results of the drilling program, if successful, would provide data to support the completion of a bankable feasibility
study and further optimization of the mine plan. The advanced exploration and delineation drilling program,
through completion of a bankable feasibility study, is expected to cost an additional $20.0 to $25.0 million.
Before Mines Management could advance the Montanore Project, it was required to obtain the requisite project
approvals and permits from the USFS, Montana Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”), the USFWS, and
the US Army Corps of Engineers. A Draft EIS was issued by the USFS and the MDEQ in the first quarter of 2009.
After the comment period expired, it was determined by the agencies that a Supplemental Draft EIS was necessary
and this was completed in September 2011. The public comment period for the Supplemental Draft EIS closed in
December 2011. The USFWS issued the final biological opinion for terrestrial and aquatic endangered species
during the second quarter of 2014, indicating the Montanore Project posed no jeopardy to endangered species in
the area around the Project. The USFS and the MDEQ continued to develop the Final EIS during 2014 and issued
the preliminary Final EIS during the third quarter of 2014. A second preliminary Final EIS was completed late in
2014. Several drafts of the ROD were also completed during 2014 by the EIS contractor. The USFS and the MDEQ
provided legal notice to the public on April 1, 2015 announcing the availability of the Final EIS and Draft ROD.
Following a public objection and resolution process, the USFS and MDEQ integrated clarifying comments into the
Final EIS. In December 2015, the USFS and MDEQ issued the Final EIS and, on February 12, 2016, issued RODs
approving development of the Montanore Project. Mines Management plans to commence the extension of the
underground adit and the underground evaluation and delineation drilling program after obtaining sufficient
external financing and completing requisite environmental mitigation activities.

record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and at any
adjournment or postponements thereof. A list of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will
be available for inspection by stockholders for ten days before the special meeting at Mines Management’s
executive offices and principal place of business at 905 West Riverside Avenue, Suite 311, Spokane, Washington
99201 during ordinary business hours for any purpose germane to the special meeting. The list will also be
available at the special meeting for examination by any stockholder of record present at the special meeting.
As of the close of business on the record date, there were outstanding a total of 35,857,893 shares of Mines
Management common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date,
approximately 8.1% of the outstanding shares of Mines Management common stock were held by Mines
Management directors and officers and their affiliates. Certain stockholders of Mines Management, including
certain Mines Management directors and officers, have entered into shareholders agreements, each dated May 23,
2016, pursuant to which each such stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares of common
stock of Mines Management (as set forth in such stockholder’s shareholders agreement) in favor of the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement.
Each share of Mines Management common stock owned on the record date is entitled to one vote on each
proposal at the special meeting.

If you own shares of Mines Management common stock that are registered in the name of someone else, such as a
broker, you are not a holder of record and instead hold your shares in “street name.” Holders in “street name” will
need to direct the organization in whose name their shares are registered to vote those shares or obtain
authorization from them and vote the shares yourself at the special meeting, as described below.
Quorum
A quorum is necessary to transact business at the special meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the Mines Management common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be
counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Required Vote
Approval and adoption of the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Mines Management common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the matter, and a quorum
must be present at the special meeting.
Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
If you are a Mines Management stockholder and fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker to vote, it will
have no effect on the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal, assuming a
quorum is present. If you are a Mines Management stockholder and you mark your proxy or provide voting
instructions to abstain, it will have no effect on the merger proposal, the adjournment proposal and the
compensation proposal.
Voting in Person
If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the meeting. Please
note, however, that if your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to
the meeting a legal proxy executed in your favor from the record holder of the shares (your broker) authorizing you
to vote at the meeting.
In addition, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license or passport. If you hold
your shares in “street name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or
letter from your broker proving ownership on the record date, along with proper identification. Stockholders will
not be allowed to use cameras, recording devices and other similar electronic devices at the meeting.
Voting of Proxies
A proxy card is enclosed for your use. Mines Management requests that you mark, sign and date the
accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying
proxy is properly executed and returned, the shares of Mines Management common stock represented by it will be
voted at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in accordance with the instructions
contained in the proxy.
As of the date hereof, management has no knowledge of any business that will be presented for consideration at
the special meeting and which would be required to be set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus or the related
proxy card other than the matters set forth in Mines Management’s Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders. If
any other matter is properly presented at the meeting for consideration, it is intended that the persons named in
the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their best judgment on such matter.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or submit a proxy
via the Internet or by telephone whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person.
All shares represented by properly executed proxies received (including proxies received via the Internet or by
telephone) in time for the special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the manner specified by the stockholder
giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions with respect to the merger
proposal, the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal will be voted “FOR” that proposal.
Shares Held in “Street Name”
If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a broker (that is, in “street
name”), you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares if you
wish them to be counted. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker. Please note that you may
not vote shares held in “street name” by returning a proxy card directly to Mines Management or by voting in
person at the special meeting unless you provide a legal proxy, which you must obtain from your broker. Further,
brokers who hold shares of Mines Management common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy
to Mines Management to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.
If you are a Mines Management stockholder holding your shares in “street name” and you do not instruct your
broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may not vote your shares, which will have no effect on the merger
proposal, the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present.
Revocation of Proxies
You have the power to revoke your proxy at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you are a
holder of record, you can revoke your proxy in one of three ways:
•
you can send a signed notice of revocation;
•
you can grant a new, valid proxy bearing a later date (including by telephone or through the Internet); or
•
you can attend the meeting and vote in person, which will cancel any proxy previously given, or you can revoke
your proxy in person, but your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given.
If you submit a signed notice of revocation or grant a new written proxy, your notice of revocation or your new
proxy must be received by the Corporate Secretary of Mines Management at 905 West Riverside Avenue, Suite 311,
Spokane, Washington 99201 no later than the beginning of the special meeting. If you do so by telephone or
through the Internet, your revised instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 11,
2016.
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker you should contact your broker to change your vote or
revoke your proxy.
Tabulation of Votes
Mines Management has appointed one or more representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to serve as
the inspector of election for the special meeting. The inspector of election will, among other matters, determine the
number of shares represented at the special meeting to confirm the existence of a quorum, determine the validity
of all proxies and ballots and certify the results of voting on all proposals submitted to the stockholders.

Solicitation of Proxies
39
In accordance with the merger agreement, the cost of proxy solicitation for the special meeting will be borne by
Mines Management. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by officers and directors and regular
employees of Mines Management, some of whom may be considered participants in the solicitation, without
additional remuneration, by telephone, facsimile or otherwise. Mines Management will also request brokerage
firms, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of
record on the record date and will provide customary reimbursement to such firms for the cost of forwarding these
materials. Mines Management has retained Morrow & Co., LLC to assist it in its solicitation of proxies and has
agreed to pay them a fee of $10,000 plus a fee of $6.50 per non-objecting beneficial owner, plus reasonable
expenses, for these services.
Adjournments
If a quorum is not present or represented, the chairman of the meeting and the stockholders entitled to vote at the
special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time
to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. If a
quorum is present at the meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the meeting to approve and adopt
the merger proposal, then Mines Management stockholders may be asked to vote on the adjournment proposal.
The chairman of the meeting also has the power to adjourn the meeting. No notices of an adjourned meeting need
be given unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days, in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any
subsequent reconvening of the special meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted
that might have been transacted at the original meeting and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they
would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been
effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the proxy is voted at the reconvened meeting.

PROPOSAL 1: THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement
Mines Management is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by Mines
Management’s board of directors to approve and adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will
be merged with and into Mines Management (with Mines Management surviving the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Hecla) and each outstanding share of common stock of Mines Management (other than shares
owned by Mines Management, Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, which will be cancelled)
will be converted into the right to receive 0.2218 of a share of common stock of Hecla. Any stockholders entitled to
receive a fractional share of Hecla common stock shall receive cash in lieu of such fractional share.
Approval and adoption of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by
holders of Mines Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting
and entitled to vote on the matter, and a quorum must be present at the special meeting.
If you are a Mines Management stockholder and fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker to vote, it will
have no effect on the merger proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you are a Mines Management stockholder
and you mark your proxy or provide voting instructions to abstain, it will have no effect on the merger proposal,
assuming a quorum is present.
Hecla stockholders are not required to adopt the merger agreement or approve the merger or the issuance of
Hecla common stock in connection with the merger.
Effects of the Merger
At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Mines Management, with Mines Management surviving
the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla. In the merger, each share of Mines Management
common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the merger (other than shares owned by
Mines Management, Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, which will be cancelled) will be
converted into the right to receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will
not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to closing of the merger. Any stockholders entitled to receive a
fractional share of Hecla common stock shall receive cash in lieu of such fractional share.
Immediately following the consummation the merger, Hecla will own 100% of the issued and outstanding common
stock of Mines Management. It is projected that holders of Mines Management common stock will own
approximately 2.28% of Hecla’s outstanding common stock, while existing stockholders of Hecla will continue to
own the remaining 97.72%.
Background of the Merger
The Mines Management board of directors has from time to time explored strategic options potentially available to
Mines Management to finance the further exploration and development of the Montanore Project and enhance
stockholder value. These have included multiple discussions with representatives of other exploration and mining
companies concerning possible business combinations or joint ventures to explore and develop the Montanore
Project, and with private equity funds and other financial institutions concerning either providing additional
financing to Mines Management or acquiring Mines Management or all or a portion of its assets. Numerous
confidentiality agreements have been executed to enable these other companies and institutions to conduct due
diligence of either Mines Management in its entirety or the Montanore Project alone. These efforts have, over the
past several years, resulted in preliminary discussions with many such companies and institutions, including
Hecla. None of these preliminary discussions resulted in a proposal that the Mines Management board of directors
could recommend to Mines Management stockholders. None of the confidentiality agreements prevent any
company from making Mines Management an offer superior to Hecla’s.
Table of Contents

Following issuance of the final EIS for the Montanore Project in March 2015, Mines Management initiated contact
regarding financing, joint venture or business combination transactions with multiple private equity funds and
exploration and mining companies and entered into confidentiality agreements with certain interested parties,
including Hecla, to enable those companies and institutions to conduct due diligence. Subsequently, in July 2015,
Mines Management sent out requests for proposals to approximately fifty private equity funds and exploration and
mining companies. As a result of those efforts, Mines Management received two responses containing
proposals. Of these two responses, one was from Hecla and the other was from an unrelated third party with which
Mines Management entered into a confidentiality agreement. After preliminary due diligence, the third party
decided not to move forward with a proposal. Concurrently, Mines Management engaged a financial advisor
concerning a possible debt or equity financing. Mines Management ended the engagement with the financial
advisor in October 2015 due to a lack of interest in the possible debt or equity financing. In October 2015, in order
to improve its cash position and continue its business, Mines Management sold mining equipment for
approximately $1.67 million.
Beginning at least as early as 2011 and from time to time over the next several years, Mines Management and Hecla
discussed a potential strategic transaction, including a joint venture with respect to the Montanore Project or a
business combination. These principally involved discussions between Glenn M. Dobbs (Chairman of the Board of
Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Mines Management) and Phillips S. Baker, Jr. (President and Chief
Executive Officer of Hecla).
Throughout the summer of 2012, Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Baker met several times in Spokane, Washington to discuss
the possibility of a joint venture between the companies.
In August 2013, Mr. Dobbs contacted Mr. Baker suggesting a meeting would be appropriate to discuss a joint
venture in light of then imminent permitting developments for the Montanore Project, and the two met on August
29, 2013 in Spokane.
In November 2013, Mr. Dobbs again contacted Mr. Baker to inquire of Hecla’s interest in a joint venture based on
positive permitting developments and indicated that a due diligence web site had been established by Mines
Management to allow interested parties that signed a non-disclosure agreement to review technical data about the
Montanore Project. The parties did not reach agreement regarding a transaction and terminated discussions.
On April 3, 2015, Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Baker met in Spokane to discuss Hecla’s interest in Mines Management and
the Montanore Project. Hecla had recently announced the pending acquisition of Revett Mining Company, Inc.
(“Revett”), which at the time owned the Rock Creek silver and copper project located near the Montanore Project.
The acquisition of Revett was subsequently completed in June 2015. The USFS and MDEQ had recently provided
notice to the public of the availability of the final EIS and draft ROD, a significant step towards issuance of the final
ROD, following which underground exploration of the Montanore deposit could proceed. The parties agreed to
continue discussions.
On May 8, 2015, Mines Management and Hecla entered into a confidentiality agreement.
On May 18, 2015, Hecla employees Luke Russell (Vice President—External Affairs), Steve Petroni (General Manager
—Exploration), and John Jordan (Vice President—Technical Services) met with Glenn Dobbs and Doug Dobbs
(Director, President and Secretary of Mines Management) at Mines Management’s office in Spokane to discuss the
Montanore Project.
Hecla continued due diligence on Mines Management and the Montanore Project in May and June 2015, and on
June 24, 2015 representatives of Hecla and Mines Management met near Libby, Montana for a site visit to the
Montanore Project, including the Libby adit. Present for Hecla were Luke Russell, Steve Petroni, Dave Holland
(Senior Environmental Engineer) and Keith Blair (Chief Resource Geologist). Present for Mines Management were
Glenn Dobbs, Rod MacLeod (Chief Geologist), Denver Winslow (Chief Engineer), and Erik Klepfer (environmental
consultant).

Mines Management continued to experience deterioration of its financial condition, and on July 1, 2015, Mines
Management was notified by the NYSE MKT that it was not in compliance with certain of the continued listing
standards as set forth in the Company Guide.
As previously mentioned, in July 2015, Mines Management sent out requests for proposals regarding financing
and Montanore Project joint venture or business combination transactions to approximately fifty private equity
funds and exploration and mining companies, including Hecla. In addition, Mr. Dobbs sent a letter dated July 14,
2015 to Mr. Baker requesting that Hecla propose by July 17, 2015 the terms of a joint venture pursuant to which
Hecla could initially earn a 40% interest in the Montanore Project with the potential to increase its interest to 60%.
At Mr. Baker’s suggestion, Mr. Baker and Mr. Dobbs met on July 22, 2015 at Mines Management’s office in
Spokane. They discussed Mines Management’s current financial condition and the status of Mines Management’s
permitting and development activities at the Montanore Project. Mr. Baker informed Mr. Dobbs that Hecla might be
interested in a possible transaction with Mines Management and that he would discuss it with Hecla’s
management.
On July 31, 2015, Hecla sent to Mines Management a non-binding indicative term sheet for a senior secured
convertible debt facility to be made available to Mines Management and a joint venture between Hecla and Mines
Management with respect to the Montanore Project. The letter proposed a $9.0 million revolving loan for Mines
Management and a joint venture that would own the Montanore Project in which Hecla would have a 70% interest
and Mines Management a 30% interest.
On August 4, 2015, Mines Management sent a letter to Hecla rejecting the July 31 proposal and instead proposed
an upfront, non-refundable payment of $4.5 million by Hecla to Mines Management, followed by another $4.0 million
payment upon execution of a joint venture agreement, pursuant to which Hecla could earn a 40% interest in the
Montanore Project, increasing to a maximum of 60% upon completion of construction of a mine at the Montanore
Project.
Throughout August, September and early October, the companies continued to negotiate the possible terms of a
loan and joint venture transaction but did not reach an agreement. Discussions of these potential transactions
terminated in mid-November 2015.
On February 12, 2016, the USFS and MDEQ issued RODs approving development of the Montanore Project, and
Mines Management issued a news release regarding the issuance of the RODs. Mr. Dobbs sent a copy of the news
release to Mr. Baker, who responded on February 17, 2016 with an email congratulating Mr. Dobbs and suggesting
that Hecla was interested in hearing details about the RODs.
On February 25, 2016, Mr. Dobbs sent an email to Mr. Baker congratulating Hecla on the issuance by the USFS of a
draft supplemental EIS for Hecla’s Rock Creek project and stated his view that a transaction between Hecla and
Mines Management continued to make sense.
In early March 2016, following issuance of the federal and state RODs in February 2016, Mines Management
engaged a financial advisor to pursue a possible debt or equity financing. The engagement ended in mid-March
due to a lack of interest in a financing. Also, in March 2016, Mines Management initiated contact with multiple
private equity funds and exploration and mining companies. On March 21, 2016, Mines Management announced
that it had retained CG as financial advisor in order to assist Mines Management in reviewing and developing
strategic options to enhance stockholder value.
In mid-March, Mines Management entered into negotiations with a mining company regarding a potential
transaction. A number of alternatives were discussed, including the acquisition of a royalty interest in the
Montanore Project, the acquisition of Mines Management common stock and a joint venture with respect to the
Montanore Project. The parties were unable to reach an agreement, and discussions terminated in mid-April.
Table of Contents
43
From March 22, 2016 to March 23, 2016, several conversations occurred between Mines Management, through
Gunnar Eggertson and Ted Hirst of CG, and Hecla, through Rob Brown (Vice President—Corporate Development).
On April 1, 2016, a lawsuit challenging the permitting of the Montanore Project was filed by Earthworks, Save Our
Cabinets and the Clark Fork Coalition in the U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula. Another lawsuit challenging
the permitting was filed on April 5, 2016. A third lawsuit challenging the permitting of the Montanore Project had
previously been filed on June 17, 2015.
On April 4, 2016, Hecla sent a non-binding indicative letter of interest to Mines Management’s board of directors
proposing that Hecla acquire Mines Management for a total consideration of $0.65 per share payable in shares of
Hecla common stock using an exchange ratio of 0.2359 Hecla shares for each share of Mines Management
common stock. The proposal represented a premium of 30% to Mines Management’s volume weighted average
closing share price of $0.4974 for the 20 previous trading days ended April 1, 2016. The letter also proposed to
address Mines Management’s short term liquidity needs in the form of secured loans in an aggregate amount not
to exceed $1.0 million, made available pursuant to an interim credit agreement to be executed on the same date as
the definitive acquisition agreement. The collateral securing the loan was proposed to be the Montanore property
and a pledge by Mines Management of the stock of its subsidiaries. Loans would bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to LIBOR plus 5% and would be due and payable on the sooner of (i) August 1, 2016 or (ii) as soon as
practicable after the closing of the acquisition. The letter of interest was subject to due diligence and other
customary conditions, and provided a deadline for execution by Mines Management of April 8, 2016. In addition,
the non-binding indicative letter of interest prohibited Mines Management from soliciting an alternative to the
proposed merger (but not from considering or accepting a non-solicited alternative proposal) until May 17, 2016 in
consideration of Hecla’s time, effort and expense in pursuing the proposed merger.
Due to ongoing negotiations under an exclusivity arrangement between Mines Management and the third party
mining company referred to above, Mines Management was unable to respond to Hecla’s April 4 letter of interest.
On April 8, 2016, Hecla sent a letter to Mines Management’s board extending the deadline to execute its April 4
letter of interest until April 18, 2016.
On April 15, 2016, Mines Management’s exclusivity arrangement with the third party terminated. Promptly following
April 15, 2016, CG resumed discussions with Hecla about a potential acquisition of Mines Management.
On April 18, 2016, Hecla sent a letter to Mines Management’s board of directors extending the deadline to execute
its April 4 letter of interest until April 21, 2016.
On April 20, 2016, Mines Management sent a non-binding letter in response to Hecla’s April 4 letter of interest,
proposing that Hecla acquire Mines Management for a total consideration of $1.00 per share payable in shares of
Hecla common stock using an exchange ratio of 0.2985 Hecla shares for each share of Mines Management
common stock. The proposal represented a premium of 41% to Mines Management’s closing share price of $0.71
on April 19, 2016 and was based on Hecla’s closing share price of $3.35 on April 18, 2016. Mines Management also
proposed that Hecla offer an interim credit agreement to address Mines Management’s short term liquidity needs in
the form of secured loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 million, with $0.5 million being advanced on
April 29, 2016 and secured by Mines Management’s warehouse facility in Libby, Montana, and the remaining $1.5
million advanced upon execution of a definitive acquisition agreement and secured by the Montanore property and
a pledge by Mines Management of the stock of its subsidiaries. Both loans would be due and payable on August
31, 2016 or, if the acquisition was completed, the loans would be forgiven. In addition, the exclusivity period was
shortened to May 13, 2016. The Mines Management letter was subject to completion of due diligence by Hecla
before execution of the definitive acquisition agreement and other customary conditions, and provided a deadline
for execution of April 22, 2016.

On April 21, 2016, Messrs. Baker and Brown discussed the terms of Mines Management’s April 20 letter of interest
with Mr. Eggertson of CG.
On April 21, 2016, in response to Mines Management’s April 20 letter of interest, Hecla sent a non-binding letter to
Mines Management proposing that Hecla acquire Mines Management for a total consideration of $1.00 per share
payable in shares of Hecla common stock using an exchange ratio of 0.2597 Hecla shares for each share of Mines
Management common stock. The proposal represented a premium of 41% to Mines Management’s closing share
price of $0.71 on April 19, 2016 and a premium of 87% to the closing share price on April 4, 2016, the date of Hecla’s
first 2016 letter of interest, and was based on Hecla’s closing share price of US$3.85 on April 19, 2016. The letter
also proposed to address Mines Management’s short term liquidity needs through secured loans in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $1.0 million, to be made available pursuant to an interim credit agreement to be executed on
the same date as the definitive acquisition agreement and indicated that Hecla would consider advancing a loan
prior to executing a definitive acquisition agreement to cover Mines Management’s accounts payable in arrears or
other past due amounts which were demonstrated to Hecla’s reasonable satisfaction to pose a risk to Mines
Management of bankruptcy or involuntary liquidation. The letter proposed that the loan would be secured by the
Montanore property and a pledge by Mines Management of the stock of its subsidiaries, but that any loan made
before the definitive acquisition agreement was executed would be secured by Mines Management’s warehouse
facility in Libby, Montana, generators at the Montanore Project site and the water treatment plant at the Montanore
Project site. Loans would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 5% and would be due and payable
on the sooner of (i) August 1, 2016 or (ii) as soon as practicable after the closing of the acquisition. In addition, the
letter proposed an extended exclusivity period to August 1, 2016. The Hecla letter was subject to due diligence and
other customary conditions, and provided a deadline for execution of April 22, 2016.
On April 25, 2016, Mines Management sent to Hecla financial information showing its current financial position and
its estimated expenses through August 2016.
Also on April 25, 2016, Mines Management sent a non-binding letter in response to Hecla’s April 21 letter of
interest, and in the letter Mines Management proposed that Hecla acquire Mines Management for a total
consideration of $1.00 per share payable in shares of Hecla common stock using an exchange rate to be
determined at the time of signing the definitive acquisition agreement. The proposal represented a premium of 41%
to Mines Management’s closing share price of $0.71 on April 19, 2016 and a premium of 87% to the closing share
price on April 4, 2016, the date of Hecla’s first 2016 letter of interest. The letter also proposed to address Mines
Management’s short term liquidity needs in the form of secured loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0
million on the same terms as contained in Hecla’s April 21 letter. In addition, the exclusivity period was shortened
to May 13, 2016. The letter of interest was subject to due diligence and other customary conditions, and provided a
deadline for execution of April 25, 2016.
On April 25 and 26, 2016, Messrs. Baker and Brown discussed the terms of Mines Management’s April 25 letter of
interest with Mr. Eggertson of CG.
On April 26, 2016, Mines Management sent a letter to Hecla revising its April 25 letter of interest by (1) changing the
loan terms to a maturity of the sooner of (i) August 15, 2016 or (ii) as soon as practicable after the closing of the
acquisition, (2) changing the collateral to include only the Montanore property and a pledge by Mines Management
of the stock of its subsidiaries and (3) eliminating the concept of any funds being loaned prior to the execution of
the definitive acquisition agreement.
On April 26, 2016, Messrs. Baker and Brown discussed the terms of Mines Management’s April 26 letter of interest
with Mr. Eggertson of CG.
On April 26, 2016, Hecla sent a revised non-binding indicative letter of interest consistent with the terms set forth in
Mines Management’s April 26 letter of interest, which was executed by both Hecla and Mines Management.

On April 29, 2016, Hecla sent to Mines Management: (i) a draft of an agreement and plan of merger among Hecla, HL
Idaho Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla, and Mines Management, (ii) a draft of a shareholders agreement
pursuant to which Mines Management’s directors, officers, and Silver Wheaton Corp., a shareholder of Mines
Management, would agree to vote in favor of the transaction and (iii) a due diligence request list.
On or about May 2, 2016, Hecla commenced its review of due diligence materials provided by Mines Management
on a data site. During May, Hecla conducted due diligence on Mines Management, which took the form of review of
materials on the data site, as well as supplemental meetings and correspondence.
On May 2, 3 and 4, 2016, representatives of Hecla met with representatives of Mines Management at Mines
Management’s office to discuss financial, accounting, information technology and related matters.
On or about May 6, 2016, Gunnar Eggertson of CG contacted representatives of Silver Wheaton Corp. to discuss
the proposed agreement and plan of merger, including Hecla’s requirement that Silver Wheaton Corp. execute a
shareholders agreement irrevocably committing Silver Wheaton Corp. to vote in favor of the transaction.
Representatives of Silver Wheaton Corp. told Mr. Eggertson that Silver Wheaton Corp. would execute the
requested shareholders agreement subject to certain changes to the shareholders agreement that were accepted
by Hecla.
On May 6, 2016, Mines Management provided Hecla with comments and suggested changes to the draft agreement
and plan of merger.
On May 10, 2016, the Mines Management board of directors held a meeting to discuss the current draft agreement
and plan of merger. At the meeting, the Mines Management board of directors also appointed a special committee
of the board, comprised of independent directors Russell Babcock, Roy Franklin, Jerry Pogue and Robert Russell.
The special committee was formed to consider and evaluate the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction;
to obtain advice from Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP, Mines Management’s counsel, with respect to the proposed
transaction; to obtain advice and an opinion from a financial advisor as to the fairness of the merger consideration,
from a financial point of view, to Mines Management’s stockholders; to determine whether the proposed
transaction is in the best interests of Mines Management and its stockholders; to consider if appropriate
alternatives to the proposed transaction existed and, if an alternative transaction, offer or proposal was made to
Mines Management, to consider and make recommendations to the Mines Management board of directors with
respect to such other transaction; and to provide recommendations to the Mines Management board of directors in
conjunction with the foregoing.
Following the May 10 board meeting, the Mines Management special committee met with representatives of Davis
Graham & Stubbs LLP. The Committee asked questions and received advice regarding certain provisions of the
merger agreement and issues that remained subject to negotiation. The special committee authorized management
to proceed with negotiation of the agreement and plan of merger.
On May 10, 2016, Hecla sent Mines Management a revised agreement and plan of merger. The revised agreement
contained many of the suggested changes that had been proposed by Mines Management’s management and
Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP.
On May 15, 2016, Mines Management provided Hecla with suggested additional changes to the revised agreement
and plan of merger.
On May 16, 2016, Hecla sent Mines Management a revised non-binding indicative letter of interest. The material
changes to the non-binding indicative letter of interest were to decrease the consideration to $0.95 per share
payable in Hecla common stock, increase the amount of the secured term loan to $2.3 million and extend the
exclusivity period to May 24, 2016.

On May 17, 2016, the Mines Management board of directors held a meeting to discuss the revised non-binding
indicative letter of interest. At the meeting, the Mines Management board of directors determined that Mines
Management should send a revised non-binding indicative letter of interest to Hecla with total consideration of
$1.00 per share payable in Hecla common stock. The Mines Management board authorized management to
negotiate the per share price with Hecla, with a floor price of $0.95 per share.
On May 18, 2016, Mines Management sent Hecla a revised non-binding indicative letter of interest. The material
changes to the non-binding indicative letter of interest were increasing the total consideration to $1.00 per share
payable in Hecla common stock and extending the length of exclusivity only to May 20, 2016. Later that same day,
Hecla sent Mines Management a revised non-binding indicative letter of interest. The material changes to the Hecla
non-binding indicative letter of interest were decreasing the total consideration to $0.95 per share payable in Hecla
common stock and extending the length of exclusivity to May 24, 2016. Each of the parties signed the revised
Hecla non-binding indicative letter of interest on May 19, 2016.
On May 18, 2016, Hecla provided Mines Management with suggested additional changes to the revised agreement
and plan of merger.
On May 19, 2016, Mines Management provided Hecla with suggested additional changes to the revised agreement
and plan of merger. On that same day, Mines Management instructed CG to prepare an analysis of the merger
transaction specified in the draft agreement and plan of merger and, if consistent with CG’s analysis, prepare and
deliver an opinion to the Mines Management board of directors that the merger consideration was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Mines Management common stockholders.
On May 21, 2016, the special committee of the Mines Management board of directors met telephonically with
representatives of Mines Management’s management, representatives of Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP and
representatives of CG to review and discuss the Hecla merger proposal. With the management directors in
attendance, the special committee received advice from counsel regarding the duties and obligations of the
directors under Idaho law with respect to the merger proposal, information regarding the final terms of the
agreement and plan of merger and the report of CG and its oral opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in
writing) concerning the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to Mines Management
common stockholders. The special committee unanimously approved and adopted the merger proposal and
recommended its approval and adoption to the board of directors.
On May 21, 2016, following the special committee meeting, the Mines Management board of directors met
telephonically with representatives of Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP and representatives of CG to review and
discuss the Hecla merger proposal and the duties and obligations of the Mines Management board of directors
under Idaho law with respect to the merger proposal, and to hear the recommendation of the special committee.
The Mines Management board of directors thereafter unanimously approved and adopted the merger proposal.
During May 23, 2016, representatives of Mines Management and Hecla, and their respective counsel, finalized the
agreement and plan of merger and the parties executed the merger agreement. The Interim Credit Agreement and
related documents were also executed.
On May 24, 2016, Mines Management and Hecla each issued a press release announcing that the parties had
entered into the merger agreement.
On June 29, 2016, Mines Management and Hecla entered into Amendment No. 1 to the merger agreement
(“Amendment No. 1”). Amendment No. 1 clarified the definition of shareholder approval set forth in the merger
agreement, the courts from which injunctive relief may be sought and that the merger is intended to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization as described in Section 368 of the Code.
On July 29, 2016, Mines Management and Hecla entered into Amendment No. 2 to the merger agreement
(“Amendment No. 2”). Amendment No. 2 extended the termination date from August 15, 2016 to September 30,
2016. The Interim Credit Agreement was also amended to extend the maturity date from August 15, 2016 to
September 30, 2016.

Recommendation of Mines Management’s Board of Directors; Mines Management’s Reasons for the Merger
At a special meeting held on May 21, 2016, the Mines Management board of directors unanimously (i) determined
that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests of Mines Management and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted the merger agreement and (iii) recommended the approval and adoption
of the merger agreement by Mines Management’s stockholders. The Mines Management board of directors
unanimously recommends that Mines Management stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
In evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, the Mines Management board of directors consulted with
Mines Management’s management and legal and financial advisors. In deciding to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and the merger transactions, including the merger, and to recommend that Mines Management’s
stockholders vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the Mines Management board of directors
considered various factors that it viewed as supporting its decision, including the material factors described below.
•
Strategic Benefits. The Mines Management board of directors believes that the merger will provide a number of
significant strategic opportunities and benefits, including the following:
•
•
•
the merger will enable Mines Management stockholders to benefit from the development of the Montanore
Project, should it occur, which Mines Management otherwise may not be able to achieve as a stand-alone
company;
the merger will resolve Mines Management’s immediate cash crisis and obviate its need to seek additional
financing through the issuance of Mines Management common stock or other securities at dilutive prices, or
through the sale of or joint venture with respect to a portion of its assets; and
the merger will eliminate the possibility that Mines Management might have to consider seeking protection
from its creditors in a bankruptcy or receivership proceeding were it not able to obtain additional financing
on acceptable terms or through the sale of a portion of its assets.
•
•
Fixed Exchange Ratio. The Mines Management board of directors also considered that the fixed exchange ratio,
which will not fluctuate as a result of changes in the market prices of shares of Mines Management or Hecla
common stock, provides reasonable certainty as to the respective pro forma percentage ownership of the
combined company by Mines Management and Hecla stockholders and provides the potential for Mines
Management stockholders to receive greater value if the Hecla common stock price were to increase prior to
closing the merger.
Ownership in the Combined Company. The Mines Management board of directors considered that, as of the
closing, it is projected that Mines Management stockholders would own approximately 2% of Hecla on a fully
diluted basis and, as a result, the combination will allow Mines Management stockholders to participate in any
future growth and value creation of the combined company and to share pro rata in any benefits of the expected
synergies.
•
Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Mines Management board of directors considered the financial analyses
presented to it by CG and CG’s oral opinion to the Mines Management board of directors, subsequently confirmed
in writing, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to Mines Management
common stockholders of the merger consideration, which opinion was based on and subject to the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken as
set forth in CG’s written opinion and more fully described below in the section “Proposal 1: The Approval and
Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Opinion of Mines Management’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 51.
•
Familiarity with Businesses. The Mines Management board of directors considered Hecla’s substantial
knowledge of the mining business and its operations, financial condition and personnel, particularly its
Table of Contents
48
knowledge of underground mining and its ability to prosecute successfully the permitting and development of
large scale mining operations in environmentally sensitive locations such as the Montanore Project.
•
Parties’ Commitment to Complete the Merger. The Mines Management board of directors considered the
commitment on the part of both parties to complete the merger as reflected in their respective obligations under
the terms of the merger agreement and the likelihood that any regulatory clearance and other approvals needed to
complete the merger would be obtained in a timely manner.
•
Terms and Conditions of the Merger Agreement. The Mines Management board of directors considered the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement, including:
•
•
Mines Management’s ability, under certain circumstances, prior to the time Mines Management
stockholders approve and adopt the merger, to consider and respond to an unsolicited proposal for the
acquisition of the stock or assets of Mines Management or engage in discussions or negotiations with the
third party making such a proposal, in each case if the Mines Management board of directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that such takeover
proposal either constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal (see “Proposal 1: The
Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative
Proposals” beginning on page 74);
the ability of the Mines Management board of directors, in response to a takeover proposal, to withhold,
withdraw or modify its recommendation that Mines Management stockholders vote in favor of approval and
adoption of the merger agreement if the Mines Management board of directors has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be a breach of the
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law and the Mines Management board of directors has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
proposal constitutes a superior proposal (see “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—The Merger Agreement—Changes in Board Recommendations” beginning on page 76); and
•
the fact that the merger agreement, including the provisions relating to the Interim Credit Agreement, would
provide Mines Management with sufficient operating flexibility for it to conduct its business in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice between the signing of the merger agreement and the
completion of the merger.
The Mines Management board of directors also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors
concerning the merger agreement, the merger transactions and the merger, including the following material
factors:
•
•
that, under the terms of the merger agreement, Mines Management must pay Hecla a termination fee of $1.0
million and reimburse certain expenses incurred by Hecla in connection with the merger in an amount not to
exceed $0.2 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, which may deter other
parties from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Mines Management
stockholders, or which may become payable following a termination of the merger agreement in circumstances
where no alternative transaction or superior proposal is available to Mines Management;
the terms of the merger agreement placing limitations on the ability of Mines Management to initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal or offer by or with a third party with
respect to a takeover proposal and to furnish non-public information to, or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, a third party interested in making a takeover proposal;
•
the risk that the merger may not be completed, or that completion may be unduly delayed, including the effect of
the pendency of the merger and the effect such failure to be completed may have on:
•
the market price of Mines Management common stock;
49
Table of Contents
•
Mines Management’s diminished cash position and potential ability to obtain external financing to continue
its business in the current market environment; and
•
title to the Montanore Project in the event of default under the Interim Credit Agreement;
that Mines Management is not permitted to terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the
market price of Hecla common stock and the risk that Mines Management stockholders may be adversely affected
by any decrease in the market price of Hecla common stock between the announcement of the transaction and
the completion of the merger, which would not have been the case had the consideration been based solely on a
fixed value (that is, a fixed dollar amount of value per share in all cases);
the risk that the development of the Montanore Project by Hecla and other benefits to the holders of Mines
Management common stock expected to result from the merger might not be fully realized or not realized at all;
the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the transaction, including the transaction expenses arising
from the merger and the costs of integrating Mines Management’s business and Hecla’s business;
•
•
•
•
•
•
the restrictions on the conduct of Mines Management’s business prior to the completion of the merger, which
could delay or prevent Mines Management from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other
action it may otherwise take with respect to the operations of Mines Management absent the pending completion
of the merger;
that, following completion of the merger, Mines Management would no longer exist as an independent public
company and Mines Management’s stockholders would be able to participate in any future earnings growth of
Mines Management solely through their ownership of common stock of the combined company;
that certain of Mines Management’s directors and officers have certain interests in the merger that might be
different from the interests of Mines Management’s stockholders generally as described under the section entitled
“Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Mines Management’s Directors
and Named Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 60; and
•
the risks of the type and nature described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 24 and the matters described
under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 8.
This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Mines Management board of directors in
reaching its conclusion and recommendations is not intended to be exhaustive and is not provided in any specific
order or ranking. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Mines Management board of directors in
evaluating the merger agreement and the merger transactions, including the merger, and the complexity of these
matters, the Mines Management board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify,
rank or otherwise assign relative weight to those factors. In addition, different members of the Mines Management
board of directors may have given different weight to different factors.
The Mines Management board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors
considered and instead conducted an overall review of such factors and determined that, in the aggregate, the
potential benefits considered outweighed the potential risks or possible negative consequences of approving and
adopting the merger agreement.

The Mines Management board of directors unanimously recommends that Mines Management stockholders vote
“FOR” the merger proposal.
The explanation of the reasoning of the Mines Management board of directors and all other information presented
in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in the
section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 8.
Opinion of Mines Management’s Financial Advisor
On May 21, 2016, CG rendered its oral opinion to the special committee of the Mines Management board of
directors that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth
therein, the consideration to be paid to the Mines Management common stockholders (other than Hecla and its
affiliates) pursuant to the transactions (including the merger) contemplated by the merger agreement (together,
and only for purposes of this section “Opinion of Mines Management’s Financial Advisor,” the “transaction”) was
fair from a financial point of view to the Mines Management common stockholders. The oral opinion was
subsequently confirmed in writing.
The full text of the written opinion of CG, dated May 21, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is included
as Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus. CG provided its opinion for the information and assistance of
Mines Management’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the transaction. The CG opinion is
not a recommendation as to how any Mines Management common stockholder should vote with respect to the
merger or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, CG,
among other things:
•
reviewed certain publicly available business and historical financial information relating to Mines Management
and Hecla;
•
reviewed the Mines Management confidential data site;
•
•
reviewed Mines Management’s draft interim financial statements and confidential forecasts. The forecasts that CG
considered were short-term cash flow forecasts that showed Mines Management exhausting its cash by August
2016;
reviewed the technical report prepared by Mine and Quarry Engineering Services, Inc. titled, “Technical Report
Preliminary Economic Assessment Montanore Project Montana, USA” with an effective date of February 3, 2011;
•
reviewed the Mines Management disclosure schedule;
•
conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Mines Management concerning the business
and financial prospects of Mines Management;
•
conducted discussions with Mines Management’s legal counsel;
•
•
conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Hecla concerning the business and financial
prospects of Hecla;
reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect to certain other companies CG believed
to be generally relevant;
•
compared publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions CG believed to be generally relevant;
•
reviewed current and historical market prices of the shares of Mines Management common stock and Hecla
common stock;
51
Table of Contents
•
reviewed the form of the merger agreement and other related agreements; and
•
conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other information, as
CG deemed necessary or appropriate.
For purposes of rendering the opinion described above, CG, with Mines Management’s consent, relied upon and
assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other
information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by CG, without assuming any responsibility for independent
verification thereof. In that regard, CG assumed with Mines Management’s consent that all technical information
provided to CG had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgements of the management of Mines Management regarding the future financial performance of Mines
Management and the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Hecla regarding the
future financial performance of Hecla. CG did not make an independent evaluation, appraisal or geological or
technical assessment of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of Mines Management, Hecla or any of their respective affiliates. CG also assumed that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the transaction will
be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transaction in any way meaningful to CG’s
analysis. CG further assumed that the transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger
agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition, the effect of which would be in any way
meaningful to CG’s analysis.
CG’s opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Mines Management to engage in the
transaction or the relative merits of the transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available
to Mines Management, nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. CG’s opinion
addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to Mines Management common stockholders, as of the
date of the opinion, of the consideration to be received by such holders pursuant to the transaction. CG does not
express any view on, and CG’s opinion does not address any other term or aspect of, the merger agreement or the
transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the transaction, including the fairness of the transaction to, or any
consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Mines Management, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be
paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Mines Management, or class of such persons, in
connection with the transaction, whether relative to consideration to be received by Mines Management common
stockholders pursuant to the transaction or otherwise. CG does not express any opinion as to the impact of the
transaction on the solvency or viability of Mines Management or Hecla or the ability of Mines Management or Hecla
to pay their respective obligations when they come due. CG’s opinion was necessarily based on economic,
monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to CG as of, the date of
the opinion, and CG assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on
circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of CG’s opinion. CG’s opinion represents the
opinion of CG as a firm. The form and content of the opinion was approved for release by a committee of directors
and other professionals of CG, all of whom are experienced in merger, acquisition, divestiture, fairness opinion and
valuation matters.
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by CG to Mines Management’s board of
directors in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by CG, nor does the order of analyses
described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by CG. Some of the summaries of
the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the
full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of CG’s financial analyses. Except as otherwise
noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data
as it existed on or before May 20, 2016 and is not necessarily indicative of current or future market conditions.

In connection with its analysis, CG calculated the implied consideration pursuant to the merger agreement, which
provides for the cancellation and conversion of each share of Mines Management common stock into the right to
receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock (the “consideration”). The defined term consideration applies
solely to this section, “Opinion of Mines Management’s Financial Advisor.”
Approach to Fairness
In support of the opinion, CG performed certain analyses on Mines Management and the consideration, based on
the methodologies and assumptions that CG considered appropriate in the circumstances for the purposes of
providing its opinion. In the context of the opinion, CG considered the following principal approaches:
•
•
•
comparison of the premium implied by the consideration to precedent premiums paid in mining transactions
(“Precedent Transactions Premium Analysis”);
comparison of the silver equivalent valuation multiple implied by the consideration to the silver equivalent
valuation multiples implied by selected precedent transactions involving target companies at a comparable
development stage as Mines Management (“Precedent Transactions Multiple Analysis”);
comparison of the silver equivalent valuation multiple implied by the consideration to the silver equivalent
valuation multiples implied by selected comparable development stage companies after adding a control
premium to estimate “en bloc” values (“Comparable Companies Analysis”); and
•
a review of the characteristics of the consideration (“Value of the Consideration”).
CG also considered but gave less weight to other approaches including relative contribution analysis to pro-forma
Hecla. CG considered, and decided not to perform, a discounted cash flow analysis, because Mines Management’s
financial distress makes such an analysis a poor tool for assessing Mines Management’s value.
Precedent Transactions Premium Analysis
CG reviewed historic spot, 20 day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) and 30 day VWAP premiums paid in
previous mining sector transactions since 2013 (the “Mining Premiums Database”) to compare against the
transaction. CG recognized that none of the precedent transactions is directly comparable to the transaction, and
that each of the selected mining sector transactions is: (i) unique in terms of size, geographic location, commodity
mix, stage of development and transaction structure and (ii) reflective of the strategic rationale of both the
respective acquiror and target. Nevertheless, the precedent mining sector transactions were selected by CG
because they are transactions that were announced since the start of 2013 and are reflective of recent “en bloc”
premiums paid in the mining sector.

Precedent Transactions Multiple Analysis
CG reviewed available public information for selected precedent precious metal transactions involving target
companies at a comparable development stage as Mines Management. CG recognized that none of the
transactions is directly comparable to the transaction, and that each of the selected precious metal developer
transactions is: (i) unique in terms of size, resource quality, geographic location, commodity mix, stage of
development and transaction structure and (ii) reflective of the strategic rationale of both the respective acquiror
and target. Nevertheless, the precedent precious metal transactions were selected because they are transactions
that were announced since the start of 2015 for projects at a similar stage of development as the Montanore Project
in terms of resource development and released economic studies as well as financing status, and were primarily
projects in the Americas. The primary criteria used in analyzing these transactions are enterprise value per
attributable ounce of silver equivalent resource (“EV/Resource”) with the acquisition of Revett by Hecla (the
“Revett Transaction”) thought to be the most directly comparable to the transaction due to the geological,
resource size and grade similarities between the Montanore Project and Revett’s principal Rock Creek project
located in close proximity to each other in Sanders County, Montana. The other transactions have been provided
as a secondary benchmark.

Mines Management common stock.
Comparable Companies Analysis
CG reviewed available public information for selected publicly traded precious metal companies that are at a
comparable development stage as Mines Management. CG recognized that none of the comparable companies is
directly comparable to Mines Management, and that each of the selected precious metal companies is unique in
terms of size, grade, geographic location, commodity mix and stage of development. Nevertheless, the publicly
traded comparable precious metal companies were selected because they were companies at a similar stage of
development as Mines Management in terms of resource development and released economic studies as well as
financing status, were primarily projects in the Americas and were similarly of a low grade comparable to the
Montanore Project, and, as a result, companies with higher grade resources were considered and rejected. The
primary criteria used in analyzing these transactions is EV/Resource after adjusting the average comparable
company multiple for an assumed “en bloc” control premium so that it is comparable to the transaction. The
control premium used to estimate “en bloc” value of the comparable companies is 44.8% and based on the
average spot premium paid in the Mining Premiums Database.

adjusting for an “en bloc” control premium of 44.8%. This EV/Resource multiple range generates illustrative values
in the range of $0.87 to $1.46 per share of Mines Management common stock.
Value of the Consideration
Pursuant to the transaction, Mines Management stockholders will receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock
for each share of Mines Management common stock. The shares of Hecla common stock received by Mines
Management stockholders will represent a minority position in Hecla and will not allow such holders to affect
control of Hecla. As such, and based on the analyses undertaken by and information made available to it, CG
concluded that it was not appropriate to consider methodologies that utilize an “en bloc” valuation approach, and
that an “en bloc” valuation is not required, in assessing the value of Hecla common shares.
Table of Contents
56
In considering the value of the consideration being offered, CG relied upon the market trading approach. The
market trading approach was deemed by CG to be an appropriate basis for valuing the consideration after
considering the following factors:
•
•
•
•
Liquidity: the last 3-month trading volume of Hecla common stock averaged approximately 9.2 million shares per
day, representing an average traded value of approximately $30.9 million per day;
Market Float: the aggregate value of Hecla’s publicly traded common stock (excluding insiders and holders of
greater than 10% of shares outstanding) is approximately $1.4 billion;
Market Familiarity: Hecla is well-known to market professionals, with 10 analysts providing research coverage;
and
Size of the Transaction: upon completion of the transaction, Mines Management stockholders would own
approximately 2% of the shares of Hecla common stock outstanding.
Market Trading Approach
CG considered the trading history of shares of Hecla common stock. For the purposes of its opinion, CG
concluded that it was most appropriate to consider a range of trading levels for shares of Hecla common stock as
observed from recent trading activity based on VWAP for 1, 10, 20 and 30 trading days.

Hecla Consideration Summary
Based upon and subject to the analyses and assumptions set out in this section, CG calculated that, as at May 21,
2016, an illustrative value of the consideration to be received by Mines Management common stockholders
pursuant to the transaction was $0.94 per share of Mines Management common stock.
Other Approaches
CG also considered, but gave less weight to, other approaches including relative contribution analysis to the pro-
forma Hecla. The results of this analysis are reflected in CG’s opinion.
General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
a summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying CG’s opinion. In arriving at
its fairness determination, CG considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular
weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, CG made its determination as to fairness on the basis of
its experience and professional judgement after considering the results of all of its analyses. No transaction or
company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Mines Management, Hecla or the
transaction.
Table of Contents

CG prepared these analyses for purposes of CG providing its opinion to the Mines Management board of directors
as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be received by Mines Management common
stockholders pursuant to the transaction. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future
results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Mines
Management, Hecla, CG or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those forecast.
The consideration to be paid pursuant to the transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations
between Mines Management and Hecla and was approved and adopted by the Mines Management board of
directors. CG provided advice to Mines Management during these negotiations including advising and assisting
Mines Management in evaluating and responding to transaction proposals and assisting Mines Management in its
determination of appropriate values to be paid in proposed transactions. CG was not, however, retained to
recommend any specific amount of consideration to Mines Management or the Mines Management board of
directors or to state whether any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration
for the transaction.
As described below, CG’s opinion to the Mines Management board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Mines Management board of directors in making its determination to approve and adopt the
merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses
performed by CG in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written
opinion of CG attached hereto as Appendix B.
CG and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading,
research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons
and entities. CG and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or
have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or
short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
and other financial instruments of Mines Management, Hecla, any of their respective affiliates and third parties,
including significant stockholders of Mines Management and Hecla. Except as otherwise disclosed in this proxy
statement/prospectus, CG and its affiliates have not provided services to Mines Management, Hecla or their
respective affiliates in the past two years.
Mines Management selected CG as its financial advisor because CG is the global capital markets division of
Canaccord Genuity Group Inc.—a leading independent full financial services firm—and is a recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transaction. Pursuant to a letter
agreement dated March 17, 2016, as amended on April 18, 2016 and May 19, 2016, Mines Management engaged CG
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the transaction and certain other transactions. Pursuant to the
terms of this engagement letter, Mines Management has agreed to pay CG a success fee currently estimated to be
$712,000 if a change of control that relates to Mines Management is completed or a change of control that relates to
Mines Management that is not supported by the Mines Management board of directors is fended off. In addition,
Mines Management has agreed to pay CG a fairness opinion fee in the amount of $200,000 for providing the
fairness opinion. This fairness opinion fee is not contingent on a successful consummation of the transaction.
Mines Management, at its discretion, may pay the fees referenced above in the form of freely tradeable common
stock of Hecla. In addition, Mines Management has agreed to reimburse certain of CG’s expenses and indemnify
CG against certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement.

Hecla’s Reasons for the Merger
58
After careful consideration, Hecla’s board of directors approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger. In reaching their decision, Hecla’s board consulted with Hecla
management and legal advisors and considered a number of factors that they believed supported their decision,
including the following factors:
•
The significant strategic opportunity that Hecla’s board believes will result from the merger and, in particular, the
acquisition of the Montanore Project, including the following with respect to the Montanore Project:
•
•
•
•
•
it is considered one of the largest undeveloped silver and copper deposits in North America;
it is located approximately 50 miles north of Hecla’s Lucky Friday mine in Idaho and 10 miles from Hecla’s
Rock Creek project, which is expected to allow Hecla to benefit from proximity to management, labor and
other resources of Hecla;
it provides to Hecla another asset which it can seek to develop for future production, including at a time
when the Greens Creek mine begins approaching the end of its known mine life;
it provides another asset to Hecla that is located in a favorable mining jurisdiction; and
Hecla’s past ability to operate in an environmentally sensitive area (Green’s Creek mine in Alaska, which is
located in the Admiralty Island National Monument, a sensitive environment in which the mine has
successfully operated the last 26 years, including the last 8 years under Hecla’s 100% ownership).
•
The board’s knowledge of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of Hecla and
Mines Management, taking into account the results of Hecla’s due diligence review of Mines Management, as
well as their knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which Hecla and Mines Management
operate, including economic and market conditions.
•
The merger is structured as an all-stock transaction, which preserves Hecla’s financial liquidity in a low metals
price environment.
•
The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the strong commitments by both Hecla and Mines
Management to complete the merger and the related transactions.
Hecla’s board also deliberated on a variety of risks and other considerations concerning the merger agreement
and the merger, including the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
the possibility that the merger may not be completed, or that completion may be unduly delayed, including
because Mines Management stockholders may not approve and adopt the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or because of reasons beyond the control of Hecla or
Mines Management;
the risk that the pendency of the merger or the failure to complete the merger could have an adverse impact on
Hecla, including on the market price of Hecla’s common stock and future business and financial results of Hecla;
the diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while
working to implement the merger;
the ability to capture the anticipated synergies between Hecla and Mines Management and to realize the other
anticipated benefits of the merger in the expected timeframe, if at all;
the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the transaction, including the costs of integrating the
businesses of Hecla and Mines Management and the transaction expenses arising from the merger;
Mines Management’s right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate certain alternative
acquisition proposals made prior to the time Mines Management stockholders approve and adopt the
Table of Contents
59
merger agreement, as well as Mines Management’s right, subject to certain conditions, to withhold or withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to Hecla or Merger Sub) or propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to Hecla or Merger Sub) its recommendation to its stockholders to vote “FOR” the merger
proposal;
•
•
the risk that Mines Management experiences an unfavorable development or outcome in any one of its pending
litigation matters;
the risk that Hecla (i) is unable to obtain the necessary permits to develop or operate the Montanore Project or (ii)
does not achieve financial returns sufficient to cover the costs that are projected to be incurred for the Montanore
Project;
•
the possibility that Hecla might not achieve its projected financial results;
•
the possibility that the market price of the common stock of Hecla may decline in the future as a result of the
•
•
•
merger;
the risk of any potential action or inaction by Hecla causing the merger to lose its tax-free qualification for U.S.
federal income tax purposes;
the risk that changes in the regulatory landscape or other conditions beyond Hecla’s control may adversely affect
the business benefits anticipated to result from the merger and the related transactions, including with respect to
obtaining the necessary permits to develop and operate the Montanore Project; and
the risks of the type and nature described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 24 and the matters described
under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 8.
The above discussion of the factors considered by Hecla’s board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In
reaching their determination, Hecla’s board did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors
considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Hecla’s board
considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and inquiry of, Hecla’s management and legal
advisors, and overall considered these factors to be favorable to, and to support, their determination.
The explanation of the reasoning of the Hecla board and certain information presented in this section are forward-
looking in nature and, therefore, the information should be read in light of the factors discussed in the section
entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 8 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.
Interests of Mines Management’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Mines Management board of directors that Mines Management
stockholders vote to approve and adopt the merger proposal, Mines Management stockholders should be aware
that some of Mines Management’s directors and named executive officers have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Mines Management stockholders generally. The Mines Management
board of directors and special committee were each aware of and considered these potential interests, among
other things, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the related transactions, in approving and
adopting the merger agreement and in recommending the approval and adoption of the merger proposal. For
purposes of the employment agreements described below, to the extent applicable, the completion of the merger
will constitute a “Change in Control” (as defined in the applicable employment agreement). These interests are
described in further detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative and table below.

Table of Contents
Executive Change in Control Payments
Each of Messrs. Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs entered into amended and restated employment agreements
with Mines Management (the “Amended and Restated Agreements”), effective January 1, 2012, that (i) set the
minimum base salaries for Glenn Dobbs at $370,000 and for Douglas Dobbs at $210,000 (subsequently increased
upon promotion to President), (ii) provide that, should the executive officer’s employment be terminated by Mines
Management without “Cause” or by the officer for “Good Reason” (in each case as defined in the Amended and
Restated Agreements) in connection with a Change in Control, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment
equal to three times the sum of his then current annual base salary and the amount of annual bonus, if any, paid by
Mines Management to him for the year before the occurrence of the Change in Control and (iii) provide for an
alternate severance that each officer may receive if his employment is terminated by Mines Management without
“Cause” or by the officer for “Good Reason” but not in connection with a Change in Control, which severance
consists of a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his then current annual base salary and the amount of annual
bonus, if any, paid by Mines Management to him for the year before termination.
Ms. Altenburg entered into an employment agreement with Mines Management, effective May 7, 2007, that provides
that, should Ms. Altenburg’s employment be deemed terminated by Mines Management in connection with a
“Change in Control, she will be entitled to receive severance payments equal to twenty four (24) months’ salary.
Upon termination of Messrs. Glenn Dobbs’ or Douglas Dobbs’ or Ms. Altenburg’s employment or service by Mines
Management other than for Cause or by the officer for Good Reason in connection with a Change in Control,
shares, options or other forms of securities issued by Mines Management and beneficially owned by such officer
that are unvested, restricted or subject to similar restriction will vest automatically on the termination date and shall
be exercisable for 90 days following such termination (or one year if termination of employment is a result of the
officer’s disability or death). In addition, each executive will be entitled to continued coverage for health benefits for
a period of up to 24 months.
Each of the employment agreements contain confidentiality and proprietary information covenants which protect
Mines Management’s confidential information and rights to discoveries made by the executives.
On May 23, 2016, Mines Management entered into amendments to the employment agreements with each of
Messrs. Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs and Ms. Altenburg. The amendments provide that upon a Change in
Control transaction any severance due to the employee can be paid, at the option of Mines Management, in Mines
Management common stock or the stock of an entity that acquires control of Mines Management as a result of the
change in control transaction.
On June 29, 2016, Mines Management entered into amendments to the employment agreements with each of
Messrs. Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs. The amendments eliminate the gross-up benefits related to Section
280G of the Code that had existed in each such individual’s employment agreement.
For additional information regarding compensation that will be received by Mines Management’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger, see “Golden Parachute Compensation” on page 61.
Golden Parachute Compensation
The merger is considered a “Change in Control” under each Mines Management named executive officer’s
employment agreement.
The following table sets forth the amounts of “golden parachute” compensation (for purposes of Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K) that each named executive officer of Mines Management could receive in connection with the
merger. These amounts assume that the named executive officer’s employment will be terminated without “Cause”
immediately following the closing of the merger such that the named executive officer will become

61
entitled to the severance benefits provided for in his or her employment agreement in respect of a termination
without “Cause” in connection with a Change in Control (as described in more detail above).
Such amounts have been calculated assuming that the closing had taken place on July 27, 2016, which is therefore
used as the date of the “Change in Control.”

Mines Management; and Tami D. Whitman, Assistant Corporate Secretary of Hecla, will serve as Secretary of Mines
Management. At the effective time, the current directors and executive officers of Mines Management will resign.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Mines
Management and holders of Mines Management common stock. The discussion is based on the Code, Treasury
Regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to
change (possibly with retroactive effect) and to differing interpretations. This discussion applies only to
stockholders that hold their Mines Management common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code. Further, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to a particular stockholder in light of his, her or its personal circumstances or to stockholders
subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as financial institutions, tax-exempt
organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities or foreign currency, traders in securities who elect to
apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, pass-through entities and investors in such entities, stockholders
who received their Mines Management common stock through the exercise of employee stock options, through a
tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation, and stockholders who hold Mines Management
common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other integrated
investment.
Table of Contents
62
This discussion is limited to Mines Management stockholders that are “U.S. holders.” For purposes of this proxy
statement/prospectus, a “U.S. holder” means a stockholder of Mines Management that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is:
•
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof;
•
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has made a valid election to be treated as a
U.S. person.
In addition, the discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax
consequences of the merger, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
This discussion does not address the tax treatment of partnerships (or entities or arrangements that are treated as
partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or persons that hold their Mines Management common stock
through partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a partnership,
including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of
Mines Management common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partners and
partnerships should consult their own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences of the merger to
them.
Mines Management stockholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences
of the merger to them.
Consequences to Mines Management and Mines Management Stockholders
Mines Management and Hecla intend for the merger to be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Mines Management has received an opinion from
Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions
set forth or referred to in such opinion, the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. This opinion is based on representations, warranties and covenants contained in
representation letters provided by Mines Management and on customary factual assumptions. The opinion is not
binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court. Mines Management and Hecla have not sought and will not
seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any matters relating to the merger, and, as a result,
there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a
position contrary to any of the conclusions set forth below. In addition, if any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or assumptions upon which the opinion is based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected. Assuming that, in accordance with the
opinion described above, the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger will be as follows:
Mines Management will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the
merger. Mines Management stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss pursuant to the merger except in
respect of cash received instead of a fractional share of Hecla common stock (as discussed below). The aggregate
tax basis of the Hecla common stock received in the merger (including fractional shares deemed received and
redeemed as discussed below) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of Mines
Management common stock surrendered for the Hecla common stock, and the holding period of the Hecla
common stock (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed) will include the period during which
Table of Contents
63
the shares of Mines Management common stock were held. If a Mines Management stockholder acquired different
blocks of Mines Management common stock at different times or at different prices, the Hecla common stock
received by that stockholder will be allocated pro rata to each block of Mines Management common stock, and the
basis and holding period of each block of Hecla common stock received by that stockholder will be determined on
a block-for-block basis depending on the basis and holding period of the blocks of Mines Management common
stock exchanged for such Hecla common stock.
A Mines Management stockholder that receives cash instead of a fractional share of Hecla common stock will
generally be treated as having received such fractional share and then as having received such cash in
redemption of the fractional share. Gain or loss will generally be recognized based on the difference between the
amount of cash received instead of the fractional share and the portion of the holder’s aggregate adjusted tax
basis in the shares of Mines Management common stock surrendered which is allocable to the fractional share.
Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such shares of Mines
Management common stock is more than one year at the effective time. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
taxpayers are subject to reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments of cash to a U.S. holder of Mines Management common stock in lieu of fractional shares of Hecla
common stock in the merger may be subject to information reporting, unless the U.S. holder provides proof of an
applicable exemption. Payments that are subject to information reporting may also be subject to backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 28%), unless such U.S. holder provides an accurate taxpayer identification
number and otherwise complies with the requirements of the backup withholding rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld will be credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided the required information is timely
supplied to the Internal Revenue Service.
Accounting Treatment of the Merger
In accordance with GAAP, Hecla will account for the merger using the acquisition method of accounting for
business combinations.
Regulatory Matters
Neither Mines Management nor Hecla is required to obtain any approvals from any federal or state regulatory
authorities to consummate the merger. Hecla must comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and
NYSE rules and regulations in connection with the issuance of shares of Hecla common stock in connection with
the merger, including the filing with the SEC of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus
is a part. In addition, the parties will be required to file a statement of merger with the Secretary of State of Idaho in
order to effectuate the merger.
Exchange of Shares in the Merger
Prior to the effective time, Hecla will appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Mines Management to
handle the exchange of Mines Management common stock for Hecla common stock.
Promptly following the effective time, the exchange agent shall mail to each holder of record of outstanding shares
of Mines Management common stock a letter of transmittal specifying instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of certificates representing outstanding shares of Mines Management common stock (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares of Mines Management common stock in exchange for the merger
consideration.
Table of Contents
64
Mines Management stockholders will receive, with respect to any fractional shares to which stockholders would be
entitled based on the application of the exchange ratio, cash in lieu of fractional shares. Each Mines Management
stockholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Mines
Management common stock exchanged by such holder) by (ii) the closing price of Hecla common stock on the
NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date.
After the effective time, shares of Mines Management common stock will no longer be outstanding, will
automatically be cancelled, and will cease to exist, and certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form that, in
each case, previously represented shares of Mines Management common stock will represent only the right to
receive a number of shares of Hecla common stock (plus cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) as described
above. Until holders of Mines Management common stock have surrendered their shares to the exchange agent
for exchange, those holders will not receive dividends or distributions declared or made with respect to shares of
Hecla common stock with a record date after the effective time. However, upon the surrender of their shares of
Mines Management common stock, such holders will receive the amount of dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Hecla common stock having a record date after the effective time and payable with respect to
such Hecla common stock between the effective time and the time of such surrender.
Merger Consideration; Treatment of Mines Management Stock Options; Treatment of Mines Management Warrants
Mines Management common stockholders will receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock for each share of
Mines Management common stock they hold, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed
and will not be adjusted for changes in the market value of the common stock of Mines Management or Hecla.
Because of this, the implied value of the consideration to Mines Management stockholders may fluctuate between
now and the completion of the merger.
At the effective time, each option to purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time that has an exercise price per share greater than or equal to the product of
the closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date
and 0.2218 will be cancelled without any payment being made in respect thereof. At the effective time, each other
option to purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (all of which are vested) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive shares of
Hecla common stock (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, with cash being
paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Hecla common stock) with a value equal to (i)(a) the product of the
closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date and
0.2218 minus (b) the exercise price per share under such option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to
such option. At the option of Hecla, in lieu of paying all or a portion of the amounts due to a holder of options,
Hecla may substitute for such shares an equivalent amount in cash.
At the effective time, and in accordance with the terms of any warrant to purchase shares of Mines Management
common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, such warrant will either be cancelled in
accordance with its terms or a replacement warrant will be issued giving the holder the right to purchase a number
of shares of Hecla common stock (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, and
no issuance of fractional shares and the number of such shares rounded down) equal to the product of (i) 0.2218
and (ii) the number of shares of Mines Management common stock subject to such warrant, with an exercise price
of $4.8765 per share of Hecla common stock, pursuant to and in accordance with such holder’s warrants (as
amended).
Change in Shares
If between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time the number of outstanding shares of Mines
Management common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Table of Contents
65
Mines Management common stock, changes into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
stock dividend (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, cash dividends), subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination, exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the exchange
ratio will be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, reverse split, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction.
Listing of Hecla Common Stock
It is a condition to the completion of the merger that the shares of Hecla common stock to be issued to Mines
Management stockholders pursuant to the merger be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.
Litigation Relating to the Merger
Since the announcement of the merger, Mines Management, members of the Mines Management board of
directors, Merger Sub and Hecla were named as defendants in three putative stockholder class actions, brought by
purported stockholders of Mines Management, challenging the proposed merger. Two of the lawsuits were filed in
the Superior Court in Spokane County, Washington, and are captioned O’Rourke v. Dobbs, et al., No. 16202116-1
(Spokane Cnty, Wash. June 6, 2016) and Schubert v. Dobbs, et al., No. 16202667-7 (Spokane Cnty, Wash. July 14,
2016) (together, the “state lawsuits”). The other lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Washington, and is captioned Assad v. Mines Management, Inc., et al., No. 16-cv-00256-SMJ (E.D. Wash.
July 12, 2016) (the “federal lawsuit”).
The plaintiffs in the state lawsuits generally claim that (i) the members of the Mines Management board of directors
breached their fiduciary duties to Mines Management stockholders by authorizing the merger with Hecla for what
the plaintiff asserts is inadequate consideration and pursuant to an inadequate process and with inadequate
disclosures and (ii) Hecla and Merger Sub aided and abetted the other defendants’ alleged breach of duties. The
plaintiffs seek, among other things, to enjoin the merger, rescind the transaction or obtain rescissory damages if
the merger is consummated, obtain other unspecified damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
The plaintiff in the federal lawsuit generally claims that (i) Mines Management and the members of the Mines
Management board of directors issued a proxy statement containing false and misleading statements and (ii) the
members of the Mines Management board of directors, Hecla and Merger Sub are liable as controlling persons of
Mines Management. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, to enjoin the merger, rescind the transaction or obtain
rescissory damages if the merger is consummated, require the members of the Mines Management board of
directors to disseminate a proxy statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that
states all material facts required or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, obtain
other unspecified damages and recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of litigation matters with certainty, each of Mines Management, its
directors, Hecla and Merger Sub believe that each of the lawsuits are without merit, and the parties intend to
vigorously defend against all claims asserted.
Interim Credit Agreement
As discussed in “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Mines Management” beginning on page 29, and
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Mines Management is experiencing severe financial challenges. In
an effort to address Mines Management’s short-term liquidity needs, Hecla and Mines Management have entered
into the Interim Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Hecla has agreed to provide one or more secured loans to
Mines Management in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,300,000. Currently, loans totaling approximately $1.4
million have been made to Mines Management. Loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 5%.
The loans mature on the earlier of September 30, 2016 and the date the merger is completed. In
Table of Contents
66
addition, the loans become due and payable in full upon a change of control or event of default or if the merger
agreement is terminated for any reason other than a breach of the merger agreement by Hecla. Mines Management
and certain of its subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for the obligations owing under the loans, and all of
the obligations of Mines Management under the Interim Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its
subsidiaries. The loans are secured, subject to certain permitted liens, by a security interest in substantially all of
Mines Management’s assets, including the Montanore Project. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Mines
Management—If the merger is not completed, Mines Management will require additional external financing to fund
its continuing business activities in the future, and the terms of any such financing, if obtained, may have negative
effects on Mines Management’s flexibility and future transactions.”
Shareholders Agreements
The following summarizes the material provisions of the shareholders agreements. This summary does not purport
to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the shareholders agreements that is important to
you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the shareholders agreements, a copy of the form of
which is included as Appendix D to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein.
Defined terms used but not otherwise defined in this section shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the
shareholders agreements.
In order to induce Hecla and Merger Sub to enter into the merger agreement, certain stockholders of Mines
Management entered into shareholders agreements, each dated May 23, 2016, pursuant to which each shareholder
agreed to vote his, her or its shares of Mines Management common stock beneficially owned by such shareholder
(as set forth in such shareholder’s shareholders agreement), and to cause any holder of record of shares of
common stock beneficially owned by such stockholder (as set forth in such shareholder’s shareholders
agreement) to vote: (i) in favor of the merger and the merger agreement, at every meeting of the stockholders of
Mines Management at which such matters are considered and at every adjournment or postponement thereof; (ii)
against (1) any takeover proposal (as defined in the merger agreement), (2) any action, proposal, transaction or
agreement which could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty
or any other obligation or agreement of Mines Management under the merger agreement (except in the case of
Silver Wheaton Corp.) or of the stockholder under the shareholders agreement and (3) any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely
affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the merger or the fulfillment of Mines Management’s, Hecla’s or Merger
Sub’s conditions under the merger agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any class of shares of
Mines Management (including any amendments to Mines Management’s articles of incorporation and bylaws).
Each of the stockholders agreed to grant an irrevocable proxy appointing Hecla as the stockholder’s proxy and
attorney-in fact (with full power of substitution and resubstitution) to vote such stockholder’s shares at any
meeting of the stockholders of Mines Management called with respect to any of the matters specified in the
shareholders agreements, and in accordance and consistent with the above. The following stockholders are party
to the shareholders agreements: Silver Wheaton Corp., Glenn Dobbs, Douglas Dobbs, Nicole Altenburg, Russell
Babcock, Roy Franklin and Robert Russell. Collectively, 6,562,199 shares of Mines Management common stock
(which include 1,322,621 shares of Mines Management common stock subject to currently exercisable options) are
subject to the shareholders agreements, representing approximately 17.6% of the outstanding shares of Mines
Management common stock as of the date hereof. On June 29, 2016, the shareholders agreements with each of
Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs were amended to correct the number of shares of Mines Management common
stock owned by Glenn Dobbs and increase the number of derivative securities subject to the shareholders
agreement entered into by Douglas Dobbs. No separate consideration was provided to any of the stockholders
who are parties to the shareholders agreements in order to induce them to enter into the shareholders agreements.
The Merger Agreement
The following summarizes certain material provisions of the merger agreement. This summary does not purport to
be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important
Table of Contents
67
to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms and conditions of the merger
agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. Mines
Management stockholders are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as well as this
proxy statement/prospectus and the information incorporated herein by reference, before making any decisions
regarding the merger. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of
which is included as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein.
Defined terms used but not otherwise defined in this section shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
the merger agreement.
In reviewing the merger agreement and this summary, please remember that they have been included to provide
you with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any other
factual information about Hecla, Mines Management or any of their subsidiaries. The merger agreement contains
representations and warranties and covenants by each of the parties to the merger agreement, which are
summarized below. These representations and warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other
parties to the merger agreement and:
•
•
were not intended as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those
statements prove to be inaccurate;
have been qualified by certain disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of
the merger agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the merger agreement or in this proxy
statement/prospectus; and
•
may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by you or other
investors.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties in the merger
agreement and described below may have changed since the date of the merger agreement, and subsequent
developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, if specific material facts arise that contradict the representations and warranties
in the merger agreement, Hecla or Mines Management, as applicable, will disclose those material facts in the public
filings that it makes with the SEC if it determines that it has a legal obligation to do so. Accordingly, the
representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but
instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in
the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 108.
The Merger
The merger agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions in the merger agreement, and in
accordance with Idaho law, Merger Sub will merge with and into Mines Management. At the effective time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Mines Management will continue as the surviving
company in the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla.
Merger Consideration
Mines Management common stockholders will receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common stock for each share of
Mines Management common stock they hold, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed
and will not be adjusted for changes in the market value of the common stock of Mines Management or Hecla.
Because of this, the implied value of the consideration to Mines Management stockholders may fluctuate between
now and the completion of the merger.

Treatment of Mines Management Stock Options
At the effective time, each option to purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time that has an exercise price per share greater than or equal to the product of
the closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date
and 0.2218 will be cancelled without any payment being made in respect thereof. At the effective time, each other
option to purchase shares of Mines Management common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (all of which are vested) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive shares of
Hecla common stock (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, with cash being
paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Hecla common stock) with a value equal to (i)(a) the product of the
closing price of Hecla common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date and
0.2218 minus (b) the exercise price per share under such option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to
such option. At the option of Hecla, in lieu of paying all or a portion of the amounts due to a holder of options,
Hecla may substitute for such shares an equivalent amount in cash.
Treatment of Mines Management Warrants
At the effective time, and in accordance with the terms of any warrant to purchase shares of Mines Management
common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, such warrant will either be cancelled in
accordance with its terms or a replacement warrant will be issued giving the holder the right to purchase a number
of shares of Hecla common stock (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding tax, and
no issuance of fractional shares and the number of such shares rounded down) equal to the product of (i) 0.2218
and (ii) the number of shares of Mines Management common stock subject to such warrant, with an exercise price
of $4.8765 per share of Hecla common stock, pursuant to and in accordance with such holder’s warrants (as
amended).
Treatment of Mines Management Series B
The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, and in accordance with the terms of the Mines
Management Series B, replacement preferred stock shall be issued to each holder of Mines Management Series B
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, which shall have a conversion price of
$3.5464 and contain such other terms as are required by the terms of the Mines Management Series B. There are
currently no shares of Mines Management Series B outstanding; all previously outstanding shares of Mines
Management Series B have been converted into common stock, and no further issuances of Mines Management
Series B are expected.
Representations and Warranties
The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by Mines Management to Hecla and Merger
Sub and by Hecla and Merger Sub to Mines Management. Certain of the representations and warranties in the
merger agreement are subject to materiality or material adverse effect qualifications (that is, they will not be
deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct is material or would result in a material
adverse impact). In addition, certain of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are subject to
knowledge qualifications, which means that those representations and warranties would not be deemed untrue or
incorrect as a result of matters of which certain officers or directors of the party making the representation did not
have actual or constructive knowledge. Additionally, certain of the representations and warranties of Mines
Management in the merger agreement are qualified by the Mines Management disclosure schedule.
The merger agreement provides that a “material adverse effect” means, with respect to Mines Management, any
event, occurrence, fact, condition or change that is, or would reasonably be expected to become, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to (i) the business, results of operations, prospects, condition (financial or
Table of Contents
69
otherwise) or assets of Mines Management and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Mines
Management to consummate the transactions contemplated under the merger agreement on a timely basis;
provided, however, that, for the purposes of clause (i), a “material adverse effect” will not be deemed to include
events, occurrences, facts, conditions or changes arising out of, relating to or resulting from: (a) changes generally
affecting the economy or financial or securities markets; (b) the announcement of the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement; (c) any outbreak or escalation of war or any act of terrorism; or (d) general conditions in
the industries in which Mines Management and its subsidiaries operate; provided further, however, that any event,
change and effect referred to in clauses (a), (c) or (d) immediately above will be taken into account in determining
whether a “material adverse effect” has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur to the extent that such
event, change or effect has a disproportionate effect (other than an effect that is disproportionate solely due to the
financial condition of Mines Management and its subsidiaries) on Mines Management and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, compared to other participants in the industries in which Mines Management and its subsidiaries conduct
their businesses.
In the merger agreement, Hecla and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Mines Management, on the other, have
made representations and warranties including representations and warranties regarding the following topics:
•
organization, qualification, standing, corporate power and organizational documents;
•
capital structure;

•
authority to execute and deliver and perform their respective obligations under, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, the merger agreement and the enforceability of the merger agreement against each

the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby having received all necessary corporate
approval (except, in the case of Mines Management, the approval and adoption of Mines Management’s
stockholders);
•
•
the absence of conflicts with, or violations of, organizational documents, applicable law and contracts as a result
of such party entering into the merger agreement and consummating the merger and the other transactions

including the required approval and adoption by Mines Management’s stockholders;

internal controls and accounting or auditing practices;
•
the conduct of business in the ordinary course and the absence of a material adverse effect since December 31,
2015;
•
absence of certain litigation;
•
ownership of subsidiaries;

Conduct of Business
Subject to certain exceptions in the merger agreement and the Mines Management disclosure schedule, as
applicable, or as required by law or with the prior written consent of Hecla, from the date of the merger agreement
until the effective time, Mines Management has agreed to carry on, and has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries
to carry on, its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and to, and cause each of its
subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to preserve substantially intact its and its subsidiaries’ business
organization, to keep available the services of its and its subsidiaries’ current officers and employees, and to
preserve its and its subsidiaries’ present relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, licensees
and other persons having business relationships with Mines Management or its subsidiaries.
In addition, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time, Mines Management has agreed to
various specific restrictions relating to the conduct of the business of Mines Management and its subsidiaries,
including with respect to the following (subject in each case to certain exceptions relating to the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by the Interim Credit Agreement, or as required by law):
•
amending or proposing to amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws (or other comparable organizational
documents);
•
•
•
issuing, delivering, selling, pledging or encumbering, or authorizing, proposing or agreeing to the issuance,
delivery, sale, pledge or encumbrance of, any securities of any kind of Mines Management (other than shares of
common stock of Mines Management pursuant to the terms of any outstanding Mines Management stock options);
declaring, setting aside, making or paying any dividend or other distribution (whether payable in cash, stock,
property or a combination thereof) with respect to, or entering into any contract with respect to the voting of, any of
its capital stock;

Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Votes
Subject to its right in certain circumstances to adjourn, recess or postpone the Mines Management stockholder
meeting, Mines Management has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part is declared effective for the purpose of
obtaining Mines Management stockholder approval and adoption of the merger proposal. Mines Management has
agreed to, through its board of directors, recommend in accordance with applicable law that the holders of Mines
Management common stock vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger
(the “Board Recommendation”). Subject to the ability of Mines Management’s board of directors in certain
circumstances to fail to make, withdraw, amend, modify or materially qualify, in a manner adverse to Hecla or
Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover Proposal, or fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of Mines Management common stock within 10
business days after the commencement of such offer, or make any public statement inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, an “Adverse
Recommendation Change”), Mines Management is required to use its best efforts to solicit stockholder approval
and adoption of the merger proposal. Mines Management’s board of directors has approved and adopted the
merger by a unanimous vote and has adopted resolutions directing that the merger proposal be submitted to the
Mines Management stockholders for their consideration.

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals
Mines Management has agreed, subject to the exceptions described below, from the time of the execution of the
merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time or the termination of the merger agreement, not to, has
agreed to cause its subsidiaries not to, and has agreed not to permit or authorize any director, officer, employee,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors and agents and other representatives of Mines Management or
any of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Representatives”), directly or indirectly, to:
•
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from,
or indication of interest in making a proposal or offer from, or an indication of interest in making a proposal or offer
by, any Person (other than Hecla and its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub) relating to any (a) direct or indirect
acquisition of assets of Mines Management or its subsidiaries (including any voting equity interests of
subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to 25% or more of the fair
market value of Mines Management’s consolidated assets, (b) direct or indirect acquisition of 25% or more of the
voting equity interests of Mines Management, (c) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person beneficially owning 25% or more of the voting equity interests of Mines Management, (d) merger,
consolidation, other business combination or similar transaction involving Mines Management or any of its
subsidiaries, pursuant to which such Person would own 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Mines
Management, taken as a whole, or (e) liquidation or dissolution (or the adoption of a plan of liquidation or
dissolution) of Mines Management or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend (whether in cash or
other property) by Mines Management (any such proposal, a “Takeover Proposal”) or the making of any proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal;
•
conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information relating to Mines
Management or any of its subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of
Mines Management or any of its subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any
effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, a Takeover Proposal;
•
amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of Mines Management or any of its subsidiaries;

approve any transaction under, or any third party becoming an “interested shareholder” under, the BCA; or
•
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Takeover Proposal
(each an “Acquisition Agreement”).
Additionally, except as set forth in the merger agreement and as described below, Mines Management is required
to, and is required to cause its subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not
authorize or knowingly permit any Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and will cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public
information in respect of Mines Management or any of its subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Mines
Management and its subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information.
Notwithstanding the above described restrictions, prior to the receipt of stockholder approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, Mines Management’s board of directors, directly or
indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to certain restrictions:
(i)
participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide,
unsolicited Takeover Proposal in writing that Mines Management’s board of directors believes in
Table of Contents
74
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a bona fide written Takeover Proposal involving the direct or indirect
acquisition pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, of
greater than 50% of Mines Management’s consolidated assets or greater than 50% of the outstanding common
stock of Mines Management, that Mines Management’s board of directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor) is more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Mines Management common stock than the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, taking into account (a) all financial considerations, (b) the identity of the third party making
such Takeover Proposal, (c) the anticipated timing, conditions (including any financing condition or the reliability
of any debt or equity funding commitments) and prospects for completion of such Takeover Proposal, (d) the other
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and the implications thereof for Mines Management, including
relevant legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal deemed relevant by Mines Management’s
board of directors and (e) any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement and the merger proposed by Hecla
during the notice period described below (any such offer, a “Superior Proposal”);
(ii)
furnish to the third party that has made such a Takeover Proposal non-public information relating to Mines
Management or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that contains
confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to Mines Management than those contained in that certain
confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of May 8, 2015, between Mines Management and Hecla, as amended;
(iii)
following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as
defined above); or
(iv)
take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders Mines Management to take (which order remains
unstayed),
but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if Mines Management’s board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to cause Mines Management’s board of directors to be in breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law.
Mines Management has also agreed that its board of directors will not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) through (iv) of the preceding paragraph unless Mines Management has delivered to Hecla a prior written notice
advising Hecla that it intends to take such action. Mines Management will notify Hecla promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by Mines Management (or any of Representatives) of
any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or any
request for non-public information relating to Mines Management or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of Mines Management or any of its subsidiaries by any third party.
In such notice, Mines Management will identify the third party making, and details of the material terms and
conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request. Mines Management is required to keep Hecla
fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or
request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms of any
such Takeover Proposal, indication, or request. Mines Management is required to provide Hecla with at least 48
hours prior notice of any meeting of Mines Management’s board of directors (or such lesser notice as is provided
to the members of Mines Management’s board of directors) at which Mines Management’s board of directors is
reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. Mines Management is required to promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) provide Hecla with a list of any non-public information concerning Mines Management’s
business, present or future performance, financial condition or results of operations provided to any third party,
and, to the extent such information has not been previously provided to Hecla, copies of such information.

Changes in Board Recommendations
Mines Management has agreed that the Board Recommendation is to be included in this proxy
statement/prospectus and that, with certain exceptions, neither Mines Management’s board of directors nor any
committee thereof will make an Adverse Recommendation Change.
Except as described below, Mines Management’s board of directors will not make any Adverse Recommendation
Change or enter into (or permit any subsidiary to enter into) an Acquisition Agreement. At any time prior to the
receipt of stockholder approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
Mines Management’s board of directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit
any subsidiary to enter into) an Acquisition Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, if: (i) Mines
Management promptly notifies Hecla, in writing, at least three business days (the “Notice Period”) before making
an Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a subsidiary to enter into) an Acquisition
Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice will state
expressly that Mines Management has received a Takeover Proposal that Mines Management’s board of directors
intends to declare a Superior Proposal and that Mines Management’s board of directors intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or Mines Management intends to enter into an Acquisition Agreement; (ii)
Mines Management attaches to such notice the most current version of the proposed Acquisition Agreement
(which version will be updated on a prompt basis) and identifies the third party making such Superior Proposal; (iii)
Mines Management will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Hecla in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, if Hecla, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after
commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including
any revision in price, the Notice Period will be automatically extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two
business days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time Mines Management notifies Hecla of any such
material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions)); and (iv) Mines Management’s board
of directors determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and an independent financial
advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any
adjustments made by Hecla during the Notice Period in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and that
the failure to take accept such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to cause Mines Management’s
board of directors to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Efforts to Complete the Merger
Hecla, Merger Sub and Mines Management have agreed to each use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, and to cause each of their subsidiaries to take or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary permits, waivers,
consents, approvals and actions or nonactions from governmental entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with governmental entities) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental entities,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents or waivers from third parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the merger and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger
agreement. Mines Management and Hecla are required, subject to applicable law, to (x) cooperate and coordinate
with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply
the other with any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking of such actions.
Each of Hecla, Merger Sub and Mines Management will promptly inform the other parties, as the case may be, of
any communication from any governmental entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. If Mines Management or Hecla receives a request for additional
Table of Contents
76
information or documentary material from any governmental entity with respect to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request, and, if permitted by applicable law and by any applicable governmental entity, provide the other
party’s counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and participate in any meeting with any
governmental entity in respect of any filing made therewith in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement.
Mines Management has agreed to take all action required to render the BCA, the Mines Management shareholder
rights plan and any other shareholder rights or other similar agreement with respect to any securities of Mines
Management, inapplicable to any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
governmental entity or private party challenging the merger or any other transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement, or any other agreement contemplated thereby, Mines Management is required to cooperate in all
respects with Hecla and Merger Sub and will use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. None of Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates is required to defend,
contest or resist any action or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, or to take any action to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.
None of Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their subsidiaries is required to, and Mines Management may not, without the
prior written consent of Hecla, become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of Mines
Management, the surviving company, Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, (ii) conduct,
restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of Mines Management, the
surviving company, Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries in any manner or (iii) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of Mines
Management, the surviving company, Hecla, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries; provided that, if
requested by Hecla, Mines Management will become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on Mines
Management in the event the Closing occurs.
Indemnification and Insurance
Hecla and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by
Mines Management now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
the merger agreement or who becomes prior to the effective time an officer or director of Mines Management and
its subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in Mines Management’s articles of incorporation and
bylaws, in each case as in effect on the date of the merger agreement, or pursuant to any other contracts in effect
on the date of the merger agreement and disclosed on the Mines Management disclosure schedule, will be
assumed by the surviving company in the merger, without further action, at the effective time and will survive the
merger and will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding
is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or
claim.
Hecla and the surviving company have agreed to, for a period of six years after the effective time and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses,

77
claims, damages, Liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in connection with any claim brought by a
third party arising out of actions or omissions in such Indemnified Party’s capacity as an officer or director of
Mines Managements or its subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the effective time, and have agreed to reimburse
each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, Liabilities, fees, expenses,
judgments and fines are incurred, subject to the receipt by the surviving company of an undertaking from such
Indemnified Party to repay such fees or expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable law.
In addition, Hecla has agreed that, at the effective time, the surviving company will obtain a “tail” directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy for Mines Management and its directors, officers and other persons who are
currently covered by the existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy maintained by Mines
Management that will provide such directors, officers and other persons with coverage for six years following the
effective time of not less than the existing coverage amount and have other terms not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to the insured persons in comparison to Mines Management’s existing insurance coverage;
provided, that in no event will the surviving company be obligated to pay an annual premium for such coverage in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by Mines Management for such insurance prior to the date of the
merger agreement.

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers
Amendment. At any time prior to the effective time, the merger agreement may be amended by the parties by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors; provided, however, that, after approval and adoption
of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Mines Management, no amendment that, by law or in accordance

partial exercise of any right under the merger agreement preclude any other or further exercise of any rights
thereunder.
Specific Enforcement

PROPOSAL 2: POSSIBLE ADJOURNMENT TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES, IF NECESSARY OR
APPROPRIATE
Mines Management is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by its board of
directors to vote in favor of any adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger proposal.
The Mines Management board of directors does not intend to propose adjournment of the special meeting if there
are sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger proposal, unless Mines Management believes that such
adjournment is necessary or advisable under applicable law.
Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of
Mines Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled
to vote on the proposal, and a quorum must be present at the special meeting.
If you are a Mines Management stockholder and fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker to vote, it will
have no effect on the adjournment proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you are a Mines Management
stockholder and you mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have no effect on the adjournment
proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON COMPENSATION
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Mines Management is
required to submit a proposal to its stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain
compensation that may become payable to Mines Management’s named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the merger. This proposal, which we refer to as the “compensation proposal,” gives Mines
Management’s stockholders the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that
may be paid or become payable to Mines Management’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.
This compensation is summarized in the table in the section entitled “Proposal 1: The Approval and Adoption of
the Merger Agreement—Interests of Mines Management’s Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger—
Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 61, including the footnotes to the table.
The Mines Management board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related
compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement/prospectus. The Mines Management board
unanimously recommends that Mines Management’s stockholders approve, by advisory vote, the compensation
that may become payable to Mines Management’s named executive officers in connection with the completion of
the merger.
The vote on the compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger proposal.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve and adopt the merger proposal and vote not to approve the compensation
proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either Mines Management or Hecla. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger
is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the
outcome of the vote on the compensation proposal.
Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of
Mines Management common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled
to vote on the proposal, and a quorum must be present at the special meeting.
If you fail to submit a proxy or fail to instruct your broker to vote, it will have no effect on the compensation
proposal, assuming a quorum is present. If you mark your proxy or voting instructions to abstain, it will have no
effect on the compensation proposal, assuming a quorum is present.

The market value of the shares of Hecla common stock to be issued in exchange for shares of Mines Management
common stock upon the completion of the merger will not be known at the time of the special meeting. The above
tables show only historical comparisons. Because the market prices of shares of Hecla and Mines Management
common stock will likely fluctuate prior to the closing of the merger, these comparisons may not provide
meaningful information to Mines Management stockholders in determining whether to approve and adopt the
merger proposal. Therefore, current and historical market prices of Hecla common stock and Mines Management
common stock are not reflective of the value that Mines Management stockholders will receive in the merger. Hecla
stockholders and Mines Management stockholders are encouraged to review carefully the other information
contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

transactions by Hecla or a subsidiary having an aggregate
value of $1,000,000 or more, (iv) the adoption of any plan or
proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Hecla proposed by

of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares
held by an interested stockholder, with an interested
stockholder who beneficially owns 12-1/2% or more of a

entity becomes an interested stockholder, unless: an
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock, voting
together as a single class, approve the business combination.
The BCA prohibits a “business combination” (defined
broadly to include mergers or consolidations, certain
sales, sales of assets, liquidation or dissolution and other
specified transactions) between a corporation and an
“interested shareholder” (defined generally as a person or
group that beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or
more of the outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or
associate of the corporation) within three years of the
shareholder becoming an interested stockholder, unless,
among other exceptions:
•    the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws
include a provision, adopted in accordance with §30-
1703 of the BCA, that expressly provides that the
corporation is not subject to the statute (Mines
Management does not have such a provision in its
articles of incorporation or bylaws);
An 80% vote is not required if:
•    prior to the date the person became an interested
shareholder, the board of directors approved either the
business combination or the transaction which resulted in
the person becoming an interested shareholder;
•    the business combination is approved by the
affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
voting stock not beneficially owned by the interested
shareholder no earlier than three years after the
interested shareholder’s share acquisition date; or
•    the business combination meets certain conditions,
including that the consideration meet certain criteria as to
amount and form and the business combination is
consummated no earlier than three years after the
interested shareholder’s share acquisition date.
•    a majority of the members of the board of directors who are
unaffiliated with the interested director approve the business
combination; and
•    certain price and procedure requirements set forth in the
certificate of incorporation are met.
Section 203 of the DGCL generally prohibits “business
combinations,” including mergers, sales and leases of assets,
issuances of securities and similar transactions by a
corporation or a subsidiary with an interested stockholder who
beneficially owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock,
within three years after the person or entity becomes an
interested stockholder, unless:
•    the board of directors of the target corporation has
approved, before the acquisition time, either the business
combination or the transaction that resulted in the person
becoming an interested stockholder;
•    upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the
person becoming an interested stockholder, the person owns
at least 85% of the corporation’s voting stock (excluding shares
owned by directors who are officers and shares owned by

under some circumstances, including if the corporation’s
original certificate of incorporation contains a provision
expressly electing not to be governed by the Delaware statute
regulating business combinations, or if the corporation, by
action of its stockholders, adopts an amendment to its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws expressly electing not to
be governed by these provisions of Delaware law (and such

Hecla
Mines Management
The DGCL provides that a corporation may indemnify any
person who is made a party to any third-party action, suit or
proceeding on account of being a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation (or was serving at the request of the
corporation in such capacity for another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) against
expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by him or her in connection with the action, suit or proceeding
through, among other things, a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to the suit or
proceeding, if the person:
•    acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation or, in some circumstances, at least not opposed to
its best interests; and
•    in a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
Mines Management’s articles of incorporation provide that
Mines Management is authorized to indemnify, agree to
indemnify or obligate itself to advance or reimburse
expenses incurred by its directors, officers, employees or
agents in any proceedings to the full extent currently or
subsequently permitted by the IBCA.
The IBCA requires that a corporation indemnify a director
who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in
the defense of any proceeding to which he or she was a
party because he or she was a director of the corporation,
against reasonable expenses incurred by him or her in
connection with the proceeding.
The IBCA permits a corporation to indemnify a director if
either (A)(i) he or she conducted himself or herself in
good faith and (ii) reasonably believed (a) in the case of
conduct in his or her official capacity, that his or her
conduct was in the best interests of the corporation, and
(b) in all cases, that his or her conduct was at least not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and (iii) in
The DGCL also permits indemnification by a corporation under
similar circumstances for expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by such persons in
connection with the defense or settlement of a derivative action
or suit, except that
the case of any criminal proceeding, he or she had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful, or (B) he or she engaged in conduct for which
broader

no indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue
or matter as to which the person is adjudged to be liable to the
corporation unless the Delaware Court of Chancery or the
court in which the action or suit was brought determines upon
application that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for the expenses which the court deems to be
proper.
To the extent a director, officer, employee or agent is
successful in the defense of such an action, suit or proceeding,
the corporation is required by Delaware law to indemnify such
person for reasonable expenses incurred thereby.
Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by such persons
in defending any action, suit or proceeding may be paid in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
that person to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to be so indemnified.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS
Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders in certain extraordinary
transactions such as a merger to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a
court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the
extraordinary transaction.
Appraisal rights are not available in all circumstances, and exceptions to these rights are provided under Idaho
law. Stockholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to shares of any class or series of stock if, among
other circumstances, such shares are listed on the NYSE or the NYSE MKT. Therefore, because Mines
Management’s common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, Mines Management stockholders will not be entitled to
appraisal rights under Idaho law in the merger with respect to their shares of Mines Management common stock.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
It is not expected that Mines Management will hold an annual meeting of stockholders for 2016 unless the merger is
not completed.
However, if the merger is not completed, then the Mines Management 2016 annual meeting of stockholders will be
held more than thirty days from the anniversary of last year’s annual meeting. Accordingly, if the merger is not
completed, any stockholders proposal, including director nominations, intended to be included in Mines
Management’s proxy materials for the annual meeting of stockholders for 2016, must be received by Mines
Management a reasonable time before printing and mailing its proxy materials in order for the proposals to be
considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders for 2016. Such proposals
must be submitted in writing and should be sent to the attention of the Secretary of Mines Management. Mines
Management will comply with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act with respect to any proposal that meets its
requirements.
In addition, under the terms of Mines Management’s bylaws, a stockholder who intends to present an item of
business at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, including director nominations (other than a proposal
submitted for inclusion in Mines Management’s proxy materials), must provide notice of such business to Mines
Management not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders;
provided, that if public disclosure of the date of the meeting is first made less than 100 days prior to the date of the
meeting, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be received no later than the close of business on the
tenth day following the day on which such public disclosure of the date of the meeting is made. In addition, all
notices must contain the additional information required by Mines Management’s bylaws. Such notice must be
sent to Secretary, Mines Management, Inc., 905 West Riverside Avenue, Suite 311, Spokane, Washington 99201.
INFORMATION REGARDING MINES MANAGEMENT
Mines Management is engaged in the business of acquiring and exploring, and if exploration is successful,
developing, mineral properties, primarily those containing silver and associated base and precious metals.
Montanore Project
Mines Management’s principal mineral property interest, the Montanore Project, is a large exploration stage silver
and copper deposit located in northwestern Montana. Noranda owned the Montanore Project from 1988 to 2002.
Noranda completed an EIS, obtained a ROD for the Montanore Project and certain environmental permits and
conducted pre-evaluation construction activities on the property. From 1988 to 2002 Mines Management held
royalty rights to a portion of the deposit. In 2002, Noranda announced that it was abandoning the project, and
subsequently transferred to Mines Management by quitclaim deed the patented and unpatented mining claims that
control the mineral rights, and all drill core and intellectual property including geologic, environmental and
engineering studies, relating to the Montanore Project. In 2006, Mines Management acquired from Noranda certain
project permits and properties that provide access to the Libby adit, commenced by Noranda to access the
Montanore deposit.
Montanore Property
The Montanore Project is located in Sanders and Lincoln Counties in northwestern Montana and consists of a
series of patented mining and unpatented mining claims, millsites and tunnel sites owned by Mines Management or
one of its subsidiaries. The unpatented mining claims are held subject to a $155 per claim annual maintenance fee
paid to the federal government.
Mines Management’s ownership of the Montanore deposit stems primarily from its ownership of two patented
mining claims, identified as HR 133 and HR 134, which cover the surface outcrop or “apex” of the gently dipping
mineralized beds. According to U.S. mining law, the holders of claims covering the apex of a
Table of Contents
97
dipping, tabular deposit own the minerals to depth, even if the deposit passes from beneath the apex claim. For
Mines Management’s claims at the Montanore Project, these “extralateral rights” have been confirmed by the U.S.
Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior and upheld in U.S. District Court for the District of Montanta. In addition to
the patented apex claims, Mines Management owns unpatented claims located along the fault which bounds the
southwestern margin of the deposit and extends outside of the western border of the Cabinet Wilderness Area.
Mines Management’s property holdings for operational access and infrastructure support for the Montanore
Project are located to the east of the deposit, south of the town of Libby, and are accessed from Libby by about 16
miles of secondary road up Libby Creek. The apex of the deposit can be reached from Noxon, the nearest town, by
traveling east about two miles on State Highway 200, north about five miles on a secondary graveled road to the
junction of the west and east forks of Rock Creek, and then about four miles on a Jeep trail behind a locked USFS
gate. The deposit outcrops near the border of and, other than the outcrop that occurs on the patented claims HR
133 and HR 134, lies entirely within the Cabinet Wilderness Area. Because any future mining of the deposit would
take place underground and Mines Management has access to the deposit from outside the Cabinet Wilderness
Area (its patented mining claims and certain other mineral rights predate the wilderness area designation), Mines
Management believes that future mining and associated surface activity would not have a material impact on the
wilderness area.
In May 2006, Mines Management acquired from Noranda State Hard Rock Operating Permit 150 that covers certain
exploration activities and the Montana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“MPDES”) water discharge permit
for the Montanore Project as well as title to properties providing access to the portal of the Libby adit. The 14,000
foot Libby adit, constructed in the early 1990s by Noranda, ends approximately 3,000 feet short of the deposit. If
extended, the adit would provide access to the Montanore deposit for underground exploration and delineation.
Non-Reserves—Mineralized Material
Non-Reserves Reported in the United States. The estimate of mineralized material set forth below was prepared by
Mine Development Associates, or MDA, of Reno, Nevada in October 2005. The estimate was prepared in
accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7.

“Mineralized material” as used in this proxy statement/prospectus, although permissible under SEC’s Industry
Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards. Mines Management cannot be certain that any part of the
mineralized material at the Montanore Project will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7
compliant “reserves.” You should not assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed
or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
Geology
The Montanore Project contains a strata-bound silver-copper deposit occurring in the Revett Formation, which is
part of an extensive series of Precambrian-aged metasedimentary rocks belonging to the Belt Supergroup. The
Revett Formation has been subdivided into three members (upper, middle and lower) based on the contained
amounts of quartzite, silty quartzite and siltite. The lower Revett Formation, which hosts the mineralized horizons,
is composed primarily of quartzite with lesser interbeds of siltite and silty quartzite.
Table of Contents
98
The silver-copper mineralization at Montanore is strata-bound in the upper portions of the lower Revett Formation.
Copper and silver values are carried predominately in the minerals bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite and native
silver in variable proportions and concentrations. Sulfide content of the mineralized rock rarely exceeds 3% to 4%
and is commonly 1% to 2%.
The mineralized zone crops out at the surface and extends down dip at least 12,000 feet to the north-northwest.
The mineralization is open ended in the down dip direction. Mineralization occurs in at least two sub-parallel
horizons separated by a silver- and copper-deficient zone containing low-grade lead in the form of galena. The two
horizons are identified as the B1 for the upper zone and the B for the lower and more extensive zone. Both zones
dip to the northwest between 15 degrees and 30 degrees, with an average of just over 15 degrees. The width of the
main (B) horizon, in plane view, is defined by a fault on one side and a fold axis on the other, and varies from 804
feet to 3,540 feet. The property boundaries, however, limit the controlled portion of the deposit to a maximum of
2,000 feet. The average thickness for each of the two horizons is 35 feet, depending upon cutoff.
Advancement of the Montanore Project
Following the initial acquisition of the Montanore Project, Mines Management retained McIntosh Engineering and
Hatch Ltd. to prepare a cost update study. McIntosh Engineering completed the study and generated a draft report
in May 2006 that included engineering optimization, engineering review, cost updates, mine planning and other
aspects of the project. As part of the mine planning effort, Mines Management incorporated the geologic
information developed by Noranda and another previous owner into a Vulcan mine modeling package, a 3-
dimensional geologic model that should assist in further evaluating mine planning activities and projection of ore
zones. Mines Management used this information to develop underground drilling targets for an evaluation drilling
program.
When Mines Management acquired the additional claims providing access to the Libby adit in 2006, there were no
plant, equipment or subsurface improvements other than the adit, which was plugged and in reclamation. In 2006,
Mines Management reopened the adit and completed initial water testing to determine the treatment method for
water discharged from the adit. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Mines Management obtained permit revisions for an
underground evaluation drilling program, purchased generators to provide power for the initial evaluation drilling
program and erected a warehouse building, shop, office and employee change facility at the Libby adit site.
In 2007, Mines Management completed the construction of site infrastructure to support the planned underground
evaluation program at the Montanore Project including a $1.5 million water treatment plant to process all water
pumped out of the Libby adit and a dry storage structure for inventory. Mines Management also acquired an initial
fleet of surface and underground heavy equipment.
In 2008 and 2009, Mines Management continued the testing and installation of the adit dewatering system in
preparation for the planned 3,000 foot extension of the Libby adit and initiation of the drilling program, installed
sumps and tested most of the mining equipment. In addition, Mines Management has worked to rehabilitate the adit
including sealing the walls, installing new roof bolts and extending power, ventilation and dewatering infrastructure
in the adit. Infrastructure in the adit includes a refuge chamber, mine power center and temporary pump station,
along with the previously installed sumps and pumping system. Mines Management dewatered the adit in 2009 and
continued engineering and geology work during 2008 and 2009.
The decline has been on care and maintenance since the second quarter 2009, pending completion of the
environmental review process. Operations at the Libby adit are currently limited to maintaining the water level at the
7,400 foot level in the adit and treating the water pumped from the adit.
Permitting and Environmental
Mines Management requires certain regulatory agency approvals and environmental permits to proceed with
Montanore Project exploration and project development.
Table of Contents
Final EIS and Record of Decision
99
In December 2015, the USFS and MDEQ issued a joint final EIS that assesses the environmental impacts of the
Montanore Project to endangered species, wetlands and water quality. After more than ten years of data collection,
analyses and public involvement, the completed EIS describes the modifications to the proposed project that the
agencies consider appropriate to minimize environmental impact utilizing mitigation measures and monitoring
requirements. The USFS and MDEQ both issued their RODs on February 12, 2016 providing approval for
development of the Montanore Project contingent upon meeting subsequent analysis, permitting milestones and
environmental mitigation requirements.
Biological Opinion
As part of the permitting process, the USFS was required to prepare a biological assessment for both terrestrial
and aquatic life. The USFWS reviewed these reports in connection with its biological opinion addressing the
impact of the project on threatened and endangered species, including grizzly bear and bull trout. In the first
quarter of 2014, the USFWS issued the final biological opinion concluding that the project, as mitigated, would not
adversely impact endangered species. The EIS included slight changes to the project’s mitigation measures to
reduce impacts to grizzly bear and bull trout, with which the USFWS concurred.
Section 404 Permit
The US Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) completed as part of the final EIS an analysis of potential project
discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States including wetlands. These discharges are
regulated by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act which requires a permit for construction of the tailings facility. In
2012, the USACE completed a jurisdictional determination on the proposed tailings impoundment site, which
required extensive aquatic habitat data. Mines Management completed a compensatory mitigation plan for aquatic
resources affected by the proposed tailings impoundment which was accepted by the USACE in 2014. Mines
Management expects the USACE to issue the 404 permit during 2016.
The State of Montana must certify the USACE Section 404 authorization through the 401 certification process
before the USACE can issue a permit. The State of Montana has been involved throughout the 404 review process
and continued to work with the USACE during 2015.
Hardrock Operating Permit
Mines Management currently holds Permit 150 (Hardrock Operating Permit) which has remained in effect since its
issuance in 1993. Permit 150 was amended with the issuance of the ROD on February 12, 2016, authorizing Mines
Management to conduct exploration activities.
MPDES Permit
Mines Management currently holds MPDES Permit #0030279 that authorizes wastewater discharge from the
Montanore Project. The project is currently operating under an administratively extended permit which will remain
valid until an amended MPDES Permit is issued for the project. Since the beginning of 2015, the agency issued a
draft MPDES permit amendment, conducted a public review process, assessed the comments received during the
public review process and analyzed changes to the draft permit. Mines Management anticipates the MPDES permit
amendment to be issued during the third quarter of 2016.
State Permits
Many of the state permits required by the project were initiated by the agencies during 2015. Those permits under
review are issuable subsequent to the issuance of the ROD, which occurred in February 2016. Mines Management
will be required to submit applications for other permits to coincide with required project activities.
Table of Contents
100
MDEQ issued a transmission certificate concurrently with the ROD which authorizes Mines Management to
construct a transmission line to supply power to the project and an air quality permit which covers the evaluation,
construction and operational phases of the project.
The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (“DNRC”) is responsible for issuing water rights
for the project during construction and operation. Reviews of water rights for the project were completed prior to
2015, but under state regulations, the water rights could not be issued until the USFS issued its ROD for the
project. Mines Management anticipates the Montana DNRC will issue water rights during 2016.
Opposition
Private groups have been active in opposing permitting of projects in and near the Cabinet Wilderness Area and
have taken and may in the future take actions to oppose or delay the Montanore Project. For example, Save Our
Cabinets, Earthworks and Defenders of Wildlife have filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
District of Montana against the USFWS challenging the issuance of the Montanore biological opinion. The same
groups (with one exception) also filed a separate lawsuit against the USFS challenging the issuance of the ROD.
See “Information Regarding Mines Management—Legal Proceedings” beginning on page 102 for additional
discussion.
Preliminary Economic Assessment
In December 2010, Mines Management announced the completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”)
for the Montanore Project. The PEA was prepared to provide guidance on the potential viability of the Montanore
Project and the basis for the continuation of exploration activities. Because of the uncertainties associated with
any mineral deposit that, like the Montanore Project, does not have reserves, the PEA should not be relied on to
value the Montanore Project, nor should it be considered to be a feasibility or pre-feasibility study.
The PEA did not update the mineral resource analysis of the Montanore deposit completed in October 2005 by
Mine Development Associates, Inc. (“MDA Report”). Mineralized material, as set forth in the MDA Report, is
81.5 million short tons of material grading 2.04 ounces per short ton silver and 0.75% copper with a cutoff grade of
1.0 ounces per short ton silver.
The PEA assumed metals prices based on a three year trailing average at August 16, 2010 (i.e. $3.10 per pound for
copper and $15.00 per ounce for silver) and developed cost estimates for development of the Montanore Project.
Based on the effective date in the PEA report, the initial capital costs for the project were estimated to be $552.3
million (with a ± 35% accuracy). The PEA assumed that the project would utilize conventional grinding and flotation
processing techniques at an initial processing rate of 12,500 short tons per day. The PEA concluded that the
Montanore Project demonstrated favorable economic potential, which justified commencement of a resource
evaluation program and subsequent pre-feasibility study.
On February 3, 2011, the PEA was filed in Canada in accordance with National Instrument 43-101—Standards of
Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The technical report summarizing the results of the PEA was prepared by Mine and
Quarry Engineering Services, Inc. of San Mateo, California. The independent “Qualified Persons” (as such term is
defined in National Instrument 43-101) for the report were Mr. Chris Kaye and Mr. Geoffrey Challiner. The PEA filed
in Canada is not part of this proxy statement/prospectus.
Description of Royalties on Patented Mining Claims
Under the HR 133 and HR 134 patented mining claims, which cover the Montanore deposit, Mines Management is
required to pay a production payment royalty of twenty cents ($.20) per ton of ore extracted and milled therefrom,
pursuant to (i) that Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 6, 1988, between Atlantic
Goldfields Inc. and Montana Reserves Company and (ii) that Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement dated
September 6, 1988, between Jascan Resources Inc. and Montana Reserves Company, a former
Table of Contents
101
joint venture partner with Noranda. The royalty is payable with respect to the amount of resources included in an
independent feasibility study prepared for project financing purposes, is payable at six month intervals following
the commencement of commercial production as defined in the referenced agreements, and terminates when the
reserve as defined in the feasibility study has been mined and milled.
Other Properties
Mines Management also owns certain patented and unpatented mining claims on zinc properties in northern
Washington State, referred to as the Iroquois and Advance properties. No mining activities have been conducted
on these properties since the 1960s.
Employees
As of March 31, 2016, Mines Management had six employees located in Spokane, Washington and five employees
in Libby, Montana. Outside consultants and contractors are engaged from time to time to perform tasks related to
the Montanore Project.
Legal Proceedings
In September 2007, Mines Management filed a declaratory judgment action captioned Mines Management, Inc.,
Newhi, Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. v. Tracie Fus et al., Cause No. DV 07-248 in Montana Nineteenth Judicial
District Court, Lincoln County. In this action, Mines Management sought a court judgment against certain of the
defendants that the unpatented mining claims of such defendants, allegedly located above portions of Mines
Management’s Libby adit and overlapping certain of its patented and unpatented mining claims, millsites and
tunnel sites are invalid. The defendants subsequently asserted trespass claims against Mines Management
relating to its use of certain of its mining claims, millsites and the adit. The parties participated in a mediation in
2009, which resulted in a settlement with seven of the ten defendants. On March 21, 2013, the court issued an order
(i) enforcing the settlement with seven of the ten defendants, (ii) enjoining Mines Management from trespassing on
certain mining claims owned by one of the defendants and (iii) finding that the mining claim of another defendant is
valid and superior to certain of Mines Management’s claims. The claims with respect to which Mines Management
was enjoined from trespass do not overlap the adit. The mining claim that the court determined was valid and
superior to certain of Mines Management’s claims overlaps portions of the adit and portions of certain of its
patented claims and unpatented millsites and tunnel sites. Mines Management does not believe that this order
affects its ability to use the adit or to conduct exploration and development operations as currently planned once
Mines Management has obtained the required permits.
Mines Management appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, Case No. DA 13-0240, with respect to certain portions
of the order. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mines Management remanding the case to the District Court with
instructions to vacate the injunction and to conduct further proceedings. In January 2014, the Montana Supreme
Court reversed the District Court on the basis of lack of findings, existence of an issue of fact, lack of evidence
regarding trespass and misplaced reliance on evidence that the District Court relied upon with respect to claim
validity. In December 2015, the District Court set the case for trial in April 2016. The District Court subsequently
vacated and has not reset the trial date.
On June 28, 2013, Mines Management filed a condemnation action captioned Montanore Minerals Corporation v.
Easements and Rights of Way under through and across those certain unpatented lode mining claims et al., Cause
No. CV-00133-DLC, in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Missoula Division. In this action,
Mines Management sought to acquire easements and rights of way for the Montanore Project including for use of
the adit and the construction and use of another underground tunnel and related equipment that are contemplated
by the draft EIS for the Montanore Project and other draft permits. The defendants include the defendant in the
case referenced in the preceding paragraphs whose claim was determined to be valid and overlaps the existing
adit. Mines Management filed a motion for a preliminary condemnation

order and injunction to obtain immediate access to the easements and rights-of-way and a motion to have the
court declare the subject mining claims void for failure to comply with an essential federal filing requirement. The
primary defendant filed a motion requesting the court to dismiss without prejudice or stay the condemnation
proceeding on abstention grounds and a motion to dismiss one of the two condemnation counts.
On April 29, 2014, the U.S. District Court in Missoula granted Mines Management’s motion for a preliminary
condemnation order, which affirms Mines Management’s right of access through the Libby adit and its right to
construct another tunnel that is planned in connection with the potential construction of a mine. In addition, the
U.S. District Court granted Mines Management’s motion for a preliminary injunction for immediate right of
possession, thereby preserving Mines Management’s ongoing access through the adit. Mines Management’s
motion to declare the subject mining claims void was denied on abstention grounds. The primary defendant’s
motions to dismiss without prejudice or stay the condemnation proceeding on abstention grounds were denied.
The primary defendant’s motion to dismiss one of the condemnation counts was denied as moot. The court
decisions referenced in this paragraph are subject to appeal. The hearing on the compensation phase of the
condemnation case was held in April 2015. In their report issued in May 2015, the Commissioners appointed by the
court to determine the just compensation for the taking resulting from the court’s preliminary condemnation order
concluded that the amount of just compensation to the defendants is $0. On August 7, 2015, the U.S. District Court
issued its final ruling affirming the Commission’s decision. The defendants have appealed this ruling.
In July 2014, Frank R. Wall filed a complaint in the Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Lincoln County,
Montana captioned Frank R. Wall v. Patent Lode Mining claims HR 133 and HR 134, et al., Case No. DV-14-140,
arising out of the facts related to the litigation described above and claiming monetary damages, declaratory
judgments and other relief. The complaint names Mines Management and its subsidiaries Newhi, Inc. and
Montanore Minerals Corporation as defendants. Mines Management believes the allegations of the complaint are
without merit.
In January 2016, Frank R. Wall filed a complaint in the United States Federal District Court for the District of Idaho
captioned Frank Reginald Wall v. United States Department of Agriculture, et al., Cause No. CV-16-0043-BLW,
claiming a violation of his constitutional rights and requesting an injunction against the USFS ROD for the
issuance of permits to Mines Management for operations at the Montanore Project. Mines Management is named
as one of the defendants. Mines Management believes the allegations of the complaint are without merit.
On May 27, 2016, Mines Management, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Montanore Minerals Corporation, filed
motions to intervene in three cases pending in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Missoula
Division captioned (i) Save Our Cabinets et al. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service et al., Cause No. CV-15-69-
M-DWM, (ii) Libby Placer Mining Company v. United States Forest Service et al., Cause No. CV-16-53-M-DWM, and
(iii) Save Our Cabinets et al. v. United States Department of Agriculture, Cause No. CV-16-56-M-DWM. Each of the
actions involve claims challenging the permitting of the Montanore Project. The motions to intervene were granted
in early June 2016.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Explanatory Note
The following discussion of Mines Management’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014 and its unaudited financial statements and notes for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which
appear in this proxy statement/prospectus commencing on page F-1.
Financial and Operating Results
Comparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Mines Management reported a net loss for the year
ended December 31, 2015 of $2.8 million or $0.10 per share compared to a net loss of $6.5 million or $0.22 per share
for the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table summarizes expenses and other income by category
and year:

Montanore Project Expense includes fees, filing, licenses and technical services, including environmental,
engineering and permitting expense. Montanore Project Expense decreased by $0.5 million during 2015 compared
to 2014 primarily because of the reduction in fees paid to the contractor working on obtaining and maintaining
project approvals and permits as well as a reduction in the baseline studies associated with the EIS.
Administrative Expense, which includes general overhead and office expense, legal, accounting, compensation,
rent, taxes and investor relations expense, decreased by $0.7 million during 2015 compared to 2014. The following
factors included within Administrative Expense are responsible for the change: (i) a decrease in payroll
expenditures of $0.2 million as a result of having fewer employees during 2015 and not paying employee bonuses,
(ii) a decrease of $0.1 million in fees paid to members of Mines Management’s board of directors during 2015, (iii) a
decrease of $0.2 million due to the lack of costs in 2015 associated with the special proxy and stockholders’
meeting held during 2014 to approve the financing completed by Mines Management in 2014 and (iv) a decrease of
$0.2 million in legal, accounting and consulting fees primarily associated with a litigation matter described in
“Information Regarding Mines Management—Legal Proceedings” beginning on page 102.
Depreciation decreased by $0.7 million during 2015 as a result of equipment reaching the end of its depreciable life
and limited acquisitions of property and equipment during the past few years.
Non Cash Stock Based Compensation Expense (which is included in general and administrative and technical
services expenses in Mines Management’s statement of operations) decreased by $0.1 million during 2015
because the number of options granted and the fair value of options granted during 2015 were less than those
granted during 2014.
Other Income of $1.8 million in 2015 consisted of proceeds from the sale of idle equipment previously utilized for
construction of infrastructure at the Montanore Project. During 2014, Other Income of $0.1 million consisted of a
gain from the sale of Mines Management’s interest in an oil and gas lease during the year.
Comparison of Three Months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. Mines Management reported a net loss of $1.0
million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The
most significant differences in operating expenditures between those two quarters include: (i) a $0.1 million
decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation and investor
relations expenses during 2016, (ii) a decrease of $0.1 million in technical expenses in 2016 primarily due to the
completion of the final EIS and issuance of the RODs, which resulted in reductions in fees paid to the contractors
working on obtaining and maintaining project approvals and permits as well as a reduction in the baseline studies
associated with the EIS, and (iii) a $0.3 million decrease in legal, accounting and consulting fees primarily
associated with the conclusion of a litigation matter in the third quarter of 2015 as described in “Information
Regarding Mines Management—Legal Proceedings” beginning on page 102.
Liquidity
The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared under the assumption that Mines
Management will continue as a going concern. Mines Management reported in its report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2016 that it did not have sufficient cash to fund ongoing operating expenses through the
end of the second quarter 2016. Mines Management had been unable to raise sufficient external financing to meet
its ongoing obligations. On May 23, 2016, Mines Management entered into the merger agreement pursuant to
which, and subject to the approval and adoption of Mines Management’s stockholders and the satisfaction of other
conditions specified in the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Hecla would merge with and into Mines Management
in a transaction in which Mines Management’s stockholders would receive 0.2218 of a share of Hecla common
stock for each share of common stock of Mines Management. Also on May 23, 2016, Mines Management entered
into the Interim Credit Agreement pursuant to which Hecla has agreed to provide secured loans to Mines
Management in an aggregate amount of up to $2.3 million. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, Mines
Management has borrowed approximately $1.4 million from Hecla pursuant to the Interim Credit Agreement.
Table of Contents
105
The merger is subject to the approval and adoption of Mines Management’s stockholders, with the meeting to vote
on the proposed merger currently scheduled for September 12, 2016. Should the proposed merger not be
completed, the loan from Hecla would become immediately due and payable, and Mines Management would review
alternatives to attempt to obtain adequate financing to fund its ongoing operating expenses. There can be no
assurance that Mines Management would be successful in obtaining adequate financing that would permit it to
continue its business, or that the terms of any such financing would not make future financings or transactions
more difficult or otherwise limit Mines Management’s flexibility or opportunities in the future. There can also be no
assurance that any financing obtained would not be highly dilutive to existing stockholders.
Mines Management’s cash and cash equivalents decreased from $1.2 million at December 31, 2015 to
approximately $0.4 million at March 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the net cash used in
operating activities was approximately $0.8 million, which was $0.4 million less than the net cash used in operating
activities during the same period in the prior year. Net cash utilized by financing activities during 2016 included
approximately $0.1 million cumulative preferred stock dividends paid.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Mines Management’s cash balances and its long term investment certificates of deposit are denominated in U.S.
dollars and held in local and national banking institutions. Mines Management manages the timing of cash required
for review of the permitting and engineering of the Montanore Project and for general corporate purposes utilizing
its money market account. Mines Management’s policy is to invest only in government securities rated “investment
grade” or better.
The market prices of base and precious metals such as silver and copper fluctuate widely and are affected by
numerous factors beyond the control of any mining company. These factors include expectations with regard to
the rate of inflation, the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, global or regional
political, economic or banking crises, and a number of other factors. If the market price of silver or copper should
decrease, the value of Mines Management’s Montanore Project could decline and Mines Management might not be
able to recover its investment in that project. Any determination to develop or construct a mine would be made
long before the first revenues from production would be received. Price fluctuations between the time that such
decisions are made and the commencement of production could affect the economics of the mine.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Mines Management, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mines Management, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Mines Management, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has
recurring losses from operations and does not have sufficient cash on hand to fund operations through the end of
2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1—ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization:
Mines Management, Inc. (the “Company”) is a publicly held Idaho corporation incorporated in 1947. The Company
acquires, explores, and develops mineral properties in North and South America.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
a. Going concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the
Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is an exploration stage company and has
incurred losses since the inception of its exploration stage. The Company does not have sufficient cash to fund
normal operations beyond April 2016 without raising additional funds. The Company currently does not have a
recurring source of revenue sufficient to fund normal operations and its ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent on the Company’s ability to secure sufficient funding for its future exploration and working capital
requirements, which may include the sale of its equity or debt securities, and the eventual profitable exploitation of
its mining properties. There can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in securing additional funding on
terms acceptable to the Company or at all, or in generating future profitable operations. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
b. Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of Mines
Management, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Newhi, Inc., Montanore Minerals Corp., Montmin Resources
Corp., and Minera Montanore Peru, SAC. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
c.
Exploration stage enterprise
The Company is in the exploration stage of operation and devotes substantially all of its efforts to acquiring and
exploring mining interests that management believes should eventually provide sufficient net profits to sustain the
Company’s existence. Until such interests are engaged in commercial production, the Company will continue to
seek additional funding to support the completion of its exploration and development activities. The Company’s
activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including its ability to secure sufficient funding to
continue operations, to obtain proven and probable reserves, to comply with industry regulations and obtain
permits necessary for development of the Montanore project, as well as environmental risks and market
conditions.
d. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, investments in certificates of deposit with
original maturities of 90 days or less, and money market funds.
e. Available for sale securities
Available for sale securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of
equity, unless a decline in value of the security is considered other than temporary. Realized gains and losses and
other than temporary impairments are recorded in the statement of operations.
Table of Contents
f.
Property and equipment
F-8
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings and leasehold improvements
are depreciated on the straight line basis over an estimated useful life of 39 years. Plant and equipment and office
equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.
When assets are retired or sold, the costs and related allowances for depreciation are eliminated from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations.
g. Mining properties, exploration and development costs
All exploration expenditures, including costs to acquire stationary equipment for use in exploration activities that
have no significant alternative future use, are expensed as incurred. Significant property acquisition payments for
active exploration properties are capitalized, including payments to acquire mineral rights. Once a feasibility study
has been completed, approved by management, and a decision is made to put the ore body into production,
expenditures to develop new mines, to define further mineralization in existing ore bodies, and to expand the
capacity of operating mines, are capitalized and amortized on the units of production basis over proven and
probable reserves. The Company charges to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs attributable to
properties sold. Capitalized costs are allocated to properties sold based on the proportion of claims sold to the
claims remaining within the project area.
h. Asset impairment
The Company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an
undiscounted basis is less than the carrying amount of the related asset grouping, asset impairment is considered
to exist. The related impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value. Changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates may have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.
i.
Fair value measurements
The Company discloses the inputs used to develop the fair value measurements for the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as well as the level within the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at
the measurement date.
Level 2: Quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs either directly related to the asset or liability or derived
principally from corroborated observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs due to the fact that there is little or no market activity.
j.
Asset retirement obligations
A liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation (asset retirement obligation),
in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The offsetting
balance is charged to expense as an exploration cost if the liability is incurred during the exploration stage of the
related mining project or as an asset if the related mining project is in production. Adjustments are made to the
liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original
present value estimate underlying the obligation. The Company has an asset retirement obligation associated with
its underground evaluation program at the Montanore Project, described more fully in note 6.
Table of Contents
k. Deferred income taxes
F-9
Deferred income tax is provided for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income
tax reporting. A deferred tax asset, subject to a valuation allowance, is recognized for estimated future tax benefits
of tax basis operating losses being carried forward. Uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two step process,
whereby (1) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the
technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition
threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate
settlement with the related tax authority would be recognized. If income tax related interest and penalties were to be
assessed, the Company would charge interest to interest expense, and penalties to general and administrative
expense.
l.
Stock based compensation
The Company measures and records the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award, recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide services in exchange for such award. Compensation cost is recognized for awards granted
and for awards modified, repurchased or cancelled.
m. Net loss per share
Basic earnings or loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings or loss per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potential dilutive shares during the period. Potential dilutive
shares include outstanding stock options and warrants and convertible preferred stock. For periods in which a net
loss is reported, potential dilutive shares are excluded because they are antidilutive. Therefore, basic loss per
share is the same as diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
n. Assumptions and use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management
assumptions and estimates relate to asset impairments, including long lived assets and investments, asset
retirement obligations, and valuation of stock based compensation and warrant derivatives. Uncertainties with
respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated
financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and
assumptions, which could have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Company’s consolidated financial
position and results of operations.
o. Recent accounting pronouncements
In August 2014, the FASB issued a new going concern standard which defines management’s responsibility to
evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to
provide related footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15,
2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Adoption of this update is not anticipated to have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard, Leases (ASC 842). Under the new guidance, a lessee will be
required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months and to disclose
key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial

NOTE 2—MINING PROPERTIES
Montanore:
The Montanore property is located in northwestern Montana and includes 10 patented mining claims and 861
unpatented mining claims. In August 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in the Montanore silver and
copper deposit in Sanders and Lincoln Counties, Montana. The Company received a quitclaim deed from Noranda
Mineral Corp. (“Noranda”) when Noranda elected to withdraw from the project. In December 2002, the Company
received a quitclaim deed to all intellectual property connected with studies that Noranda carried out on the
project.
Advance and Iroquois:
The Advance and Iroquois properties are located in northern Washington State. The Advance property consists of
720 acres of patented mineral rights. Although the Company does not own the overlying surface rights to its
patented mineral rights, it does have right of access to explore and mine. The Iroquois property consists of 62
acres of patented mineral and surface rights.
NOTE 3—CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
The Company has a certificate of deposit pledged as security for a letter of credit to the Montana Department of
Environmental Quality as a reclamation guarantee for the Montanore expansion evaluation program. This
certificate of deposit was in the amount of $1,124,055 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. It bore
interest at the rate of 0.40% as of December 31, 2015 and had a maturity date of January 3, 2016. This certificate of
deposit renews automatically each year and is included with reclamation deposits on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The certificate was renewed on January 3, 2016 in the
amount of $1,124,055 bearing interest at the rate of 0.15% and expires on January 3, 2017.

NOTE 6—ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
$ 528,250
The Company has an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) associated with its underground evaluation program at
the Montanore Project. The ARO resulted from the reclamation and remediation requirements of the Montana
Department of Environmental Quality as outlined in the Company’s permit to carry out the evaluation program.
Estimated reclamation costs were discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate of 4.78% from the time
the Company expects to pay the retirement obligation to the time it incurred the obligation, which is estimated at
25 years. The following table summarizes activity in the Company’s ARO.

Department of Environmental Quality as a reclamation guarantee for the Montanore expansion evaluation program
which is discussed further in note 3.
NOTE 7—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company maintains most of its cash and cash equivalents in one financial institution. To date, the Company
has not experienced a material loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, no
assurance can be provided that access to the Company’s invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted
by adverse conditions in the financial markets. The Company’s total uninsured bank deposit balance totaled
approximately $2,200,000 as of December 31, 2015.
NOTE 8—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Preferred Shares:
During July 2014, the Company sold to one investor 4,000 units consisting of one share of the Company’s Series B
convertible preferred stock, no par value, and a warrant to purchase the Company’s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, at a stated value of $1,000 per unit. Each share of Series B convertible preferred stock is
immediately convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of approximately 1,271 shares of
common stock for each share of Series B convertible preferred stock (equivalent to a conversion price of $0.7866
per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to downward adjustment upon the Company issuing
or selling shares of the Company’s common stock for a per share price less than the applicable conversion rate.
The offering yielded gross proceeds, before offering expenses, of $4.0 million (net proceeds of $3.5 million after
Table of Contents
F-12
deducting placement agent and investor fees and expenses and other offering expenses). The preferred stock has
no voting rights but will entitle the holders to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6% per annum per share,
payable quarterly. The dividends are payable in either cash or common stock at the Company’s discretion. As of
December 31, 2015, 474 shares of the Series B convertible preferred stock had been converted into 602,592 shares
of common stock. Upon the occurrence of certain events that the Company believes are within its control, the
holders of the preferred shares may have the option to redeem or convert them into common shares or increase
the dividend rate to 18% per annum.
Warrants: Each warrant is immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $1.0816 per share and allows the holder
to purchase approximately 636 shares of the Company’s common stock. The warrants are not listed on a national
securities exchange and do not have the rights or privileges of a holder of common stock, including any voting
rights, until the holder exercises the warrant. Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the
warrant, the Company or its successor may be required to purchase the unexercised portion of the warrant from
the warrant holder. The Company does not currently anticipate that this will occur. The following table summarizes
exercise prices and expiration dates of outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of December 31, 2015.

Exercise Price Per Share
$1.0816
Expiration Date
November 30, 2018
Liquidation: Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of the
preferred stock are entitled to receive distributions out of the Company’s assets, whether capital or surplus, before
any distributions may be made on any other outstanding classes of stock. The amount received by holders of the
preferred stock will be equal to the stated value of $1,000 per share of preferred stock plus any accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon, and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing.
Common Shares:
During 2007, the Company sold 2,500,000 common shares in a private placement to one investor. In connection
with the stock sale, the Company entered into a Right of First Refusal agreement (the “ROFR”) which grants a
twenty-year right of first proposal and a right to match third-party proposals, to purchase all or any portion of silver
mined, produced or recovered by the Company in the State of Montana. The ROFR does not apply to trade sales
and spot sales in the ordinary course of business or to forward sales, in each case, for which no upfront payment
is received by the Company.
NOTE 9—STOCK OPTIONS
The Company had four equity incentive plans: the 2003 Stock Option Plan, the 2003 Consultant Stock
Compensation Plan, the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Plans”).
Under all of the equity incentive plans, the option exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value
per share on the date of grant, the stock options are exercisable within ten years from the date of the grant of the
option, and the vesting schedule of the options is at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Under the 2003 Stock Option Plan and Consultant Stock Compensation Plan, both of which expired in February
2014, the Company could grant options to purchase up to 3,000,000 shares and 700,000 shares of authorized and
unissued common stock, respectively. The 2003 Stock Option Plan included both incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options.
Under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”), which provides for the issuance of both incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options and restricted shares to directors, employees and consultants of the
Company, the Company may issue up to 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s authorized but unissued common
stock. No participant is eligible to be granted more than 500,000 common shares during any calendar year.
Table of Contents
F-13
Under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”), the Company may grant options to purchase up
to 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s authorized but unissued common stock, at the discretion of the Board. The
2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive stock options to employees and nonqualified stock options to
directors, employees and consultants of the Company. No participant is eligible to be granted more than 200,000
common shares during any calendar year.

The fair value for each option award is estimated at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model
using the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility for the years presented is based on the historical
volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected life of the option. The risk free rate for periods within
the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The
Company does not foresee the payment of dividends on common stock in the near term.

For the periods presented, the effective income tax rate differed from the expected rate because of the effects of
changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 relate only to corresponding changes in deferred tax assets for
those periods.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had federal tax basis net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $74,200,000 which will expire in various amounts from 2020 through 2035. The Company is subject
to examination of its income tax filings in the United States and various state jurisdictions for the 2012 through
2015 tax years. Within each of these jurisdictions the Company has examined its material tax positions and
determined that they would more likely than not be sustained.

Nature of Operations:
Mines Management, Inc. (the Company) is an Idaho corporation incorporated in 1947. The Company acquires,
explores, and develops mineral properties in North America. The Company’s principal mineral property interest,
the Montanore Project, is held by its wholly owned subsidiaries, Newhi Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. The
Company’s properties, including the Montanore property, are currently in the exploration stage; none of its
properties are currently in production. The Company continues acquiring various permits for the Montanore
Project and is determining its feasibility for development. The Company’s business, operations and financial
condition are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to
continue our business and execute our planned advanced evaluation and delineation drilling program at the
Montanore Project.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, as well as the instructions
to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal
recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been
included.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and
assumptions are inherent in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements;
accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, which could
have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of
operations. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
(a) Going concern
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that
the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is an exploration stage company
and has incurred losses since the inception of its exploration stage. The Company does not have sufficient cash to
fund normal operations through the end of the second quarter of 2016 without raising additional funds. The
Company currently does not have a recurring source of revenue sufficient to fund normal operations and its ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to secure sufficient funding for its future
exploration and working capital requirements, which may include the sale of its equity or debt securities,
borrowing, or the sale of all or part of the Montanore project. There can be no assurance that the Company will
succeed in securing additional funding on terms acceptable to the Company or at all, or in generating future
profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.
(b) Mining properties, exploration and development costs
All exploration expenditures are expensed as incurred. Significant property acquisition payments for active
exploration properties are capitalized, including payments to acquire mineral rights. Once a feasibility study
Table of Contents
F-21
has been completed and approved by management, and a decision is made to put the ore body into production,
expenditures to develop new mines, to define further mineralization in existing ore bodies, and to expand the
capacity of operating mines, are capitalized and amortized on the units of production basis over proven and
probable reserves. The Company charges to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs attributable to
properties sold. Capitalized costs are allocated to properties sold based on the proportion of claims sold to the
claims remaining within the project area.
(c) Fair value measurements
The Company discloses the inputs used to develop the fair value measurements for the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as well as the level within the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
as follows:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at
the measurement date.
Level 2: Quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs either directly related to the asset or liability or derived
principally from corroborated observable market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs due to the fact that there is little or no market activity.
(d) Stock compensation
The Company measures and records the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award, recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide services in exchange for such award. Compensation cost is recognized for awards granted
and for awards modified, repurchased or cancelled.
(e) Net loss per share
Basic earnings or loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings or loss per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potential dilutive shares during the period. Potential dilutive
shares include outstanding stock options and warrants. For periods in which a net loss is reported, potential
dilutive shares are excluded because they are antidilutive. Therefore, basic loss per share is the same as diluted
loss per share for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.
(f) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which defines management’s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for
annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Adoption of this update is expected to affect only the presentation
and disclosures of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard, Leases (ASC 842). Under the new guidance, a lessee will be
required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months and to disclose
key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements at this time.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to simplify
several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact,
Table of Contents
F-22
classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeitures. This guidance is effective for years ending after
December 31, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial
statements.
(g) Subsequent events
The Company evaluated events and transactions subsequent to the balance sheet date of March 31, 2016 for
potential recognition or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2—CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT:
The Company has a certificate of deposit in the amount of $1,124,055 pledged as security for a Letter of Credit to
the Montana Department of Environmental Quality as a reclamation guarantee for the Montanore expansion
evaluation program. This certificate matures on January 3, 2017, bears interest at the rate of 0.15% and renews
automatically each year. This certificate of deposit is included with reclamation deposits on the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
NOTE 3—AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES:
Available-for-sale securities are comprised of common stocks which have been valued using quoted market prices
in active markets. The following table summarizes the Company’s available-for-sale securities:

NOTE 5—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:
The Company maintains most of its cash and cash equivalents in one financial institution. To date, the Company
has not experienced a material loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, no
assurance can be provided that access to the Company’s invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted
by adverse conditions in the financial markets. The total uninsured bank deposit balance on the Company’s bank
statements was approximately $1,279,000 as of March 31, 2016.
NOTE 6—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:
Preferred Shares:
During July 2014, the Company sold to one investor 4,000 units consisting of one share of the Company’s Series B
convertible preferred stock, no par value, and a warrant to purchase the Company’s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, at a stated value of $1,000 per unit. Each share of Series B convertible preferred stock is
immediately convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of approximately 1,271 shares of
common stock for each share of Series B convertible preferred stock (equivalent to a conversion price of $0.7866
per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to downward adjustment upon the Company issuing
or selling shares of the Company’s common stock for a per share price less than the applicable conversion rate.
The offering yielded gross proceeds, before offering expenses, of $4.0 million (net proceeds of $3.5 million after
deducting placement agent and investor fees and expenses and other offering expenses). The preferred stock has
no voting rights but will entitle the holders to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6% per annum per share,
payable quarterly. The dividends are payable in either cash or common stock at the Company’s discretion. As of
March 31, 2016, 906.63 shares of the Series B 6% convertible preferred stock had been converted into 1,152,592
shares of common stock. Upon the occurrence of certain events the Company believes are within its control, the
holders of the preferred shares may have the option to redeem or convert them into common shares or increase
the dividend rate to 18% per annum.
Warrants: Each warrant is immediately exercisable and allows the holder to purchase approximately 636 shares of
the Company’s common stock. The warrants are not listed on a national securities exchange and do not have the
rights or privileges of a holder of common stock, including any voting rights, until the holder exercises the warrant.
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction, as defined in the warrant, the Company or its successor may
be required to purchase the unexercised portion of the warrant from the warrant holder. The following table sets
forth the exercise price and expiration date of the outstanding common stock purchase warrants as of March 31,
2016.
Number of Warrants
Exercise Price Per Share
Expiration Date
4,000
4,000
$ 1.0816
November 30, 2018
Liquidation: Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of the
preferred stock are entitled to receive distributions out of the Company’s assets, whether capital or surplus, before
any distributions may be made on any other outstanding classes of stock. The amount received by holders of the
preferred stock will be equal to the stated value of $1,000 per share of preferred stock plus any accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon, and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing.
Common Shares:
During 2007, the Company sold 2,500,000 common shares in a private placement to one investor. In connection
with the stock sale, the Company entered into a Right of First Refusal agreement (the “ROFR”) which grants a
twenty-year right of first proposal and a right to match third-party proposals, to purchase all or any portion of silver
mined, produced or recovered by the Company in the State of Montana. The ROFR does not apply to trade sales
and spot sales in the ordinary course of business or to forward sales, in each case, for which no upfront payment
is received by the Company.

The fair value for each option award is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Volatility for the periods presented is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the
expected life of the option. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company does not foresee the payment of dividends in
the near term. There were no options granted during the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, there were 784,000 stock options exercised with a weighted
average exercise price of $0.21 and a total intrinsic value of $99,018. During the three months ended March 31,
2015 there were no stock options exercised.

Statements of Operations. Total costs recognized for stock-based compensation awards for services performed by
outside parties were $29,400 and $0 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash
received from options exercised under all share-based payment arrangements during the three months ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015 was $30,000 and $0, respectively.

than the Merger Consideration Closing Value, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any
payment being made in respect thereof, and (b) at the option of Parent, in lieu of paying all or a portion of the

Business Days thereof), Parent shall (1) if any shares of Parent Common Stock are being issued to any holder of
Company Stock Options, cause Parent’s transfer agent to issue such Parent Common Stock, and (2) if any cash

Exchange Ratio and (ii) the number of shares subject to such Warrant, with an

Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock, shares of Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, cash in an
amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to this Article 3 (the certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising such aggregate Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, being referred to hereinafter as the “Stock Merger Exchange Fund”).
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Stock
Merger Exchange Fund. The Stock Merger Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as set
forth in this Agreement.
Section 3.3.2 Exchange Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Stock (the “Certificates”) or of non-certificated shares of Company Stock
represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) (a) a letter of transmittal in customary form, which shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Parties prior to the Effective Time, and (b) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss and, if reasonably requested by Parent,
appropriate bonds in lieu thereof), or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the applicable
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration,
without interest, allocable to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such shares of Company Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent (or in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the applicable procedures set forth in the letter of
Table of Contents
A-12
transmittal), accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration allocable to such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger having a
record date after the Effective Time and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time will be paid
to Persons entitled by reason of the Merger to receive Parent Common Stock until such Persons surrender their
Certificates (or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the applicable procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) as provided in this Section 3.3.2. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the Person in
whose name the Merger Consideration is issued any dividends or other distributions having a record date after the
Effective Time and payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock between the Effective Time and the time of
such surrender. After such surrender, at the appropriate payment date, there shall be paid to the Person in whose
name the Merger Consideration is issued any dividends or other distributions on such Parent Common Stock with
a payment date after such surrender which shall have a record date after the Effective Time. In no event shall the
Persons entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends
or other distributions.
Section 3.3.3 Further Rights in Company Stock. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock.
Section 3.3.4 Termination of Stock Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock on the
day that is six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon.
Section 3.3.5 No Liability. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the Parties shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Stock entitled to payment of the Merger Consideration under this Article 3 for any Merger
Consideration (including any interest or cash in lieu of fractional shares) from the Stock Merger Exchange Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Stock
held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid
or distributed with respect to such Parent Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.
Section 3.3.6 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in the form required by
the Exchange Agent and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made with
respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.
Section 3.3.7 Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or
the Exchange Agent and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock in respect

of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be.
Section 3.4 Fractional Shares. If a holder of shares of Company Stock is entitled to receive any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock based on application of the Exchange Ratio to the total number of shares of Company
Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, such holder will be entitled to receive, at Parent’s
option, either (i) such fractional share or (ii) cash in lieu of such fractional shares based on the Merger
Consideration Closing Value.
Section 3.5 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock outstanding on the
records of the Company prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company Stock represented
thereby except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for transfer or any other reason shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in, and in accordance with, this

amendments thereto, the “S-4”), in which the Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus, in connection
with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information relating to Parent and Merger Sub as the Company
may reasonably request (or as may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and the holders of the Company Stock as Parent may reasonably request in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the S-4 and the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective by the SEC,
the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to the holders of shares of Company Stock and Company Preferred
Stock. Subject to and without limiting the rights of the Company Board pursuant to Section 6.4.2, the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation and the Fairness Opinion. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or S-4, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff, will be made by the Company
or Parent without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will
advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the S-4 has become effective or any
supplement thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information and will, as promptly as practicable, provide to the Company copies of all
correspondence and filings with the SEC with respect to the S-4 and Proxy Statement. The Company will inform
Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and will,
as promptly as practicable, provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and filings with the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information, event or circumstance relating to
any Party, or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, should be discovered by any Party which should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to either the Proxy Statement or the S-4 so that the Proxy Statement or the
S-4 does not contain any untrue statement of material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party discovering such information, event or circumstance shall promptly inform the other Parties
and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information, event
or circumstance shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, if required, disseminated to the holders of
shares of Company Stock and Company Preferred Stock. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken
under state blue sky or other securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger.
Section 6.2.2 Company Shareholders’ Meeting. Subject to Section 6.4, the Company shall take all action necessary
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Stock and any holders of
Company Preferred Stock (the “Company Shareholders’ Meeting”) as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date on which the S-4 is declared effective by the SEC (but taking into account any advance notice or
other requirements under applicable Law) for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval. Subject to
Section 6.4.2, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders’
Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Once the Company Shareholders’ Meeting has been called and noticed, the
Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders’ Meeting without the consent of Parent (other
than (i) in order to obtain a quorum of its shareholders or (ii) as reasonably determined by the Company to comply
with applicable Law).

counsel, advisors, and agents and other representatives (collectively, “Company Representatives”) to: (a) provide

reasonable prior notice to the Company or to the Company Representatives, as applicable, to the properties,
offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the books and records thereof, and (b) furnish,
or cause to be furnished, such reasonably available information concerning the business, properties, Contracts,
assets, Liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company as Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent
Representatives may reasonably request. Any such access and availability shall include access for Parent
Representatives to conduct any environmental site assessments (including sampling) or inspection in respect of
environmental matters at the Company Owned Properties and the Company Leased Premises, physical
inspections of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and contact with the customers, vendors, suppliers
and creditors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as Parent Representatives may reasonably
request. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3.1 shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations
of the Parties to consummate the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would contravene any Law, binding
Contract to which the Company is party or any privacy policy applicable to the Company’s customer information.
Section 6.3.2 Confidentiality and Restrictions. Until the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement
under Section 8.1, with respect to any information (i) disclosed or provided by the Company or any Company
Representative to Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Representative, and (ii) disclosed or provided by Parent or any
Parent Representative to the Company or any Company Representative pursuant to, or in accordance with, this
Agreement, the Parties shall comply with, and shall cause the Parent Representatives and the Company
Representatives, respectively, to comply with the confidentiality provisions (but only the confidentiality provisions
and not any “standstill” provisions) contained in that certain confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of May 8,
2015, between the Company and Parent (as such agreement may be amended from time to time, the
“Confidentiality Agreement”).
Section 6.4 No Solicitation of Transactions.
Section 6.4.1 The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any
Company Representative to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, or, subject to Section 6.4.2, (i) (a) conduct or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, (b) disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, (c) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, or (d) knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party that is
seeking to make, or has made, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) (a) amend or grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries except a confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section 6.4.2 or (b) approve any transaction

principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Takeover Proposal except a confidentiality
agreement as contemplated by Section 6.4.2 (each, a “Company Acquisition Agreement”). Subject to Section 6.4.2,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (v) fail to make, withdraw, amend, modify or
Table of Contents
A-37
materially qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (w) recommend a
Takeover Proposal, (x) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares
of Company Stock within ten Business Days after the commencement of such offer, (y) make any public statement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, or (z) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any
of the foregoing, a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”). The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any
Company Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
third party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information
in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information.
Section 6.4.2 Notwithstanding Section 6.4.1, prior to the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, the Company Board,
directly or indirectly through any Company Representative, may, subject to Section 6.4.3, and provided that the
Company is not then in breach of Section 6.4.1 (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party
that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal in writing that the Company Board
believes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to the third party that has
made such Takeover Proposal non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to an executed confidentiality agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall
be promptly (in all events within 24 hours) provided for informational purposes only to Parent), except that such
agreement need not contain any standstill or similar provision, (iii) following receipt of and on account of a
Superior Proposal, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.4.4, or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take (which
Order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to cause the Company Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. The Company Board shall be permitted to disclose to the Company’s shareholders a position, otherwise in
compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover Proposal, if the Company determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of
applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law.
Section 6.4.3 The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section
6.4.2 unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take
such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after it obtains
Knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of the Company Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal, any
inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, or any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party. In such notice, the Company shall
identify the third party making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and material
terms of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hours
prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the
Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) provide Parent with a list of any non-public
information concerning the Company’s business, present or future performance, financial condition or results of
operations provided to any third party in connection with the
Table of Contents
A-38
receipt by the Company (or any of the Company Representatives) of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or
request and copies of such information to the extent not previously provided to Parent.
Section 6.4.4 Except as set forth in this Section 6.4.4, the Company Board shall not make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company Acquisition
Agreement. At any time prior to the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, in response to a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, take an action otherwise prohibited
under Section 6.4.1(ii) or, subject to compliance with Section 8.1(iii)(b), enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter
into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three
Business Days (the “Notice Period”) before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, taking an
action otherwise prohibited under Section 6.4.1(ii) or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary to enter into) a
Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which
notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board intends
to declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, or take an action otherwise prohibited under Section 6.4.1(ii) or the Company intends to
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of
the proposed Company Acquisition Agreement (which version shall be updated on a prompt basis) and identifies
the third party making such Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such
adjustments (it being agreed that, in the event that after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material
revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including any revision in price, the Notice Period shall, if less than two
Business Days remain before the expiration of such Notice Period, be automatically extended to two Business
Days from the date on which the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that
there may be multiple extensions)); and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with
outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Notice Period in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and that the failure to accept such Superior Proposal would reasonably be
expected to cause the Company Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Section 6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.
Section 6.5.1 General. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including those
contained in this Section 6.5.1), each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to
satisfy all conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary permits, waivers, consents, approvals and actions or
nonactions from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings
with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,
or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents or
waivers from third parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall,
subject to applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions
contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 6.5.1 and (y) supply the other with any information that may
be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking of such actions. Each Party shall promptly inform the other
Parties, as the case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company or Parent receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or
Table of Contents
A-39
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable
Governmental Entity, provide the other Party’s counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made therewith in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.
Section 6.5.2 BCA and Shareholder Rights Plan. The Company shall take all action required to render the BCA, the
Shareholder Rights Plan, and any other shareholder rights or other similar agreement with respect to any
Company Securities, inapplicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 6.5.3 Challenge. In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, the Company shall
cooperate in all respects with Parent and Merger Sub and shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be required to defend, contest or resist any action or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, or to take any action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 6.5.4 Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to,
any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or any portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided that, if requested by Parent, the
Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing
occurs.
Section 6.6 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (a) any material notice or other material communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any
material claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations commenced or, to such Party’s Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (c) any fact, event or
circumstance known to such Party that would cause or constitute, or would reasonably be expected to cause or
constitute, a breach in any material respect of such Party’s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein or would prevent, delay or impede, or would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede,
the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not limit or
Table of Contents
A-40
otherwise affect any remedies available to the Party receiving such notice or prevent or cure any
misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations
of the Parties under this Agreement.
Section 6.7 Public Announcements. Except as set forth in this Section 6.7, the Parties agree that Parent will prepare
and disseminate any press release or public announcement pertaining to the Merger, and shall in good faith
consult with the Company as to the text of any such press release or public announcement, provided that all
decisions with respect to such press releases and public announcements shall ultimately rest with Parent. The
Company shall not issue any press release or public statement pertaining to the Merger without consulting with,
and obtaining the consent of, Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as
required to comply with any Law. The Parties will prepare a joint release for the announcement of the execution of
this Agreement. Glenn Dobbs and Douglas Dobbs, as the representatives of the Company, are authorized to make
public statements substantially as follows without the need to consult with or obtain the prior consent of Parent:
(i) In current market conditions, the Company will have difficulty developing the Montanore Project. The Company
owes it to its shareholders and all stakeholders to be responsible in light of current realities.
(ii) The Montanore Project has received excellent support from the communities of northwest Montana, and is it
important that this project be developed to the highest standards. Parent is a company that can do this.
Section 6.8 NYSE Listing. Parent agrees to authorize for listing on the NYSE the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger, upon official notice of issuance. Parent shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to maintain the listing of the Parent Common Stock on the NYSE.
Section 6.9 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Section 6.9.1 Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in the Company’s Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed on Section
6.9.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during
such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.
Section 6.9.2 For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses,
claims, damages, Liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in connection with any claim brought by a
third party arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in such Indemnified Party’s capacity as such
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, Liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation’s receipt
of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it
is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation’s prior written
consent.
Section 6.9.3 The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain in
effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors’
Table of Contents
A-41
and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies, of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain
as of the Effective Time “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the “Maximum Premium”). The Maximum Premium is set
forth on Section 6.9.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at an
annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, that amount of directors’ and officers’ insurance (or “tail” coverage)
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.
Section 6.9.4 The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9).
Section 6.9.5 In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6.9. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement
is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior to,
or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.
Section 6.10 State Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and their respective boards of directors shall take all reasonable action necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.
Section 6.11 Section 16(b) Exemption. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including “derivative securities” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act))
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or
executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

The Board of Directors
Mines Management, Inc.
905 West Riverside Ave.
Spokane, Washington 99201
To the Members of the Board of Directors:
Canaccord Genuity Corp. (“Canaccord Genuity”, “we” or “us”) understands that Mines Management, Inc., an Idaho
corporation (“Mines Management” or the “Company”), Hecla Mining Company, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”),
and HL Idaho Corp., an Idaho corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”),
propose to enter into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft dated May 20,
2016 (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the “Merger”) and as a result of the Merger the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and
each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Company Stock”), other
than (x) shares of Company Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any subsidiary of Buyer or Merger Sub, (y) shares
of Company Stock in the treasury of the Company, and (z) shares of Company Stock held by any subsidiary of the
Company (holders described in the foregoing classes (x), (y) and (z) being referred to as, “Excluded Holders”), will
be converted into the right to receive 0.2218 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of Parent common stock, par value
$0.25 per share (“Parent Common Stock”). Parent has also agreed to lend up to $2.3 million to the Company at an
interest rate of LIBOR plus five percent to bridge the Company’s financial position through the closing of the
Merger. The terms and conditions of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement
(together, the “Transaction”) are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
The Company has retained Canaccord Genuity to act as a financial advisor to the board of directors (the “Board”)
of Mines Management to provide advice and assistance in evaluating the Transaction, including, the preparation
and delivery of Canaccord Genuity’s written opinion (the “Opinion”) as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the Exchange Ratio under the Agreement to the holders of shares of Company Stock (other than Excluded
Holders) (the “Stockholders”).
Engagement
Canaccord Genuity was formally engaged by the Company through an agreement between the Company and
Canaccord Genuity (the “Engagement Agreement”) dated March 17, 2016, as amended on April 18, 2016 and
May 19, 2016. The Engagement Agreement provides the terms upon which Canaccord Genuity has agreed to act
as a financial advisor to the Board in connection with the Transaction during the term of the Engagement
Agreement (the “Engagement”). The terms of the Engagement Agreement provide that Canaccord Genuity is to be
paid a fee for delivering this Opinion, no portion of which is conditional upon this Opinion being favourable
Table of Contents
B-1
or that is contingent upon completion of the Transaction. In addition, Canaccord Genuity is to be paid an additional
fee for other services provided, a substantial portion of which is contingent on a change of control that relates to
the Company being completed or a change of control that relates to the Company that is not supported by the
Board being fended off. In addition, Canaccord Genuity is to be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and to be indemnified by the Company in certain circumstances.
Canaccord Genuity consents to the inclusion of the Opinion in its entirety and a summary thereof in the proxy
statement/prospectus which will be mailed to the Mines Management stockholders (the “Proxy Statement”) in
connection with the Transaction, and to the filing thereof, as necessary, by the Company with the securities
commissions or similar regulatory authorities in each province of Canada, in the United States and with the
Toronto Stock Exchange, the NYSE and NYSE MKT, provided the contents of the Proxy Statement comply with
applicable law (subject to the terms of the Engagement Agreement) and are approved in writing by Canaccord
Genuity, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably.
Credentials of Canaccord Genuity Corp.
Canaccord Genuity is the international capital markets division of its parent, Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., and
has investment banking operations including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, corporate
restructuring, financial advisory services, institutional and retail equity sales and trading and investment research
through our offices in Canada, the US, the UK, France, Ireland, Hong Kong, China, Australia and Dubai. The
Opinion expressed herein represents the opinion of Canaccord Genuity as a firm. The form and content herein
have been approved for release by a committee of officers and directors of Canaccord Genuity, each of whom is
experienced in merger, acquisition, divestiture and fairness opinion matters.
Independence of Canaccord Genuity Corp.
Neither Canaccord Genuity, nor any of its affiliates, is an affiliate, insider or associate (as those terms are defined
under applicable Canadian securities laws or an associate or an affiliate (as those terms are defined in the rules
promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of the Company or Parent, or any of their
respective associates or affiliates. Prior to the Engagement, Canaccord Genuity had not been engaged to provide
any financial advisory services nor had it participated in any financings involving the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective associates or affiliates, within the past two years. There are no understandings, agreements or
commitments between Canaccord Genuity and the Company or Parent, or any of their respective associates or
affiliates with respect to any future business dealings. However, Canaccord Genuity may in the future, in the
ordinary course of its business, perform financial advisory or investment banking services for the Company,
Parent, or any of their respective associates or affiliates.
Canaccord Genuity acts as a trader and dealer, both as principal and agent, in major financial markets and, in such
capacity, may have had, or may in the future have positions in the securities of the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective associates or affiliates and, from time to time, may have executed or may execute transactions on
behalf of such companies or clients for which it received or may receive compensation. As an investment dealer,
Canaccord Genuity conducts research on securities and may, in the ordinary course of its business, provide
research reports and investment advice to its clients on investment matters, including with respect to the
Company, Parent or the Transaction.
Scope of Review
Canaccord Genuity has not been asked to, nor does Canaccord Genuity offer any opinion as to the terms of the
Transaction (other than in respect of the fairness from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to the
Stockholders) or the form of agreements or documents related to the Transaction.
Table of Contents
B-2
In connection with rendering the Opinion, we have reviewed and relied upon or carried out, among other things, the
following:
1.
certain publicly available business and historical financial information relating to Mines Management and Parent;
2.
access to the Mines Management confidential dataroom;
3.
draft Mines Management interim financial statements and confidential forecasts;
4.
technical report prepared by Christopher Kaye (B. Eng.) and Geoffrey Challiner (B. Sc.) titled “Technical Report
Preliminary Economic Assessment Montanore Project Montana, USA” with an effective date of February 3, 2011;
5. Mines Management Company Disclosure Schedule;
6.
discussions with members of the senior management of the Company concerning the business and financial
prospects of the Company;
7.
discussions with the Company’s legal counsel;
8.
9.
discussions with members of the senior management of Parent concerning the business and financial prospects
of Parent;
certain publicly available financial information and other data relating to the business and financial prospects of
Parent;
10. publicly available financial and stock market data with respect to certain other companies we believe to be
generally relevant;
11. publicly available financial terms of certain other transactions we believe to be generally relevant compared to the
Transaction;
12. current and historical market prices of the shares of Company Stock and Parent common stock;
13.
the form of the Agreement and other related agreements; and
14. such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other information, as we deemed
necessary or appropriate.
Canaccord Genuity has not, to the best of its knowledge, been denied access by the Company or any of its
affiliates to any information under its or their control requested by Canaccord Genuity. Canaccord Genuity did not
meet with the auditors of Mines Management or Parent and has assumed the accuracy and fair presentation of, and
relied upon, the audited consolidated financial statements of Mines Management and Parent and the reports of the
auditors thereon.
Assumptions and Limitations
Canaccord Genuity has not prepared a formal valuation or appraisal of the Company or any of its securities, assets
or liabilities and has not been provided with any such valuation or appraisal. This Opinion should not be construed
as providing a formal valuation or appraisal of the Company or any of its securities, assets or liabilities. Canaccord
Genuity has, however, conducted such analyses as it considered necessary in the circumstances. In addition, this
Opinion is not, and should not be construed as, advice as to the price at which the Company Stock may trade at
any future date. Canaccord Genuity was similarly not engaged to review any legal, tax or accounting aspects of the
Transaction or otherwise in connection with the Transaction.
As provided for under the Engagement Agreement, Canaccord Genuity has relied, without independent
verification, upon the completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of all of the financial and other information,
data, advice, opinions or representations with respect to the Company and Parent obtained by it from public
Table of Contents
B-3
sources or otherwise provided to us by or on behalf of the Company and its agents and advisors, directly or
indirectly, orally or in writing, or otherwise obtained pursuant to the Engagement Agreement (collectively, the
“Information”) and has assumed the Information did not omit to state any material fact or any fact necessary to be
stated to make that Information not misleading. The Opinion is conditional upon such completeness, accuracy and
fair presentation of the Information. Subject to the exercise of professional judgment and except as expressly
described herein, we have not attempted to verify independently the completeness, accuracy or fair presentation of
any of the Information.
With respect to financial models, forecasts, projections and estimates provided to Canaccord Genuity and used in
the analysis supporting the Opinion, we note that projecting future results of any company, including the Company
and Parent, is inherently subject to uncertainty. We have assumed, with the approval of the Company, that such
financial models, forecasts, projections and estimates have been prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and reasonable judgment of management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby,
and in rendering the Opinion we express no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts, projections,
estimates or assumptions on which they are based.
Senior officers of the Company have represented to Canaccord Genuity in their capacity as senior officers in the
Representation Letter delivered to Canaccord Genuity as of the date hereof, among other things, that: (i) the
Information provided to Canaccord Genuity by the Company, its affiliates or its or their representatives for the
purpose of the engagement under the Engagement Agreement taken as a whole was, at the date the Information
was provided to Canaccord Genuity, and is, complete, true and correct in all material respects and did not and
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact in respect of the Company, its affiliates and the
Transaction and did not and does not omit to state a material fact in relation to the Company, its affiliates and the
Transaction, in each case necessary to make the Information not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which the Information was presented; and (ii) since the dates on which the Information was provided to Canaccord
Genuity, other than as disclosed in the public disclosure record of the Company, there has been no material
change, financial or otherwise, in the financial condition, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), business,
operations or prospects of the Company or any of its affiliates and no material change has occurred in the
Information or any part thereof which would have or which would reasonably be expected to have a material effect
on the Opinion.
In preparing the Opinion, Canaccord Genuity has made several assumptions, including among other things, that all
the conditions required to complete the Transaction described in the Agreement will be satisfied or waived, that all
necessary consents, permissions, approvals, exemptions or orders required from third parties or governmental
authorities will be obtained without adverse condition or qualification, that the Transaction will proceed as
scheduled and without material additional costs to the Company or liabilities of the Company to third parties, that
the procedures being followed to implement the Transaction are valid and effective and that the disclosure to be
provided in any public filed disclosure document relating to the Transaction with respect to Mines Management
and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the Transaction will be accurate in all material respects and comply with
applicable securities laws.
This Opinion is rendered on the basis of securities markets, economic, financial and general business conditions
prevailing as at the date hereof and the condition and prospects, financial and otherwise, of the Company and its
affiliates as they were reflected in the Information. In its analyses and in preparing this Opinion, Canaccord Genuity
made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Canaccord Genuity.
This Opinion has been provided for the use of and is to be relied upon by the Board. This Opinion is given as of the
date hereof and Canaccord Genuity disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in
any fact or matter affecting this Opinion that may come or be brought to Canaccord Genuity’s attention after the
date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that there is any material change in any fact or
Table of Contents
B-4
matter affecting this Opinion after the date hereof, Canaccord Genuity reserves the right to change, modify or
withdraw this Opinion with effect after the date hereof, but does not assume any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm this Opinion and Canaccord Genuity expressly disclaims any such obligation.
Canaccord Genuity believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, and that selecting portions of the
analyses or the factors considered by it without considering all factors and analyses together, could create a
misleading view of the process underlying this Opinion. The preparation of an opinion is a complex process and is
not necessarily susceptible to partial analyses or summary description. Any attempt to do so could lead to undue
emphasis on any particular factor or analysis. This Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board or
any Stockholder as to whether the Stockholders should vote in favour of the Transaction.
Conclusion
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and such other matters as we consider relevant, Canaccord Genuity is of
the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Stockholders.
Yours very truly,
/s/ Canaccord Genuity Corp.

5. The parties have complied with and, if applicable, will continue to comply with, the covenants contained in the
Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the proxy statement/prospectus.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and
limitations stated in the Registration Statement and the proxy statement/prospectus constituting part of the
Registration Statement, we are of the opinion that the Merger will qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
“reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
In addition to the matters set forth above, this opinion is subject to the exceptions, limitations and qualifications set
forth below.
1. This opinion represents our best judgment regarding the application of U.S. federal income tax laws arising
under the Code, existing judicial decisions, administrative regulations and published rulings and procedures, but
does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. We express no opinion as to U.S.
federal, state, local, foreign, or other tax consequences, other than as set forth herein. Our opinion is not binding
upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there is no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will
not assert a contrary position. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that future legislative, judicial or
administrative changes, on either a prospective or retroactive basis, would not adversely affect the validity of the
conclusions stated herein. Nevertheless, we undertake no responsibility to advise you of any new developments in
the application or interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws.
2. No opinion is expressed as to any transaction other than the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement or to
any matter whatsoever, including the Merger, if, to the extent relevant to our opinion, either all the transactions
described in the Merger Agreement are not consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
and without waiver or breach of any provisions thereof or all of the factual statements, representations, warranties
and assumptions upon which we have relied, including in the Registration Statement, the proxy
statement/prospectus and the Representation Letters, are not true and accurate at all relevant times.
We are furnishing this opinion in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement and this opinion is not to
be relied upon for any other purpose without our prior written consent. We consent to the filing of this opinion as
an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm name therein under the caption “Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.” In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within
the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.
Very truly yours,

(d) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder, the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or compliance by Shareholder with any of the provisions hereof will conflict
with or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under any
provision, of any trust agreement, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
agreement, instrument or Law applicable to Shareholder or to Shareholder’s property or assets.
(e) No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or

order for Shareholder to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.]4
3. Agreement to Vote Shares; Irrevocable Proxy.
(a) Shareholder agrees during the term of this Agreement to vote the Shares, and to cause any holder of record of
Shares to vote: (i) in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, at every meeting of the shareholders of the
Company at which such matters are considered and at every adjournment or postponement thereof; (ii) against (1)
any Takeover Proposal, (2) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement which could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company under the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder under this Agreement and (3) any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely
affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the fulfillment of Parent’s, the Company’s or Merger
Sub’s conditions under the Merger Agreement or change in any manner the voting rights of any class of shares of
the Company (including any amendments to the Charter Documents of the Company).
(b) Shareholder hereby appoints Parent and any designee of Parent, and each of them individually, its proxies and
attorneys-in-fact, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote during the term of this Agreement with
respect to the Shares in accordance with Section 3(a). This proxy and power of attorney is given to secure the
performance of the duties of Shareholder under this Agreement. Shareholder shall take such further action or
execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. This proxy and power of
attorney granted by Shareholder shall be irrevocable during the term of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be
coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all prior proxies
granted by Shareholder with respect to the Shares. The power of attorney granted by Shareholder herein is a
durable power of attorney and shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy, death or incapacity of Shareholder. The
proxy and power of attorney granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.
4. No Voting Trusts or Other Arrangement. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not, and will not permit any
entity under Shareholder’s control to, deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to
the Shares or subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Shares other than
agreements entered into with Parent.
5. Transfer and Encumbrance. Shareholder agrees that during the term of this Agreement, Shareholder will not,
directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber
(“Transfer”) any of the Shares or enter into any Contract, option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to,
a Transfer of, any of the Shares or Shareholder’s voting or economic interest therein. Any attempted Transfer of
Shares or any interest therein in violation of this Section 5 shall be null and void. This Section 5 shall not prohibit a
Transfer of the Shares by Shareholder [to any member of Shareholder’s immediate family, or to a trust for the
benefit of Shareholder or any member of Shareholder’s immediate family, or upon the death of

Shareholder]/[to an Affiliate of Shareholder]5; provided, that a Transfer referred to in this sentence shall be
permitted only if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in a writing, reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to Parent, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement.
6. Additional Shares. Shareholder agrees that all shares of Company Stock that Shareholder purchases, acquires
the right to vote or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act[, but
excluding shares of Company Stock underlying unexercised Derivative Securities]6) of after the execution of this
Agreement shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute Shares for all purposes of this
Agreement.
7. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date
on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.
8. No Agreement as Director or Officer. Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in
Shareholder’s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (if Shareholder holds such
office), and nothing in this Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by Shareholder in
Shareholder’s capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement,
and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (b) will be construed to prohibit,
limit or restrict Shareholder from exercising Shareholder’s fiduciary duties as an officer or director to the Company
or its Shareholders.
9. Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the
damage to the other party if a party hereto fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by this Agreement,
that every such obligation is material and that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will not have an
adequate remedy at law or damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy, in addition to remedies at law or damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not
oppose the seeking of such relief on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law. Each party
hereto agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with the other party’s seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.
10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, and no provisions hereof may be
modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any
provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by such party, nor shall
any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.
