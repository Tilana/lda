NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Yojee Limited (Yojee)is a company focused on developing a sharing-economy based logistics technology through 
the creation of the Yojee delivery network and secure blockchain technology platform (Platform), initially targeting 
the Asia-Pacific region. The Platform will be an international collaborative economy technology platform aiming to 
provide seamless and efficient, on-demand movement of goods and services where and when they are needed. 
Yojee  was  founded  on  the  basis  that  opportunities  in  e-commerce  are  growing  at  a  rapid  rate,  the  global 
population  is  embracing  the  sharing-economy  and  the  traditional  logistics  model  provides  an  opportunity  for 
implementation of these newer technologies, in particular in jurisdictions with immature transport networks.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These  unaudited  preliminary  consolidated  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements  which 
have been prepared in accordance with the  Corporations Act 2001, Accounting Standards and Interpretations, 
and comply with other requirements of the law. 
 
The unaudited preliminary financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of the Company 
and its controlled entity (collectively the Group). The unaudited preliminary financial statements were authorised 
for issue by the directors on 31 August 2016. 
 
2.1.1
Basis of preparation
Financial position
Statement of compliance
The financial statements comprise the unaudited preliminary consolidated financial statements of the Group. For 
the purposes of preparing the unaudited preliminary consolidated financial statements, the Company is a for-profit 
entity. Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these unaudited preliminary financial statements 
are presented below. They have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated. 
 
2.1.2 
 
These  unaudited  preliminary  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements  which  have  been 
prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations of the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (AAS Board) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
 
Australian  Accounting Standards  (AASBs) set out accounting policies that the  AAS Board has concluded would 
result in a financial report containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and conditions 
to which they apply. Compliance with AASBs ensures that the unaudited preliminary financial statements and notes 
also comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB. 
 
2.1.3 
 
The unaudited preliminary consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and are 
based on historical costs modified, where applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current 
assets,  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities.  Historical  cost  is  generally  based  on  the  fair  values  of  the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
 
The  unaudited  preliminary  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which 
contemplates the continuity of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business. 
 
The Group has incurred a net loss after tax for the year ended 30 June 2016 of $6,216,430 and a net cash outflow 
from  operations  of  $657,042.  At  30  June  2016,  the  Group  has  net  current  assets  of  $3,078,305  and  net  equity  of 
$3,019,581. 
 
Based on a cash flow forecast, the Group has sufficient working capital to fund its mandatory obligations for the 
period ending 12 months from the date of this report. Should the Group be unable to generate sufficient funds from 
its operations or it is unable to raise sufficient capital, the planned operations and software development may have 
to be amended. The Board is confident in securing sufficient additional capital to fund the operations of the Group. 
The Directors consider the going concern basis of preparation to be appropriate based on forecast cash flows and 
confidence in raising additional funds.

Reverse acquisition
2.1.4 
 
Yojee Limited (formerly Southern Crown Resources Limited) (Yojee) is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. 
The Company completed the 100% legal acquisition of Send Yojee Pty Ltd (Send Yojee) and its 100% wholly owned 
Singaporean subsidiary company Yojee Pte Ltd on 14 June 2016. 
 
Send Yojee (the legal subsidiary) was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes as it has obtained control 
over the operations  of the legal acquirer  Yojee  (accounting subsidiary).  Accordingly,  the unaudited preliminary 
consolidated financial statements of Yojee have been prepared as a continuation of the financial statements of 
Send Yojee. Send Yojee (as the deemed acquirer) has accounted for the acquisition of Yojee from 14 June 2016. 
There is no comparative information presented in the unaudited preliminary consolidated financial statements  for 
Send Yojee due to incorporation of the entity during the financial period. 
 
The impact of the reverse acquisition on each of the primary statements is as follows:

The consolidated statement of comprehensive income:
o
for the year to 30 June 2016 comprises of approximately nine months of Send Yojee and the period 
from 14 June 2016 to 30 June 2016 of Yojee.


The consolidated statement of financial position:
o  as at 30 June 2016 represents both Send Yojee and Yojee.
The consolidated statement of changes in equity:
o
for the year ended 30 June 2016 comprises  Send Yojee's  loss for the year and transactions  with 
equity holders for twelve months. It also comprises Yojee transactions within equity from 14 June 
2016 to 30 June 2016 and the equity value of Send Yojee and Yojee at 30 June 2016. The number 
of shares on issue at year end represent those of Yojee only.

The consolidation statement of cash flows:
o
for the year ended 30 June 2016 comprises the cash balances Yojee and Send Yojee at 30 June 
2016.
Use of estimates and judgments
2.1.5 
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,  estimates and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  policies  and  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  income  and 
expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors that 
are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  of  making  the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. 
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
 
2.1.6  Comparative figures 
 
Where required by AASBs comparative  figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation for 
the current financial year. 
 
2.1.7 
 
As at reporting date, the assets and liabilities of all controlled entities have been incorporated into the unaudited 
preliminary  consolidated  financial  statements  as  well  as  their  results  for  the  year  then  ended.  Where  controlled 
entities have entered the Consolidated Group during the year, their operating results have been included from the 
date control was obtained.

The steps for calculating of the acquisition account items reflect the following rationale:


Send Yojee is deemed to make a share-based payment to acquire the existing shareholders’ interest in the 
net assets of Yojee Limited (formerly Southern Crown Resources Limited) (Yojee) following the Acquisition;  
the total consideration deemed to be paid by Send Yojee at the Acquisition (by way of the sharebased 
payment) is calculated as follows:
1. Nature of deemed consideration – shares in Yojee;  
2. The assessed value of Yojee shares deemed to be issued by reference to the fair value of Yojee assets acquired 
at date of reinstatement with ASX on 14 June 2016;  
3. Fair value of Yojee assets acquired (no. of Yojee shares on issue prior to Acquisition been 64,501,482 multiplied by 
the fair value of each Yojee share at the closing price on reinstatement on ASX of $0.04 (4 cents).  
4. Fair value of Yojee assets acquired (no. of Yojee shares issued on completion of  Acquisition being 160,498,518 
multiplied by the fair value of each Yojee share at the closing price on reinstatement on ASX of $0.04 (4 cents). 
As the shares of Yojee were not being traded at the time of the Acquisition (the shares were suspended pending 
the outcome of the  transaction) there was no active market for those shares.   Accordingly the fair value of the 
shares was determined as 4 cents per share, this being the closing trade price of Yojee Limited shares as at the date 
of reinstatement to ASX. 
 
The  total  consideration  deemed  to  be  paid  by  Send  Yojee  is  then  compared  to  the  net  assets  of  Yojee  at  the 
Acquisition.  The  excess  of  the  consideration  paid  over  the  value  of  the  net  assets  of  Yojee  is  expensed  in  the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a listing fee expense (Calculations seen below).
