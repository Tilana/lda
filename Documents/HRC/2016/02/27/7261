<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Liberia was held at the 2nd meeting, on 4 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Liberia was headed by the Minister of Gender, Children and Social 
</p>
<p>Protection, Julia M. Duncan-Cassell. At its 10th meeting, held on 8 May 2015, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on Liberia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Liberia: Gabon, the Russian Federation and 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam. 
</p>

<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Liberia: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/LBR/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/LBR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/LBR/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United 
</p>
<p>States of America was transmitted to Liberia through the troika. These questions are 
</p>
<p>available on the extranet of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Liberia welcomed the opportunity to interact with other member 
</p>
<p>States and to discuss how Liberia may continue to move forward in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. It added that Liberia found this dialogue extremely helpful in 
</p>
<p>identifying key areas for the protection and promotion of human rights in the country.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that Liberia had made a number of notable achievements since 
</p>
<p>its first universal periodic review, four years earlier. In 2011, the country had held its 
</p>
<p>second peaceful presidential and legislative elections since the end of the civil war in 2003. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation noted that the Government had developed a national security strategy 
</p>
<p>in light of the anticipated drawdown of the United Nations Mission in Liberia. Enhancing 
</p>
<p>human rights compliance within the security sector was an integral part of that strategy. 
</p>
<p>Ensuring access to justice was also a key component, provided for through the progressive 
</p>
<p>establishment of regional hubs for justice and security, which would enhance service 
</p>
<p>delivery, particularly outside Monrovia, the capital city. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation mentioned that Liberia had also implemented a number of policies to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the rule of law and foster the protection of human rights. These included the 
</p>
<p>Strategic Roadmap for National Healing, Peacebuilding and Reconciliation, which 
</p>
<p>contained recommendations made by the country&#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission; 
</p>
<p>the Agenda for Transformation, which prioritized the development of the justice sector and 
</p>
<p>addressed cross-cutting issues impacting on human rights and vulnerable groups; and the </p>


<p>National Human Rights Action Plan, which provided for the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s regional and international human rights obligations and of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>9. With regard to the ratification of human rights instruments, the delegation noted that 
</p>
<p>in 2012 Liberia had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and 
</p>
<p>in 2014 it had ratified the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the Kampala Convention and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and 
</p>
<p>Governance.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that Liberia was taking steps to address its backlog in treaty 
</p>
<p>reporting, and was currently in good standing with regard to reports due under the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
</p>
<p>of Discrimination against Women. It added that the common core document was in the 
</p>
<p>process of finalization. The Government had also developed a national strategy on meeting 
</p>
<p>treaty obligations, including treaty reporting, to address the matter of other outstanding 
</p>
<p>reports. Moreover, the delegation emphasized that the process of issuing a standing 
</p>
<p>invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council had begun. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation explained that the independent national human rights institution had 
</p>
<p>trained a number of human rights monitors, and had begun implementation of the Palava 
</p>
<p>Hut Programme, a critical initiative in the Strategic Roadmap for National Healing, 
</p>
<p>Peacebuilding and Reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>12. However, the delegation recognized that many challenges lay ahead in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of human rights. As a fragile society, Liberia faced additional challenges as 
</p>
<p>it strived to meet the needs of its citizens. Most recently, the outbreak of Ebola had posed 
</p>
<p>the most serious threat to national stability since the end of the 14-year civil war. The 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that the impacts of Ebola had been widespread, hitting the economy and 
</p>
<p>the health-care infrastructure particularly hard. It added that Liberia was only a few days 
</p>
<p>away from being declared Ebola-free, and was cautiously optimistic that the worst had 
</p>
<p>passed.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation stated that, as Liberia was beginning to emerge from one of its 
</p>
<p>greatest crises in recent memory, it looked forward to engaging with renewed vigour in the 
</p>
<p>process of enhancing human rights protection. It concluded by saying that Liberia looked 
</p>
<p>forward to the continued support of the international community as it strived to implement 
</p>
<p>its human rights obligations.  
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>carried out to improve women&#8217;s access to justice. It noted that Liberia had established

</p>
<p>education and awareness into the security sector. Zimbabwe made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>such as the overall development strategy, the strategy of consolidation of peace and

<p>Rights and the creation of a unit to tackle sexual and gender-based violence. Algeria made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>17. Angola commended Liberia on the legislative policy measures taken since its last

</p>
<p>19. Australia commended Liberia on its transition from civil war to peace and on its

</p>
<p>accession to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, its Constitution had not

</p>
<p>21. Botswana appreciated the adoption of the Children&#8217;s Law and the process of 
</p>
<p>harmonizing domestic legislation with international obligations. However, it remained 
</p>
<p>concerned by the high level of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as by reports of 
</p>
<p>high rates of maternal and infant mortality, particularly in rural areas. Botswana made

</p>
<p>its efforts to promote equality between men and women, and its fight against violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls, particularly female genital mutilation. Canada made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Chad stated that Liberia had made significant progress since its first review, but that 
</p>
<p>unfortunately, difficulties due to the Ebola epidemic had curbed that progress. Chad 
</p>
<p>congratulated Liberia on its establishment of institutions in the field of human rights and on 
</p>
<p>its ratification of international and regional human rights instruments. Chad made 
</p>
<p>recommendations.

<p>detention of human rights defenders. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire thanked Liberia for its report, which summarized not only measures 
</p>

</p>
<p>connected to their effective implementation. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted the progress under way in

</p>
<p>54. The delegation of Liberia explained that a larger delegation, headed by the Minister

</p>
<p>special court had been established for trials relating to rape and crimes of sexual and

</p>
<p>laws would be reviewed in the ongoing constitutional process.

</p>
<p>made progress and was committed to enhancing the system and strengthening access to 
</p>
<p>justice, particularly via the establishment of the regional hubs for justice and security. As 
</p>
<p>mentioned earlier, the delegation stated that the standing invitation to the special procedures 
</p>
<p>was being prepared and should be issued very soon. 
</p>
<p>58. With regard to Ebola, the delegation said that the Government had developed an 
</p>
<p>economic stabilization and recovery plan that addressed all the relevant issues, in particular 
</p>
<p>the health-care infrastructure, education, and social protection and welfare. It hoped that the 
</p>
<p>plan could be shared with the Member States that had concerns about the post-Ebola period.
