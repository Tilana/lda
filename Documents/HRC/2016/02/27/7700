<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil,

</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on minority 
issues, Rita Izs&#225;k 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report provides an update on the activities of the mandate holder since 
submission of her previous report. The Independent Expert includes a thematic discussion 
on &#8220;Ensuring the inclusion of minority issues in post-2015 development agendas&#8221;. As 
momentum builds towards the shaping of new global development goals, addressing 
inequalities has emerged as a core area of discussion and consultation. This gives greater 
attention to the issues of women, those with disabilities, the elderly and vulnerable groups. 
However the Independent Expert considers that the issues of minorities remain relatively 
poorly reflected in the emerging discussions, both internationally and nationally. She urges 
greater and systematic attention to disadvantaged minorities who constitute hundreds of 
millions of the poorest and most socially and economically marginalized and excluded 
people globally. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert identifies the need for the new global development agenda 
to include specific goals relating to addressing inequality and promoting social inclusion, 
which include specific requirements and targets focused on activities to address the 
situations of disadvantaged minority groups. Human rights-based approaches to 
development are essential and must give greater attention to the promotion and protection 
of minority rights, which offers an important path to development for national, ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Independent Expert on minority issues was established by the 
Commission on Human Rights in 2005 (resolution 2005/79), and extended by Human 
Rights Council (resolution 7/6). On 24 March 2011, the Council decided to renew the 
mandate of the Independent Expert for an additional three years (resolution 16/6) and 
Rita Izs&#225;k was appointed mandate holder and assumed her functions on 1 August 2011. The 
Independent Expert is required, inter alia, to promote implementation of the Declaration on 
the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, 
including through consultation with Governments. 
</p>
<p>2. In chapter II of this report, the Independent Expert provides a brief overview of her 
activities since the submission of her previous report (A/HRC/22/49). In chapters III and IV 
she focuses on ensuring the inclusion of minority issues in post-2015 development agendas 
and chapter V provides a series of conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Independent Expert 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Thematic activities and reports 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Participation in conferences and consultations  
</i>3. In her workplan presented in 2012 to the Council, the Independent Expert committed 
herself to pay particular attention to the rights of religious minorities in 2013 and beyond, 
recognizing the general lack of dedicated attention given to their minority rights beyond 
guaranteeing their freedom or religion or belief. The Independent Expert also recognized 
that this is a subject of considerable global interest and therefore decided to dedicate the 
sixth Forum on Minority Issues to the rights of religious minorities. 
</p>
<p>4. She sent a questionnaire to all Member States on 25 April 2013 on measures to 
ensure the rights and security of religious minorities. The questionnaire focused on the 
identification of positive practices for the protection and promotion of<b> </b>the rights of religious 
minorities, including initiatives in the area<b> </b>of interfaith dialogue and the promotion of 
harmonious relations between different faith groups. She thanks responding States 
including: Argentina, Austria, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, 
Denmark, Estonia, Guatemala, Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Jordan, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Oman, Pakistan, 
Paraguay, Poland, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, 
Thailand, Ukraine, and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>5. On 6 June 2013, the Independent Expert convened an Expert Group Meeting 
&#8220;Beyond Belief: The rights and security of religious minorities&#8221;<b> </b>in Geneva. It was attended 
by national and international experts in the field of religious minority rights from different 
regions, including Heiner Bielefeldt, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
(via video-conference). The objective was to inform her report to be submitted to the 
General Assembly&#8217;s sixty-eighth session. Expert speakers presented on issues that included: 
key concepts and standards; identification of challenges and violations, including non-
discrimination, recognition and security; positive practices; the security of religious 
minorities in conflict and post-conflict situations; and strengthening responses to rights 
violations against religious minorities.  </p>


<p>6. The Independent Expert presented her annual report to the General Assembly 
(A/68/268) at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly on 23 October 2013. The 
report had a thematic focus on minority rights-based approaches to the protection and 
promotion of the rights of religious minorities. Therein, the Independent Expert highlighted 
the fact that the rights of religious minorities are poorly implemented in practice and in all 
regions they face discrimination, social exclusion, marginalization and often harassment, 
persecution and violence. The rights of religious minorities go beyond freedom of religion 
and belief. The wider group rights of religious minorities are frequently neglected by 
Governments. Minority rights require positive actions on the part of States based on the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities. Legislation, policies and specific measures are required to create 
substantive equality in all areas of cultural, economic, political, public, religious and social 
life. 
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert acknowledges the important work of the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief and welcomes his 2013 report to the Council on religious 
minorities (A/HRC/22/51). On 28 October, she (together with the Special Rapporteur) was 
a panellist in a side event at the General Assembly organized by the Government of 
Canada, titled &#8220;International Efforts to Promote and Protect Freedom of Religion or Belief: 
Where Can The United Nations Play an Effective Role?&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Linguistic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Independent Expert&#8217;s previous report to the Council (A/HRC/22/49) in 2013 
discussed the rights of, and challenges experienced by, linguistic minorities. She 
highlighted the warning that half of the world&#8217;s estimated 6,000 plus languages are under 
threat, and urged Governments to take necessary steps to protect minority communities and 
their language heritage (para. 39). She has continued to collect information on good 
practices from all regions relating to such issues as: threats to the existence of minority 
languages and linguistic minorities; recognition of minority languages and linguistic rights; 
minority languages in public life; minority languages in education, the media, public 
administration and judicial fields; and provision of information and services in minority 
languages.  
</p>
<p>9. On 13 March 2013, the Independent Expert convened a roundtable discussion on 
linguistic minorities with Member States, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
representatives of academia and linguistic minority communities, to identify initiatives that 
have proved successful in ensuring the rights of linguistic minorities. Over 60 participants 
shared their experiences and views, including regarding future possibilities for the work of 
United Nations mechanisms in the field of linguistic minority issues globally. In 2013, the 
Independent Expert began work to prepare a practical guide and a compilation of effective 
practices to assist policymakers and others. She plans to publish it online by mid-2014, 
following further consultation. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Minority women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert participated in conferences on the issues of minority women 
and girls. She used her participation to raise awareness about mechanisms in the United 
Nations human rights system for the protection of women and how they can be used 
effectively, and to introduce the recommendations of the fourth session of the Forum on 
Minority Issues that focused on the rights of minority women and girls. She served as the 
General Rapporteur of the Fourth International Conference of Roma Women in Helsinki on 
16 and 17 September 2013. The event discussed ways of improving the situation for 
individual women, their families and communities and the aims included developing </p>


<p>strategies for the protection of the rights of women, and improving networking between 
Roma women and other groups working for gender equality.  
</p>
<p>11. The Independent Expert attended an event on double discrimination against minority 
women, organized by the Club de Madrid,1 on 1 and 2 October 2013. The meeting focused 
on women belonging to minority groups, and explored how they can transcend traditional 
roles to advance their rights and be empowered as agents of change. She spoke at the 
Hungarian Women&#8217;s Congress in Budapest, organized by the Hungarian Women&#8217;s Lobby. 
The Congress brought gender equality to the forefront of public discourse before 
parliamentary and local government elections and elections to the European Parliament to 
be held in 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Independent Expert visited Cameroon between 2 and 11 September 2013 and 
thanks the Government for its excellent cooperation. With over 250 ethnic groups, the 
Government is rightly proud of the country&#8217;s diversity and stability. While challenges 
remain, the Government appears willing to involve minorities in finding effective solutions. 
Pygmy and Mbororo pastoralist communities are among the poorest in Cameroon and 
issues relating to land and livelihood are of primary importance to these communities. 
Language issues include the decline of some of the country&#8217;s many mother-tongue 
languages. While a national bilingual language policy exists, Anglophone representatives 
allege discrimination in such areas as access to employment and political appointments. 
Freedom of religion is generally evident; however, Pentecostal church leaders complained 
of closure of churches and discriminatory treatment. The report on the mission is contained 
in addendum 1 to the present report (A/HRC/25/56/Add.1).  
</p><p>13. The Independent Expert thanks the Government of Nigeria for agreeing to a visit 
during early 2014. She urges other States that she has requested to visit to respond 
positively to her. She draws attention to the press release of mandate holders on Human 
Rights Day calling for stronger cooperation of Member States.2 
</p>
<p>14. The Independent Expert travelled to Malaysia at the invitation of a human rights 
organization, Pusat KOMAS. She thanks all those civil society actors she met and with 
whom she held discussions. She also met high-level officials including ministers in the 
Prime Minister&#8217;s Departments for National Unity and Integration and for Human Rights. 
During her meetings, she gave an introduction to international standards and principles for 
the protection of minority rights, discussed the importance of Malaysia ratifying the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the 
need for disaggregated data, especially for assessing the need for existing affirmative action 
policies. She highlighted to Government officials her desire visit Malaysia on an official 
mission and noted her long-standing visit request.

<p><b> C. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Independent Expert continues to receive information from diverse sources about 
human rights violations perpetrated against national, ethnic, religious and linguistic 
minorities. Based on this information, she has sent communications in the form of letters of 
allegation and urgent action letters relating to minority issues to Member States over the 
reporting period, the majority sent jointly with other relevant mandates. These are made 
publicly available together with responses from concerned Governments in the joint s 
communications reports of the special procedures submitted to the Council.3  
</p>
<p><b> D. Additional activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Strengthening collaborations 
</b></p>
<p>16. As follow-up to a recommendation made at the fifth Forum on Minority Issues, the 
Independent Expert attended the fifty-third session of the African Commission on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights in Banjul, in April 2013. She held a consultation with the Working 
Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities in Africa and noted with appreciation its 
openness to engaging in further dialogue concerning minority issues. She addressed the 
NGO forum and advised civil society representatives about opportunities for cooperation 
with her mandate, the United Nations human rights system and the Forum on Minority 
Issues and encouraged Governmental and NGO representatives to attend future Forum 
sessions. 
</p>
<p>17. The Independent Expert encouraged the Commission to look into options for 
dedicating specific attention to minority issues and ensuring that minority concerns are 
addressed in a systematic way. On 11 April 2013, she issued a press statement warning that 
hundreds of minority groups across Africa are in dire need of strengthened attention and 
protection.4 She intends to continue her engagement with the Commission and African 
regional human rights actors and produce a report on minority issues in the African region. 
</p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert held consultations with the Special Adviser on the 
Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, to identify ways in which their respective mandates 
might strengthen their collaboration in the area of prevention of genocide and mass 
atrocities. She invited Mr. Dieng to attend the Forum on Minority Issues and deliver a 
keynote speech in which he recognized that populations are often targeted based on their 
identity or religious belief and expressed concern over religious and sectarian tensions in 
the Central African Republic, Egypt, Myanmar and the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>19. The Independent Expert continued her collaboration with the newly established 
United Nations network on racial discrimination and protection of minorities, which is 
coordinated by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR). She also continued to contribute to the global consultations on the post-2015 
development agenda and submitted two papers on the consultations about inequalities and 
about good governance. On 5 December 2013, the Independent Expert participated as a 
panellist in an event held in Geneva to mark Human Rights Day and the twentieth 
anniversary of OHCHR.

<p><b> 2. Events, conferences and outreach 
</b></p>
<p>20. On 14 and 15 May 2013, the Independent Expert participated in the conference 
&#8220;Right-wing Extremism and Hate Crime: Minorities under Pressure in Europe and Beyond&#8221; 
in Oslo. She spoke about the importance of early action to confront hateful messages. In 
November, she joined the Sixth Budapest Human Rights Forum as a panellist on issues of 
freedom of religion and belief. She contributed to several meetings via video messages, 
including: on 6 March 2013, a meeting organized by the European Union delegation to the 
United Nations in Geneva addressing freedom of religion or belief for all; on 10 December, 
the Regional Ministerial Education Conference co-organized by the Ministry of National 
Education of Turkey and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) Regional Office 
for Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States on the theme 
of including all children in quality learning. 
</p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert has continued to raise awareness about discrimination on 
the basis of work and descent. On 24 May 2013, she led a joint statement calling for 
strengthened protection of more than 260 million victims of caste-based discrimination.5<b> </b>On 
16 and 17 December 2013, she participated in the Second South Asia Regional 
Consultation on Caste Based Discrimination in Kathmandu. The objective was to explore 
contemporary caste-based discrimination issues in the region, as well as to discuss United 
Nations action to combat such discrimination in country programmes. 
</p>
<p>22. The Independent Expert enhanced efforts to reach out to young people belonging to 
minorities. She gave lectures and presentations to youth and student groups (among others 
at the Central European University in Budapest and Fordham Law School in New York) 
and participated in youth events, including a youth festival in Hungary, to discuss 
minorities and hate speech. She met and participated in the closing of the OHCHR Minority 
Fellowship Programme and as a former fellow herself, encouraged other fellows to take up 
leadership roles.  
</p>
<p>23. On 25 November 2013, prior to the session of the Forum on Minority Issues, the 
Independent Expert hosted a public event &#8220;How can you fight hate and intolerance?&#8221; The 
event included the screening of short films from the project &#8220;Not in Our Town&#8221;, focused on 
how different communities have mobilized to confront hatred and intolerance. This well-
attended event and discussion presented positive examples of how individuals and 
communities can take practical action and generated an interesting dialogue and personal 
reflections from participants. The Independent Expert plans to host a similar event on an 
annual basis.  
</p>
<p>24. The Independent Expert used social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to raise 
awareness of minority issues and the work of her mandate and other relevant international 
bodies and mechanisms. These social media sites also provided a platform for discussion of 
minority issues. Notably, the debate on a Dutch cultural tradition of Sinterklaas and Zwarte 
Piet was followed by some 13,000 people on her Facebook page within just a few days and 
resulted in around 500 comments and messages being sent to the Independent Expert 
directly on this matter.

<p><b> 3. Statements  
</b></p>
<p>25. The Independent Expert issued additional public statements, many jointly with other 
mandates, to highlight issues of concern involving minorities.6 These included: on 
29 March, calling on all parties in Bangladesh to cease violence, including against the 
Hindu minority, following large-scale protests across the country in February 2013; on 
8 April, a statement to mark International Roma Day, calling for political and legislative 
commitments to be implemented in practice to bring much needed changes into the lives of 
Roma; on 4 May, she initiated a joint statement calling for greater protection of people 
living with albinism, recognizing that their lifelong stigmatization and marginalization is 
extreme and noting concern over attacks against them; on 13 May, calling on the Iranian 
authorities for the immediate release of seven Baha&#8217;i leaders nearing the fifth anniversary 
of their arrests, whose detentions were declared arbitrary by the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention in 2008.  
</p>
<p>26. On 29 October, the Independent Expert issued a statement &#8220;Roma in Europe: Guilty 
until proven innocent?&#8221;<b> </b>relating to the removal of children from their Roma families and 
accusations of child abduction against Roma by authorities and the media. On 
21 November, a statement was issued regarding the Dutch celebrations of the arrival of 
Sinterklaas and his servant, Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), which perpetuates negative 
stereotypes of Africans and people of African descent. The Government was urged to 
support and facilitate an open debate in Dutch society by establishing a dedicated platform 
for this discussion, with a view to identify steps that might respond to the views and 
concerns of all. On 25 November a statement related to a decision of the Government of 
Malaysia to ban a Catholic publication from using the word &#8216;Allah&#8217; to refer to God, 
warning that it violates the rights of religious minorities. On 19 December, a statement on 
Central African Republic urged all sides to step back from the brink of all-out sectarian 
conflict and an immediate and unconditional halt to the violence and attacks against 
civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Update on the Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Independent Expert is required in resolution 19/23 of March 2012 to guide the 
sessions of the Forum on Minority Issues, prepare its annual meetings and to report its 
recommendations to the Council. On 26 and 27 November 2013, the sixth annual session of 
the Forum took place in Geneva with a thematic focus on guaranteeing the rights of 
religious minorities. 
</p>
<p>28. More than 500 delegates participated, representing Member States from all regions, 
United Nations mechanisms, treaty bodies and specialized agencies, intergovernmental 
organizations, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations and including academics and experts on minority issues. 
Interventions addressed the many challenges facing religious minorities, provided 
information about legislation, policies and practices for the protection of their rights, and 
presented proposals for solutions to problems experienced by religious minorities. 
Recommendations for guaranteeing the rights of religious minorities emanating from the 
Forum will be presented to the Council at its twenty-fifth session.

<p>29. The Independent Expert participated as a panellist in a number of side events that 
were held during the Forum, including one event hosted by Adama Dieng, Special Adviser 
on the Prevention of Genocide, on the theme of &#8220;Prevention of Incitement to Atrocity 
Crimes&#8221;. Other Side-Events included one focused on religious minorities in the Middle East 
and North African Region, and &#8220;Gender Justice and Religion: Women as Agents of Positive 
Change&#8221;, which examined the challenges facing women belonging to religious minorities 
and their role in fostering intercommunity tolerance and dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Ensuring the inclusion of minority issues in post-2015 
development agendas 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>30. The following thematic discussion forms part of an ongoing programme of work by 
the Independent Expert to ensure that minority issues are given appropriate attention in the 
context of the post-2015 development agenda. She will continue to consult widely on this 
issue with all relevant stakeholders at the global and national level to achieve this objective.  
31. There are compelling arguments for giving greater attention to disadvantaged 
minorities in post-2015 development agenda and future development goals. Foremost 
amongst these is that globally minorities remain among the poorest and most socially and 
economically excluded and marginalized communities.<b> </b>Tens of millions of people 
belonging to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities worldwide are trapped in a 
cycle of discrimination, exclusion, poverty and underdevelopment from which they cannot 
break free without targeted attention being given to their situations. The relationship 
between inequality, discrimination and poverty and its impact on disadvantaged minority 
groups cannot be ignored or underestimated. 
</p>
<p>32. As highlighted by the former Independent Expert, poverty within minority 
communities is both a cause and a manifestation of the diminished rights, opportunities and 
social advancement available to the members of minority communities. Their poverty 
involves more than just a lack of income or a daily struggle for basic sustenance and is 
frequently based on structural inequality and long-standing discrimination and social 
exclusion which defy &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; solutions. Poor minority communities are less able 
to participate effectively in political decision-making. They suffer from unequal access to 
education, health care, employment and land. Minorities are more likely to lack citizenship 
and be stateless, often resulting in their total exclusion from development and human rights 
initiatives.  
</p>
<p>33. In fact, as 2015 approaches, many persons belonging to minorities are at risk of 
backsliding in development and human rights terms. For example, the impact of the global 
financial crisis is most deeply felt by the poorest in society, including minorities, who may 
lack secure employment and face shrinking social welfare platforms. Recent or ongoing 
conflicts have had a devastating impact on minorities in numerous countries. Religious 
minorities are under threat in countries where conflict or political and social unrest has 
emerged, including the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; States, leading many to flee their homes or become 
refugees in neighbouring States.  
</p>
<p>34. An emerging message underlying the consultations around the post-2015 
development agendas has been &#8220;leave no one behind&#8221;. This message is a welcome one that 
indicates a growing global awareness that inequality greatly hampers development progress 
for those affected. The Independent Expert considers that a real risk exists that millions of 
disadvantaged minorities globally will be &#8220;left behind&#8221; if there is not a clear commitment at 
the global and national levels to address the development needs and human rights of </p>


<p>disadvantaged minorities. New development goals for the post-2015 period provide an 
important opportunity to refocus development agendas on inequality and put minority 
issues at the heart of these efforts.  
</p>
<p>35. In many national situations, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not 
been achieved for disadvantaged minorities. A full analysis of experiences is still needed in 
order for lessons to be fully learned from the MDG experience. In some countries, positive 
examples have emerged where practices have been implemented and targeted strategies 
have produced positive results for minorities. However, a survey by the former Independent 
Expert on minority issues, Gay McDougall, demonstrated that only a handful of countries 
devoted particular attention to minorities in their MDG reports, that, even where minorities 
are mentioned, there is a lack of discussion on how and, crucially, why minorities are 
experiencing disproportionately high levels of poverty and other serious inequalities, and 
that women belonging to minority groups remain particularly invisible (see A/HRC/4/9, 
para. 68). 
</p><p>36. Deficiencies in the MDG framework have been highlighted by minority rights and 
development experts.7 A reliance on aggregate results and a continuing lack of 
disaggregated data collection resulted in very few measurements being made of the 
progress of minority groups towards the goals. Governments have tended to focus attention 
on populations that are easiest to reach and issues that were easiest and least costly to 
address. Minorities are often geographically and socially harder to reach and their issues 
include long-standing discrimination and social exclusion, which are more difficult to 
address. Strategies consequently often failed to target minorities and their particular 
challenges, even where the political will to address the issues of minorities existed.  
</p>
<p>37. Research suggests that minorities and indigenous peoples have progressed at a 
slower rate and even found gaps between them and other communities widening as others 
benefited from MDG interventions. An issues brief on promoting equality, including social 
equity, co-authored by UNICEF, UN-Women, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and OHCHR, stated: &#8220;The MDGs, in focusing largely on national 
averages, without addressing inequalities explicitly, may have led to perverse outcomes 
whereby already-marginalized groups have tended to be &#8216;left until last&#8217;, thus exacerbating 
existing inequalities.&#8221;8 
</p>
<p>38. OHCHR and mechanisms and mandates of the Council have consistently 
emphasized that human rights must be at the heart of development processes and that 
human rights-based approaches to development, based on the normative framework of 
human rights law, strengthen development strategies. This message is increasingly being 
taken up by other stakeholders, including Member States that acknowledge the relationship 
between human rights and development. It must not be forgotten that human rights include 
minority rights, as established in article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.

<p>39. In September 2013, Amnesty International called for human rights-based approaches 
and attention to minorities in the post-2015 development agenda. It stated that world 
leaders risk deepening inequalities, discrimination and injustice if human rights remain 
sidelined. &#8220;The poorest, most disadvantaged and marginalized groups are being let down&#8221; 
said its Secretary General, Salil Shetty: &#8220;There is a widening gap between rich and poor and 
between men and women and those from minority groups.&#8221; The MDGs and the post-2015 
agenda must directly address factors causing inequality and must address and dismantle the 
multiple and systemic barriers which marginalize the most vulnerable.9  
</p>
<p>40. Since 2012, a consultation process has been taking place internationally to put in 
place a new global development plan when the MDGs conclude in 2015. Important 
processes have been under way, including the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the 
Post-2015 Development Agenda, and the intergovernmental Open Working Group on 
Sustainable Development Goals, connected to the Rio+20 process. The General Assembly 
met in September 2013 to review progress, begin discussion of the recommendations and 
start work on a new framework to follow the MDGs. Emerging from this process is a strong 
call for attention to the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups.  
</p>
<p>41. The Rio+20 outcome document10 highlights the fact that green economy policies in 
the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication should &#8220;enhance the 
welfare of indigenous peoples and their communities, other local and traditional 
communities, and ethnic minorities, recognizing and supporting their identity, culture and 
interests and avoid endangering their cultural heritage, practices and traditional knowledge&#8221; 
(para. 58). It also stresses the need to ensure equal access to education for ethnic minorities 
and for an enabling environment for women and girls from ethnic minorities (paras. 229 
and 238). The High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons, in its report, states: &#8220;We should 
ensure that no person &#8212; regardless of ethnicity, gender, geography, disability, race or other 
status &#8212; is denied universal human rights and basic economic opportunities. We should 
design goals that focus on reaching excluded groups&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>42. The Secretary-General established the United Nations System Task Team on the 
Post-2015 United Nations Development Agenda in September 2011, which brings together 
experts from over 50 United Nations entities and international organizations to support the 
post-2015 consultation process. In its report, <i>Addressing inequalities: The heart of the post-
2015 agenda and the future we want for all</i>, it states that: &#8220;the era of the MDGs may have 
inadvertently seen some channeling of resources away from the poorest population groups 
or from those that are already at a disadvantage because of the effects of discrimination 
based on their gender, ethnicity, disability or residence &#8230; Redressing such discrimination 
and inequalities will be essential, if global opportunities for progress are to be shared by 
those most in need of its benefits.&#8221;12

<p>43. The United Nations system has increased its attention to minority issues. In 2012, 
the Secretary-General established the United Nations network on racial discrimination and 
the protection of minorities in Policy Committee decision No. 2012/4 of 6 March 2012. It 
aims to enhance dialogue and cooperation across the United Nations system. In the 
guidance note of the Secretary-General on racial discrimination and protection of minorities 
based on the network&#8217;s work, it is stated that: &#8220;efforts to improve sustainable human 
development and promote inclusion and stability are complemented and strengthened with 
better attention to the situation of minorities &#8230; participation of persons belonging to 
minorities is essential in the process of developing the post-2015 development agenda, with 
a view to ensuring that the resulting agenda advances non-discrimination and other human 
rights concerns of minorities.&#8221;13 
</p>
<p>44. United Nations Country teams supported 88 countries to convene national 
consultations on the post-2015 development agenda and hold forums to exchange ideas for 
a shared vision of &#8220;The World We Want&#8221;, in an open process tailored to country contexts.14 
The national consultations made deliberate efforts to engage groups that generally do not 
participate in policy discussions. This global conversation responds to a growing call for 
active participation in the process and calls for the voices and issues of disadvantaged 
groups, including minorities, to be taken into account at every stage. Submissions to the 
Global Consultation on Addressing Inequalities were revealing and emphasized the extent 
to which globally ethnic and linguistic minorities face structural exclusion that limits 
integration into society.  
</p>
<p>45. The United Nations Development Group organized a set of eleven thematic 
consultations, on the themes of: conflict and fragility; education; environmental 
sustainability; governance; growth and employment; health; hunger, food and nutrition; 
inequalities; population dynamics; energy; and water. A report and preliminary findings 
were launched in March 2013. The following sections provide a brief discussion of 
minority issues in the context of each of these thematic areas. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Minorities in the context of specific areas of development 
consultation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Inequalities 
</b></p>
<p>46. Tackling inequality stands out among the consultation areas as a cross-cutting and 
essential goal that should be at the heart of international and national development agendas. 
To make progress on this goal for disadvantaged minority groups and others means to 
create conditions of substantive equality for minorities, the challenges to which are a major 
barrier to development and human rights that minorities experience. A requirement for 
States to address inequality means that they must act clearly and directly to address the 
social exclusion, economic marginalization, poverty and discrimination facing minority 
communities.

<p>47. A global-level commitment to tackle inequality and address the situation of 
disadvantaged minorities and indigenous peoples by the international community, the 
United Nations, the donor community and international financial institutions is essential to 
encourage and ensure State-level action. If such a global message is missing or weakly 
stated, States that have historically neglected, denied or violated the rights and development 
of marginalized minority groups will have little incentive to do otherwise. Conversely, a 
strong requirement to address inequality, clearly articulated in a new set of post-2015 
development imperatives, will serve to mobilize State action, empower civil society and 
minority communities, and have the potential to ensure real change on the ground for some 
of the most impoverished and marginalized minority groups.  
</p>
<p>48. While the increasing focus on &#8220;inequality&#8221; is welcome and vital, it is essential that 
this translates into far greater attention to minority issues in practice in every State. It is 
essential not only to address the challenges of &#8220;the poor&#8221;, but to identify who are the 
poorest, where and why &#8212; to find the inequality where it is gravest. A deeper 
understanding of the inequalities which lie behind poverty, social exclusion and economic 
marginalization is necessary if nationally and internationally we are to overcome the 
barriers to development experienced by disadvantaged minorities.  
</p>
<p>49. Discussions on the post-2015 agenda must take into account evidence that indicates 
that a rapidly increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s poor are minority groups. In many 
situations globally, in both developing and developed countries, poverty takes on ethnic, 
religious and linguistic dimensions. An honest assessment of why minority groups face 
more severe challenges reveals that discrimination and exclusion form a launching pad for a 
host of obstacles for minorities. At the national level, long-term success in poverty 
reduction and in reaching development targets for minorities requires an investment in 
tackling the root causes of inequality, as well as its symptoms. 
</p>
<p>50. In core documents emerging from the consultations on the post-2015 agenda, there 
is little, if any, recognition that minorities experience multiple and intersectional challenges 
that create vulnerability across a range of areas under consideration. For example, a focus 
on rural/urban disparities fails to acknowledge that minorities are frequently rural and 
remote communities with poor access to services and basic needs. Consideration of 
household wealth disparities rarely makes the link between low income and belonging to a 
minority. It is often women from disadvantaged minorities who are most affected by poor 
access to education and decent employment and who suffer multiple discrimination as they 
are women, members of a minority and poor. When the maps of poverty, access to basic 
services, gender discrimination, poor housing and population groups are overlaid, 
minorities stand out as being the most in need. The nexus between minorities, poverty and 
inequality cannot be ignored. 
</p>
<p>51. Minority groups have experienced increased levels of racism and xenophobia since 
the financial crisis began. The 2012 Annual Report of the European Commission against 
Racism and Intolerance noted that: &#8220;The ongoing economic crisis has created a vicious 
cycle in which many of the groups of concern to ECRI (vulnerable groups) are trapped. 
Diminished economic opportunities and welfare cuts puts them into poverty, which breeds 
negative feelings on both sides of the social divide&#8221;.15

<p>52. Calls for inequality to be addressed more clearly are coming from a wide group of 
experts. On 21 May 2013 a group of 18 United Nations human rights mandate holders 
called for the post-2015 development agenda to be urgently refocused on equality, social 
protection and accountability.16 The statement highlighted that:  
</p>
<p>The rise of inequality has severely undermined the achievements of the Millennium 
Development Goals &#8230; Future goals must be sensitive to who benefits and at whose 
expense, and must go beyond blunt, aggregate targets that allow us to pick the &#8221;low-
hanging fruit&#8221; and ignore the most vulnerable groups, while leaving systemic 
injustices untouched &#8230; Making equality a cross-cutting priority would mean every 
new goal will confront head on the systemic injustices that drive inequalities, from 
institutional discrimination against minority groups to uneven investments in social 
services in different regions of a country.  
</p>
<p><b>  The importance of disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>53. A major barrier in assessing and tackling disparities is the lack of data disaggregated 
by ethnicity, religion or language. Data is vitally important for effective poverty reduction 
and yet, within aid modalities on poverty, the collection of ethno-cultural disaggregated 
data is not uniformly supported. In 2005, UNDP published <i>MDG Monitoring and 
Reporting: A Review of Good Practices</i>, wherein it recommends that, &#8220;Whenever possible, 
disaggregated data should be used to highlight disparities across gender, ethnicity, 
geographical location, age or other dimensions of inequality&#8221;.17 In a few countries where 
disaggregated data exist, these reflect clearly the inequalities between majority and 
minority groups. Equally, they provide essential baseline data upon which to base targeted 
interventions and monitor progress. Each of the countries mentioned below has, to some 
extent, recognized the challenges facing minorities revealed by such data and established 
programmes targeted towards them. 
</p>
<p>54. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, disaggregated data 
reveal patterns of ethnic poverty. Around two fifths of people from ethnic minorities live in 
income poverty, twice the rate for whites. The highest income poverty rates (in 
percentages) are found among Bangladeshis (65), Pakistanis (55) and black Africans (45 ). 
At 25&#8211;30 per cent, the rate among Indians and black Caribbeans is lower but still much 
higher than the 20 per cent among white people.18 In Brazil, census data show that on 
average, white and Asian Brazilians earned twice as much as black or mixed-race 
Brazilians. Black Brazilians are much more likely to be poor. Of the 16.2 million people 
living in extreme poverty (approximately 8.5 per cent of the population), 70.8 per cent are 
black. The average wages for black and mixed-race Brazilians are 2.4 times lower than 
those earned by citizens of white and Asian origin.19

<p>55. Analysis by the Pew Research Center of census data in the United States20 shows the 
wealth gap between whites and minorities continued to grow since 1984 when the census 
began tracking such data. White households have on average 20 times the median wealth of 
blacks and 18 times that of Hispanics. The recession from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far 
greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation-adjusted 
median wealth fell by 66 per cent among Hispanic households and 53 per cent among black 
households, compared with just 16 per cent among white households. As a result the typical 
black household had just $5,677 in wealth (assets minus debts) in 2009; the typical 
Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth; and the typical white household had $113,149. 
</p><p>56. The World Bank has highlighted the &#8220;remarkable progress&#8221; of Viet Nam on poverty 
reduction. However, ethnic minorities &#8212; 15 per cent of the population &#8212; have not enjoyed 
such progress. In 1993, minorities comprised 20 per cent of all poor households. By 1998, 
this had risen to 29 per cent, and by 2010 to 47 per cent, and 68 per cent of the extreme 
poor. The gap in living standards is also large: 66.3 per cent of ethnic minorities were still 
poor in 2010 compared to only 12.9 per cent of the majority Kinh, and 37.4 per cent of 
ethnic minorities are still extremely poor, compared to just 2.9 per cent of Kinh.21 The 
World Bank describes six &#8220;pillars of disadvantage&#8221; that combine in a &#8220;vicious cycle&#8221; to 
influence ethnic minority livelihood outcomes and lead directly and indirectly to persistent 
poverty: lower levels of education; less mobility; less access to financial services; less 
productive, lower-quality land; limited market access; stereotyping and cultural barriers.22 
</p>
<p>57. One criticism that must be addressed is that a focus on any population group or 
minority may be perceived of as unfair affirmative action or special measures that result in 
a neglect of other population groups who may also have very real issues and development 
challenges. However, this need not be the case. An approach which addresses the long-
standing issues of disadvantaged minorities as a core priority does not assume or require 
neglect of other groups or essential areas of concern. It requires that such targeted attention 
is justified, monitored and time-bound to ensure that it does not become discriminatory. 
Disaggregated data is also essential in this regard and allows inequalities to be statistically 
demonstrated, and progress towards targets to be monitored and evaluated.  
</p>
<p>58. Addressing inequality is an overarching goal that, if it is achieved, will inevitably 
bring with it benefits for disadvantaged minority groups across a wide range of other areas 
that the post-2015 development agenda consultations are addressing. The rationale behind 
such an inequalities-based approach is strong, however it must be driven at a global and 
donor level to overcome barriers of discrimination, power-dynamics, and lack of political 
will that are often evident at the national level. In the Synthesis Report of the Global 
Thematic Public Consultation on the Post-2015 Development Agenda focusing on 
inequalities,23 it is stated that &#8220;there is considerable evidence that inequalities in one 
structural domain increase the likelihood of inequalities in others. In the event of 
opportunity for improvements in one domain, the chances of progress are often undermined

<p>or rendered inaccessible by simultaneous intersecting disadvantage in another. These 
intersecting and mutually reinforcing inequalities are often rooted in historical 
relationships, and continue to be reproduced through discrimination in social, economic, 
environmental and political domains.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> B. Education 
</b></p>
<p>59. Education is a basic human right for all children, and yet in all regions there are 
minority children who do not enjoy that right or enjoy it to a much lesser extent than others. 
Often countries face serious problems in providing basic education for many children 
owing to factors including scarcity of resources, poverty and conflict. However the 
challenges and barriers to minority children are frequently based on and perpetuated by 
discrimination and social exclusion. Lack of access to education perpetuates a cycle of 
poverty that is often experienced most acutely by minority communities. Yet conversely, 
education provides a gateway to development and the full enjoyment of a wide array of 
human rights for minorities. 
</p>
<p>60. In 2009, of the world&#8217;s 101 million children out of school, an estimated 50&#8211;70 per 
cent were from minorities or indigenous peoples.24 In Central Africa, the great majority of 
Batwa and Baka have not had access even to primary education. Only 13 per cent of 
children in sub-Saharan Africa have access to primary education in their mother tongue.25 
In South Asia, Dalit girls are prevented from pursuing their education not only because of 
poverty, but through discrimination and sexual violence. Literacy levels are commonly 
much lower among Dalit girls. For example, in the Mushahar Dalit community in India, 
barely 9 per cent of women are literate.26 In Latin America, millions of indigenous and 
African descendant children work in fields, plantations or mines instead of being in school. 
</p>
<p>61. As a result of factors including segregation, stigmatization, and high dropout rates 
among Roma, their attendance beyond primary school is dramatically lower than the 
average. In South-East Europe only 18 per cent of Roma attend secondary school, 
compared with 75 per cent of the population, and less than 1 per cent of Roma attend 
university.27 In many countries globally, education is only in the national or majority 
language leaving linguistic minorities disadvantaged. In Viet Nam and other South-East 
Asian countries, education is commonly only in the language of the majority putting 
minorities at a disadvantage in education.

<p><b> C. Health 
</b></p>
<p>62. According to Paul Hunt, former Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (2002&#8211;2008): 
</p>
<p>We live in a world of profound health inequalities, a world in which a person&#8217;s 
health and the quality of care they receive is determined by their ethnicity, the 
language they speak or their religious and cultural beliefs. In almost every country in 
the world, minorities and indigenous peoples are among the poorest and most 
vulnerable groups, suffer greater ill-health and receive poorer quality of care than 
other segments of the population. They die younger, suffer from higher rates of 
disease and struggle more to access health services compared to the rest of the 
population. More often than not, this ill-health and poor healthcare is a symptom of 
poverty and discrimination.28 
</p>
<p>63. Minorities frequently live in remote or inaccessible localities and often Government 
health-care facilities and provision do not reach there. In many countries, the health-care 
infrastructure, including hospitals or clinics, is simply not available in minority areas. In 
some cases, health-care provision comes at a cost relating to treatment and drugs that poor 
communities &#8212; often minority communities &#8212; cannot afford. The infrastructure to ensure 
safe drinking water and hygiene facilities may also not reach areas where minorities live. In 
some cases the provision of health care is also limited due to discrimination. New attention 
to minorities and strategies to address their health situations are urgently required. A greater 
understanding of their health needs is essential and requires research and data collection.  
</p>
<p>64. In Nepal, according to UNDP, life expectancy of a Hill Dalit was 61 in 2009 
compared to 68 for a higher caste Hill Brahmin. A 2011 Open Society Foundation study 
reported that Roma are disproportionately unvaccinated, have poorer than average nutrition 
and experience higher rates of infant mortality and tuberculosis. There is evidence that life 
expectancy among Roma communities is 10 to 15 years lower than in non-Roma 
communities.29 In Cameroon, visited by the Independent Expert in 2013, the access to 
health and health situation of Pygmy communities is extremely poor relative to other 
population groups. In Pakistan, UNICEF reports that the maternal mortality ratio for 
Baluchistan &#8212; largely inhabited by the Baluchi minority &#8212; is 758 per 100,000 live births, 
almost three times the national average of 276 per 100,000 and far from the MDG target of 
140 per 100,000.30 
</p>
<p><b> D. Growth and employment 
</b></p>
<p>65. Economic exclusion is a cause, a manifestation and a consequence of discrimination 
against minorities. As was strongly emphasized at the World Conference against Racism in 
Durban in 2001, poverty can contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices, 
which in turn generate more poverty, a situation coined as the &#8220;vicious cycle of poverty&#8221;.

<p>Many minorities have historically been excluded from full and effective participation in 
economic life, both in the developed and developing world. Minorities face discrimination 
when they seek employment due to their colour, religion, language or names. Minorities are 
poorly represented even in public-sector employment, including where legislation bans 
discrimination in public and private sectors. They may face barriers in accessing credit or 
loans and may live in the poorest or remote regions that offer limited prospects for their 
economic development. Large-scale economic development projects or commercial 
activities carried out on the lands where minorities live frequently have negative impacts, 
including displacement, perpetuation of poverty and, in some cases, violence.  
</p>
<p>66. Several factors exacerbate the exclusion of minorities, including deteriorating 
economic conditions, ethnic tensions and rising discrimination. Unequal regional 
distribution of resources and services and a lack of basic infrastructure in regions where 
minorities live often have the effect of preventing them from fully exercising their 
economic and social rights. The past decade has brought new and unanticipated challenges, 
including the global food and economic crises that have been proven to have a greater 
impact on particular vulnerable groups and minorities. Failing to fully include and integrate 
minorities also means that States are missing out on economic developments and benefits 
that such inclusion brings. World Bank studies have shown how the inclusion of currently 
marginalized and excluded minorities in economic life would lead to increased GDP.31 
</p>
<p><b> E. Hunger, food security and nutrition 
</b></p>
<p>67. Directly linked to health concerns, minorities are frequently in a vulnerable situation 
in regard to hunger, food security and nutrition. High levels of poverty and extreme 
poverty, lack of access to employment or secure forms of income, land or land tenure all 
impact on their food security. In India, for example, child malnutrition is some 14&#8211;20 per 
cent higher for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and has been declining at a slower 
rate than for the rest of the populations over the period of the MDGs.32 In country visits by 
the mandate holders to Rwanda (2011) and Cameroon (2013), food security and nutrition 
was a major concern of Batwa and Pygmy communities, many of whom are displaced from 
traditional forest habitats and can no longer maintain their hunter/gather lifestyles and 
access forest-based food sources. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Conflict and fragility 
</b></p>
<p>68. Globally, minorities often suffer disproportionately from the impact of conflict. 
Many examples demonstrate clearly the impact of conflict upon minorities and their 
development and rights, which in some cases has been devastating and has set progress 
towards development goals back by years for certain groups. 
</p>
<p>69. The huge impact of conflict and instability on minorities in Iraq has been 
documented, including for Muslim minorities, Baha&#8217;is, Christians, Armenians, Chaldo-
Assyrians, Faili Kurds, Palestinians, Jews, Sabian Mandaeans, Yazidis and others. Minority

<p>Rights Group states that: &#8220;Minorities in Iraq have continued to be targeted on the grounds 
of their religion or ethnicity since the US-led invasion and fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. 
They have suffered from killings, kidnappings, torture, harassment, forced conversions and 
the destruction of homes and property.&#8221;33 Persecution, human rights violations and targeted 
attacks have led to vast numbers of internally displaced persons and a mass exodus of 
minority communities to neighbouring countries, where they continue to experience severe 
challenges and poverty. Equally, in Egypt and the Syrian Arab Republic, the full extent of 
unrest and conflict on minorities is becoming evident and has far-reaching implications for 
their rights and security.  
</p>
<p>70. In Rakhine State in Myanmar, conflict between the Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim 
Rohingya communities erupted in 2012 and resulted in the killing of hundreds, the 
destruction of homes and property and the internal displacement of over 130,000 people, 
mostly minority Muslims. Tens of thousands of displaced people, and many thousands of 
others in villages affected by the conflict and insecurity, now have no access to livelihood 
activities or income, are dependent on humanitarian assistance for food, shelter, health care, 
education and water and sanitation. The conflict has had a catastrophic impact on their 
rights, access to essential services and development, forcing many into a condition of 
extreme poverty and insecurity. The Government of Myanmar does not recognize the 
Rohingya as citizens with implications for their enjoyment of all their human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Environmental sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>71. According to the report of the United Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 
United Nations Development Agenda: &#8220;Deepening resilience among vulnerable populations 
and reducing risks of disasters and other shocks must be central to limiting the social and 
economic costs of disasters, in terms of death, hunger, malnutrition, displacement and 
forced migration.&#8221;34 Equally, Claus H. Sorensen, Director-General of the European 
Commission Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection stated:  
</p>
<p>Those who are most vulnerable and marginalised need primary attention when a 
disaster strikes, both because the impact of the disaster is likely to be higher on them 
than others, and because of the likelihood that they find themselves excluded from 
response and recovery efforts. By systematically addressing in each action the 
inclusion of those who are marginalised (in particular, persons affected by caste 
discrimination, minorities, as well as persons with disabilities, women, and the 
elderly), lives have been saved, the suffering of those in need has been alleviated, 
and their dignity protected.35

<p>72. In South Asia, experiences from the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, the 2004 Asian 
Tsunami and flooding in Nepal in 2008, the Indian States of Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, 
Karnataka and Assam during 2007&#8211;2009, and Pakistan in 2010, demonstrated that Dalits

<p>recovery efforts&#8221;.36 The impact of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath on African-American 
communities was well documented as were deficiencies in the relief and reconstruction 
efforts. Minorities may be more vulnerable to natural disaster due to the location of their 
homes in marginal locations, vulnerable occupations, and poor-quality housing. The 
environmental impact of development mega-projects often has a disproportionate impact on 
minorities, as demonstrated by the impact of aggro-business projects on Afro-Colombian 
minorities and their lands and indigenous minorities in the Gambella region of Ethiopa 
displaced from their lands, as well as the impact on Pygmy communities of the Chad-
Cameroon oil pipeline in Cameroon &#8212; a few of many examples. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Governance  
</b></p>
<p>73. The Independent Expert provided a submission to the Global Consultation on 
Governance and the Post-2015 Framework held in South Africa in February 201337 in 
which she highlighted that minorities globally are poorly represented in all levels of 
government, decision-making bodies and public-sector employment. At the national level, 
political and administrative frameworks and public-sector structures with responsibilities 
for development are often staffed by and geared towards majority communities. Good and 
inclusive governance is essential to ensuring the rights of minorities. Inclusive governance, 
representative of minorities, ensures that their issues are not neglected and that policies and 
programmes are developed with their interests in mind. When minorities are excluded from 
decision-making and public bodies responsible for implementation of development 
initiatives, it is inevitable that strategies will neglect minorities or lack the specialist 
information about their situations and needs to ensure that projects are successful and 
sustainable. 
</p>
<p>74. The Independent Expert highlighted in her 2012 report to the General Assembly, the 
fact that efforts to ensure minority rights and equality frequently require States to 
implement positive measures and approaches, as required by the Declaration. Positive 
change for disadvantaged minorities can be facilitated by appropriate institutional attention 
given to minority rights and a policy and programme framework within which to address 
minority issues. Institutional attention for minority rights is the logical next step from 
legislation to concrete action for the protection and promotion of minority rights. A key 
recommendation is that States consider institutional attention for minority rights both as a 
good governance obligation, and as an essential component of their human rights, equality 
and non-discrimination commitments.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Energy 
</b></p>
<p>75. Access to affordable energy is essential for development and yet minority 
communities are frequently disproportionately affected by &#8220;energy poverty&#8221; that impacts on 
all areas of their lives and restricts their opportunities and development. Minority 
communities often live in remote or poor rural areas that are poorly served by energy 
infrastructure. Indeed minorities may also be negatively affected by energy-generating 
projects which take place in the areas in which they live, but from which they do not fully

<p>benefit. A lack of affordable energy impacts on communities in a host of ways: restricting 
their ability to reform and increase agricultural production; impacting on the ability to 
undertake entrepreneurial activities; and creating difficulties in providing electricity to 
enable children to study and clean, healthy options for cooking. The objective of achieving 
affordable, sustainable energy for all is therefore particularly relevant for minority 
communities. 
</p>
<p>76. A 2012 regional Roma survey, revealed that between 70 and 90 per cent of Roma 
surveyed reported living in conditions of severe material deprivation. Roma settlements 
frequently lack energy provision, sometimes because they are classified as illegal 
settlements and do not fall within energy and infrastructure plans. Communities in 
Bulgaria, visited by the mandate holder in 2011, described paying more for energy from 
private providers and being unable to afford energy bills owing to lack of employment and 
low incomes. Key questions must be asked at the national level, which include: who are 
those most affected by lack of access to affordable energy?  
</p>
<p><b> J. Water 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
Catarina de Albuquerque, focused her 2012 report to the Council (A/HRC/21/42) on 
stigmatization in the realization of the rights to water and sanitation. The report examines 
different manifestations of stigma in the context of the human rights to water and sanitation 
and explores recommendations for policymaking and solutions to prevent and respond to 
human rights violations resulting from stigma. The Special Rapporteur found that stigma 
pushes people to the margins of society and results in the rejection, avoidance and 
marginalization of certain groups. Access to water and sanitation for many Roma 
communities is notoriously precarious. Similarly, the report highlights that Dalit habitations 
are often systematically excluded from service provision.  
</p>
<p>78. On 30 October 2013, the Friends of Water, UNICEF, the Special Rapporteur and 
OHCHR issued a press statement calling for the post-2015 development agenda to be 
framed around the principles of equality and non-discrimination in the context of water and 
sanitation.38 The statement called for future goals, targets and indicators to be framed to 
include an explicit focus on the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups and 
individuals, including through the use of disaggregated data. &#8220;Success&#8221; must be assessed in 
relation to the progress made in closing gaps or inequalities in access to sanitation, water 
and hygiene. New priorities should focus on the millions of marginalized peoples who have 
remained hidden within aggregate statistics, and who continue to have no access to basic 
services. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Population dynamics 
</b></p>
<p>79. Population dynamics include trends and changes in population growth, migration, 
urbanization, population density and age structures, and are a core element of the 
consultations. However, consideration of this area of development rarely addresses 
inequalities and the dimensions of population associated with majority/minority relations. 
Trends towards urbanization, for example, are frequently least pronounced for minority

<p>populations resulting in growing rural/urban and majority/minority divides. Birth rates may 
decrease in increasingly affluent population groups but remain high amongst the poorest, 
often minority, communities, serving to perpetuate their poverty. In many countries, there 
are clear geographical boundaries between population groups and equally clear 
socioeconomic divides between population groups &#8212; commonly, minorities fall on the 
wrong side of such divides. 
</p>
<p>80. Population dynamics may be deeply affected by discrimination and social exclusion 
exercised by one population group against another. The dynamics between and across 
different population groups should therefore also be given greater attention. For example, 
conflict between communities and enforced population movement due to conflict results in 
internal displacement that may affect minorities disproportionately and have a greater and 
longer-term impact on their rights, their access to livelihood, income and basic services. 
Globally, millions of people are affected by displacement and they are often minorities who 
are numerically fewer, politically and militarily non-dominant and the most vulnerable to 
social and political unrest and the impact of conflict. A fundamental message of the 
Independent Expert is that protection of minority rights and the creation of a culture of 
minority rights within wider society promotes conditions of stability under which human 
rights and development crises and setbacks, and huge population impacts, are less likely 
to occur.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>81. <b>Equality for minorities is</b> <b>a human right and must be recognized as a core 
development goal. There are compelling arguments for greater attention being given 
to disadvantaged minorities in post-2015 development agendas and future 
development goals. Foremost amongst these is that globally, disadvantaged minorities 
remain among the poorest and most socially and economically excluded communities. 
The Independent Expert considers that a real risk exists that many millions of persons 
belonging to minorities globally will continue to be &#8220;left behind&#8221; if there is not a clear 
commitment at the global and national levels to address their plight as a high global 
development priority. </b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Minorities should be among the first targets of development strategies, yet 
frequently they are among the last. Lack of attention to the situations of minorities 
constitutes one of the most serious deficiencies in the MDG process and an important 
impediment to achieving certain goals in some States. Without significant and 
continuing efforts to raise attention to the need for solutions that work effectively for 
disadvantaged minorities, post-2015 strategies may continue to follow the same 
patterns, priorities and models that have proved to be flawed in their ability to 
address the development needs of disadvantaged minorities.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The relationship between inequality, discrimination and poverty cannot be 
ignored or underestimated. Tens of millions of people worldwide are trapped in a 
cycle of discrimination, exclusion, poverty and underdevelopment from which they 
cannot break out without targeted attention given to their situations. It is imperative 
that the United Nations and others, as they move forward to craft a new set of 
development objectives and targets, addresses the inequalities faced by national or 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. </b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Despite the valuable new attention to inequalities, even within the numerous 
consultation reports emerging from the process, there is a tendency to place minorities 
at the end of a long list of disadvantaged groups or ignore them completely. The 
message that emerges from these high-level documents is that they are a relatively low </b></p>


<p><b>priority in comparison to other inequality issues including gender equality, disability, 
children and age. </b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>The post-2015 framework of new goals should be based on human rights, 
including minority rights as established in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons 
Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, and the 
principles of equality, non-discrimination and participation. A focus on disadvantaged 
minorities and specific minority groups, including Roma, people of African Descent, 
Dalits, and disadvantaged religious and linguistic minorities worldwide would 
potentially bring much needed development attention to millions of the most excluded 
and impoverished peoples globally.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>The need for disaggregated data to reveal the inequalities experienced by 
persons belonging to minority groups remains essential and national efforts to collect 
and analyse such data should be enhanced and assisted by the international 
community. Disaggregated data are needed across all goals and in relation to such 
crucial areas as education, employment, health, and household income. Such data not 
only allows inequalities to be identified, they assist in the design of appropriate 
targeted solutions and in the monitoring and evaluation of progress towards achieving 
goals for minorities. </b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Nevertheless, in the majority of countries where disaggregated data are lacking, 
Governments, national institutions and development actors, as well as United Nations 
specialized agencies, are generally well aware of which communities are the most 
excluded, marginalized and impoverished &#8212; frequently disadvantaged minority 
communities. Consequently, lack of statistical evidence and data must not be used to 
justify lack of attention to the needs of disadvantaged minority groups.</b> 
88. <b>Within the framework of a strong equality-focused goal or goals, it will be 
crucial to establish specific targets for States on the inclusion of minorities and 
specific indicators upon which to measure progress. The participation of minorities 
needs to be ensured and increased in all phases. </b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>Targeted affirmative action policies for addressing the economic and social 
exclusion of minorities, including specific social and economic development plans for 
marginalized groups and the regions in which they live are required. Where 
appropriate, dedicated institutional attention should be given to minorities in the 
States where they live, including through designated ministries, departments or units, 
focal points, ombudspersons, commissions etc in order for national action plans to be 
implemented with the necessary attention given to minorities. </b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The international donor community should clearly recognize the need to give 
attention to disadvantaged minorities and ensure that, at the global level, this is 
reflected in the process of developing a new set of development goals and in the goals 
themselves. At the national level, donors should ensure that sufficient resources are 
provided to States to support their activities and are directed towards projects and 
programmes meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged minority communities. </b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The Independent Expert urges States to establish independent monitoring 
bodies with civil society and public participation, including of minorities, to ensure 
that the next round of commitments made at the global level are fulfilled for 
minorities. </b>
