<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>World Programme for Human Rights Education</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 14 July 2005, in its resolution 59/113 B the General Assembly adopted the Plan of 
Action for the first phase (2005-2007) of the World Programme for Human Rights Education 
(2005-ongoing).  The first phase of the World Programme focuses on the infusion of human 
rights education into the primary and secondary school systems.  Drawing from the principles 
and frameworks set by international human rights instruments, the Plan of Action highlights that 
human rights education in the school system involves not only the integration of human rights in 
all educational processes and tools (curricula, textbooks, materials, methods and training) but 
also the practice of human rights within the education system.  The Plan of Action provides 
methodological guidelines on the content and process for infusing human rights education in the 
school system in line with the above-mentioned approach.  The main responsibility for 
implementing the Plan of Action rests with the ministry of education or equivalent institution in 
each country, which should assign or strengthen a department or unit responsible for 
coordinating the development and implementation of a related national strategy, in close 
cooperation with all relevant actors.  Member States are also encouraged to identify and support 
a resource centre for collecting and disseminating related initiatives and information (good 
practices, educational materials, events). 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*<b>  </b>The present report is being submitted late so as to include as much updated information as 
possible. 
</p>
<p>GE.07-10551  (E)    120207 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>2. On 27 February 2006, the High Commissioner for Human Rights presented a report on 
the World Programme and on related activities undertaken by her Office to the Commission on 
Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/90).  The present report provides additional information on 
activities which took place from February to December 2006, and is submitted in accordance 
with Human Rights Council decision 2/102. 
</p>
<p>3. On 3 April 2006, the General Assembly established the Human Rights Council by its 
resolution 60/251, according to which one of the primary responsibilities of the Council would 
be to promote human rights education and learning (para. 5). 
</p>
<p>4. On 23 June 2006, the Eighteenth Meeting of Chairpersons of the Human Rights Treaty 
Bodies accepted the harmonized guidelines on reporting under the international human rights 
treaties, including guidelines on a common core document and treaty specific documents 
(HRI/MC/2006/3).  The guidelines mention that States should provide information on any 
measures taken to ensure adequate education and training in human rights for a wide range of 
professional categories, including teachers (para. 43 (d)).  States should also submit information 
on any measures taken to promote respect for human rights through education and training in 
general, and within schools in particular (paras. 43 (e) and 56). 
</p>
<p>5. On 24 August 2006, the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights adopted resolution 2006/19 welcoming the establishment of the Human Rights Council 
and the activities carried out by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) both aimed at disseminating globally the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the World Programme&#8217;s Plan of Action, and at supporting the Plan&#8217;s implementation.  
The Sub-Commission recommended that human rights treaty bodies, when examining reports 
of States parties, devote specific attention to human rights education in the framework of the 
World Programme and that human rights education be included as an item in the agenda of the 
annual meeting of the persons chairing the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the adoption of the Plan of Action, OHCHR and the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have carried out joint activities with a view to 
disseminating the Plan. 
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR and UNESCO jointly published a booklet containing the text of the Plan of 
Action as well as a summary highlighting its main aspects and relevant General Assembly 
resolutions.  As of mid-December 2006, the booklet was available in English and it will soon be 
published in all United Nations official languages. 
</p>
<p>8. As stated in report E/CN.4/2006/90, in January 2006 the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and the Director-General of UNESCO, as well as the Secretary-General of the Council of 
Europe as far as Council of Europe&#8217;s Member States are concerned, addressed personal letters to 
ministers of education to encourage implementation of the Plan of Action and offer assistance 
upon request.  They also requested information on which relevant departments or units in the 
Ministry would coordinate initiatives related to the implementation of the Plan of Action.  As of </p>

 <p></p>
<p>mid-December 2006, 28 governmental bodies had responded to the joint letter; the list of 
countries is attached in the annex to this report.  In order to facilitate information-sharing on 
national initiatives undertaken in connection with the Plan of Action, in November 2006 
OHCHR launched a new section of its website.  The section contains information on the national 
focal points appointed by Governments as well as on existing national plans for human  
rights education or relevant excerpts from overall national human rights plans.  This is  
available on OHCHR&#8217;s website at:  http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/ 
national-initiatives.htm. 
</p>
<p>9. On 11-12 September 2006, OHCHR and UNESCO hosted the first meeting of the 
United Nations Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee on Human Rights Education in the 
School System (UNIACC), established in accordance with the Plan of Action (paras. 38-40).  
The objectives of the Committee include: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To encourage and support appropriate implementation of human rights education in 
the school system at the national level; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To liaise with all other United Nations initiatives, frameworks and inter-agency 
efforts relevant to education/human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To develop ways to collect and disseminate examples from various contexts and 
countries; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To develop a framework for monitoring and evaluating progress in the 
implementation of the Plan of Action; and 
</p>
<p>&#8722; To interact with international and regional financial institutions, as well as bilateral 
funding agencies, to explore ways of linking their funding programmes on education 
to human rights education programmes. 
</p>
<p>10. The meeting gathered representatives from the International Labour Organization, 
OHCHR, UNAIDS, the United Nations Development Programme, UNESCO, the United Nations 
Population Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East, and the World Bank.  The newly-established Committee agreed on 
strategies for the short, medium and long term with a view to encourage and support national 
implementation of the Plan of Action, focusing on the use of existing United Nations 
mechanisms and institutions as entry-points for enhancing cooperation.  The Committee 
identified three broad areas for support by the United Nations system to the national 
implementation of the Plan of Action, namely technical assistance, information-sharing and 
resources mobilization.  More information on the Committee is available on OHCHR&#8217;s website 
at:  http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/UN-inter-agency.htm. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. In addition, OHCHR contributed to the implementation of the World Programme and its 
Plan of Action by:<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p> (a) Facilitating information-sharing and networking among all actors through 
OHCHR&#8217;s Database on Human Rights Education and Training, which provides information on 
relevant institutions and programmes and is accessible through OHCHR&#8217;s website at 
http://hre.ohchr.org/hret, as well as the Resource Collection on Human Rights Education and 
Training, a specialized section of the OHCHR Library which includes a variety of human rights 
education and training materials and is publicly accessible.  OHCHR continues to respond on a 
daily basis to related queries from governmental and non-governmental actors, including by 
providing human rights education and training reference services and advice.  OHCHR also 
supported international and regional human rights education activities organized by other actors 
through provisions of grants, dissemination of publications, participation of specialized staff and 
other initiatives, as appropriate; 
</p>
<p> (b) Supporting national capacities for human rights education and training through 
projects undertaken within OHCHR&#8217;s Programme of Technical Cooperation in the Field of 
Human Rights.  More information on this programme is available on OHCHR&#8217;s website at:  
http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/coop/index.htm.  OHCHR also devoted enhanced efforts 
to strengthening national capacities for human rights training of military and other staff deployed 
to peacekeeping operations; in particular, the Office contributed to the development of training 
materials for the United Nations Police; 
</p>
<p> (c) Supporting grass-roots human rights education initiatives through the Assisting 
Communities Together (ACT) Project, a joint initiative of OHCHR and the United Nations 
Development Programme which provides small grants to national and local non-governmental 
organizations for community-based human rights education and training projects.  In 
November 2005, OHCHR and UNDP launched the fifth phase (2005-2007) of the ACT Project, 
focusing on supporting activities within the school system, in the following regions and 
countries: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Africa (Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, 
Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia,
