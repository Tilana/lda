<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that no one should be subjected to torture as defined in article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>&#8727;  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>GE.08-14292  (E)    130608 </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is a non-derogable right that must be protected under all circumstances, including in 
times of international and internal armed conflict or internal disturbance, and that the absolute 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed 
in the<b> </b>relevant international instruments, </p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that the prohibition of torture<b> </b>has been recognized to be<b> </b>a peremptory norm of 
international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>that a number of international, regional and domestic courts have held the 
prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to be customary 
international law, </p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that, under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, torture and inhuman treatment is a 
grave breach and that under the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court, acts of torture can constitute crimes against humanity and 
war crimes, </p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearances in General Assembly resolution 61/177 of 
20 December 2006, as well as its resolution approved at its seventh session on the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, and recognizing 
that the entry into force of the Convention, as soon as possible, through its ratification by 
20 States, and its implementation will make a significant contribution to the prevention of 
torture, including through prohibiting places of secret detention, 
</p>
<p> <i>Commending</i> the persistent efforts by civil society, in particular<b> </b>non-governmental 
organizations, to combat torture and to alleviate the suffering of victims of torture, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council and 5/2 
on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 18 June 2007, 
and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her duties in accordance with those 
resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and 
Social Council and reaffirming the Commission on Human Rights resolutions on the subject, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and 
can thus never be justified, and calls upon all Governments to implement fully the absolute 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns in particular </i>any action or attempt by States or public officials to legalize, 
authorize or acquiesce in torture under any circumstances, including on grounds of national 
security or through judicial decisions;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for a further period of three years: 
</p>

intergovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, individuals and groups of 
individuals, regarding issues and alleged cases concerning torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To conduct country visits with the consent or at the invitation<b> </b>of Governments; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To study, in a comprehensive manner, trends, developments and challenges in 
relation to combating and preventing<b> </b>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and to make recommendations and observations concerning appropriate measures to 
prevent and eradicate such practices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To identify, exchange and promote best practices on measures to prevent, punish and 
eradicate torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To integrate a gender perspective throughout the work of his or her mandate; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To continue to cooperate with the Committee against Torture, the Subcommittee for 
the Prevention of Torture and relevant United Nations mechanisms and bodies and, as 
appropriate, regional organizations and mechanisms, national human rights institutions, national 
preventive mechanisms<b> </b>and civil society, including non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To report on his or her activities, observations, conclusions and recommendations<b> </b>to 
the Council, in accordance with its programme of work, and annually on the overall trends and 
developments with regard to his or her mandate<b> </b>to the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/7/3) and the 
recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her 
task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to react appropriately and 
expeditiously to his or her urgent appeals, and those Governments that have not yet responded to 
communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur to answer without further delay; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To give serious consideration to responding favourably to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
requests to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of the 
Special Rapporteur; </p>
<p> 6. <i>Also urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To<b> </b>implement effective measures to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, particularly in places of detention and other places where 
persons are deprived of their liberty, including education and training for personnel, who may be 
involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any individual subjected to any form of 
arrest, detention or imprisonment; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have  all allegations of 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially 
examined by the competent national authority, to hold persons, who encourage, order, tolerate or 
perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely punished, 
including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to 
have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the Effective 
Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment (the Istanbul Protocol) as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is 
invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence 
that the statement was made; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other way transfer a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in 
danger of being subjected to torture; the Council recognizes in this respect that diplomatic 
assurances, where used, do not release States from their obligations under international human 
rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment obtain redress and are awarded fair and adequate compensation and receive 
appropriate socio-medical rehabilitation, and in this regard encourages the development of 
rehabilitation centres for victims of torture; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To ensure that all acts of torture are offences under domestic criminal law, and 
emphasizes that acts of torture are serious violations of  international  human rights law and 
humanitarian law and can constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes and that the 
perpetrators are liable to prosecution and punishment; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Not to punish personnel for not obeying orders to commit acts amounting to torture 
or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To protect medical and other personnel for their role in documenting torture or any 
other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and in treating victims of 
such acts; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To ensure appropriate follow-up to conclusions and views on individual 
communications of the relevant treaty bodies, including the Committee against Torture and the 
Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) To adopt a gender-sensitive approach in the fight against torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, paying special attention to violence against 
women; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To become parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a matter of priority as well as to give early consideration 
to signing and ratifying its Optional Protocol and, once parties, to designate or establish truly 
independent and effective national preventive mechanisms; </p>
<p> 7. <i>Reminds </i>States that:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Corporal punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment or even to torture; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Intimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the physical integrity 
of the victim or of a third person, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to 
torture; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in 
itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes</i> the reports of the Committee against Torture, submitted in accordance with 
article 24 of the Convention; </p>

 <p></p>
<p>9. <i>Takes note</i> of the reports of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Victims of Torture and calls upon the Board of the Fund to report to the Council in 
accordance with the annual programme of work; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to ensure, within the overall budgetary framework of the 
United Nations, the provision of an adequate and stable level of staffing, as well as the necessary 
technical facilities, for the bodies and mechanisms involved in combating torture and assisting 
victims of torture, in order to ensure their effective performance commensurate with the strong 
support expressed by Member States for combating torture and assisting victims of torture; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Recognizes </i>the global need for international assistance to victims of torture, stresses the 
importance of the work of the Board of Trustees of the Fund and appeals to all Governments, 
organizations and individuals to contribute annually to the Fund, preferably with a substantial 
increase in the contributions and encourages contributions to the Special Fund established by the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention to help finance the implementation of the recommendations 
made by the Subcommittee on Prevention, as well as education programmes of the national 
preventive mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
and United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as relevant intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, to commemorate on 26 June the United Nations International 
Day in Support of Victims of Torture, as proclaimed by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 52/149 of 12 December 1997; </p>
<p>13. <i>Decides</i> to continue to consider this matter in conformity with its annual programme of 
work.
