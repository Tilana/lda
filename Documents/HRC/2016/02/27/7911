<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>1. In this document, Montenegro presents its views on recommendations from the 
second UPR cycle. 
</p>
<p>2. Montenegro received a total of 124 recommendations during interactive discussion 
on 28 January 2013. In the framework of the adopted draft report of the working group, 
Montenegro accepted 96 recommendations, 13 recommendations were accepted as having 
already been implemented, while 15 recommendations were left for further considerations. 
</p>
<p>3. The document is the result of a joint activity of the government institutions, 
representatives of judiciary and prosecution service, the Ombudsman and NGOs. 
Consideration was given to all the recommendations in an open consultation process, in 
relation to which Montenegro gives the following brief comments and/or presents views, in 
accordance with the topics grouped by fields. 
</p>
<p><b> I. All the recommendations enjoy support of Montenegro, 
except recommendations number: 119.2, 119.4 partly, 119.8, 
119.12. Reasons for such position are as follows: 
</b></p>
<p><b>119.2</b> &#8211; Certain provisions of ICRMW are not in accordance with the positive legal 
regulation governing residence of foreigners in Montenegro. Ratification of this convention 
would result in the need to amend the existing regulations in a way which does not 
guarantee harmonization of national regulations with the EU law. In regulating legal 
migration and employment of foreigners, the Law on Employment and Work of Foreigners 
relies on ILO standards and ILO Constitution in particular. This law defines migration 
policy which protects interests of migrant workers and their family members legally 
residing in Montenegro. Therefore, ratification of ICRMW is unnecessary since interests of 
migrants are already protected. 
</p>
<p><b>119.4</b> &#8211; The Labour Law of Montenegro lays down standards for the protection of 
those performing work in the household. Despite the existence of legal basis, labour 
agreement for the performance of work in the household is rarely concluded in 
Montenegro. Protection of those performing work in the household is prescribed at the level 
matching the protection granted to the employees working for other employers. Given that 
it will take some more time to accept in practice the work performed in the household as a 
productive work which incorporates all the elements of the employment status of an 
employee and that national regulations prescribe full protection of employees performing 
work in the household in accordance with ILO standards, we believe that it is unnecessary 
to ratify ILO Convention 189 at this point. If the practice shows that the existing legal 
framework does not provide full protection, Montenegro will give consideration to 
ratification of ILO Convention 189. 
</p>
<p><b>119.8</b> &#8211; On 11 October 2005, Montenegro extended standing invitation to the special 
procedures to visit the country. Montenegro maintains regular contact and cooperation with 
all the OHCHR mechanisms. So far, it has cooperated with special rapporteurs/working 
groups for freedom of opinion and expression, human rights defenders and enforced 
disappearances. Bearing in mind that organising rapporteurs&#8217; visit does not depend only on 
</p>
<p>the expressed willingness of the state extending the invitation, but also on the organization, 
priorities and financial capacity of the OHCHR, Montenegro cannot accept this kind of 
formulation of the recommendation. Invitation to the special procedures remains open and 
Montenegro is ready, at any point, to give positive response to the announcement of visit of 
the OHCHR rapporteurs listed in the recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>119.12 </b>&#8211;<b> </b>In pursuance of international standards, Montenegro<b> </b>carries<b> </b>out intensive 
reform of criminal legislation. The new concept of prosecutor-led investigation was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>introduced with the aim of conducting more efficient investigation which resulted in 
considerably shorter duration of criminal proceedings. Strengthening independence and 
efficiency of judiciary will be continued in the framework of further reforms and in that 
regard Montenegro accepts recommendation 119.12. As for specific formulation of the 
recommendation and the time frame of 15 months, it was determined during the 
clarification procedure with the UPR Secretariat, Sub-committee and the state that had 
given the recommendation, that there existed no recommendation by the Sub-committee 
and that there was an error made by the state in stating it during interactive discussion. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The remaining recommendations enjoy the support of 
Montenegro, with the following comments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal documents on human rights and institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework for the protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. Montenegro will continue to build capacity of the Ombudsman in order to secure 
full implementation of regulatory framework in the field of protection against 
discrimination and prevention of torture. The Law on the Protector of Human Rights and 
Freedoms and the Law on Prevention of Discrimination are currently being amended which 
will guarantee legislative improvements and compliance with international standards. The 
parliamentary body responsible for determining necessary amount of funds and proposing 
budget for the Ombudsman will take care, together with the Ministry of Finance, of the 
need to strengthen financial and human resources in the course of preparation of the Law on 
Budget for each next year. 
</p>
<p>5. Measures and activities will be continued to ensure full implementation of ratified 
international instruments and national legislation, particularly with regard to protection of 
vulnerable groups and persons discriminated on any ground. For that purpose, efficient 
implementation of accompanying strategic documents will be priority. 
</p>
<p>6. Montenegro acceded to the Palermo Protocol. 
</p>
<p>7. Montenegro will ratify the Convention on the Reduction on Statelessness 1961. 
</p>
<p>8. The procedure of ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Communications 
Procedure to the CRC and Optional Protocol to the ICESCR is in progress. 
</p>
<p>9. Montenegro will ratify Kampala amendments to the ICC Statute by the end of 2016.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Anti-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>10. Legislative improvements in this field will result from amendments to the Law on 
the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms and Law on Prohibition of Discrimination 
that are currently being drafted. Montenegro continuously invests efforts in efficient 
implementation of anti-discrimination legislation. Efforts will be invested in achieving 
more efficient monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of strategies and action 
plans in this field. Surveys of discrimination and public campaigns on legal protection set 
out by anti-discrimination legislation will continue, along with the establishment of records 
and database for all the reported discrimination cases. 
</p>
<p>11. The Law on Prohibition of Discrimination particularly prescribes protection against 
discrimination on grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation. For that purpose, 
necessary measures will be taken to eliminate discrimination against LGBT. The Strategy 
for Improving the Quality of Life of LGBT persons will be adopted soon. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>12. Montenegro will continue to take all the required steps aimed towards increasing the 
share of women in decision-making positions, economic empowerment and protection of 
women and girls against all forms of violence. The measures to achieve such goal are set 
out in the Action Plan for Achieving Gender Equality 2013-2017. The Plan includes 
objectives set in regard to fighting discrimination against women in all the spheres of life, 
including education and employment. The Family Law sets out division of property of 
spouses in equal shares. When determining the share of each spouse the court takes into 
account not only the incomes and earnings of each spouse, but also the support that one 
spouse provides for another, the work, household and family, care for upbringing of 
children and every other form of cooperation in management, maintenance and increase of 
joint property. Intensive efforts will be invested in implementation of CEDAW 
recommendations for the Initial Report of Montenegro. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>13. Improvement of the position of persons with disabilities and their full social 
inclusion is one of priorities that Montenegro will continue to pursue by means of efficient 
implementation and evaluation of adopted measures and activities set out in the Action Plan 
for implementation of the Strategy for Integration of Persons with Disabilities and Strategy 
of Inclusive Education. The focus will be placed on activities aimed towards further 
development of and support to inclusive education, occupational rehabilitation and 
employment, establishment and development of social support services in local 
communities and ensuring accessibility to public buildings. These activities will be 
supported by continuing the campaigns aimed towards awareness raising among both, the 
public and persons with disabilities, in regard to their rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Particular attention is devoted to regular (inclusive) education which is considered as 
the first option in all the cases. Schools that have special classes receive additional support 
to perform joint teaching of children with learning disabilities and their peers in regular 
classes. Resource centres (former special institutions) provide support to the children in 
regular education system. Inclusion in vocational education is receiving an increased 
attention. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Minorities and Roma 
</b></p>
<p>15. Montenegro will continue to implement activities aimed towards improvement of 
the position of minority nations and other minority national communities, particularly 
Roma and Egyptians. Already good legislative framework will be improved even further, 
while strengthening the existing institutions will ensure consistent implementation of 
strategic documents in this field. Measures for preserving the identity of minority nations 
that have been taken in certain fields of social life have resulted in full compliance with 
international standards and achievements of modern multi-national democracies. 
</p>
<p>16. A continuous upward trend in the number of Roma and Egyptian children in 
elementary schools has been recorded. Activities to prevent school drop-out have been 
undertaken by means of detection mechanisms and case management. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Refugees and birth registration 
</b></p>
<p>17. Recommendations have been implemented intensively over a longer period of time. 
Significant progress has been made concerning regulation of the legal status, in particular 
of IDPs from Kosovo. The competent authorities have continuously implemented activities 
to identify the most vulnerable persons in need of assistance with acquisition of documents 
and payment of administrative fees. The proposed law is in the Parliamentary pipeline; it 
extends the deadline for application for the status of foreigner with permanent residence 
until 31 December 20131. 
</p>
<p>18. The 2013 Action Plan has been adopted for implementation of the Strategy for 
Durable Solution to the Issues of DPs and IDPs, with particular emphasis on Konik area.<b> </b> The Plan includes a set of concrete activities and measures for 2013 pertaining not only to 
the status, but all other issues concerning full integration (employment, education, health 
and social insurance, housing, information campaigns etc). The Regional Housing Program 
envisages funds for resolving the housing problem of the most vulnerable categories 
(persons placed in informal collective centres and vulnerable persons living in private 
accommodation, with particular emphasis on the Konik Camp). 
</p>
<p>19. The currently applied procedure for subsequent birth registration in Montenegro is a 
universally accepted standard in the given field. This procedure safeguards the identity of 
each person for whom subsequent registration is required and prevents potential abuse, in 
particular with regard to potential child trafficking. Montenegro will endeavour, by means 
of appropriate amendments to the Law on Non-Contentious Proceedings, to simplify the 
procedure for subsequent registration of children born in Montenegro outside health 
institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Children 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Law on Treatment of Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings was adopted, in 
accordance with the CRC recommendations. The proposed Law on Social Welfare and 
Child Care was adopted. Activities have been launched towards a comprehensive child care 
database and a new National Action Plan for Children. Activities for more efficient 
implementation of laws concerning protection of child rights have been stepped up. Budget 
allocations for social welfare and child care, health care and education have increased. The 
respective roles of the Council for the Rights of the Child, Deputy Ombudsman for child 
rights and social services working with children and families (focus on prevention &#8211; 
transformation of child care and social welfare institutions and development of support 
services for families and family substitutes in the local community). Campaigns on the right 
of the child have continuously taken place, supported by the UN agencies. The Law on 
Treatment of Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings provides the legal framework for a 
comprehensive juvenile justice system based on the rights of the child and on the 
international standards. Equal access to education and health care is provided for all 
children, regardless of their immigration status. 
</p>
<p>21. Montenegro will embark on legal amendments to explicitly prohibit corporal 
punishment of children in all settings; a media campaign will be launched on the 
consequences of corporal punishment of children. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The NGO coalition monitoring the UPR process in Montenegro and taking part in consultations 
</p>
<p>recommends - as the third option in resolving the status of refugees, in addition to integration and 
voluntary return to the country of origin - voluntary departure to other countries. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/12/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> H. Human trafficking and sexual exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>22. The activities outlined in the recommendations have been continuously implemented 
by the competent authorities. The Strategy for the Fight against Human Trafficking 2012-
18 and the accompanying Action Plan identified the aims, principles and directions of 
fighting human trafficking and some measures for greater efficiency of the system for 
fighting human trafficking in the following areas: prevention and education; victim 
identification; victim assistance, protection and reintegration; efficient criminal 
prosecution; international cooperation; coordination and partnership. Current regulations 
and the Agreement on Cooperation between state institutions and NGOs regulate protection 
of adult/child trafficking victims to detail. 
</p>
<p>23. Criminal legislation has been harmonized with the Convention on Cyber Crime. 
Amendments to the Criminal Code are under way in order to include the criminal offence 
of display of pornographic material to children and production and possession of child 
pornography. Montenegro will continue to follow all international standards in this field 
and fiercely combat cyber crime, in particular in the sense of protecting children on the 
Internet. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Domestic violence, violence against women and children 
</b></p>
<p>24. Montenegro has set up a sound legislative framework for protection of victims of 
domestic violence, in particular women and children. In the coming period, efforts will be 
made towards efficient implementation of the laws and strategies from this field. Further 
efforts will be made to strengthen interdepartmental cooperation so as to provide all victims 
of violence with adequate and coordinated protection and assistance; continuous training 
will be organized for the staff working in institutions, along with awareness raising 
campaigns, and a database on victims of domestic violence will be set up. Montenegro is 
already working on setting up a mechanism for monitoring the number of domestic 
violence cases. The Criminal Code includes provisions aligned with Articles 2 and 3 of the 
CRC Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Judiciary reform 
</b></p>
<p>25. Montenegro is intensively implementing the judiciary reform, in the aim of stronger 
independence and impartiality. Legal amendments have generated more objective criteria 
for the election and promotion of judges and state prosecutors via the appraisal system and 
the improved election procedure. The intended constitutional amendments will enable 
further amendment of laws on the judiciary towards a more comprehensive and more 
detailed reform of election and appointment of judges and prosecutors and their deputies 
and of other issues of relevance for establishment of independent and autonomous 
judiciary. Montenegro has embarked on drafting the Law on Amendments to the Criminal 
Code, stipulating a new criminal offence of obstruction of justice. Stipulation of this 
criminal offence serves to protect regular operation of the judiciary, while judicial office 
holders are envisaged as its passive subjects. 
</p>
<p>26. Ratification of the European Convention on Compensation of Victims of Violent 
Crimes generated the legal basis for adoption of a new law to regulate the right to pecuniary 
compensation of victims of violent crimes. The Law on Compensation of Victims of 
Violent Crimes is currently being drafted. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> K. Combating corruption 
</b></p>
<p>27. The fight against corruption will remain one of the Government&#8217;s key priority, in 
line with the Strategy and Action Plan for Fight against Corruption and Organized Crime 
2010&#8211;2014. 
</p>
<p>28. The legislative framework for fighting corruption has been completed; further 
efforts focus on implementation, through adoption of accompanying secondary legislation 
and its upgrade based on the implementation impact assessment. The Training Program for 
judicial office holders on fighting corruption is being successfully implemented, as an 
important preventative activity in the fight against corruption in the judiciary. Particular 
attention has been paid to training central and local civil servants. The Strategy includes a 
specific section on local self-government, aiming to prevent varied interpretations of 
national regulations in this field. One of the measures envisaged under the Action Plan 
refers to harmonization of local action plans with the national one. The texts of some anti-
corruption laws are to be improved in order to be put in compliance with the international 
standards and to enable better implementation (Law on Political Party Financing, Law on 
Prevention of Conflict of Interest, Criminal Code etc.). Further judiciary reform will 
include further strong efforts to suppress corruption in order to be able to claim full 
independence and readiness of the judiciary to respond to any form of corruption. Draft 
Action Plan 2013-2014 has been prepared; it is expected to be adopted in April 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Freedom of expression and freedom of the media 
</b></p>
<p>29. Freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution. The standards are further 
elaborated and implemented by means of media laws. Three independent media self-
regulation bodies have been set up, namely: Media Self-Regulation Council, Press Council 
and Self-Regulation Council for Local Press and Periodicals. In the context of resolving the 
pending cases of violence against reporters, the competent state authorities will continue to 
work on identification of perpetrators and efficient, effective and impartial investigations to 
ensure full freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Freedom of religious communities 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Constitution stipulates separation between religious communities and the state. 
The Constitution guarantees equality and freedom of practice and religious affairs. A new 
proposed law on the legal status of religious communities is being drafted to regulate the 
issues of relevance for the religious communities in line with the new social and political 
circumstances. At the same time, the legal framework will serve to resolve the cases of 
restoration of some property powers to religious communities. 
</p>
<p>31. <b>All recommendations that enjoy support will be implemented and their 
implementation will be monitored in order to improve the efficiency and protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and freedoms in Montenegro.</b>
