HIGHLIGHTS DURING THE 2015-2016 FINANCIAL YEAR
EdenCreteTM 
  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)

I-20  Interstate  Highway  field  trial,  using  EdenCreteTM  added  to  GDOT’s  24  hour  accelerated 
concrete repair mix in two trial slabs, was conducted (Augusta, August 2015) .
  Results were 45.8% improvement in compressive strength, and a 56% reduction in the depth of
wear in an abrasion resistance test.
  Eden received formal approval from the GDOT New Products Evaluation Committee for use of 
EdenCreteTM  in  GDOT  24  hour  accelerated  concrete  applications  and  Class  B  concrete 
applications and discussions commenced in relation to specifications for the use of 24-Hour 
Accelerated Concrete/ Class B Concrete.
  Since the end of the financial year:

an  inspection  of  the  I-20  field  trail  slab  shows  it  is  showing  no  visible  cracking  or 
significant signs of wear after 11 months of highway wear, whereas the control section 
is already showing a significant crack developing; and
  GDOT has advised it proposes to use EdenCreteTM in several state funded forthcoming
suitable highway slab replacement projects in Georgia.
  GDOT intends that the requests for tender in these selected projects will specify that
EdenCreteTM be added to the concrete.
  These  will  be  the  first  commercial  contracts  for  EdenCreteTM  for  US  highway  repair
projects.
  The GDOT field trial of EdenCreteTM in Class 1 concrete has been included in a new section of 
highway that is being tendered and is presently anticipated to take place in 2018 unless this 
timetable can be accelerated.
  Commercial order received for use of EdenCreteTM in replacing a section of a high strength concrete 
slab at an industrial  site that is subject to extreme wear and abrasion, following an earlier successful 
field trial at the site  (October 2015). This project was completed and since the end of the financial year, 
a second section of concrete slab has been replaced using concrete with EdenCreteTM  added.
  First commercial EdenCreteTM order received for an infrastructure project, for use at a new MARTA bus 
garage  in  Atlanta,  Georgia and  the  project was  undertaken,  achieving  the  following  improvements  in 
performance:
38% 
  Compressive Strength Increase - 
59% 
  Split Tensile Strength Increase - 
24% 
  Modulus of Elasticity Increase - 
47% 
  Abrasion Resistance Increase - 
  Shrinkage Reduction (Improvement) - 9%
  Trials  of  EdenCreteTM  with  lower  dosage  rates  of  EdenCreteTM  showed  material  improvement  in 
performance  characteristics  of  concrete,  including  a  46%  reduction  (improvement)  in  the  rate  of 
abrasion  using  ½  US  gallon  of  EdenCreteTM  /  yard3  of  concrete,  which  would  have  added  only 
approximately 3.5% - 4% to the installed cost of the concrete paid by GDOT on the I-20 field trial.
  Eden completed the testing  ASTM C494 S testing of the EdenCreteTM enriched concrete which showed:
  41% increase in compressive strength at 28 days (ASTM C39); 
  32% increase in flexural strength at 28 days (ASTM C78); 
  29% increase in split tensile strength at 28 days (ASTM C496); 
  59% increase in abrasion resistance at 90 days (ASTM C779 Proc C); 
  61% reduction in ultimate shrinkage at 35 days (ASTM C105);  
  9.5% increase in freeze / thaw resistance at 180 days (from 88 to 96.4) (ASTM C666) and 
  3 minute delay in Time of Set (ASTM C403).
  The expansion of Eden’s Colorado based production capability of EdenCreteTM, from its present level of 
approximately 108,000 gallons per year to a targeted maximum of 2 million -2.4 million gallons per year 
commenced and is on schedule to be operational by early in 2017. Plans are also underway to acquire 
the Colorado facility which has previously been occupied under a lease.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
During the year Eden made significant progress towards achieving its goal of having EdenCreteTM, Eden’s carbon 
nanotube-enriched concrete admixture, become a product that is widely used in the concrete market, particularly the 
huge  US  infrastructure  market.  Further  progress  was  achieved  in  Eden’s  collaborative  research  projects  being 
conducted with the University of Queensland and Deakin University. 
Whilst sales of the Optiblend™ dual fuel system remained slow due to the ongoing low oil prices and the limited oil 
and gas exploration taking place as a result, nevertheless a total of 24 Optiblend™ dual fuel systems were sold in 
India and the USA during the year, having an aggregate value of  A$1.1 million. 
The progress achieved during the year is summarised in the highlights on pages 3 and 4 of this Report.  
The following is a more detailed account of this progress.   
 
EDENCRETETM (Eden 100%) 
 
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)  
GDOT I-20 Field Trials 
Two field trials of EdenCreteTM enriched concrete were undertaken on Interstate I-20 in Augusta, Georgia for GDOT. 
The field trials took place in August 2015 and involved the pouring of replacement concrete slabs on the I-20. The 
concrete used in the slabs included EdenCreteTM and this was compared with the results from a second slab that was 
poured using the same concrete mix but with no added EdenCreteTM, giving a basis for comparison of the benefits 
EdenCreteTM delivers (see Figures 1 and 2 below).  
In  the  laboratory  tests  of  EdenCreteTM  concrete  from  the  field  trial,  at  56  days,  where  an  accelerant  was  used, 
EdenCreteTM  concrete  exceeded  the  performance  of  the  same  control  mixture  (with  the  accelerant  but  without 
EdenCreteTM) by the following percentages:
• 
•
45.8% improvement in the compressive strength over the control mix; and  
56% reduction in the depth of wear of the concrete in an accelerated abrasion trial.
In November 2015 these results were considered by the GDOT New Products Evaluation Committee, which:
•  Approved the use of EdenCreteTM in GDOT construction and maintenance projects in both GDOT’s Class
24-Hour accelerated strength concrete mix applications and also its Class B concrete application; and
•  Classified  EdenCreteTM  as  “Field  Tests”  (i.e.  to  undertake  a  further  Field  Test)  in  the  applications  of 
Portland cement concrete pavements (GDOT Specification Section 430 and/or 439) and concrete white-
topping (GDOT Specification Section 453) (replacing the surface of an asphalt pavement with a concrete 
surface layer). A field trial for this purpose is anticipated will occur in 2018 unless arranged earlier.
Figure 1 2nd Field Trial of EdenCreteTM On I-20                                      Figure 2  2nd Field Trial of EdenCreteTM On I-20 
A visual examination, undertaken in July 2016, of the state of repair of the EdenCreteTM enriched section of concrete 
laid  on  26  August  2015  as  the  field  trial  of  EdenCreteTM  on  a  troublesome  section  of  the  I-20,  showed  no  visible 
cracking or significant signs of wear after 11 months of highway wear. The control section, laid on 27 August 2015 on 
the adjoining section of the same lane on I-20, and using the same concrete mix but containing no EdenCreteTM, was 
however, already showing a significant crack developing, 11 months after being laid (see Figures 3 and 4 below).

Figures 3. EdenCreteTM - No Visible Cracking                                     Figure 4. Control - Visible Crack Developing 
The trial section of the I-20 has high water content in the sub-surface beneath the road surface, which often results in 
a relatively short service life of the concrete roadway surface.
After reviewing these results in July 2016, GDOT concluded that the performance improvements that EdenCreteTM 
brings  to  the  concrete  (increased  flexural  strength  and  compressive  strength)  are  beneficial  in  slab  replacements, 
particularly when the substructure may be problematical, which frequently leads to the cracking beginning, as was the 
case with the I-20 field trial.
GDOT  advised  that it  is in  the  process of  identifying  several  upcoming, state  funded  slab  replacement  projects  in 
which  it  proposes  to  specify  in  the  request  for  tender,  that  EdenCreteTM  be  used.  In  accordance  with  Federal 
regulations, federally funded projects will still only specify performance characteristics that must be achieved.
By  requiring  the  use  of  EdenCreteTM,  GDOT  will  be  able  to  ensure  that  EdenCreteTM  is  used  in  the  nominated 
projects, and will enable it to monitor the results achieved, including where different sub-surface conditions and wear 
conditions may exist. These projects, if and when awarded, will be the first commercial projects involving the use of 
EdenCreteTM on US highway repair projects.
EdenCreteTM used in high strength concrete slab subject to extreme wear and abrasion 
During the year Eden received a commercial order for its EdenCreteTM concrete admixture to be used to replace 
several sections of a concrete hard stand area that is subject to very heavy wear and abrasion. The project took 
place at a major regional maintenance facility in Georgia for a large national US company where very heavy steel 
components from a national transport fleet are brought for repairs and maintenance.  
The concrete at the maintenance facility is exposed to extreme rolling loads, impact loads and abrasive wear (see 
Figure 5 below); and several  times each  year, under  a scheduled maintenance  programme,  sections  of the hard 
stand area that are severely cracked and require replacement are ripped up and replaced.

This  project  used the same  concrete  mix  that  was  approved  by  Georgia  Department  of Transportation  (GDOT)  in 
November 2015 for 24-hour maintenance and B Class concrete, but without any set accelerator.  It involved replacing 
three concrete slabs using EdenCreteTM, the first and third of which were adjacent to one another in an area over 
which  loaded  trucks,  fork  lifts  and  front-end  loaders  frequently  travel  to  access  the  section  of  the  yard  where  the 
replacement parts are stored (see Figure 5 above). These sections were excavated as closely to 150mm (6 inches) 
as possible, but there were sections where it was as deep as 225mm (9 inches) but there was no preparation of the 
sub-base before the new concrete was poured (see Figures 6 and 7 below).
Figure 6. Partially poured first slab                                                    Figure 7. Completed first slab
To  manage  the  variable  depth,  which  normally  requires  a  flat,  compacted  sub-base,  more  EdenCreteTM  enriched 
concrete was simply used to fill the deeper sections of the hole instead of spending time and money on sub-base 
preparation. As a result it was not necessary to order aggregate or compaction equipment to prepare the sub-base, 
and a little extra concrete was simply added to the concrete truck that delivered the concrete.
The  outcome  of  using  EdenCreteTM  on  this  project  was  a  45%  reduction  in  the  total  costs  compared  with  the 
budgeted cost of carrying out the same work using a new ultra-high strength mix design. This alternative mix would 
have  involved  a  12  inch  (300mm)  thick  concrete  slab  incorporating  half  inch  (12.5mm)  diameter  steel  rebar, 
supported by a six inch (150mm) compacted crushed aggregate sub-base, that had been planned to try and achieve 
a five year service life for the concrete.
The first section was opened and driven on by loaders, less than 24-hours after the last slab was poured. The second 
slab is to be used as foundation for a large filtration system used in the adjacent fabrication shop where the parts are 
replaced. No excavation at all was conducted.  Additionally, a sidewalk running under it was left in-situ and the slab 
simply  poured  over  the  top  (see  Figures  8  and  9  below).  Heavy  trucks  will  be  regularly  driven  onto  this  slab  to 
change the large filters on the system.

MARTA Brady Mobility Facility Project 
During  the  year,  Eden  received  its  first  commercial  government  infrastructure  order,  which  was  successfully 
completed at the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) Brady Mobility Facility in Atlanta.  
The state of the art facility will house the administrative functions, operations, and maintenance facilities for a fleet of 
up  to  200  Mobility  vehicles  (specialized  vans  and  cutaway  buses).  The  EdenCreteTM  section  will  be  subjected  to 
extreme rolling frictional forces due to the constant wear and abuse of large vehicle tyres when turning on the slab 
from day to day and will be evaluated over time relative to the rest of the concrete not containing EdenCreteTM.
A section of a new concrete hardstand area was installed using EdenCreteTM enriched concrete at the new state-of-
the-art bus garage that is being constructed on the site of the existing bus garage (see Figures 10 and 11).  
The final area that was selected for the project was larger than originally planned and in consequence, using all the 
available  EdenCreteTM  admixture  that  had  been  supplied  by  Eden,  17  truck  loads  of  concrete,  with  EdenCreteTM 
added  at a  dosage  rate  equal  to 3  gallons per cubic  yards  of  concrete,  were  used  to  construct  the section  of the 
Brady facility. 
At this dosage rate, which was lower than had originally been planned due to the increased volume of concrete that 
was required, the EdenCreteTM is still anticipated to at least double the service life of the concrete by enhancing the 
concrete’s  resistance  to  abrasive  wear,  increasing  its  flexural  strength  and  also  its  durability  due  to  reduced 
permeability.
Figure 10. Brady Mobility Facility                                         Figure 11. EdenCreteTM enriched slab being installed  
 
The test results, conducted after concrete had cured for 28 days, from two separate independent laboratories of the 
concrete used in the MARTA Brady Mobility Facility Trial showed EdenCreteTM delivered the following improvements:
25%
First Laboratory 
Compressive Strength Increase -
Second Laboratory
Compressive Strength Increase - 
Split Tensile Strength Increase - 
Modulus of Elasticity Increase - 
Abrasion Resistance Increase - 
Shrinkage Reduction (Improvement) -
38% 
59% 
24% 
47% 
9%
Following receipt of these test results, discussions with MARTA commenced in relation to possible further projects for 
EdenCreteTM in various specific applications at some, as yet undecided, time in the future. 
  
Trials of EdenCreteTM using Lower Dosage Rates of EdenCreteTM  
Trials  conducted  during  the  year  showed  material  improvement  in  all  performance  characteristics  of  concrete  that 
were tested using lower dosage rates of EdenCreteTM  
These results included a 46% reduction (improvement) in the rate of abrasion using ½ US gallon of EdenCreteTM / 
yard3  of  concrete,  which  would  have  added  only  approx.  3.5%  -  4%  to  the  installed  cost  of  the  concrete  paid  by 
GDOT on the I-20 field trial. 
1 US gallon (3.8 litres) of EdenCreteTM / yard3 of concrete produced a 55% reduction (improvement) in the depth of 
wear, which would have added approximately 7% - 8% to the installed cost of concrete in the I-20 field trial.

These new results make a very compelling economic case for the future widespread use of EdenCreteTM for high 
abrasion applications such as highways, bridge decks, warehouse floors, hard-stand areas and other surfaces that 
are subject to high abrasive wear. The results achieved EdenCreteTM are shown in Figures 12 and 13 below.

ASTM C494 S TESTING 
During  the  year  Eden  undertook  testing  in  accordance  with  the  American  Standards    for  Testing  and  Materials 
ASTM C494, Type S Test program (the umbrella standard to compare the performance of specialty admixtures) of 
EdenCreteTM. 
The results achieved to date showed:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
41% increase in compressive strength at both 28 and 56 days (ASTM C39); 
32% increase in flexural strength at 28 days (ASTM C78); 
29% increase in split tensile strength at 28 days and 22% at 56 days (ASTM C496); 
59% increase in abrasion resistance at 90 days and 56% at 56 days (ASTM C779 Proc C); 
61% reduction in ultimate shrinkage at 35 days (ASTM C105);  
3 minute delay in Time of Set (ASTM C403); and 
9.5% increase in freeze / thaw resistance at 180 days (from 88 to 96.4) (ASTM C666).
Only the 365 day compressive strength testing, due on 1st December 2016, remains to be completed. These results 
provide a standard basis for comparing the performance benefits delivered by specialty admixtures. Industry experts 
advise that a 5% improvement in performance is a material improvement. 
 
Expansion of Eden’s Colorado based EdenCreteTM Production Capability 
During  the  year,  the  expansion  of  the  production  capability  of  Eden’s  Colorado  based  EdenCreteTM  production 
facility from its present level of approximately 108,000 gallons per annum of EdenCreteTM to a target of between 
approximately 2 million - 2.4 million gallons (7.6 - 9.1 million litres) per annum commenced and is progressing on 
schedule. 
In order to achieve this scale-up, the entire plant is being expanded. The design of all items is completed, and most 
of the items have been ordered or are currently under construction. These include the following: 
  The equipment to produce the quantity of catalyst required for production of the necessary carbon nanotubes;  
  Two new reactors to manufacture the carbon nanotubes;  
  All the necessary processing and mixing equipment; and  
  Tanks and dispensing equipment for storage and delivery to road tankers of the 40,000 gallons (151,000 litres)
of finished product per week
Additionally alterations to the layout within the building and its surrounds were commenced and are underway to 
accommodate the new equipment. This includes disposing of now redundant equipment such as the original gen-
set that was first used in the development of Eden’s OptiBlend dual fuel system, to create sufficient area for the 
EdenCreteTM expansion. 
The entire up-scaling is scheduled to be completed and operational by the early in 2017, and at present the project 
is progressing on-time. As these premises in Colorado have only been occupied by Eden as a lessee, steps are 
currently underway for Eden to purchase the freehold so that it will have full, long term control over this important 
part of Eden’s operation, which is intended to remain Eden’s long term technology base, even after the proposed 
Georgia production facility is established.

Proposed Georgia EdenCreteTM Production Facility  
During the year Eden resolved to establish its future large scale global EdenCreteTM production facility in Augusta, 
Georgia over the next seven years at an estimated cost of US$67 million, thereby creating approximately  250 jobs.  
The plant is to be built on a large tract of suitable industrial land in Augusta and will have capacity for very large 
scale  future  expansion.  The  land  is  being  provided  by  the  Augusta  Economic  Development  Authority  under  a 
conditional grant as part of a financial incentive package detailed below. 
The site has very convenient road and rail access to the entire North American market, as well as easy access to 
shipping for the global market via the Port of Savannah. The site adjoins the railway system linking it to the entire 
North  American  rail  network.  It  is  also  located  within  12  kilometres  of  the  interconnected  US  Interstate  Highway 
network  giving  it  very  efficient  road  access  to  North  America.  The  Port  of  Savannah,  the  third  largest  port  (by 
volume)  in  the  US  for  containerised  freight,  is  160  kilometres  away  by  both  road  and  rail,  and  provides  efficient 
shipping access via the Atlantic to South America, Europe,  Africa and the Middle East, and also via the Panama 
Canal  to the rest of the  global market.  
The  initial  building  plant  (Phase  1)  will  be  developed  in  four  stages  to  a  planned  aggregate  annual  production 
capacity  of  a  planned  50  million  gallons  (189  million  litres)  of  EdenCreteTM  concrete  admixture.  The  site  has 
sufficient  area  to  accommodate  up  to  10  of  these  buildings  as  future  demand  grows  (see  Figure  14  below).

-  Various  County  tax  exemptions  from  Property  Tax,  Inventory  Tax,  and  Freeport  Exemption;
and
-  State Sales Tax and Use Tax exemptions.
Apart from evidencing the strong support that the Government of Georgia is prepared to provide to incoming industry, 
this generous assistance package will significantly reduce both the up-front capital costs and the operational set-up 
costs  associated  with  establishing  the  large  scale  manufacturing  operation  in  Georgia,  and  also  help  significantly 
defray  operating  costs  for  up  to  20  years.  Further,  it  will  deliver  a  significant  reduction  in  both  the  capital  and 
operating costs, and greatly enhance the overall attractiveness of the project to both future investors and lenders. 
 
EdenCrete Sales Team  
Eden  commenced building  a specialist  US  EdenCreteTM  sales  force.  The sales  team is  intended  will  comprise a 
team of people who each have a minimum of approximately 10 years’ experience in successfully selling concrete 
admixtures  in  the  US  with  top  admixture  suppliers.    To  date  5  very  experienced  and  highly  qualified  staff,  who 
collectively  have  109  years’  experience  successfully  selling  concrete  admixtures  in  well  over  half  of  continental 
USA, have been engaged.  
Western Region Sales  
Eden engaged its western region sales manager, who is based in California where he has commenced marketing 
and selling EdenCreteTM to potential customers. Having previously had a successful career as sales manager with a 
major  admixture  supplier,  responsible  for  more  than  10  states  in  the  western  region  of  the  US,  he  has  been 
appointed by Eden as the western region sales manager. Three further western region sales people have also been 
appointed. Further possible appointments are being discussed. 
Eastern Region Sales 
The sales manager for the eastern region of the US, a highly experienced person based in New Jersey, has also 
been appointed and commences work in August. Further possible appointments are being discussed. 
Longer Term Plans 
The intention is to progressively build the sales team to a total of approximately 8-10 sales people whose collective 
task will be to cover the US market, with the intention of selling all, or as much as possible, of the EdenCreteTM that 
Eden will be able produce in 2017 from its expanded Colorado production facility, which is targeted at approximately 
2-2.4 million gallons of EdenCreteTM per year. Initially the task is to get trials arranged with potential customers. In 
the longer term, it is intended to further expand the sales team both in the US and also into the global arena as the 
market  expands  to  absorb  the  production  increases  that  are  planned  to  result  from  the  establishment  of  Eden’s 
proposed large scale, global production facility in Augusta, Georgia. 
 
Deakin University- Research - High Strength concrete needing little reinforcing steel  
During  the  year  Eden  finalised  its  agreement  with  Deakin  University  (“Deakin”)  to  proceed  with  a  collaborative 
Australian  Research  Council  (“ARC”)  Linkage  Grant  research  project  into  ultra-high  strength  carbon  nanotube 
enriched  concrete  requiring  little  or  even  no  reinforcing  steel.  The  ARC  grant,  funded  by  the  Commonwealth  of 
Australia, which was initially awarded to Eden and Monash University in Melbourne, will provide a total of A$300,000 
over the three year life of the research project.

EDEN ENERGY LIMITED   ABN 58 109 200 900

The  Principal  Researcher  named  in  the  application,  Dr  Frank  Collins,  who  was  formerly  Associate  Professor  and 
Head  of  Structures  Department  at  the  Civil  Engineering  Department  at  Monash  University,  was  appointed  as 
Professor  of  Infrastructure  Engineering,  at  Deakin  University’s  Institute  for  Frontier  Materials  in  Melbourne  during 
2015. With the agreement and co-operation of Monash University, the project was transferred to Deakin University.  
This  research  could  potentially  lead  to  both  the  improvement  of  EdenCreteTM  and  the  development  of  ultra-high 
strength  concrete  that  requires  little  or  no  steel  re-enforcing.  Quite  apart  from  the  enormous  environmental  and 
financial implications, such an outcome would have major implications for the global construction industry. Eden has 
already made significant advances with EdenCreteTM towards achieving this goal, and this new project should assist 
in accelerating this progress.  
 
EDENPLASTTM / CNT ENRICHED POLYMERS AND PLASTICS 
During the year, the collaborative research project, partially funded by the Australian Research Council (“ARC”) (to 
the  extent  of  A$255,000)  between  Eden  and  the  University  of  Queensland  into  carbon  nanotubes  in  plastics,  has 
achieved very encouraging preliminary results, showing:
  Excellent combination of high modulus (stiffness) and outstanding ductility (elongation-at-break) achieved for
Nylon containing less than 1% Eden’s CNTs compared to commercial grades of nano Nylon 6.
  Superior ductility with comparable tensile strength (more than 75 MPa, 50% Relative Humidity (“RH”)
conditions) compared to super-tough commercial Nylons containing higher levels (4wt%) of nanoclays.
  Higher tensile strength than comparable Nylon based materials with similar ductility. 
  Excellent dispersion of the Eden’s CNTs in EdenPlastTM. 
  Visual clarity and transparency suggests suitability for a super-tough-film grade. 
  The relatively low-cost processing method of EdenPlastTM could potentially result in production of cost-
effective, high-stiffness and/or high-toughness grades of nano Nylon 6.
  Possible suitable future markets for EdenPlastTM, indicated by the results to date, are the automotive and
packaging markets.
Whilst  fundamental  studies  (X-ray  defraction,  rheology,  thermal  and  electrical  analysis)  and  further  standard 
characterization (ASTM, ISO) require to be carried out (impact, flexural, tensile, dynamical, fatigue) before possible 
commercialisation  could  be  considered,  the  preliminary  results  from  extruded  filaments  are  considered  very 
encouraging. 
 
OPTIBLEND™ DUAL FUEL SYSTEM  
US OptiBlend™ Progress 
Eden Innovations LLC, a wholly owned US subsidiary of Eden, received purchase orders for fifteen OptiBlendTM dual 
fuel systems during the year.  
Two  orders,  for  a  total  of  twelve  (of  the  fourteen)  OptiBlendTM  systems  in  the  US  for  a  combined  value  of 
US$490,000, were received from a division of Cummins Inc. and with whom Eden has collaborated over the past 
several years to adapt the OptiBlendTM systems for use in Cummins power modules for the drilling industry. 
The global market for dual fuel systems has been at a virtual standstill for the past 12 months as a result of the steep 
drop in world oil prices, the consequential drastic slowdown in oil and gas exploration and the reduced difference in 
price between diesel fuel and natural gas. Although the global price of oil remains low, which from market reports 
appears  likely  to  continue  at  least  for  the  short  to  medium  term,  nevertheless  these  sales  indicate  some  level  of 
renewed interest from the sector and may signal a slight upturn in the level of exploration activity. 
Eden  Innovations  is continuing  to  work  on  trying  to  establish  a  number  of  partnerships to  increase  its  bi/dual  fuel 
offerings.    These  proposed  partnerships  include  work  with  various  OEMs  to  become  their  default  supplier  and/or 
supplier of private labelled OptiBlend™ technology.  
India Optiblend™ Progress 
During the year, Eden Energy (India) Pvt Ltd (“Eden (India)”), Eden’s wholly owned Indian subsidiary, won a tender to 
supply to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (“ONGC”) of India, with eight OptiBlendTM dual fuel kits for use on 
diesel powered generator sets (“gensets”) used on drilling rigs it operates in India. The value of the contract is for the 
Australian dollar equivalent of over A$240,000. This is the first time that Eden (India) has secured a contract to supply 
ONGC, and is an encouraging development.  
India  is  presently  expanding its  early  stage  domestic  exploration  for shale  oil  and gas,  and  ONGC  is  a significant 
participant in this exploration programme, Eden (India) is hopeful of further success in this emerging Indian market.

CORPORATE
Successful rights issue raising A$4.86 million 
Eden raised A$4.86 million through an almost fully subscribed rights issue to existing shareholders in January 2016.
Successful A$10.35 million capital raising to fund Colorado expansion and preliminary expenses in Georgia 
Eden raised A$10.35 million additional capital through the placement to two US investment funds of 45 million fully 
paid  ordinary  shares  at  an  issue  price  of  A$0.23  per  share  together  with  22.5  million  free  options,  exercisable  at 
A$0.31 at any time before 11.59pm on 19 May 2019.
The funds raised were broadly intended to be used as follows:
  Approximately  US$2million  –  $2.5  million  to  fund  the  completion,  by  early  2017,  of  the  expansion  of  the 
current  EdenCreteTM  production  facility  in  Colorado,  to  a  targeted  annual  output  of  approximately  2-2.4 
million gallons; and
  Approximately US$2.5 million - $3 million to fund the Eden Group’s  ongoing working capital requirements,
and
The balance will be applied towards the initial expenses for site works, design and engineering for the first stage of 
the proposed large scale EdenCreteTM production facility to be built in Augusta, Georgia and which is targeted to be 
in production early in 2019 with a proposed initial annual output from its first production line of approximately 12.5 
million gallons of EdenCreteTM. 
UK Gas Project Sale 
On 24 February 2016, Eden sold its 100% owned UK subsidiary that held all its UK gas assets, to the parent of its UK 
Joint  Venture  partners.  The  consideration  was  an  earn-out  (commencing  at  1%  of  gross  sale  proceeds  from  all 
hydrocarbon sales from the UK licences (PEDLs) in which Eden’s subsidiary held a 50% interest, and reducing to 
0.5%), in connection with any hydrocarbon sales made in the period expiring on the 20th anniversary of completion. 
There is no cap placed on the maximum value of the amount that Eden can receive under the earn-out.
Eden has no further financial commitments on this project, but can still share in the potential upside from hydrocarbon 
sales, and focus its efforts on its EdenCreteTM and OptiBlendTM projects.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED) 
This  report  details  the  nature  and  amount  of  remuneration  for  each  director  of  Eden  Energy  Limited,  and  for  the 
executives receiving the highest remuneration. 
Remuneration policy 
The  remuneration  policy  of  Eden  Energy  Limited  has  been  designed  to  align  director  and  executive  objectives  with 
shareholder  and  business  objectives  by  providing  a  fixed  remuneration  component  and  offering  specific  long-term 
incentives based  on  key  performance  areas  affecting  the consolidated Group’s  financial  results.  The  board of  Eden 
Energy Limited believes the remuneration policy to be appropriate and effective in its ability to attract and retain the 
best executives and directors to run and manage the consolidated group, as well as create goal congruence between 
directors, executives and shareholders. 
The board’s policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for board members and senior executives of 
the economic entity is as follows: 
•
All  executives  receive  a  base  salary  (which  is  based  on  factors  such  as  length  of  service  and  experience), 
superannuation, fringe benefits and options.
Executives are also entitled to participate in the employee share and option arrangements. 
The executive directors and executives receive a superannuation guarantee contribution required by the government, 
which is currently 9.5%, and do not receive any other retirement benefits. Some individuals, however, have chosen to 
sacrifice part of their salary to increase payments towards superannuation. 
All remuneration paid to directors and executives is valued at the cost to the Company and expensed. Shares issued to 
directors and executives are valued as the difference between the market price of those shares and the amount paid by 
the director or executive. Options are valued using the Black-Scholes methodology.  The Group does not have a policy 
on directors hedging their shares. 
The  maximum  aggregate  amount  of  fees  that  can  be  paid  to  non-executive  directors  is  subject  to  approval  by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Fees for non-executive directors are not linked to the performance of the 
consolidated group. However, to align directors’ interests with shareholder interests, the directors are encouraged to 
hold shares in the Company and are able to participate in the employee option plan. 
Performance-based remuneration 
No performance based remuneration was paid during the year. 
Key Management Personnel Remuneration Policy 
The  Board's  policy  for  determining  the  nature  and  amount  of  remuneration  of  management  for  the  Group  is  as 
follows: 
The  remuneration  structure  for  key  management  personnel  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  length  of 
service, particular experience of the individual concerned, and overall performance of the Company. The contracts for 
service between the Company and key management personnel are on a continuing basis, the terms of which are not 
expected to change in the immediate future. Upon retirement key management personnel are paid employee benefit 
entitlements accrued to date of retirement. Any options not exercised before or on the date of termination lapse.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The  financial  report  is  a  general  purpose  financial  report  that  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian 
Accounting  Standards,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  and  the 
Corporations Act 2001. The financial report of Eden Energy Ltd and controlled entities complies with all International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in their entirety. 
The financial report covers the consolidated group of Eden Energy Ltd and controlled entities as at and for the year 
ended 30 June 2016. Eden Energy Ltd is a listed public company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The Group 
is a for-profit entity and primarily is involved in green energy technology. 
The financial report was authorised for issue on 31 August 2016 by the Board of Directors. 
The following is a summary of the material accounting policies adopted by the consolidated group in the preparation of 
the financial report. The accounting policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of Preparation 
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all years presented.  
Reporting Basis and Conventions 
The  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  is  based  on  historical  costs  modified  by  the 
revaluation  of  selected  non-current  assets,  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  for  which  the  fair  value  basis  of 
accounting has been applied. These consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the 
Parent’s functional currency. The subsidiaries’ functional currencies are USD, GBP and INR. 
Going Concern 
These  financial statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which contemplates  continuity of  normal 
business activities, the realisation of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.  
Accounting Policies 
a.
Principles of Consolidation 
A  controlled  entity  is  any  entity  Eden  Energy  Ltd  is  exposed  to,  or  has  rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of 
the entity.  A list of controlled entities is contained in Note 16 to the financial statements. All controlled entities 
have a June financial year-end. 
All  inter-company  balances  and  transactions  between  entities  in  the  consolidated  group,  including  any 
unrealised  profits  or  losses,  have  been  eliminated  on  consolidation.  Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have 
been changed where necessary to ensure consistencies with those policies applied by the parent entity. 
Income Tax 
The charge for current income tax expense is based on the profit for the year adjusted for any non-assessable 
or disallowed items. It is calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or are substantially enacted by 
the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising 
between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  carrying  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  No 
deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business 
combination, where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax assets are 
recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  future  tax  profits  will  be  available  against  which  deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Eden  Energy  Ltd,  Adamo  Energy  Ltd  and  Eden  Energy  Holdings  Pty  Ltd,  its  wholly-owned  Australian 
subsidiaries,  have  formed  an  income  tax  consolidated  group  under  the  tax  consolidation  regime.  The  Group 
notified the Australian Tax Office that it had formed an income tax consolidated group to apply from 1 July 2005. 
The  tax  consolidated  group  has  entered  a  tax  sharing  agreement  whereby  each  company  in  the  group 
contributes to the income tax payable in proportion to their contribution to the net profit before tax of the tax 
consolidated group. The R&D tax rebate is recognised as income tax benefit upon receipt. 
Inventories 
Inventories  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.  The  cost  of  manufactured  products 
includes direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate portion of variable and fixed overheads. Costs are 
assigned on the basis of first-in, first-out.  
Segment reporting 
Segment results that are reported to the Group’s board of directors (the chief operating decision maker) include 
items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Employee Benefits 
Provision is made for the company’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees 
to balance date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the 
amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs.

i.
Depreciation Rate 
15 – 50% straight line
Property, Plant and Equipment  
Each  class  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  carried  at  cost  or  fair  value  less,  where  applicable,  any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant  and  equipment  are  initially  recognised  at  acquisition  cost  or  manufacturing  cost,  including  any  costs 
directly  attributable  to  bringing  the  assets  to  the  location  and  condition  necessary  for  it  to  be  capable  of 
operating in the manner intended by the Group’s management. 
The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors to ensure it is not in excess of the 
recoverable amount of these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash 
flows that will be received from the asset’s employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows 
have been discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts. 
The depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable assets are: 
Class of Fixed Asset 
Plant and equipment 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains 
and  losses  are  included  in  the  income  statement.  When  revalued  assets  are  sold,  amounts  included  in  the 
revaluation reserve relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings. 
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure 
Exploration,  evaluation  and  development  expenditure  incurred  is  accumulated  in  respect  of  each  identifiable 
area of interest. These costs are only carried forward where the right to tenure is current and to the extent that 
they are expected to be recouped through the successful development of the area or where activities in the area 
have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable 
reserves. 
Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered through sale 
rather than continuing use. 
Immediately before classification as held-for-sale, the assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s 
other accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains 
or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. 
Financial Instruments 
Recognition 
Financial instruments are initially measured at cost on trade date, which includes transaction costs, when the 
related contractual rights or obligations exist. Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are measured 
as set out below. 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or that 
are not classified in any of the other categories. They comprise investments in the equity of other entities where 
there is neither a fixed maturity nor fixed or determinable payments. 
Loans and receivables  
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  that  are  not 
quoted in an active market and are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  
Financial liabilities  
Non-derivative  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  at  amortised  cost,  comprising  original  debt  less  principal 
payments and amortisation. 
Fair value  
Fair  value  is  determined  based  on  current  bid  prices  for  all  quoted  investments.  Valuation  techniques  are 
applied  to  determine  the  fair  value  for  all  unlisted  securities,  including  recent  arm’s  length  transactions, 
reference to similar instruments and option pricing models.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
i.
Financial Instruments continued 
Impairment  
At each reporting date, the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial instrument has 
been impaired. In the case of available-for-sale financial instruments, a prolonged decline in the value of the 
instrument is considered to determine whether an asset is impaired. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement.  
Impairment of Assets 
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying values of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether  there  is  any  indication  that  those  assets  have  been  impaired.  If  such  an  indication  exists,  the 
recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is 
compared to the asset’s carrying value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is 
expensed to the income statement. 
Impairment testing is performed annually for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives.  
Where  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  individual  asset,  the  group  estimates  the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Intangibles 
Research and development  
Expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Development 
costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project will deliver future economic 
benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably.  
Development costs have a finite life and are amortised on a systematic basis matched to the future economic 
benefits over the useful life of the project. 
Intellectual Property  
Intellectual  property,  which  includes  trademarks  and  engineering  knowledge,  is  included  in  the  financial 
statements at cost, being their fair value on acquisition. 
Intellectual property  and trademarks  are  only  amortised  or written  down  where  the  useful  lives are  limited or 
impaired  by  specific  circumstances,  in  such  cases  amortisation  is  charged  on  a  straight  line  basis  over  their 
useful lives and write downs are charged fully when incurred.  The directors have assessed the useful life of the  
intellectual  property  and  have  determined  that  it  has  a  finite  useful  life  of  10  to  20  years.  The  intellectual 
property is amortised on a systematic basis matched to the future economic benefits over the useful life of the 
project.  
Intellectual property is amortised over 10-20 years in line with its useful life. 
Foreign Currency Transactions and Balances 
Functional and presentation currency 
The functional currency of each of the group’s entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment  in  which  that  entity  operates.  The consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Australian 
dollars which is the parent entity’s functional and presentation currency. 
Transaction and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-
monetary  items  measured  at  historical  cost  continue  to  be  carried  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the 
transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the exchange rate at the date when fair 
values were determined. 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement. 
Group companies 
The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the group’s 
presentation currency are translated as follows: 
— 
— 
— 
Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the group’s foreign 
currency translation reserve in the balance sheet. These differences are recognised in the income statement in 
the  period  in  which  the  operation  is  disposed.  Intercompany  loans  are  treated  as  investments  for  foreign 
currency translation purposes.
assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date; 
income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period; and 
retained earnings are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.

NOTE 1: STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
m.
Equity-settled compensation 
The  group  operates  a  number  of  share-based  compensation  plans.  These  include  both  a  share  option 
arrangement  and  an  employee  share  scheme.  The  bonus  element  over  the  exercise  price  of  the  employee 
services rendered in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an expense in the income 
statement. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the shares of the options granted. 
Comparative Figures 
When  required  by  Accounting  Standards,  comparative  figures  have  been  adjusted  to  conform  to  changes  in 
presentation for the current financial year.  
Ordinary shares 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares 
are recognised as a deduction from equity. 
New accounting standards and interpretations 
A number of new and revised standards became effective for the first time to annual periods beginning on or 
after  1  July  2015.  The  more  significant  standard  is  AASB  2015-4  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting 
Standards  –  Financial  Reporting  Requirements  for  Australian  Groups  with  a  Foreign  Parent,  which  amends 
AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. 
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the Group. 
New accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 
July 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group does not 
plan to adopt these standards early.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
The directors evaluate estimates and judgments incorporated into the financial report based on historical knowledge 
and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on 
current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the group. 
Key Estimates — Impairment 
The  group  assesses  impairment  of  assets  held  for  sale  and  intangible  assets  at  each  reporting  date  by  evaluating 
conditions specific to the group that may lead to impairment of assets. At the date of this report the Group has sufficient 
reason to believe that no impairment triggers exist for intangible assets. 
There  is  a  significant  risk  of  actual  outcomes  being  different  from  those  forecasted  due  to  changes  in  economic  or 
market conditions and events. 
Key Estimates — Share-based payment transactions 
The consolidated entity measures the cost of equity settled transactions with suppliers by reference to the fair value of 
the equity instruments as at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes 
model. Refer to Note 27 for the inputs to the Black-Scholes model.

NOTE 13: ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
On 29 May 2013, Eden announced a conditional contract to sell all of its interest in its UK Gas project. Since that date 
that  conditional  contract  was  terminated,  a  heads  of  terms  with  another  purchaser  was  agreed  and  signed,  to  be 
subsequently terminated. Consequently, assets and liabilities allocable to Adamo Energy (UK) Ltd were classified as a 
disposal group in 2015. Revenue and expenses, gains and losses relating to the discontinuation of Adamo Energy (UK) 
Ltd have been eliminated from profit or loss from the Group’s continuing operations and are shown as a single line item 
on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (see loss for the year from discontinued 
operations). 
 
On  24  February  2016  the  sale  of  Adamo  Energy  (UK)  Ltd,  the  subsidiary  company  which  holds  the  licences,  was 
completed for £1.00 and an earn out arrangement based on a percentage of petroleum sales on the PEDL sold. This 
resulted in a loss of $5,020 before tax, primarily due to related selling costs. 
 
The loss of Adamo Energy (UK) Ltd until the date of disposal and the loss from re-measurement of assets and liabilities 
classified as held for sale is summarised as follows:
2016
Accounting and audit 
Exploration costs written off 
Legal and other consultants 
Other 
Loss for the year 
Loss on re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell 
Loss for the year for discontinued operations

Credit risk 
Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a 
financial  loss  to  the  company.  The  company  has  adopted  a  policy  of  only  dealing  with  credit  worthy 
counterparties  and  obtaining  sufficient  collateral  or  other  security  where  appropriate,  as  a  means  of 
mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.  
The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, at balance 
date to recognised financial assets, is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those 
assets, as disclosed in the balance sheet and notes to the financial statements. 
The  company  does  not  have  any  material  credit  risk  exposure  to  any  single  receivable  or  group  of 
receivables under financial instruments entered into by the company. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies arising from the sale and purchase of goods 
and services in currencies other than the group’s measurement currency. At 30 June 2016, the effect on 
the  loss  and  equity  as  a  result  of  a  10%  increase  in  the  exchange  rates,  with  all  other  variables 
remaining  constant  would  be  an  decrease  in  loss  by  $717,000  (2015:  $140,000)  and  an  increase  in 
equity by $717,000 (2015: $140,000). 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The group’s minimal exposure to interest rate risk, the only 
asset / liability affected by changes in market interest rates is Cash and cash equivalents.
