<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, visited Austria 
from 5 to 15 April 2011, at the invitation of the Government. The mission was the first 
official visit to Austria by an expert appointed by the Human Rights Council. During her 
stay, the independent expert visited Vienna, Graz, Burgenland and Klagenfurt, where she 
considered initiatives to promote diversity, inclusion and the protection and promotion of 
cultural rights, especially of minorities and marginalized people. Such groups include, in 
particular, national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrants, as well as persons 
with disabilities and living on low incomes.  
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the independent expert met with senior officials at the federal, 
State and municipal levels in the areas of culture, education, science and technology, 
women&#8217;s issues, minority issues, the media, internal and foreign affairs, as well as with 
institutions in the field of culture and media, equality and redress. She also interacted with 
academics, civil society organizations, representatives of minority associations and 
religious groups, and visited a number of cultural projects and educational institutions.  
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert thanks the Government of Austria for the opportunity to 
examine the situation of cultural rights in the country, and also thanks all stakeholders and 
interlocutors for their time, information and insights. 
</p>
<p>4. In the present note, the independent expert presents her preliminary observations and 
recommendations in the spirit of fostering further cooperation and with a view to 
contributing to the efforts to strengthen cultural rights in Austria. These will be developed 
and explored in more detail in the final report on the mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>5. The independent expert underlines a number of positive initiatives and good 
practices adopted in Austria for the protection of cultural diversity and the promotion of 
access to cultural rights by all persons, including marginalized groups. The official 
recognition of ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity in Austria, predominantly as a result 
of the State treaty of 1955, provides an important base for promoting cultural diversity and 
cultural rights. The independent expert welcomes the rights to bilingual schooling and 
topographical signs and the usage of minority languages in judicial and administrative 
procedures in particular regions. She also appreciates Government initiatives, such as the 
especially commendable codification of a Romani language and the introduction in some 
public media broadcasts of subtitles, sign language and transmissions in official minority 
languages. Furthermore, she finds encouraging that the national plan of action on 
integration was adopted in consultation with experts and civil society. A consultative 
process is also being followed in the preparation of a national plan of action on disabilities. 
With regard to cultural heritage, significant steps have been taken to increase access to 
culture, such as the National Agency for Intangible Cultural Heritage tasked with 
inventorying living cultures; actions to increase access for youth and persons with 
disabilities; and the ongoing digitalization of cultural heritage. There is a number of 
excellent initiatives promoting cultural rights, cultural diversity and inclusiveness in 
Austria, most supported by the Government. 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert appreciates the progress made and the positive initiatives 
taken in the field of cultural rights in Austria, but considers that a number of steps are 
required to bolster cultural rights for all.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Promotion of cultural diversity and of cultural rights of all 
persons 
</b></p>
<p>7. The framework of public policies, regulations and institutions currently available in 
Austria for the promotion of cultural diversity and the promotion of cultural rights of 
cultural communities is severely fragmented. Only recognized autochthonous minorities are 
granted particular rights that, however, they lose outside the specified territories. It is 
important to note that strict application of the criteria of territoriality, particularly with 
respect to rights in the field of education, could undermine efforts to safeguard the 
languages and identity of minorities. Although public authorities have shown some 
flexibility in financing cultural development, further efforts are recommended to ensure 
consistency and a more inclusive application of the rights granted to ethnic groups/national 
minorities throughout the country.    
</p>
<p>8. Despite efforts to comply with the provisions of the Ethnic Groups Act, &#8220;bilingual 
education&#8221; is actually rare. Only a few genuinely bilingual kindergarten and primary level 
schools exist, particularly in Burgenland and Carinthia, and are highly dependent on the 
personal efforts of individual teachers and principals to operate effectively . Indeed, 
minority languages are mostly taught as elective courses, with Hungarian and especially 
Romani facing considerable challenges. Bilingual primary schools that have been opened in 
other areas, such as in Graz, are welcomed.  
</p>
<p>9. A number of impediments, such as the lack of bilingual forms for administrative 
procedures and of language proficiency among officials, are considered to impede the use 
of minority languages in local public offices in the regions of ethnic groups.  
</p>
<p>10. According to the interlocutors met, the fact that few public federal officials &#8211; 
including personnel in prisons and detention centres &#8211; speak languages other than German 
hinders adequate implementation of the rights of non-German speaking sectors of the 
population, in particular people with a migrant background.  
</p>
<p>11. The independent expert encourages the Government of Austria to approach cultural 
diversity as an invaluable resource for the inclusion of all and to take measures to 
mainstream cultural diversity and the cultural heritage of the country&#8217;s diverse populations 
by, inter alia, incorporating minority cultures and history in all public schooling curricula, 
media and cultural activities; promoting intercultural competencies in all official 
institutions; and encouraging competencies in minority languages among civil servants. 
Special efforts are required to ensure the full inclusion and rights of the Roma. 
</p>
<p>12. Following previous recommendations by regional and international human rights 
bodies, the independent expert also urges the Government to consider extending support to 
linguistic and ethnic groups other than those officially recognized in Austri,a and to 
improve the existing mechanisms for the disbursement of funds for activities of national 
minorities. Greater accountability and transparency is required for European integration and 
refugees funds.  
</p>
<p>13. The security forces play a very important role in ensuring respect for and protection 
of human rights of all persons living in Austria. The Government should take all necessary 
measures to ensure the full respect of human rights and cultural diversity by all public 
officials and security forces, including by expanding its initiatives to include training on 
human rights and cultural diversity in the mandatory curricula of public officials across the 
country. The independent expert commends the concerned authorities for actively 
encouraging persons with migrant backgrounds to join the police in Vienna, and urges the 
Government to take similar initiatives across the country. To ensure genuine equal 
opportunities for persons from a migrant background, German language courses provided 
by public institutions should complement existing language exams. </p>

</p>
<p><b> IV. 2011 census 
</b></p>
<p>14. The independent expert is concerned about the data-collection system planned for 
the 2011 census, which is not intended to include statistical data on national, linguistic and 
religious affiliation, as was the case in previous censuses. Moreover, the census will be 
based on the collection of data in existing registers in various institutions, departments or 
offices, rather than on a new national and comprehensive survey; the need to be cost-
effective is put forward as a rationale for the adoption of such a system.  
</p>
<p>15. In the view of the independent expert, however, the elimination of a comprehensive 
survey impedes adequate statistical assessments of cultural diversity in terms of linguistic 
and ethnic minorities, religious communities and migrant backgrounds of Austrian 
nationals. While she appreciates the sensitivity of the issue, the absence of a statistical basis 
will impede effective planning to protect and promote cultural diversity as well as cultural 
rights in Austrian society. Many of those met, including representatives of most minorities, 
believed that there was a need for such information.   
</p>
<p>16. The independent expert recalls that concern was expressed in previous censuses at 
the methods used to collect information (namely, the lack of anonymity in questionnaires, a 
reported lack of anonymity in rural areas and small cities during data collection and alleged 
cases of intimidation by local officials) and at the reported bias or misleading nature of the 
questions asked concerning linguistic affiliation. 
</p>
<p>17. The independent expert encourages the Government to adopt a non-mandatory and 
anonymous information-gathering system with a view to allowing the compilation of a 
database on cultural diversity in Austria, including internal and international migration. 
Such a system should guarantee privacy and be respectful of the principle of self-
identification of all persons regarding their national, linguistic and religious affiliations. 
Where necessary, the Government should engage with concerned communities in dialogue 
to strengthen trust and understanding of the purpose of such survey. To that end, the 
independent expert also recommends that the Government consult with, in particular, civil 
society organizations and concerned communities with regard to the specific questions to 
be asked during the census. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Institutional framework for the promotion of cultural rights, 
cultural diversity and intercultural understanding 
</b></p>
<p>18. Effective interventions to promote diversity and enhance the implementation of 
cultural rights remain scattered and poorly known; they lack secure financial support for 
longer-term planning and an institutional framework that can facilitate upscaling, building 
on lessons and existing resources. The independent expert therefore recommends that 
consideration be given to establishing a unified framework and an institutional body, at the 
Government level, to promote cultural diversity and intercultural understanding, oversee 
cultural heritage matters and promote the right to participate in cultural life. The 
independent expert emphasizes the fact that ensuring cultural rights is about empowering 
individuals and communities to create culture as continuously evolving ways of life, each 
culture being equally valued. Measures are needed to encourage public and private media to 
avoid stigmatizing certain communities. Intercultural exchanges among diverse groups 
would help to overcome ghettoization according to attributes such as language, religion, 
ethnic background and impairment.  
</p>
<p>19. While Austria recognizes the value of cultural diversity, it is important that 
Government policies approach diversity as a resource for building Austrian society as a 
whole rather than as rights for particular groups. In this regard, it is of concern that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/38/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>integration affairs are placed within the Ministry of the Interior, which might suggest that 
&#8220;integration&#8221; is a matter of law and order rather than an opportunity to benefit from and to 
enhance the richness of the country&#8217;s diverse cultures and cultural traditions. The expert 
recommends that the Government consider addressing the issue of integration together with 
cultural diversity, either within a new entity or within the Federal Chancellery. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the field of education, the independent expert is concerned that the 
parallel schooling system, which divides education after primary school into separate 
streams of vocational training and general education, has an impact on children according 
to their background, particularly children with a migrant background, and therefore does 
not encourage intercultural understanding. The independent expert welcomes the creation 
of new middle schools and recommends the adoption of an integrated system for 
compulsory public schools.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Institutional framework for the promotion of all human 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>21. A number of legislative acts and bodies have been established to cover different 
human rights issues, such as the Austrian Ombudsperson Board, the Equal Treatment 
Commission and various Ombudsperson offices for equal treatment, people with 
disabilities, children and youth, and the Human Rights Advisory Council. However, while 
the commissions and ombudsperson offices are function well, there is no comprehensive 
institutional and legislative framework for the protection and promotion of human rights in 
Austria. The lack of a national human rights institution and national human rights plan of 
action exacerbates this fragmented approach. Combined with the insufficient domestication 
of international human rights obligations, particularly in the field of economic, social and 
cultural rights, and highly restricted possibilities for collective action before courts, this 
weakens the protection of rights. The independent expert therefore recommends that the 
Government , as a matter or priority, adopt an integrated national human rights plan of 
action and a human rights institution in conformity with the Paris Principles, mandated to 
oversee all rights, including those in the field of culture, paying special attention to the 
needs of more marginalized groups such as persons with disabilities  
</p>
<p>22. Lastly, the independent expert strongly recommends that the Government of Austria 
give adequate follow-up to the recommendations made by United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies and in the context of the country&#8217;s universal periodic review before the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> The independent expert will continue to examine the above issues and others 
that have been brought to her attention in further detail, including through a 
thorough review of large amounts of documents that the Government and other 
stakeholders have undertaken to provide. All of this will be carefully considered in the 
preparation of the full report to be submitted to the Human Rights Council in June 
2012. The independent expert looks forward to continuing engagement and 
cooperation with the Government of Austria with a view to strengthening the ongoing 
dialogue on these important issues.
