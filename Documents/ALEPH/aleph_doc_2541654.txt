Description of Business.
Item 1.
General
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 20, 2000 as Dundee Mining Inc. On
October 2, 2002, we changed our name to Dravco Mining Inc. We changed our name because we
were advised by a Canadian corporation with a similar name that we might be infringing on the
other corporation's trademark in Canada. While we believed we were not infringing on the other
corporation's trademark, we also believed that it would not be economically worthwhile to engage
in protracted litigation in Canada regarding the infringement issue.
We are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. We maintain our statutory
registered agent's office at 101 Convention Center Drive, Suite 700, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89109
and our business office is 101-1865 Dilworth Drive, Unit 404, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada
V1Y  9T1.  Our  telephone  number  is (604)  687-6991.  Our  offices  are  donated  rent  free  by  our
president.
Dravco Mining has no plans to change its business activities or to combine with another business,
and is not aware of any events or circumstances that might cause its plans to change.
Background
In July 2000, Rodney L. Lozinski, our sole officer and director, entered into an oral agreement with
Locke Goldsmith, an unrelated third party, to stake one property containing ten unpatented mining
claims in the Nickel Plate Mountain area of Hedley, Osoyoos Mining Division, British Columbia,
Canada, in exchange for $878. This is the total cost of the property. Mr. Goldsmith was paid an
additional $829 to maintain our claims. These are the only services we have paid to Mr. Goldsmith
to date. We retained the services of Mr. Goldsmith because we believed he was knowledgeable
about  mining  claims  in  British  Columbia  and  we  are  not. Mr. Goldsmith  has  been  engaged  in
mining exploration for the past 42 years. He is a registered professional engineer in the provinces
of  Ontario  and  British Columbia,  a  registered  professional  geologist  in  the  province  of  British
Columbia and the states of Oregon, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Mr. Goldsmith holds a Bachelor of
Science  degree  with  honors  in  geology  from  Michigan  Technological University,  a  Master  of
Science  degree  from  the  University  of  British  Columbia, and  has  done  postgraduate  study  in
geology  at  Michigan  Technological  Institute and the University of Nevada. He is a graduate of
Haileybury School of Mines, and a Certified Mining Technician. He is a member of the Society of
Economic Geologists, the AIME, and Fellow of the Geological Association of Canada.
The claims were conveyed by Mr. Goldsmith to Mr. Lozinski and are recorded in Mr. Lozinski's
name to avoid paying additional fees. The property is held in trust pursuant to a written declaration
executed by Mr. Lozinski. Under British Columbia law, title to mining claims must be held by a
British  Columbia corporation  or  held  by  an  individual  who  is  a  Canadian  citizen.  In  order  to
comply with the law we would have to incorporate a British Columbia wholly owned subsidiary
corporation and complete audited consolidated financial statements. We believe those costs are
unwarranted  at  this  time.  In  the  event  that  we  find mineralized  material  and  the  mineralized
material can be economically extracted, we will form a wholly owned British Columbia subsidiary
corporation  and  Mr. Lozinski  will  convey  title  to  the  properties  to  the  wholly  owned  subsidiary
corporation. Should Mr. Lozinski transfer title to another person and that deed is recorded before
we record our documents, that other person will have superior title, however, Mr. Lozinski would
be liable to us for monetary damages for breaching the terms of his agreement with us.
All Canadian lands and minerals which have not been granted to private persons are owned by
either the federal or provincial governments in the name of Her Majesty. Ungranted minerals are
commonly  known  as  Crown  minerals.  Ownership rights  to  Crown  minerals  are  vested  by  the
Canadian  Constitution  in  the  province where  the  minerals  are  located.  In  the  case  of  the
Company's  property,  that i s the province of British Columbia. In the 19th century the practice of
reserving the minerals from fee simple Crown grants was established. Legislation now ensures
that minerals are reserved from Crown land dispositions. The result is that the Crown is the largest
mineral  owner  in Canada,  both  as  the  fee  simple  owner  of  Crown  lands  and  through  mineral
reservations  in  Crown  grants.  Most  privately  held  mineral  titles  are  acquired directly  from  the
Crown.  The  Company's  property  is  one  such  acquisition. Accordingly,  fee  simple  title  to  the
Company's  property  resides  with  the  Crown. The  Company's  claims  are  mining  leases  issued
pursuant to the British Columbia Mineral Act. The lessee has exclusive rights to mine and recover
all  of  the minerals  contained  within  the  surface  boundaries  of  the  lease  continued vertically
downward. There are no native land claims that affect our title.
The property is unencumbered and there are no competitive conditions which affect the property.
Further,  there  is  no  insurance  covering  the  property  and  we believe  that  no  insurance  is
necessary since the property is unimproved and contains no buildings or improvements.
To date we have performed one day of prospecting work on the property. We are presently in the
exploration stage and we cannot guarantee that a commercially viable mineral deposit, a reserve,
exists in the property until further exploration is done and a comprehensive evaluation concludes
economic and legal feasibility.
Item 2.
Description of Property.
In July 2000, Rodney L. Lozinski, our sole officer and director, entered into an oral agreement with
Locke Goldsmith, an unrelated third party, to stake one property containing ten unpatented mining
claims in the Nickel Plate Mountain area of Hedley, Osoyoos Mining Division, British Columbia,
Canada.
Claims
The property is comprised of ten claims. They are:
1.  Cahill #3 - Tenure No. 380915 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
23, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
2.  Cahill #4 - Tenure No. 380916 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
23, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
3.  Cahill #5 - Tenure No. 380917 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
22, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
4.  Cahill #6 - Tenure No. 380918 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
23, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
5.  Cahill #7 - Tenure No. 380919 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
22, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
6.  Cahill #8 - Tenure No. 380920 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
23, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.

8.  Cahill #10 - Tenure No. 380922 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
22, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
9.  Cahill #11 - Tenure No. 380923 was recorded on October 2, 2000 and expires on September
23, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
1 0 .     Cahill #12  -  Tenure  No.  380924  was  recorded  on  October  2,  2000  and  expires  on
September 23, 2005 and contains approximately 62 acres.
Location and access
The property is located on the upper eastern slopes of Nickel Plate Mountain near the headwaters
of  Cahill  Creek  on  the  Thompson  Plateau.  The  property  is  situated approximately  three  miles
northeast of Highway 3 and approximately 3.2 miles east of the village of Hedley.
Two accessible roads lead to the north end of the property. The Nickel Plate Mine road departs
northeasterly from Highway 3 at a point approximately two miles southeast of Hedley. The Apex
Mountain  road  departs  westerly  from  Highway  97 a t Penticton.  The  two  roads  join  at  the
headwaters  of  Cahill  Creek  where  a  dirt road  branches  southwesterly  and  passes  through  the
entire property. Various spur roads within the property provide additional access.
History of previous work
The area around the property has been explored extensively since the 1890s. The property has
no history of previous exploration. There is no evidence of mining on the property and there is no
plant  or  equipment  located  on  the  property.  There are no  material  engineering  or  geological
reports concerning the property, other than governmental regional geological reports, which are
known or available to us. There is no power source on the property.
Current state of exploration
In order to maintain the claims in good standing with the government we completed one day of
prospecting in September 2001. Three rock samples and three soil samples were collected and
tested. We found no gold in five of the samples and an insignificant amount of gold in one of our
samples. Otherwise no work has been completed on the property.
Physiography
The property lies between 1,700 and 1,900 feet above sea level. Vegetation is moderate  at  all
levels. There is ample water and timber within the property to support exploration. The property is
free of snow from April through December, allowing eight to nine months of exploration each year.
The property is within easy commuting distance from Penticton, which is the nearest center with
facilities.
Property geology
The main rock types occurring in the area are volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The foregoing was
observed by Mr. Goldsmith when he visited the property. We have been advised by Mr. Goldsmith
that  gold  may  be  found  in  some  volcanic  and sedimentary  rock,  however,  not  all  volcanic  and
sedimentary rock contains gold. We do not know if there are potentially significant occurrences of
economic mineralization on the property.
W e currently  maintain  limited  office  space  occupied  by  Rodney  Lozinski,  our  sole officer  and
director,  for  which  we  do  not  pay  any  rent.  The  address  is  101-1865 Dilworth  Drive,  Unit  404,
Kelowna,  British  Columbia,  Canada  V1Y  9T1.  We  do not believe  that  we  will  need  to  obtain
additional office space at any time in the foreseeable future until we commence our exploration
program.
Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.
We are not party to any pending litigation and to the best of our knowledge none is contemplated
or threatened.
Item 4.
Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2004.
PART II
Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholders Matters.
Market Information
There is currently no public trading market for our common stock. We have made application to
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”) to attempt to have our common stock
eligible for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”). No assurance
can be given that our common stock will be accepted to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB or
whether an active trading market will ever be developed, or if developed, will be maintained.
There are no plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any person with regards to
the development of a trading market in any of our securities.
Holders
As at March 16, 2005 the Company had 49 shareholders of record of common stock.
Dividends
The Company has never declared any cash dividends with respect to its common stock and does
not  intend  to  declare  dividends  in  the  foreseeable  future.  There  are n o material  restrictions
limiting, or that are likely to limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends in its common stock.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
None.
Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act
The Company’s shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended  that  imposes  additional  sales  practice  requirements  on broker/dealers  who  sell  such
securities  to  persons  other  than  established customers  and  accredited  investors  (generally
institutions  with  assets  in  excess of  $5,000,000  or  individuals  with  net  worth  in  excess  of
$1,000,000  or  annual income  exceeding  $200,000  or  $300,000  jointly  with  their  spouses).  For
transactions covered by the Rule, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination
for the purchase and have received the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction prior to
the sale. Consequently, the Rule may affect the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and
also  may affect  your  ability  to  sell  your  shares  in  the  secondary  market.  Section  15(g) of  the
Exchange  Act  also  imposes  additional  sales  practice  requirements  on broker/dealers  who  sell
penny securities. These rules require a one-page summary of certain essential items. The items
include  the  risk  of  investing  in  penny stocks  in  both  public  offerings  and  secondary  marketing;
terms important in the understanding of the function of the penny stock market, such as “bid” and
“offer” quotes, a dealers “spread” and broker/deal compensation; the broker/dealer compensation,
the broker/dealers duties to its customers, including the disclosures required by any other penny
stock  disclosure  rules, the  customers  rights  and  remedies  in  causes  of  fraud  in  penny  stock
transactions;  and,  the  NASD’s  toll  free  telephone  number  and  the  central  number of  the  North
American Administrators Association for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers
and their associates persons.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
None.
Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities
Our SB2 Registration Statement was declared effective on February 10, 2003 (Commission file
no.  333-54044).  We  offered  up  to  a  total  of  4,000,000  shares  of  common stock  on  a  self
underwritten basis, 2,000,000 minimum, 4,000,000 shares maximum at the offering price of $0.05
per share. On March 10, 2004, we completed our public offering by raising $200,000. We sold
4,000,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $0.05 per share. No direct or indirect
payments were  made  to  directors,  officers,  general  partners  of  the  issuer  or  their associates  in
connection with the offer.
Use of  Proceeds  -  From  February  10,  2003  (Effective  Date  of  Registration  Statement) to
December 31, 2004
We completed our public offering on March 10, 2004, from the $200,000 raised, we have incurred
$1,637.75  in  exploration  costs,  $4,472.60  in  audit  fees,  $4,400 i n legal  fees;  and  $5,995.87  in
general working capital, for a total of $16,506.22.
Item 6. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation.
This section  of  this  report  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  are  based  on th e current
beliefs  and  expectations  of  management,  as  well  as  assumptions  made b y , and  information
currently available to, the Company’s management. Because such statements involve risks and
uncertainties, actual actions and strategies and the timing and expected results thereof may differ
materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project
and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes and other
financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-KSB.
Plan of Operation
Our proposed exploration program
W e a re prospecting  for  gold.  Our  target  is  mineralized  material.  Our  success  depends upon
finding mineralized material. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated
by appropriate spaced drilling or underground sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average
grade  of  metals  to  justify  removal. If we  do  not  find  mineralized  material  or  we  cannot  remove
mineralized  material, either  because  we  do  not  have  the  money  to  do  it  or  because  it  is  not
economically feasible to do it, we may suspend or cease operations.
In addition, we may not have enough money to complete our exploration of our property. If it turns
out  that  we  have  not  raised  enough  money  to  complete our exploration program, we  will  try  to
raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private placement or loans. At the present
time, we have not made any plans to raise additional money and there is no assurance that we
would b e able to raise additional money in the future. If we need additional money and cannot
raise it, we may suspend or cease operations.
We must conduct exploration to determine what amount of minerals, if any, exist on our properties
and if any minerals that are found can be economically extracted and profitably processed.
Our property is undeveloped raw land. Our offering is concluded, we intend to start exploration
operations.  To  our  knowledge,  the  property  has  never  been  mined. The only  event  that  has
occurred  is  the  staking  of  the  property  by  Locke  Goldsmith and  a  physical  examination  of  the
property. The cost of staking the claims was included in the $878 we paid to Mr. Goldsmith. In
addition, we paid Mr. Goldsmith $686 in 2002 and $143 in 2003 to maintain the claims in good
standing. During the year, we renewed our claims with the Ministry of Energy and Mines in British
Columbia.
We are proceeding with our exploration program in the following three phases:
Phase 1  begun  with  research  of  the  available  geological  literature,  personal  interviews with
geologists, mining engineers and others familiar with the prospect sites. To date, this phase of the
exploration process is ongoing by researching available literature over the Internet and through
other sources such as books and magazines.
Weather interruptions in the province of British Columbia have effected and contributed to a delay
in our proposed exploration operations. Once the winter weather conditions in British Columbia
improve and Mr. Locke Goldsmith is available to assist us, our initial work will be augmented with
geologic  mapping,  geophysical testing and geochemical testing of our claims. When available,
existing workings, like trenches, prospect pits, shafts or tunnels will be examined. If an apparent
mineralized  zone  is  identified  and  narrowed  down  to  a  specific area by  the  studies,  we  will  to
begin trenching the area.
Trenches are  generally  approximately  150  ft.  in  length  and  10-20  ft.  wide.  These dimensions
allow for a thorough examination of the surface of the vein structure types generally encountered
in the area. They also allow easier restoration of the land to its pre-exploration condition when we
conclude our operations. Once excavation of a trench is completed, samples are taken and then
analyzed for economically potential minerals that are known to have occurred in the area. Careful
interpretation of this available data collected from the various tests aid in determining whether or
not the prospect has current economic potential and whether further exploration is warranted.
Phase 1 will take about 3 months once undertaken and cost up to $20,000.
Phase 2 involves an initial examination of the underground characteristics of the vein structure
that was identified by Phase 1 of exploration. Phase 2 is aimed at identifying any mineral deposits
of potential economic importance. The methods employed are
* more extensive trenching
  * more advanced geophysical work
drift driving
*
Drift driving is the process of constructing a tunnel to take samples of minerals for testing. Later,
the tunnel can be used for mining minerals. The geophysical work gives a general understanding
of the location and extent of mineralization at depths that are unreachable by surface excavations
and  provides  a  target  for more  extensive  trenching  and  core  drilling.  Trenching  identifies  the
continuity and extent of mineralization, if any, below the surface. After a thorough analysis of the
data collected in Phase 2, we will decide if the property warrants a Phase 3 study.
Phase 2 will take about 3 months and cost up to $40,000.
Phase 3 is aimed at precisely defining the depth, the width, the length, the tonnage and the value
per ton of any mineral  body.  This  is  accomplished  through  extensive drift driving. Phase 3 will
take about 6 months and cost up to $80,000.
The breakdown of estimated times and dollars for each phase was made by the board of directors.
We do not intend to interest other companies in the property if we find mineralized materials. We
intend to try to develop the reserves ourselves.
If we are unable to complete a phase of exploration because we do not have enough money, we
will cease operations until we raise more money. If we cannot or do not raise additional money,
we will cease operations.
We cannot provide you with a more detailed discussion of how our exploration program will work
and what we expect will be our likelihood of success. That is because we have a piece of raw
land  and  we  intend  to  look  for  gold.  We  may  or  may  not find any  mineralized  material.  It  is
impossible to predict the likelihood of such an event.
We will not move onto a subsequent phase until the phase we are working on is completed.
We do  not have any plan to take the Company from Phase 3 exploration to revenue generation
until we have determined its economic feasibility.
We do not intend to hire additional employees at this time. All of the work on the property will be
conducted by unaffiliated independent contractors that we will hire. The independent contractors
will  be  responsible  for  surveying,  geology, engineering,  exploration,  and  excavation.  The
geologists  will  evaluate  the information  derived  from  the  exploration  and  excavation  and  the
engineers will advise us on the economic feasibility of removing the mineralized material.
We will be conducting research in the form of exploration of our property. We are not going to buy
or  sell  any  plant  or  significant  equipment  during  the  next  twelve months.  We  will  not  buy  any
equipment until we have located a body of ore and we have determined it is economical to extract
the ore from the land.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There i s no  historical  financial  information  about  Dravco  Mining  Inc.  upon  which  to base an
evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage corporation and have not generated
any  revenues  from  operations.  We  cannot  guarantee  we  will b e successful  in  our  business
operations.  Our  business  is  subject  to  risks  inherent in  the  establishment  of  a  new  business
enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our properties,
and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services.
To become profitable and competitive, we will have to conduct research and exploration o f our
properties before we start production of any minerals we may find. In the event that the funds we
raised in our initial public offering is not sufficient, we have no assurance that future financing will
be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may
be  unable t o continue,  develop  or  expand  our  operations.  Equity  financing  could  result  in
additional dilution to existing shareholders.
Before gold retrieval can begin, we must explore for and find mineralized material. After that has
occurred we have to determine if it is economically feasible to remove the mineralized material.
Economically  feasible  means  that  the  costs associated  with  the  removal  of  the  mineralized
material will not exceed the price at which we can sell the mineralized material. We cannot predict
what that will be until we find mineralized material.
W e do  not know  if  we  will  find  mineralized  material.  We  believe  that  activities  occurring on
adjoining properties are not material to our activities. The reason is that whatever is located under
adjoining property may or may not be located under our property.
Our exploration program is designed to economically explore and evaluate our properties.
We do not claim to have any minerals or reserves whatsoever at this time on any of our properties.
We intend to implement an exploration program that consists of core sampling. Core sampling is
the process of drilling holes to a depth of up to 1,400 feet in order to extract a sample of earth. Mr.
Goldsmith will assist us in determining where drilling will occur on the property. The samples will
be tested to determine if mineralized material is located on the property. Based upon the tests of
the  core  samples,  we  will  determine  if  we  will  suspend  operations, proceed  with  additional
exploration of the property, or develop the property. The proceeds from our offering are designed
to only fund the costs of core sampling and testing. We intend to take our core samples to ALS
Chemex, analytical  chemists,  and  registered  assayers  located  in  North  Vancouver,  British
Columbia, Canada.
W e estimate  the  cost  of  sampling  will  be  $20  per  foot  drilled.  The  amount  of drilling  will  be
predicated upon the amount of money raised in our offering. As we raised the maximum amount of
money, we intend to drill approximately 7,000 linear feet, or up to 23 holes to a depth of 300 feet.
We estimate that it will take up to three months to drill 20 holes to a depth of 300 feet. We intend to
pay Mr. Goldsmith up to a maximum of $5,000 per month for his services during the three-month
period or a maximum of $15,000. The total cost for analyzing the core samples is estimated to be
$3,000. We intend to begin drilling within 90 days after our financing is closed, weather permitting.
We do not intend to interest other companies in our property if we find mineralized materials. We
intend to try to develop the reserves ourselves.

Results of Operations
Twelve Months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
W e are  a start-up,  exploration  stage  corporation  and  have  not  yet  generated  or  realized any
revenues from our business operations.
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is
doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no
revenues  are  anticipated until we  begin  removing  and  selling  minerals.  Accordingly,  we  must
raise cash from sources other than the sale of minerals found on the property. That cash must be
raised from other sources. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in
Dravco Mining Inc. We must raise cash to implement our project and stay in business. On March
10, 2004, w e completed  our  public  offering  and  raised  the  maximum  amount  of  money  in  our
offering, $200,000. We do not know how long the money will last, however, we do believe it will
last twelve months. It depends upon the amount of exploration we conduct and the cost thereof.
We  will  not  know  that  information  until  we  begin exploring  our  property.  Now  that  we  have
completed our offering, we will begin exploration of our property.
The money that we have raised will be applied to exploration as set forth in our prospectus. If we
find mineralized material and it is economically feasible to remove the mineralized material, we
will attempt to raise additional money through a subsequent private placement, public offering or
through loans to finance the removal of the mineralized material. If we need additional cash and
cannot  raise  it  we  will  either  have  to  suspend  operations  until  we  do  raise the cash,  or  cease
operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.
From Inception on September 20, 2000 to December 31, 2004
We acquired our first property. We have staked the property. We completed our public offering on
March 10, 2004. We have begun research of available geological information. We have renewed
our claims with the Ministry of Energy and Mines in British Columbia. We had expected to begin
core  drilling  and exploration  within  90  days  of  completing  our  offering,  weather  permitting, but
have been delayed due to winter weather conditions.
Since inception, we have used our common stock to raise money for the property acquisition, for
corporate  expenses  and  to  repay  outstanding  indebtedness. Net cash  provided  by  the  sale  of
shares from inception on September 20, 2000 to December 31, 2004 was $200,050. In addition, a
related party advanced a total of $43,127 to us, which must be repaid.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of the date of this report, we have yet to generate any revenues from our business operations.
We issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock through a Section 4(2) offering in September 2000
to  Rodney  L.  Lozinski,  our  sole  officer  and  director. This  was  accounted  for  as  a  cash  shares
purchase of $50.
On March 10, 2004 we issued an additional 4,000,000 shares of common stock against proceeds
of $200,000 pursuant to our public offering.
Since our inception, Mr. Lozinski, has advanced the total sum of $43,127. $30,000 was used for
legal fees relating to organizational and start-up costs, $1,707 was used to pay Locke Goldsmith
for the initial claims and subsequent maintenance work, $7,210 was for audit fees, $2,397 was
used to pay filing fees and $1,813 was used for general administrative and operating capital. The
loan  does  not  bear interest  and  has  not  been  repaid  as  of  the  date  hereof.  There  are  no
documents reflecting the loan and they are not due on a specific date. Mr. Lozinski will accept
repayment from us when money is available.
As of December 31, 2004 we had cash resources of $185,560. We had total liabilities of $50,388.
This was comprised of the $43,127 loan from Mr. Lozinski, $3,800 for administrative and general
office expenses, $1,000.00 for legal fees and $2,461 for audit fees.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company's  discussions  and  analysis  of  its  financial  condition  and  results  of operations,
including  the  discussion  on  liquidity  and  capital  resources,  are based  upon  the  Company's
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported  amounts o f assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of
contingent assets and liabilities.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its obligations in the normal course of
business. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to
realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in
the  balances  set  out  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements.  The Company  will  require
additional  capital  to  fund  any  future  plan  of  operations. There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the
Company will be able to raise additional capital, and if the Company is unable to raise additional
capital, it will unlikely be able to continue as a going concern.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders of
Dravco Mining Inc.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Dravco Mining Inc. as at December 31,
2004 and 2003 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’equity and cash flows for
the years then ended and for the period cumulative from inception on September 20, 2000 to
December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Dravco Mining Inc. as at December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended and for the period cumulative from inception on
September 20, 2000 to December 31, 2004 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will
continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is
in the exploration stage with respect to its mineral property. The Company has not determined
whether the exploration property contains ore reserves that are economically recoverable. At
December 31, 2004 the Company has limited cash resources and will require new financing to
maintain operations and initiate exploration work on its mineral property. Management intends to
secure additional financing through the issuance of common stock. However, there can be no
assurance that management will be successful in its efforts to secure additional financing through
the issuance of common stock, or that it will ever develop a self-supporting business. These
factors together raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

DRAVCO MINING INC.
(An Exploration Stage Company)
Notes to the Financial Statements
December 31, 2004 and 2003
NOTE 1 - NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
The Company  was  incorporated  in  the  State  of  Nevada  on  September  20,  2000  as  Dundee
Mining Inc. On October 2, 2002 the Company changed its name to Dravco Mining Inc.
The Company  does  not  own  any  property.  Since  inception  the  Company  acquired  the right  to
conduct exploration activity on 10 mineral claims in British Columbia, Canada for consideration of
$878.00. Title to the property upon which the Company intends to conduct exploration activities, is
not held by the Company. Title to the property is recorded in the name of Mr. Rodney Lozinski,
president and  sole  director  of  the  Company.  The  property  is  held  in  trust  pursuant  to a  written
declaration executed by Mr. Lozinski. If Mr. Lozinski transfers the property to another third party,
the third party will obtain good title and the Company will have no claim on the property. Since Mr.
Lozinski  is  the  president and  sole  director  of  the  Company  and  has  a  fiduciary  duty  to  the
Company, the Company would have cause of action against Mr. Lozinski for breach of fiduciary
duty. The amount of damages would be the value of the property at that period of time, the value of
which is unknown at this period of time. To date, the Company has not conducted any exploration
on the claims. Management intends to conduct a preliminary exploration program to assess the
potential of the claims.
The Company has not determined whether the exploration property contains ore reserves that are
economically recoverable. At December 31, 2004 the Company has limited cash resources and
will  require  new  financing  to  maintain  operations and initiate  exploration  work  on  its  mineral
property.  Management  intends  to  secure additional  financing  through  the  issuance  of  common
stock. However, there can be no assurance that management will be successful in its efforts to
secure additional financing through the issuance of common stock, or that it will ever develop a
self-supporting  business.  These  factors  together  raise  substantial doubt  about  the  Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. .
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the
time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
Mineral property costs
All exploration and maintenance costs incurred on the mineral property are expensed as incurred,
until  it  has  been  determined  that  the  mineral  property  can  be economically  developed.
Development costs thereafter will be capitalized. All capitalized costs will be amortized over the
estimated productive life of the property if it is placed into commercial production. If the property is
sold or allowed to lapse, the related costs will be charged to operations in the period.
The carrying value of the mineral property is subject to periodic review for impairment whenever
events  and  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the carrying  value  of  the  asset  may  not  be
recoverable. Any losses will be charged to operations at the time impairment is determined.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $nil for the year ended
December 31, 2004 (2003: $nil).
Stock-based compensation
The Company  accounts  for  stock  options  and  similar  equity  instruments  issued  in accordance
with SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and SFAS No. 148 “Accounting
for  Stock-Based  Compensation  -  Transition  and  Disclosure”, an amendment to  SFAS  No.  123.
Accordingly, compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted
to employees are measured at the fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the expected
vesting period with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. Transactions in which
goods  or  services  are received  from  non-employees  in  exchange  for  the  issuance  of  equity
instruments are  accounted  for  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or the fair
value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. As at December
31, 2004 and 2003 the Company has not issued any stock options or similar equity instruments.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  expected future  tax  consequences  of
events  that  have  been  recognized  in  the  Company’s financial  statements  or  tax  returns.  In
estimating future tax consequences, all expected future events other than enactment of changes
in the tax laws or rates are considered.
Due to the  uncertainty  regarding  the  Company’s  future  profitability,  the  future  tax benefits  of  its
losses  have  been  fully  reserved  for  and  no  net  tax  benefit has been  recorded  in  the  financial
statements.
Loss per share
Basic loss  per  common  share  has  been  calculated  based  on  the  weighted  average  number of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share on the potential exercise of
options and warrants is not presented where anti-dilutive.
Use of estimates
T h e preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  United  States  generally accepted
accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Financial instruments and financial risk
The Company’s  financial  instruments  consist  of  cash,  accounts  payable  and  accrued liabilities
and  amounts  due  to  a  related  party.  The  fair  values  of  the  current assets  and  liabilities
approximate their carrying amount due to their short-term nature.
The Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest,  credit  or  currency  risk  arising from  these
financial instruments.

NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES
N o provision  for  income  taxes  has  been  made  for  the  periods  presented  as  the Company  has
incurred net losses.
The potential benefit of net operating loss carry forwards has not been recognized in the financial
statements since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit
will be utilized in future years. The components of the net deferred tax asset, the statutory tax rate,
the effective rate and the elected amount of the valuation allowance are as follows:

Changes in  and  Disagreements  with  Accountants  on  Accounting  and  Financial
Disclosure.
There have been no disagreements on accounting and financial disclosures from the inception of
the Company through the date of this Form 10-KSB. Our financial statements for the last two fiscal
years  ended  December  31,  2004  and  2003, included  in  this  report  have  been  audited  by
Hoogendoorn  Vellmer,  Chartered Accountants,  406-455  Granville  Street,  Vancouver,  British
Columbia, Canada V6C 1T1, as set forth in their report included herein.
Item 8A.
Controls and Procedures.
(a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period
specified  in  the  SEC's  rules  and  forms.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures include,  without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the  reports  filed  under  the  Exchange Act is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report,  the
Company  carried  out  an  evaluation,  under  the  supervision  and  with the  participation  of  the
Company's management, including  the  Company's  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
