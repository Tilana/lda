

the proxy need not vote on a show of hands, but if the proxy does so, the proxy must 
vote that way (ie as directed); and
if  the  proxy  has  2  or  more  appointments  that  specify  different  ways  to  vote  on  the 
resolution, the proxy must not vote on a show of hands; and
if the proxy is the chair of the meeting at which the resolution is voted on, the proxy must 
vote on a poll, and must vote that way (ie as directed); and
if the proxy is not the chair, the proxy need not vote on the poll, but if the proxy does so, 
the proxy must vote that way (ie as directed).

resolution at a meeting of the Company's members; and
the appointed proxy is not the chair of the meeting; and

2.1
RESOLUTION 1 – ADOPTION OF REMUNERATION REPORT
General
The  Corporations  Act  requires  that  at  a  listed  company’s  annual  general  meeting,  a 
resolution  that  the  remuneration  report  be  adopted  must  be  put  to  the  shareholders. 
However,  such  a  resolution  is  advisory  only  and  does  not  bind  the  company  or  the 
directors of the company.
The  remuneration  report  sets  out  the  company’s  remuneration  arrangements  for  the 
directors and senior management of the company. The remuneration report is part of the 
directors’ report contained in the annual financial report of the company for a financial 
year.
The chair of the meeting must allow a reasonable opportunity for its shareholders to ask 
questions about or make comments on the remuneration report at the annual general 
meeting.
2.2
Voting consequences
Under  changes  to  the  Corporations  Act  which  came  into  effect  on  1  July  2011,  a 
company  is  required  to  put  to  its  shareholders  a  resolution  proposing  the  calling  of 
another  meeting  of  shareholders  to  consider  the  appointment  of  directors  of  the 
company  (Spill  Resolution)  if,  at  consecutive  annual  general  meetings,  at  least  25%  of 
the  votes  cast  on  a  remuneration  report  resolution  are  voted  against  adoption  of  the 
remuneration report and at the first of those annual general meetings a Spill Resolution 
was not put to vote. If required, the Spill Resolution must be put to vote at the second of 
those annual general meetings.
If  more  than  50%  of  votes  cast  are  in  favour  of  the  Spill  Resolution,  the  company  must 
convene  a  shareholder  meeting  (Spill  Meeting)  within  90  days  of  the  second  annual 
general meeting.
All  of  the  directors  of  the  company  who  were  in  office  when  the  directors'  report  (as 
included in the company’s annual financial report for the most recent financial year) was 
approved, other than the managing director of the company, will cease to hold office 
immediately before the end of the Spill Meeting but may stand for re-election at the Spill 
Meeting.
Following the Spill Meeting those persons whose election or re-election as directors of the 
company is approved will be the directors of the company.

Previous voting results
At  the  Company’s  previous  annual  general  meeting  the  votes  cast  against  the 
remuneration  report  considered  at  that  annual  general  meeting  were  less  than  25%.

RESOLUTION 2 – RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTOR – PETER BUCK
ASX Listing Rule 14.4 provides that a director of an entity must not hold office (without re-
election) past the third AGM following the director’s appointment or 3 years, whichever is 
the longer.
In  accordance  with  clause  11.3  of  the  Constitution,  at  every  Annual  General  Meeting, 
one  third  of  the  Directors  (or  if  the  number  of  Directors  is  not  a  multiple  of  3,  then  the 
number nearest to one third and, in any event, such number as is appropriate to ensure 
that  no  Director  other  than  the  Managing  Director  holds  office  for  more  than  3  years 
without being re-elected) for the time being must retire from office by rotation and are 
eligible for re-election.
The  Directors  to  retire  are  those  who  have  been  in  office  for  3  years  since  their 
appointment  or  last  re-appointment  or  who  have  been  longest  in  office  since  their 
appointment or last re-appointment or, if the Directors have been in office for an equal 
length of time, by agreement.
These requirements for a Director to retire do not  apply to a  Managing Director  (but if 
there  is  more  than  one  Managing  Director,  only  one  is  exempt  from  retirement).  In 
determining the number and identity of the Directors to retire by rotation, the Managing 
Director and any Director seeking election after appointment by the Board to fill a casual 
vacancy are not taken into account.
The  Company  currently  has  4  Directors,  other  than  the  Managing  Director,  and 
accordingly 1 must retire.
Peter has been in office for 3 years since his last re-appointment and accordingly retires 
by rotation and seeks re-election.
The  Board  supports  Peter’s  re-election  and  recommend  Shareholders  vote  in  favour  of 
Resolution 2.

Peter  is  a  geologist  with  more  than  forty  (40)  years  of  international  mineral  exploration 
and production experience, principally in nickel, base metals and gold. During his career 
he  has  been  associated  with  the  discovery  and  development  of  a  number  of  mineral 
deposits in Australia and Brazil.
Peter worked with WMC for twenty three (23) years in a variety of senior exploration and 
production  roles  both  in  Australia  and  Brazil  before  joining  Forrestania  Gold  NL  as 
Exploration  Manager  in  1994.  Forrestania  Gold  was  subsequently  acquired  by  LionOre 
International  Ltd  with  whom  he  became  the  Director  of  Exploration  and  Geology  until 
mid-2006.  Peter  managed  the  highly  successful  exploration  team  that  delineated  the 
Maggie Hays nickel deposit and discovered the Emily Ann, Waterloo and Amorac nickel 
deposits and the two million ounce Thunderbox gold deposit in Western Australia. All of 
these were subsequently developed into mines. Peter played a key senior management 
role  in  progressing  these  deposits  through  feasibility  studies  to  production.  Peter  also 
played  key  senior  advisory  roles  in  indigenous  relations  in  Australia  and  in  LionOre 
International’s  African  operations  and  new  business  development.  During  this  period 
Peter was also a Non-Executive Director with Gallery Resources Limited and Breakaway 
Resources Limited (Breakaway).
In 2006, Peter played a key role in managing a divestment of a large portion of LionOre 
Australia’s  nickel  exploration  portfolio  into  Breakaway.  Following  this  transaction,  Peter 
became  the  Managing  Director  of  Breakaway  and  led  the  team  that  discovered 
extensions to a series of nickel and base deposits in WA and Queensland. In 2009, Peter 
left Breakaway to pursue other professional and personal interests.
From 2010 until early 2013 Peter chaired the Canadian Company, PMI Gold (‘PMI”), and 
played a key role in co-listing the company on the ASX. The role entailed a revamping of 
the  strategy  of  the  company  to  fast-track  the  advancement  of  the  company’s 
Ghanaian  gold  assets  and  in  particular  the  preparation  of  the  multi-million  ounce 
Obotan gold deposit. Also the role entailed overseeing PMI’s transition to a merger of the

RESOLUTION 3 – RATIFICATION OF PREVIOUS ISSUE OF SECURITIES
General
On 16 October 2015 the Company announced that it would undertake a placement of 
79,500,000  Shares  and  39,750,000  free  Attaching  Options  to  sophisticated  investors 
(Placement).
These Shares and Attaching Options were issued in two tranches on 16 October 2015 and 
19 October 2015 respectively.
30,550,000 Shares and 39,750,000 Attaching Options were issued pursuant to Listing Rule 
7.1. 48,950,000 Shares were issued pursuant to Listing Rule 7.1A.
Resolution 3 seeks Shareholder ratification pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 7.4 for the issue of 
the Shares and Attaching Options under the Placement (Ratification).
11
4.2
ASX Listing Rule 7.1
ASX Listing Rule 7.1 provides that a company must not, subject to specified exceptions, 
issue  or  agree  to  issue  more  equity  securities  during  any  12  month  period  than  that 
amount which represents 15% of the number of fully paid ordinary securities on issue at 
the commencement of that 12 month period.
ASX Listing Rule 7.4 sets out an exception to ASX Listing Rule 7.1. It provides that, where a 
company  in  general  meeting  ratifies  the  previous  issue  of  securities  made  pursuant  to 
ASX Listing Rule 7.1 (and provided that the previous issue did not breach ASX Listing Rule 
7.1), those securities will be deemed to have been made with shareholder approval for 
the purpose of ASX Listing Rule 7.1.
By ratifying, under Resolution 3, the issue of 30,550,000 Shares and 39,750,000 Attaching 
Options  issued  under  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.1  as  part  of  the  Placement,  the  Company  will 
retain the flexibility to issue equity securities in the future up to the 15% annual placement 
capacity  set  out  in  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.1  without  the  requirement  to  obtain  prior 
Shareholder approval.
4.3
ASX Listing Rule 7.1A
ASX  Listing  Rule  7.1A  provides  that,  in  addition  to  issues  permitted  without  prior 
shareholder  approval  under  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.1,  an  entity  that  is  eligible  and  obtains 
shareholder approval under ASX Listing Rule 7.1A may issue or agree to issue during the 
period the approval is valid a number of quoted equity securities which represents 10% of 
the  number  of  fully  paid  ordinary  securities  on  issue  at  the  commencement  of  that 
12 month period as adjusted in accordance with the formula in ASX Listing Rule 7.1.
Where an eligible entity obtains shareholder approval to increase its placement capacity 
under  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.1A  then  any  ordinary  securities  issued  under  that  additional 
placement capacity:
(a)
(b)
will not be counted in variable “A” in the formula in ASX Listing Rule 7.1A; and
are counted in variable “E”,
until  their  issue  has  been  ratified  under  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.4  (and  provided  that  the 
previous issue did not breach ASX Listing Rule 7.1A) or 12 months has passed since their 
issue.
By ratifying, under Resolution 3, the issue of 48,950,000 Shares issued under ASX Listing Rule 
7.1A as part of the Placement, the base figure (ie variable “A”) in which the Company’s 
15%  and  10%  annual  placement  capacities  are  calculated  will  be  a  higher  number 
which in turn will allow a proportionately higher number of securities to be issued without 
prior  Shareholder  approval  (although  note  that  the  Company’s  use  of  the  10%  annual 
placement  capacity  following  this  Meeting  remains  conditional  on  Resolution  5  being 
passed by the requisite majority.)
4.4
Technical information required by ASX Listing Rule 7.5
For  the  purposes  of  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.5,  the  following  information  is  provided  to 
shareholders in relation to the Ratification:
(a)
79,500,000 Shares were issued on the following basis:
(i)
(ii)
30,550,000 Shares issued pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 7.1; and
48,950,000 Shares issued pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 7.1A;
(b)
39,750,000 Attaching Options were issued pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 7.1;
12
5.

(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
the  Shares  were  issued  at  an  issue  price  of  $0.007  per  Placement  Share.  The 
Attaching  Options  were  issued  for  nil  cash  consideration  as  they  were  free 
attaching;
the Shares issued were in the same class of the Company’s existing quoted fully 
paid ordinary shares. The Attaching Options were issued in the same class of the 
Company’s  then  existing  listed  Options.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  the 
Attaching Options are set out in Schedule 2;
the  Shares  and  Attaching  Options  were  issued  to  sophisticated  investors  who 
are unrelated parties of the Company; and
a  total  of  $558,250  was  raised  from  the  Placement.  The  funds  were  used  for 
tenement  tenure  costs,  exploration  activities  and  working  capital  by  the 
Company in the pursuit of its activities as detailed in Schedule 1.
RESOLUTION 4 – APPROVAL OF 10% PLACEMENT CAPACITY
General
ASX Listing Rule 7.1A provides that an Eligible Entity may seek Shareholder approval at its 
annual general meeting to allow it to issue Equity Securities up to 10% of its issued capital 
(10% Placement Capacity).
The Company is an Eligible Entity.
If  Shareholders  approve  Resolution  4,  the  number  of  Equity  Securities  the  Eligible  Entity 
may  issue  under  the  10%  Placement  Capacity  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with 
the formula prescribed in ASX Listing Rule 7.1A.2 (as set out in section 5.2 below).
The effect of Resolution 4 will be to allow the Company to issue Equity Securities up to 
10%  of  the  Company’s  fully  paid  ordinary  securities  on  issue  under  the  10%  Placement 
Capacity  during  the  period  up  to  12  months  after  the  Meeting,  without  subsequent 
Shareholder  approval  and  without  using  the  Company’s  15%  annual  placement 
capacity granted under Listing Rule 7.1.
Resolution  4  is  a  special  resolution.  Accordingly,  at  least  75%  of  votes  cast  by 
Shareholders present and eligible to vote at the Meeting must be in favour of Resolution 4 
for it to be passed.
5.2
ASX Listing Rule 7.1A
ASX Listing Rule 7.1A enables an Eligible Entity to seek shareholder approval at its annual 
general meeting to issue Equity Securities in addition to those under the Eligible Entity’s 
15% annual placement capacity.
An Eligible Entity is one that, as at the date of the relevant annual general meeting:
(a)
(b)
is not included in the S&P/ASX 300 Index; and
has  a  maximum  market  capitalisation  (excluding  restricted  securities  and 
securities quoted on a deferred settlement basis) of $300,000,000.
The Company is an Eligible Entity as it is not included in the S&P/ASX 300 Index and has a 
current market capitalisation at the date of this Notice of less than $300,000,000.
Any  Equity  Securities  issued  must  be  in  the  same  class  as  an  existing  class  of  quoted 
Equity Securities. The Company currently has one (1) class of quoted Equity Securities on 
issue, being 902,836,774 Shares (ASX Code: AZY).
13
The exact number of Equity Securities that the Company may issue under an approval 
under Listing Rule 7.1A will be calculated according to the following formula:
(A x D) – E
Where:
A
D
E
is  the  number  of  Shares  on  issue  12  months  before  the  date  of  issue  or 
agreement:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
plus the number of Shares issued in the previous 12 months under an 
exception in ASX Listing Rule 7.2;
plus  the  number  of  partly  paid  shares  that  became  fully  paid  in  the 
previous 12 months;
plus  the  number  of  Shares  issued  in  the  previous  12  months  with 
approval of holders of Shares under Listing Rules 7.1 and 7.4. This does 
not include an issue of fully paid ordinary shares under the entity’s 15% 
placement capacity without shareholder approval; and
(iv)
less the number of Shares cancelled in the previous 12 months.
is 10%.
is the number of Equity Securities issued or agreed to be issued under ASX Listing 
Rule 7.1A.2 in the 12 months before the date of issue or agreement to issue that 
are  not  issued  with  the  approval  of  holders  of  Ordinary  Securities  under  ASX 
Listing Rule 7.1 or 7.4.
5.3
Technical information required by ASX Listing Rule 7.1A
Pursuant  to  and  in  accordance  with  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.3A,  the  information  below  is 
provided in relation to this Resolution 4:
(a)
Minimum Price
The  minimum  price  at which  the  Equity  Securities  may  be  issued  is  75%  of  the 
volume  weighted  average  price  of  Equity  Securities  in  that  class,  calculated 
over  the  15  ASX  trading  days  on  which  trades  in  that  class  were  recorded 
immediately before:
(i)
(ii)
the date on which the price at which the Equity Securities are to be 
issued is agreed; or
if the Equity Securities are not issued within 5 ASX trading days of the 
date  in  section  5.3(a)(i),  the  date  on  which  the  Equity  Securities  are 
issued.
(b)
Date of Issue
The  Equity  Securities  may  be  issued  under  the  10%  Placement  Capacity 
commencing on the date of the Meeting and expiring on the first to occur of 
the following:
(i)
(ii)
12 months after the date of this Meeting; and
the  date  of  approval  by  Shareholders  of  any  transaction  under  ASX 
Listing Rules 11.1.2 (a significant change to the nature or scale of the 
Company’s  activities)  or  11.2  (disposal  of  the  Company’s  main 
undertaking)  (after  which  date,  an  approval  under  Listing  Rule  7.1A 
ceases to be valid),
14
(10% Placement Capacity Period).
(c)
Risk of voting dilution
Any issue of Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Capacity will dilute the 
interests of Shareholders who do not receive any Shares under the issue.
If  Resolution  4  is  approved  by  Shareholders  and  the  Company  issues  the 
maximum  number  of  Equity  Securities  available  under  the  10%  Placement 
Capacity,  the  economic  and  voting  dilution  of  existing  Shares  would  be  as 
shown in the table below.
The  table  below  shows  the  dilution  of  existing  Shareholders  calculated  in 
accordance with the formula outlined in ASX Listing Rule 7.1A(2), on the basis of 
the current market price of Shares and the current number of Equity Securities 
on issue as at the date of this Notice.
The table also shows the voting dilution impact where the number of Shares on 
issue  (Variable  A  in  the  formula)  changes  and  the  economic  dilution  where 
there are changes in the issue price of Shares issued under the 10% Placement 
Capacity.

issued with Shareholder approval under Listing Rule 7.1.
The table above uses the following assumptions: 
1.
That  Resolution  3 
is  passed  by  Shareholders.  There  are  currently 
902,836,774  existing  Shares  on  issue  as  at  the  date  of  this  Notice  of 
Meeting. On the basis that Resolution 3 is passed variable A is 902,836,774

The  Company  issues  the  maximum  possible  number  of  Equity  Securities 
under the 10% Placement Capacity.  
The issue of Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Capacity consists 
only  of  Shares.  It  is  assumed  that  no  Options  are  exercised  into  Shares 
before the date of issue of the Equity Securities. 
The calculations above do not show the dilution that any one particular 
Shareholder  will  be  subject  to.  All  Shareholders  should  consider  the 
dilution  caused  to  their  own  shareholding  depending  on  their  specific 
circumstances. 
This table does not set out any dilution pursuant to approvals under ASX 
Listing Rule 7.1. 
The  10%  voting  dilution  reflects  the  aggregate  percentage  dilution 
against the issued share capital at the time of issue. This is why the voting 
dilution is shown in each example as 10%. 
The table does not show an example of dilution that may be caused to a 
particular  Shareholder  by 
the  10% 
Placement Capacity, based on that Shareholder’s holding at the date of 
the Meeting.
reason  of  placements  under
Shareholders should note that there is a risk that:
(i)
(ii)
the market price for the Company’s Shares may be significantly lower 
on the issue date than on the date of the Meeting; and
the Shares may be issued at a price that is at a discount to the market 
price for those Shares on the date of issue.
(d)
Purpose of Issue under 10% Placement Capacity
The  Company  may  issue  Equity  Securities  under  the  10%  Placement  Capacity 
for the following purposes:
(i)
(ii)
raised  for  the  acquisition  of  new
as  cash  consideration  in  which  case  the  Company  intends  to  use 
funds 
resources,  assets  and 
investments (including expenses associated with such an acquisition), 
continued  exploration  expenditure  on  the  Company’s  current  assets 
and general working capital; or
as non-cash consideration for the acquisition of new resources assets 
and investments excluding previously announced acquisitions, in such 
circumstances the Company will provide a valuation of the non-cash 
consideration as required by listing Rule 7.1A.3.
The  Company  will  comply  with  the  disclosure  obligations  under  Listing  Rules 
7.1A(4) and 3.10.5A upon issue of any Equity Securities.
(e)
Allocation policy under the 10% Placement Capacity
The Company’s allocation policy for the issue of Equity Securities under the 10% 
Placement Capacity will be dependent on the prevailing market conditions at 
the time of the proposed placement(s).
The  recipients  of  the  Equity  Securities  to  be  issued  under  the  10%  Placement 
Capacity  have  not  yet  been  determined.  However,  the  recipients  of  Equity 
Securities could consist of current Shareholders or new investors (or both), none 
of whom will be related parties of the Company.
16
The  Company  will  determine  the  recipients  at  the  time  of  the  issue  under  the 
10% Placement Capacity, having regard to the following factors:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
the purpose of the issue;
alternative methods for raising funds available to the Company at that 
time,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  an  entitlement  issue  or  other  offer 
where existing Shareholders may participate;
the  effect  of  the  issue  of  the  Equity  Securities  on  the  control  of  the 
Company;
the circumstances of the Company, including, but not limited to, the 
financial position and solvency of the Company;
prevailing market conditions; and
advice from corporate, financial and broking advisers (if applicable).
Further,  if  the  Company  is  successful  in  acquiring  new  resources,  assets  or 
investments, it is likely that the recipients under the 10% Placement Capacity will 
be vendors of the new resources, assets or investments.
(f)
Previous Approval under ASX Listing Rule 7.1A
The  Company  last  obtained  approval  from  its  Shareholders  pursuant  to  Listing 
Rule 7.1A at its 2015 Annual General Meeting held on 16 October 2015 (Previous 
Approval).
Since  the  Previous  Approval,  the  Company  has  issued  48,950,000  Equity 
Securities pursuant to the Previous Approval.
During the 12 month period preceding the date of the Meeting, being on and 
from  16  September  2015,  the  Company  otherwise  issued  a  total  of  79,500,000 
Shares and 53,750,000 Options (excluding the issue of Shares on the exercise of 
Listed  Options)  which  represents  approximately  16.8%  of  the  total  diluted 
number  of  Equity  Securities  on  issue  in  the  Company  on  16  September  2015, 
which was 793,686,774.
Further details of the issues of Equity Securities by the Company during the 12 
month period preceding the date of the Meeting are set out in Schedule 1.
(g)
Compliance with ASX Listing Rules 7.1A.4 and 3.10.5A

Company  has  not  invited  any  existing  Shareholder  to  participate  in  an  issue  of  Equity

6.1
RESOLUTIONS 5 TO 9 – ISSUE OF OPTIONS TO RELATED PARTIES
Background
Resolutions  5  to  9  seek  shareholder  approval  for  the  grant  of  Incentive  Options  to 
Stephen Power, Roger Mason, Mark Rodda, Peter Buck and Gary Johnson (the Related 
Parties) as an incentive component of their remuneration as Directors of the Company.
The  Company  has  limited  funds  at  present,  most  of  which  are  allocated  to  specific 
activities  related  to  the  Company’s  objectives.  The  Board  has  chosen  to  grant  the 
Incentive  Options  to  the  Related  Parties  as  a  key  component  of  their  remuneration  in 
order to retain their services and to provide incentives linked to the performance of the 
Company.
The  proposed  number  of  Incentive  Options  to  be  granted  (45,000,000)  represents 
approximately  4.98%  of  the  Shares  currently  on  issue.  At  the  2015  Annual  General 
Meeting  Shareholders  approved  a  total  of  28,000,000  incentive  options  be  granted  to 
Directors representing approximately 5.7% of the number of Shares then on issue.
There are no specific additional performance criteria attaching to the Incentive Options, 
as, given the stage of development and speculative nature of the Company’s activities, 
it is considered that the performance of the Board and the value of the Company are 
closely related. As such, the Incentive Options proposed to be granted will generally only 
be  of  benefit  if  the  Board  performs  to  the  level  whereby  the  value  of  the  Company 
increases sufficiently to warrant exercising the Incentive Options.
If  Resolutions  5  to  9  are  passed,  the  Incentive  Options  will  be  granted  to  the  Related 
Parties.  Stephen  Power,  Roger  Mason,  Mark  Rodda,  Peter  Buck  and  Gary  Johnson  are 
Related  Parties  of  the  Company  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  they  are  Directors  of  the 
Company. For this reason, Shareholder approval of the grant is being sought.
6.2
Requirement for Shareholder approval
Chapter 2E of the Corporations Act
Chapter 2E of the Corporations Act prohibits a public company from giving a financial 
benefit to a related party of the company unless either:
(a)
(b)
the  giving  of  the  financial  benefit  falls  within  one  of  the  exceptions  set  out  in 
sections 210 to 216 of the Corporations Act; or
prior shareholder approval is obtained to the giving  of the financial benefit in 
accordance with sections 217 to 227 of the Corporations Act and the financial 
benefit is given within 15 months following such approval.
Related party is widely defined under the Corporations Act, and includes the directors of 
a company.
Financial  benefit  is  defined  broadly  and  includes  benefits  from  the  public  company’s 
subsidiaries. It is necessary to look at the economic and commercial substance and the 
effect  of  the  transaction  in  determining  the  financial  benefit.  The  Corporations  Act 
requires that any consideration that is given is disregarded, even if the consideration is 
adequate.
18
Messrs  Power,  Mason,  Rodda,  Buck,  and  Johnson  are  Directors  and  therefore  related 
parties of the Company, and the issue of the Incentive Options to them or their nominees 
constitutes  the  provision  of  a  financial  benefit  for  the  purposes  of  Chapter  2E  of  the 
Corporations Act.
Listing Rule 10.11
Listing Rule 10.11 requires a listed company to obtain Shareholder approval by ordinary 
resolution  prior  to  the  issue  of  securities  to  a  related  party  unless  an  exception  in  ASX 
Listing  Rule  10.12  applies.  If  shareholder  approval  is  obtained  under  Listing  Rule  10.11, 
shareholder approval is not required under Listing Rule 7.1 and the proposed issue will not 
be included in 15% annual limit permitted by Listing Rule 7.1.
It is the view of the Company that the exceptions set out in sections 210 to 216 of the 
Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rule 10.12 do not apply in the current circumstances. 
Accordingly,  Shareholder  approval  is  sought  for  the  grant  of  Incentive  Options  to  the 
Related Parties.
6.3
Information required by Chapter 2E of the Corporations Act
For the purposes of section 219 of the Corporations Act and ASIC Regulatory Guide 76, 
the following information is provided to Shareholders to enable them to assess the merits 
of the resolution:
(a)
The  related  parties  to  whom  the  proposed  Resolutions  5-9  would  permit  the 
benefit to be given are Messrs Power, Mason, Rodda, Buck, and Johnson, and 
they are related parties by virtue of being Directors of the Company.
(b)
The nature of the financial benefit
The proposed financial benefits to be given are the issue of Incentive Options to 
each of the Directors as follows:

The terms and conditions of the Incentive Options are set out in Schedule 3 to 
this Explanatory Memorandum.
(c)
Reasons for giving the benefit
The  grant  of  the  Incentive  Options  to  the  Messrs  Power,  Mason,  Rodda,  Buck, 
and Johnson is to preserve cash reserves while providing an incentive for future 
performance in their roles as Directors.
The Board (other than the Director receiving the Incentive Options) believe that 
it  is  appropriate  to  issue  the  specified  number  of  Incentive  Options  for  the 
following reasons:
(i)
(ii)
the issue of the Incentive Options to the Directors will align the interests 
of the Directors with those of Shareholders;
the  issue  of  the  Incentive  Options  is  a  reasonable  and  appropriate 
method to provide cost effective remuneration as the non-cash form
19
of this benefit will allow the Company to spend a greater proportion of 
its cash reserves on its operations than it would if alternative cash forms 
of remuneration were given to the Directors; and
(iii)
it is not considered that there are any significant opportunity costs to 
the  Company  or  benefits  foregone  by  the  Company  in  issuing  the 
Incentive Options upon the terms proposed.

Dilution effect on existing members’ interests
20
The Company’s existing share capital will not change as a result of the issue of 
Incentive Options to the Directors.
If the Incentive Options granted to the Related Parties are exercised, a total of 
45,000,000  Shares  will  be  issued.  This  will  increase  the  number  of  Shares  from 
902,836,774  to  947,836,774  (assuming  no  other  Options  are  exercised  or  other 
Shares  issued)  and  dilute  current  Shareholders  of  the  Company  by  4.7  %, 
consisting of:

The  market  price  for  Shares  during  the  term  of  the  Incentive  Options  would 
normally  determine  whether  or  not  the  Incentive  Options  are  exercised.  If,  at 
any time any of the Incentive Options are exercised and the Shares are trading 
on ASX at a price that is higher than the exercise price of the Incentive Options, 
there may be a perceived cost to the Company.

6.5
Directors’ recommendation
The  Directors,  other  than  the  Director  receiving  Incentive  Options  under  each  of 
Resolutions  5,  6,  7,  8  and  9,  consider  the  issue  of  Incentive  Options  reasonable  in  the 
circumstances for the reason set out in 6.3(c) and recommend that Shareholders vote in 
favour of Resolutions 5 to 9.
Stephen  Power  declines  to  make  a  recommendation  to  Shareholders  in  relation  to 
Resolution 5 as he has a personal interest in the outcome of Resolution 5. Stephen Power 
and his associates will not be entitled to vote on Resolution 5.
Roger  Mason  declines  to  make  a  recommendation  to  Shareholders  in  relation  to 
Resolution 6 as he has a personal interest in the outcome of Resolution 6. Roger Mason 
and his associates will not be entitled to vote on Resolution 6.

Gary  Johnson  declines  to  make  a  recommendation  to  Shareholders  in  relation  to 
Resolution 9 as he has a personal interest in the outcome of Resolution 9. Gary Johnson

In  forming  their  recommendations,  each  Director  considered  the  experience  of  each 
other  Related  Party,  the  current  market  price  of  Shares,  the  current  market  practices 
when determining the number of Incentive Options to be granted as well as the exercise 
price and expiry date of those Incentive Options.
Approval  pursuant  to  ASX  Listing  Rule  7.1  is  not  required  in  order  to  issue  the  Incentive 
Options to the Related Parties as approval is being obtained under ASX Listing Rule 10.11. 
Accordingly, the issue of Incentive Options to the Related Parties will not be included in 
the  15%  calculation  of  the  Company’s  annual  placement  capacity  pursuant  to  ASX 
Listing Rule 7.1.
7.
RESOLUTION 10 - APPROVAL OF EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE OPTION PLAN
Resolution  10  seeks  Shareholders  approval  for  the  Company  to  issue  Incentive  Options 
under the employee incentive scheme titled “Antipa Minerals Ltd – Employee Incentive 
Option Plan” (Plan) in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 7.2 (Exception 9(b)).
ASX Listing Rule 7.1 provides that a company must not, subject to specified exceptions, 
issue  or  agree  to  issue  more  equity  securities  during  any  12  month  period  than  that 
amount which represents 15% of the number of fully paid ordinary securities on issue at 
the commencement of that 12 month period.
ASX Listing Rule 7.2 (Exception 9(b)) sets out an exception to ASX Listing Rule 7.1 which 
provides that issues under an employee incentive scheme are exempt for a period of 3 
years  from  the  date  on  which  shareholders  approve  the  issue  of  securities  under  the 
scheme as an exception to ASX Listing Rule 7.1.
If Resolution 10 is passed, the Company will be able to issue Incentive Options under the 
Plan to eligible participants over a period of 3 years from the date of approval without 
impacting  on  the  Company’s  ability  to  issue  up  to  15%  of  its  total  ordinary  securities 
without Shareholder approval in any 12 month period.
At the date of this Notice, 6,900,000 Incentive Options to employees have been issued 
under  the  Plan  (as  adopted  at  the  Company’s  2013  annual  general  meeting  held  on 
19 November 2013).
The  objective  of  the  Plan  is  to  attract,  motivate  and  retain  key  employees  and  it  is 
considered  by  the  Company  that  the  adoption  of  the  Plan  and  the  future  issue  of 
Incentive Options under the Plan will provide selected employees with the opportunity to 
participate in the future growth of the Company.
Any  future  issues  of  Incentive  Options  under  the  Plan  to  a  related  party  or  a  person 
whose  relation  with  the  company  or  the  related  party  is,  in  ASX’s  opinion,  such  that 
approval  should  be  obtained  will  require  additional  Shareholder  approval  under  ASX 
Listing Rule 10.14 at the relevant time.
A  summary  of  the  key  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Plan  is  set  out  in  Schedule 4.  In 
addition,  a  copy  of  the  Plan  is  available  for  review  by  Shareholders  at  the  registered 
office of the Company until the date of the Meeting. A copy of the Plan can also be sent
23
to  Shareholders  upon  request  to  the  Company  Secretary.  Shareholders  are  invited  to 
contact the Company if they have any queries or concerns.

SCHEDULE 2 – TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ATTACHING OPTIONS
The following were the terms and conditions of the Attaching Options on the date of issue.
The Attaching Options expired on 17 May 2016 if they had not been exercised by that date.
(a)
The Attaching Options are exercisable at a price of 1 cent ($0.01) each at any time on or 
before 17 May 2016. Each Option entitles the holder to subscribe for one Share.
(b)
Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if:
(i)
(ii)
a  takeover  bid  within  the  meaning  of  the  Corporations  Act  is  made  for  the 
Shares  in  the  Company  and  the  bidder  becomes  entitled  to  compulsorily 
acquire all of the Shares, any Attaching Options not exercised by the end of the 
bid period shall lapse; or
a  court  orders  a  meeting  to  be  held  in  relation  to  a  proposed  scheme  of 
arrangement  in  relation  to  the  Company  the  effect  of  which  may  be  that  a 
person will have a relevant interest in at least 90% of the Company’s Shares, any 
Attaching Options not exercised during the period which is 7 days of the court 
order shall lapse.
The  holder  may  exercise  any  part  of  the  Attaching  Options  without  prejudice  to  the 
holder’s ability to subsequently exercise any remaining Attaching Options.
All Shares issued upon exercise of the Attaching Options will rank equally in all respects 
with  the  then  issued  Shares,  and  the  Company  will,  within  7  days,  apply  for  official 
quotation by the ASX of all Shares issued upon the exercise of the Attaching Options.
There are no participating rights or entitlements conferred on the Attaching Options and 
the holder will not be entitled to participate with respect to the Attaching Options in new 
issues  offered  to  shareholders  of  the  Company  during  their  currency  without  exercising 
the  Attaching  Options.  However,  the  Company  will  ensure  that  for  the  purposes  of 
determining  entitlements  to  any  such  issue,  the  Option  holders  will  be  notified  of  a 
proposed issue after the issue is announced. This will give the holder the opportunity to 
exercise  the  Attaching  Options  prior  to  the  date  for  determining  entitlements  and  to 
participate in any such issue as a shareholder.
In the event of any reorganisation of capital of the Company prior to the expiry date for 
exercise of the Attaching Options, the number of Attaching Options to which the holder 
is  entitled  or  the  exercise  price  of  the  Attaching  Options  or  both  shall  be  changed  to 
comply with the ASX Listing Rules applying to a reorganisation of capital at the time of 
reorganisation.

requirements of section 708A(6) of the Corporations Act; and
perform such other acts or take such other actions to ensure the Shares that are 
allotted  pursuant  to  the  exercise  of  the  Incentive  Options  are  quoted  by  the 
ASX and freely tradeable.
The  holders  of  an  Incentive  Option  may  only  participate  in  new  issues  of  securities  to 
holders  of  ordinary  shares  in  the  Company  if  the  Incentive  Option  has  been  exercised 
and  Shares  allotted  in  respect  of  the  Incentive  Option  before  the  record  date  for 
determining entitlements to the issue.
There will be no change to the exercise price of the Incentive Option or the number of 
Shares  over  which  an  Incentive  Option  is  exercisable  in  the  event  of  the  Company 
making a pro rata issue of shares or other securities to the holders of ordinary shares in the 
Company (other than a bonus issue).
If there is a bonus issue (Bonus Issue) to the holders of ordinary Shares in the Company, 
the number of Shares over which an Incentive Option is exercisable will be increased by

the number of Shares which the holder would have received if the Incentive Option had 
been  exercised  before  the  record  date  for  the  Bonus  Issue  (Bonus  Shares).  The  Bonus 
Shares must be paid up by the Company out of the profits or reserves (as the case may 
be) in the same manner as was applied in the Bonus Issue and upon issue rank equally in 
all respects with the other Shares of that class on issue as the date of issue of the Bonus 
Shares.
If prior to the Expiry Date there is a reorganisation of the issued capital of the Company, 
the  rights  of  a  holder  of  Incentive  Options  will  be  changed  to  the  extent  necessary  to 
comply with the applicable ASX Listing Rules in force at the time of the reorganisation.
The Incentive Options are transferable provided the holder has obtained the prior written 
consent  of  Board  to  the  transfer  and  the  transfer  complies  with  section 707(3)  of  the 
Corporations Act.
