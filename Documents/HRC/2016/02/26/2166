into prostitution. One such victim was a young deaf and mute girl; another was only five

<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
visited the United Arab Emirates from 11 to 17 April 2012, at the invitation of the 
Government. In this report, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the country&#8217;s 
commitment and progress in combating trafficking in persons, and highlights shortcomings 
in legislation and enforcement, particularly regarding lack of recognition of trafficking for 
labour exploitation. She welcomes the proposed amendments to the federal anti-trafficking 
law as well as the drafting of a new law for domestic workers, and makes a number of 
recommendations to the Government, inter alia, on increasing capacity-building activities 
for relevant government officials, strengthening labour protection for all workers, including 
migrant domestic workers, and creating more opportunities for safe labour migration.

<p>  C. Legislative, policy and institutional framework .............................................  25&#8211;<footnote name="4">9. The Special Rapporteur observed that the general failure to identify persons 
trafficked for labour exploitation may also be partly due to labour inspectors not being well 
equipped to identify such victims. The meeting with representatives from the Ministry of 
Labour revealed that although the Ministry&#8217;s inspection department has an anti-human 
trafficking section, only very few of the 420 labour inspectors have received training on 
trafficking. No information was provided on the exact number of labour inspectors 
specialized to work on cases involving trafficking for labour exploitation. It was further 
admitted that with only 420 inspectors and around 240,000 companies, the Ministry faced 
challenges in conducting labour inspections in a comprehensive manner, and inspections 
were therefore carried out randomly or upon receiving complaints. There is also a clearly </footnote>3 8

Dhabi Police operates social support centres in Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Sharjah, which 
mainly assist victims of domestic violence and provide them with shelter. The centres 
provide victims, especially women and children, with psychological and social support, and 
where alleged trafficking cases are under investigation by the police, trafficked persons are 
reportedly kept in these centres before being transferred to Ewa&#8217;a shelters upon being 
identified as victims. </footnote>0 11 
</p>
<p>  E. Protection, recovery and reintegration of trafficked persons ..........................  51&#8211;<footnote name="6">8. NCCHT, various ministries at federal level and several departments in some 
emirates have taken a number of initiatives aimed at preventing trafficking, primarily in the 
form of awareness-raising campaigns and publications. They have also conducted lectures, 
workshops and training sessions designed for immigration and police officers, public 
prosecutors and representatives of shelters. Furthermore, an anti-trafficking campaign was 
launched in 2010 and 2011 at the airports of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, which included 
informative posters and the distribution of pamphlets in six languages. The Ministry of 
Interior introduced human rights-related modules in the curricula of police academies and 
published a human trafficking guidance and several brochures on the issue. The Ministry 
further reported that it is using iris and fingerprint recognition at checkpoints in order to </footnote>0 13

enforcement, which, if verified, undeniably impedes the effective identification of 
trafficked persons and the successful prosecution of offenders. She was informed of cases 
in which police and immigration officers at lower levels were either implicated in 
trafficking or turned a blind eye to the situations of trafficked persons. </footnote> 15

<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
conducted an official visit to the United Arab Emirates from 11 to 17 April 2012, at the 
invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, she visited Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah, where she met with 
officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Labour, Interior, Justice, and Social 
Affairs, judicial and police departments, public prosecutors, as well as representatives of 
the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking, Supreme Council for Family 
Affairs and Emirates Human Rights Association. She visited labour camps and shelters for 
trafficked women and children, where she met with victims trafficked for labour and sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its invitation and collaboration in 
facilitating meetings with officials from the various ministries and departments. She 
appreciates the openness with which the Emirati authorities discussed issues relating to 
trafficking in persons. Finally, she expresses her gratitude to civil society representatives 
for their valuable inputs. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Migration trend in the United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>4. The expansion of the oil industry in the last four decades in the United Arab 
Emirates brought with it rapid economic growth which, at the same time, resulted in a 
heavy reliance on foreign expertise and labour. With cities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai 
having huge commercial potentials, the United Arab Emirates developed into a destination 
and transit country for trafficking in persons (&#8220;trafficking&#8221;). People from all over the world, 
</p>
<p>including unskilled, low- and semi-skilled workers, come to work in the United Arab 
Emirates. The country now has a small indigenous population, with foreign labour making 
up 90 per cent of its working population. Indeed, in five years, the population of the 
Emirates doubled from 4.<footnote name="1">6. Illegal practices, such as charging recruitment fees, substituting contracts and 
confiscating the passports of foreign workers, continue on a large scale in the United Arab 
Emirates, not only in the construction industry, but throughout the whole services sector. 
For instance, one driver, who had been working in the United Arab Emirates for over 20 
years, said that his employer still held his passport and in order to get it back, he would 
have to hand over his labour card. Two ladies working in a beauty salon also reported that 
their passports had been retained by their employer, and that they and other colleagues were 
made to work long hours without even being paid overtime. All stated that they preferred 
not to complain about their working conditions for fear of losing their jobs and being 
deported. 
</footnote> million in 2005 to 8.<footnote name="2">0. The same modus operandi is used so that migrant domestic workers are charged 
huge recruitment fees and promised good working and living conditions, but when they 
actually start working they are often given less or no wages at all and are exploited and 
mistreated. The Special Rapporteur received information of migrant women who are 
college graduates and trained professionals recruited with offers of high salaries as nurses, 
nannies or private tutors, and who find themselves working as domestic workers. 
Reportedly, domestic workers are sometimes pooled together by their employers&#8217; relatives 
and made to work in the evenings as waitresses and to provide catering services for social 
functions. The employers purportedly flout the law by using their domestic workers instead 
of other workers who have comparatively more rights and protection under the Labour 
Law. The Special Rapporteur received information on the case of a Filipina woman 
recruited as a tutor and then forced to work as housemaid and cook in addition to tutoring 
two boys. She was subjected to mistreatment and sexual gestures of one of the boys finally 
made her go back to the agency that had recruited her. The agency reportedly locked her up 
with 29 other girls in a small room for two months. It seems that such agencies lock up the 
</footnote> million in 2010, with 950,000 nationals 
and 7.3 million foreigners1, mostly employed in labour intensive sectors, such as the 
construction industry, and in other service sectors as taxi drivers, security guards, restaurant 
workers, cleaners, lower-end hotel employees and domestic workers. Migrant workers 
account for over 170 different nationalities and are governed by the sponsorship system 
known as <i>kafala</i>. 
</p>
<p>5. The <i>kafala</i> regulates the entry, recruitment, employment and residency of migrant 
workers in the United Arab Emirates; they must have a national sponsor and are only 
allowed to work for the employer who sponsored them.2 A migrant worker&#8217;s work and 
residence permits are therefore tied to his/her sponsor. Under this system, migrant workers 
wishing to change jobs, with limited exceptions for certain categories of skilled workers, 
must have at least two years&#8217; continuous service with their employer and their contract

</p>
<p>art. 67. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.<footnote name="1">9. The majority of domestic workers come to the United Arab Emirates through 
recruiting agencies, which often are unlicensed agents or unscrupulous brokers who recruit 
migrant domestic workers clandestinely despite bans in some of the sending countries. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed of cases of female domestic workers who, through illegal 
agents, bypass the mandatory clearance in their home countries and cross borders, 
sometimes travelling to neighbouring countries, before arriving in the United Arab 
Emirates to work as domestic workers without an employment contract. Illegal agents also 
thrive by taking advantage of the fact that administrative procedures for the legal 
recruitment of domestic workers are perceived to be expensive and complicated by many 
individual employers, which therefore provides the perverse incentive for them to contract 
the services of illegal agents. 
</footnote> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>must be terminated by mutual consent.3 If these two preconditions are not met, migrant 
workers wishing to change employers before the expiry of their contract will automatically 
be subject to an employment ban ranging from six to 12 months, even when they have the 
consent or a certificate of non-objection from their employer/sponsor.<footnote name="4">8. Furthermore, trafficking in the United Arab Emirates is still viewed primarily as a 
problem concerning women and children, and essentially related to commercial sex 
exploitation. This is clearly reflected in the statistics provided by Emirati authorities, which 
suggest that the majority of persons identified by law enforcement officers were women 
and girls trafficked for sexual exploitation. In 2011, 49 persons trafficked for sexual 
exploitation were identified, however, only six were male victims. No case was registered 
for labour exploitation or forced labour per se and this may be owing to the Emirates&#8217; 
policy of delinking trafficking and labour migration. 
</footnote> Migrant workers are 
thus compelled to stay with their sponsors for at least two years, irrespective of working 
conditions, and imperatively need the sponsor&#8217;s consent before being able to change jobs. 
Otherwise, they are considered to be &#8220;absconding,&#8221; and will be deported and subject to a 
12-month ban;<footnote name="5">8. Moreover, victims are made to appear speedily before the court and to testify at the 
very beginning of trials before being repatriated. While the Special Rapporteur values the 
fact that the authorities attempt to avoid protracted delays and to deal with the investigation 
and prosecution of trafficking cases swiftly, she also stresses the importance of granting 
trafficked victims a reflection period. Such reflection period will allow them to recover and 
enable them to make a free and informed decision on their options, including whether they 
want to cooperate with authorities in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. 
</footnote> sponsors failing to report &#8220;absconding&#8221; workers are subject to heavy fines. 
</p>
<p>6. In all cases, when a foreign worker leaves his/her employer/sponsor, it is common 
practice for the sponsor to request the Ministry of Labour to cancel the worker&#8217;s labour 
card; the worker is then required to leave the Emirates within 30 days or he/she will be 
fined.6 Furthermore, despite it being illegal, confiscation of workers&#8217; passports by their 
sponsors is widespread and even condoned by the Government, since employers wishing to 
report absconding workers must produce the worker&#8217;s original passport or departure/entry 
certificate. The employer/sponsor must take the worker&#8217;s passport or cancelled labour card 
to the Ministry of Interior to request that his/her visa be cancelled as well.7 The worker&#8217;s 
passport is then endorsed with a six-month ban from entering the Emirates for employment, 
and his/her name is included in the administrative list of individuals prohibited from 
entering the United Arab Emirates;8 action will also be taken for his/her deportation. 
Therefore, despite the fact that confiscation of passports, which violates the right to 
freedom of movement, is prohibited under international law, ruled unlawful by the Dubai 
Court of Cassation since 20019 and the bylaw issued by the Ministry of Interior in 2002, the 
<i>kafala</i> system encourages the undesirable motivation for employers to confiscate passports. 
</p>
<p>7. The restrictive laws of the <i>kafala</i> enhance the degree of control exercised by 
employers over unskilled, low- and semi-skilled workers, who, especially in the light of the 
costs associated with travelling in and out of the United Arab Emirates upon losing jobs, 
are bound to stay in their sponsors&#8217; employment for the duration of the contract irrespective 
of the working conditions. This places the workers in a vulnerable situation and often 
exposes them to unsafe work environments, abuse (physical and/or psychological) and 
exploitation, poor working/living conditions, withholding of travel documents, withholding 
or non-payment of wages and excessive working hours. The <i>kafala</i> further contributes to 
creating a lucrative opportunity for criminal involvement in the foreign worker market, and 
increases their vulnerability to trafficking. For instance, since migrant workers cannot work 
in the United Arab Emirates unless they have a sponsor, they are often recruited by 
unscrupulous brokers or recruitment agencies who lure them to the United Arab Emirates 
with false promises of well-paid employment opportunities and good working conditions in 
exchange for huge recruitment fees and charges.

 9 In 2001, the Court held that &#8220;it is not permitted for an employer to confiscate the passport of an 
</p>
<p>employee and prevent him from his natural right to travel and move, whatever the nature of the 
relationship that ties them together. Confiscating a passport from his owner is nothing but a method of 
the many methods that prohibit an employee from travel and this is ruled by the text of Article 329 of 
the civil procedure law that raises the cases in which preventing travel is permitted, and the condition 
that the order must be issued by a judge in accordance with the formal and practical procedures as 
defined by law&#8221; (Dubai Court of Cassation, Case No. 268 (2001), October 27, 2001). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.<footnote name="1">8. There are around 750,000 domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates,<footnote name="12">. The Special Rapporteur met with several trafficking victims, aged between 14 and 
32 years, who had been trafficked from a number of countries. All had been deceived by 
promises of jobs in the United Arab Emirates, and forced into prostitution instead. One 
victim explained that she was contacted by her husband&#8217;s friend in Pakistan and promised a 
job in a school bus; another met her trafficker in Georgia through a website advertising jobs 
in a beauty salon; while a third victim, a university graduate from Colombia, responded to a 
job offer online, and was even interviewed through Skype by her trafficker. 
</footnote> mostly 
from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Sri Lanka. They are in a more 
vulnerable position than other migrant workers as the protection laid out in the Labour Law 
does not extend to &#8220;domestic servants working in private residences and the like.&#8221;<footnote name="1">5. The Special Rapporteur spoke to a number of migrant workers living in labour 
camps on the outskirts of Dubai, who confirmed the above. All reported that their 
employers had confiscated their passports and that they were paid less than what they had 
been promised, nor did they receive an overtime rate. Some stated that initially their wages 
had been withheld for months, and in many cases there were delays in the payment of their 
wages; however, they acknowledged that since the establishment of the electronic payment 
system, this practice had recently been abandoned by employers. Many shared overcrowded 
rooms with other co-workers. 
</footnote>3 They 
fall instead under the aegis of the Ministry of Interior with only a standard unified contract, 
so that their fate depends entirely on the contractual relationship binding them to their 
sponsors. They have no legal guarantees and are confined to the homes of their 
employers/sponsors. Their situation remains unknown to the outside world and goes 
unreported unless they manage to escape or commit suicide in despair. Many domestic 
workers who have escaped report that they were returned to their abusive employers; 
subjected to verbal, physical or sexual abuse; compelled to surrender their passport to their 
sponsors; often not paid their wages at all; deprived of food; made to work round the clock 
without rest; not given breaks, holidays or social security; and locked in their employer&#8217;s 
home. 
</footnote> 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes that the absence of opportunities for 
safe migration, particularly for low-skilled labour, coupled with inadequate and ineffective 
regulations regarding recruitment of foreign workers, and the absence of mechanisms to 
protect the human rights of migrants are the main factors contributing to trafficking in the 
United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>9. The United Arab Emirates faces significant challenges as a destination country, but 
to a lesser extent as a transit country. As a destination country, the United Arab Emirates 
receives trafficked persons from all regions of the world; however, the majority of the 
victims come from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In fewer cases, 
victims, especially children, have reportedly been trafficked to a third country, transiting 
through the Emirates. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur observed the following forms of trafficking as particularly 
prevalent in the United Arab Emirates: 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking for sexual exploitation  
</b></p>
<p>11. While prostitution is illegal in the United Arab Emirates, sex workers constitute the 
invisible workforce catering for the continuing demand for sexual services, not only by 
nationals and tourists, but also by the large population of male migrant workers, who often 
leave their wives and families in their home countries. Consequently, trafficking in women 
and girls for sexual exploitation has become rampant in the Emirates, with victims coming 
from Africa, Eastern Europe, South Asia and Latin America. They are misled into believing 
that they will be employed as salespersons, domestic workers, hotel receptionists or 
waitresses by the traffickers, who usually take advantage of their vulnerable and 
disadvantaged situations. Traffickers arrange for their travel to the United Arab Emirates 
through other persons, who in many cases use shell companies registered in the Emirates to 
process travel documents, visas and entry permits. Once in the United Arab Emirates, the 
victims&#8217; passports are either taken or forcefully confiscated, they are locked in apartments 
and villas and must either repay the alleged costs for arranging their visa and travel, 
claimed to be as high as US$5,000 to $9,000, or prostitute themselves in order to pay off 
the debt. If they refuse, they are beaten up, often sexually abused and threatened that if they 
run away or go to the police they would risk imprisonment before being deported for being 
in the country illegally and/or engaging in illegal trade. They are watched and accompanied 
at all times and forced to provide sexual services to clients without receiving any part of the 
money collected by the traffickers or handlers, which is claimed to be repayment of their 
&#8220;debt&#8221;. Under such circumstances, only few victims manage to escape or contact the police. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>cases reported in 2011 of sexual exploitation of two Pakistani men, aged 24 and 36 years, 
and four boys, aged between 11 and 16 years from China. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trafficking for labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>14. Trafficking of men and women for labour exploitation is widespread in the United 
Arab Emirates, but particularly in the construction and lower-level service sectors, where 
workers fall easy prey to traffickers who often exact huge recruitment fees from them. 
Although it is legally prohibited for a licensed agent to charge a worker a commission 
before, or even after, recruitment,10 this practice is widespread. Migrants from countries 
like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are often recruited by agents, who charge 
fees as high as US$3,000 to $4,000, promising to secure work permits and employment in 
the United Arab Emirates. The workers often take out loans at high interest rates in their 
home countries to pay the recruitment fees, or if they are unable to pay up front, they agree 
to have the fee deducted from their wages. In most cases, the workers are assured that they 
will benefit from good wages and good working/living conditions. However, once in the 
Emirates they are made to sign contracts in Arabic or English, which often they do not 
understand, with conditions that do not reflect what they had been initially promised. 
Indeed they are made to work under poor conditions for long hours, their regular and 
overtime wages, days off and other benefits are significantly reduced, and they are cramped 
in labour camps with other co-workers in poor living and sanitary conditions. As they are 
either already crippled by debts in their home country or indebted to recruitment agencies, 
they inevitably fall into situations of debt bondage and find themselves compelled to accept 
whatever terms and conditions are imposed on them. They are further restrained by the 
<i>kafala</i> and the associated deportation risks should they want to quit their job and search for 
a better one.

</b></p>
<p>views foreign migrant workers, who represent approximately 90 per cent of its labour force, 
as merely temporary contractual workers and disregards such pervasive practices which 
amount to trafficking. Emirati authorities unequivocally stated that &#8220;labour issues should 
not be linked to human trafficking and should be treated separately.&#8221;11 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Domestic workers  
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>migrant workers in overcrowded rooms and very poor conditions so as to break their will 
and compel them to accept their fate and do what they are told. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur noted with great concern that there were several cases 
involving the trafficking of children in the United Arab Emirates. In some cases, children 
from countries such as China, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Uzbekistan are given or sold 
to intermediaries by their own parents or stepparents, then brought to the Emirates and 
exploited in various ways, including physical or sexual abuse. Often, children are made to 
do household chores at the intermediary&#8217;s place or forced to beg in the transit country, and 
</p>
<p>when brought to the Emirates, exploited for commercial sex. Traffickers usually pretend to 
be the biological parents of the child victims and/or falsify their age. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that several cases registered from 2007 to 
2011involved non-Emirati children trafficked for the purpose of forced begging at market 
places or petrol stations. She further learnt of a case where the father of an 11-year-old 
child of Cameroonian nationality went back to Cameroon to find money to pay back the 
debt he owed his employer. In order to be able to travel, the father had to leave the child&#8217;s 
passport with his employer in exchange for his own passport and also left the child behind 
in the United Arab Emirates. It is not clear whether the child was used as bond for his 
father&#8217;s debt, however, this case illustrates how the precarious situation of migrant workers 
further increases their and their family&#8217;s vulnerabilities to trafficking. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur recognized the huge efforts made by the United Arab 
Emirates since 2005, in partnership with UNICEF, to repatriate child camel jockeys to their 
home countries in Asia and Africa and to eradicate trafficking of children for camel 
jockeying. She was pleased to learn that organizers of races now use remote-controlled 
robots to ride camels. However, according to some international non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and news media,14 until recently, some camel racers were still using 
child jockeys despite the prohibition. Emirati authorities assured her that this was not the 
case. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless reminds the United Arab Emirates to remain 
vigilant and ensure enforcement of the ban on child jockeys in camel races. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Other forms of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur noted that trafficking for &#8220;enslavement&#8221; is also emerging in 
the United Arab Emirates. She was informed that in 2011, Emirati authorities had identified 
three cases in which the victims, from Nepal and Indonesia, aged 25, 32 and 34 years, had 
been trafficked for &#8220;enslavement.&#8221; Their traffickers were arrested and prosecuted. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislative, policy and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. The United Arab Emirates is party to the Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children (&#8220;Trafficking Protocol&#8221;) and other key international 
human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It has also ratified

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>several International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, including Nos. 29 and 105 on 
forced labour and No. 100 on equal remuneration. 
</p>
<p>26. Regrettably, the United Arab Emirates has not ratified certain important human 
rights instruments, including the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Though the United Arab Emirates has 
signed ILO Convention No. 189 concerning decent work for domestic workers, it has not 
yet ratified it nor the fundamental conventions Nos. 87 and 98 on workers&#8217; right to 
organize. The United Arab Emirates is also not party to the 1954 Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons, the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness nor the 
1951 Slavery Convention. 
</p>
<p>27. It is worth mentioning that before acceding to the Trafficking Protocol in 2009, the 
United Arab Emirates had established a domestic legal framework to combat trafficking 
through Federal Law 51 (2006), article 1 of which defines human trafficking as: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring or receiving persons by means of 
</p>
<p>threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse 
of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or the 
giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person 
having control over another for the purpose of exploitation.&#8221;15 
</p>
<p>28. It further defines exploitation as including &#8220;all forms of sexual exploitation, 
engaging others in prostitution, servitude, forced labour, enslavement, quasi-slavery 
practices, or detachment of organs.&#8221; Article 2 of the law provides for a minimum sentence 
of five years&#8217; imprisonment or life imprisonment under aggravated circumstances, for 
example when the victim is a female, child or disabled person. Corporate entities are 
subject to fines ranging from 100,000 Dh to one million Dh (approximately US$27,225 to 
$272,247) and traffickers&#8217; assets used in the commission of the crime shall be confiscated. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes that the law does not provide for a trafficked person&#8217;s 
consent to an intended exploitation when traffickers use one of the means described in 
article 1, nor does it consider the offence of trafficking of children complete in the absence 
of any such means. Another shortcoming is that the law does not provide for important 
protection and remedial measures, including the rights of trafficked persons to receive 
assistance, seek compensation for damages, and temporarily regularize their legal status. 
</p>
<p>30. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that in 2010, the National 
Committee to Combat Human Trafficking (NCCHT) completed its study on the possibility 
of amending Federal Law 51 to make it consistent with the Trafficking Protocol, and 
particularly to provide for protection and repatriation of victims. At the time of reporting, 
the proposed amendments were before the Federal National Council for adoption. 
</p>
<p>31. In addition to Federal Law 51, Federal Law 3 (1987) constituting the Penal Code 
punishes offences that may amount to trafficking. In particular, article 364 provides for a 
maximum sentence of 10 years&#8217; imprisonment for anyone who &#8220;entices a male or female 
into committing debauchery or prostitution by coercion, threat or trickery,&#8221; but a minimum 
sentence of 10 years&#8217; imprisonment if the victim is under 18 years or was detained &#8220;against 
his will by coercion, threat or trickery, with the intention of forcing him to commit any act 
of lewdness or prostitution.&#8221; Article 368 further prohibits prostitution per se by stipulating

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>that any person who &#8220;habitually practices debauchery or prostitution shall be punished by 
term imprisonment.&#8221; However, there is no exemption in this or any other law to protect 
trafficked persons who have been forced into prostitution against being found guilty of 
&#8220;habitually practicing&#8221; prostitution. 
</p>
<p>32. Moreover, Federal Law 8 (1980) governs the relationship between workers and their 
employers in the United Arab Emirates. It sets out minimum labour protection standards, 
including working hours, paid leave and overtime pay and prohibits the recruitment of 
children under the age of 15 years16 as well as imposes certain safeguards where a child 
over 15 years of age is hired.17 However, the law does not provide for a minimum wage nor 
does it apply to certain informal sectors, such as agriculture and domestic work, in which 
trafficked persons are often exploited.18 
</p>
<p>33. In 2010, the United Arab Emirates also adopted a ministerial decision on 
implementing its Federal Law 15 (1993) regulating the transfer and transplant of human 
organs in order to prohibit the trafficking in human organs.19 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that, at the time of reporting, the United Arab 
Emirates did not have a child protection law, only inadequate provisions scattered in its 
Penal Code, and in family and labour laws relating to the protection of children. She recalls 
the importance of legislation establishing minimum standards for the treatment of children, 
prohibiting exploitative acts, such as those often committed in the process of trafficking, 
and in particular guaranteeing that welfare assistance is available to children in need. She 
notes, however, that in 2005, the Government promulgated Federal Law 15 (2005) 
regulating participation in camel racing and prohibiting the employment of children under 
18 years for such races. 
</p>
<p>35. Lastly, Federal Law 2 (2006) on cybercrimes prohibits any person from creating a 
website on the Internet aiming at or contributing to human trafficking (art. 17) and 
criminalizes any person who incites another into prostitution (art. 13). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>36. The United Arab Emirates has made combating trafficking one of the priorities on 
its national agenda since 2006 and devised a four-pillar strategy focusing on four target 
areas: legislation, enforcement, victim support and bilateral agreements and international 
partnerships. While this four-pillar strategy is commendable, further development into a 
coherent national policy with a clearly articulated plan of action for implementation and 
monitoring compliance in all the emirates is still lacking. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>37. The National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking (NCCHT) was established 
in 2007 to coordinate efforts and implement plans aimed at combating trafficking among 
various ministries and departments. It is headed by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs 
and Federal National Council Affairs and its members include representatives from the 
ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Labour, Health and Social Affairs, and State 
Security, as well as public prosecutors, law enforcement officers and representatives of 
civil society organizations. It is also tasked with revising the anti-trafficking legislation and 
raising public awareness about trafficking.

</b></p>
<p>38. A number of government departments and units deal with protection against 
trafficking. For example, the Ministry of Interior has an Anti-Human Trafficking 
Committee, a Federal Human Trafficking Section and units specialized in combating 
trafficking. It also has a Human Rights Department, which includes female public 
prosecutors, legal researchers, social workers and psychological advisers specialized in 
trafficking cases. This department is tasked with preparing plans and policies to combat 
trafficking, conducting studies on methodologies used by traffickers and providing training 
to officials. In 2011, the Ministry also created a new administrative focal agency which 
coordinates joint programmes relating to anti-human trafficking activities. 
</p>
<p>39. Additionally, there is a Human Trafficking Crimes Control Centre in Dubai, which 
is a subsidiary body of the Dubai Police. It conducts studies and research into trafficking 
offences and works in cooperation with other local and regional units in combating such 
crimes. It also coordinates with international organizations and bodies in countries of 
origin, provides support to victims and organizes meetings and training courses. The Centre 
has a section which receives complaints from workers, including through a hotline, related 
to offences of trafficking, and monitors their general working and living conditions through 
inspection of labour camps. 
</p>
<p>40. As a member of the Virtual Global Taskforce, the Ministry of Interior formed a 
Higher Committee for the Protection of Children in 2010, which established a Child 
Protection Centre in 2011. The Committee also monitors child exploitation on the Internet, 
controls abuse through public networks and raises awareness about child abuse. 
</p>
<p>41. In 2009, the Ministry of Labour created a section in its inspection department to 
combat trafficking and monitor the activities of recruitment agencies. This department also 
conducts awareness-raising programmes and training for workers and employers. The 
Ministry further established the electronic Wage Protection System, which requires 
employers with 100 or more employees to pay wages through banks, money transfer 
companies or similar service providers. Additionally, the Ministry also operates a toll-free 
hotline in 14 languages and an online service called &#8220;My Salary&#8221; for workers to report 
</p>
<p>cases of unpaid salaries and illegal deductions. Labour dispute departments within the 
Ministry receive and investigate complaints from workers and attempt to settle disputes 
within a period of two weeks, failing which they are referred to Labour Courts. 
</p>
<p>42. The Ministry of Labour has also created labour care units, which are operational in a 
number of areas in several emirates. These units receive complaints from and raise 
awareness of workers about their rights and conduct visits to labour sites and employers in 
order to curb practices of forced labour. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur commends the creation of all these sections and units within 
the different ministries. However, she found it difficult to evaluate how and to what level of 
effectiveness and efficiency all the structures work in practice, as there are no procedures or 
systems in place to properly monitor how the Emirates&#8217; various anti-trafficking 
mechanisms are performing and their accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>44. Police and immigration officials have the primary responsibility for identifying 
trafficked persons in collaboration with other ministries and agencies. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that trafficked persons may often be misidentified as irregular 
migrants and consequently, arrested, detained and summarily deported. Official figures 
show that only 51 persons were identified in 2011 as having been trafficked. Moreover, 
figures from the Dubai Police also illustrate that support was provided to only 39 victims in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>2011. Construing the scale of the problem in the United Arab Emirates, these numbers 
clearly represent a very small fraction of the total number of victims. 
</p>
<p>45. Along with measures aimed at tightening control at checkpoints and conducting 
training sessions for its officials, the Ministry of Interior published a human trafficking 
guidance, comprising, inter alia, key procedures for interaction between trafficking victims 
and competent authorities, guidance for investigators, as well as key indicators for 
trafficking crimes. However, despite these efforts to train law enforcement officials, the 
Special Rapporteur noted that police and immigration officers in the United Arab Emirates 
might still be lacking the capacity to apply the law and operational procedures, which 
therefore hampers proper identification of trafficked persons. It is also not clear whether all 
the procedures and guidance in place are being consistently and systematically used by law 
enforcement and other government officials. She further received no evidence that effective 
identification procedures in immigration detention centres exist, and if they do exist, 
whether they are followed. 
</p>
<p>46. She received allegations of cases where the police reportedly arrested and summarily 
deported women and girls directly from streets, restaurants, bars, discoth&#232;ques and hotels 
on a daily basis, without any identification process or proper assessment as to whether they 
were trafficked persons or whether their return would be safe. It is further alleged that no 
interpreters are provided to them, that they are detained in difficult conditions, with 
sometimes up to 60 persons cramped in one room, before being deported within 24 to 36 
hours. Given such serious allegations on the detention conditions of migrants, the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that her request to visit a detention centre for migrants could not be 
accommodated by the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>47. It is further reported that many victims arrested by the police are unable to request 
transfer to a shelter since, generally, shelters take in victims only after their identification as 
such by the police. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in her interviews with victims in 
shelters, several, including those who had managed to run away from their traffickers and 
who had directly contacted the police, reported that they had been kept in detention centres 
for investigation before being brought to the shelter. Moreover, the criteria used by the 
police to identify victims are said to be unclear and, in the case where a victim runs away 
from traffickers but does not go to the police immediately, it is reported that the police will 
not identify him/her as a trafficking victim. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>averred unwillingness by the Ministry to intervene in situations of trafficking for labour 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>50. Moreover, there is an apparent lack of appropriate infrastructures and services 
designed to facilitate identification of persons trafficked for labour exploitation. For 
instance, labour care units are situated only on sites where 300,000 or more workers reside. 
Likewise, while the hotline operated by the Ministry is definitely a positive step, it 
functions only from Saturday to Thursday, when workers normally work. Additionally, 
despite the hotline being designed to take reports on, inter alia, issues related to trafficking, 
as well as salary and accommodation disputes, the 1,<footnote name="54">. The Ewa&#8217;a shelter in Abu Dhabi can take in 60 trafficked persons at a time, while 
the two other Ewa&#8217;a shelters in Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah can accommodate 35 victims 
each. As at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Abu Dhabi shelter had received 
126 victims in total since 2008, while the two more recently established shelters in Ras Al-
Khaimah (2010) and Sharjah (2011) had accommodated 22 and 18 victims, respectively, 
from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Gulf Region and the Middle East. Furthermore, all </footnote>1 complaints registered in 2011 
related solely to unpaid salaries or illegal deductions from wages that have nothing to do 
with trafficking. This hotline and/or &#8220;My Salary&#8221; have not been utilized to report potential 
or actual cases of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Protection, recovery and reintegration of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur observes that there is no specific provision in the domestic 
legal framework to protect trafficked persons from further harm and to assist them in 
achieving full recovery. Reliance is placed on general provisions of the Criminal Procedure 
Law to protect victims and witnesses in trafficking cases. She was informed that in 2010, 
NCCHT issued regulatory procedures to protect trafficked persons during the criminal 
investigation stage and in the shelters. It also issued ethical standards for the media with 
regard to interviewing trafficked persons in order to respect their privacy and protect their 
identity. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Non-criminalization of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>52. Neither Federal Law 51 nor the Penal Code contains any provision exempting 
trafficked persons from being prosecuted for offences relating to irregular entry and stay in 
the United Arab Emirates, giving false information, forging or using forged travel 
documents, and engaging in prostitution or in employment without a work permit. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that it is only on a case-to-case basis that immigration 
authorities, based on reports and recommendations from shelters, decide on exonerating 
victims for offences related to their status in the Emirates. Furthermore, the majority of 
trafficked persons are, in reality, regularly misidentified as irregular migrants or criminals, 
and arrested and summarily deported. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Support to trafficked persons in recovery and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>53. Four shelters, managed by charitable and social networks, provide high-standard 
facilities and care for victims of trafficking. Three are run by Ewa&#8217;a in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah 
and Ras Al-Khaimah, and accommodate only women and girls trafficked for sexual 
exploitation, while the fourth is run by the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children 
(DFWC) in Dubai, and caters for women and children victims of violence. Victims are 
usually referred to these shelters by various sources, including law enforcement officials, 
embassies and places of worship. The Special Rapporteur visited the Ewa&#8217;a shelters in Abu 
Dhabi and Sharjah and the DFWC shelter in Dubai. There is no shelter specifically 
designated for adult males trafficked for either sexual or labour exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>the victims in the shelters, except for seven girls in 2011, were adult women. The victims 
are provided with accommodation, meals, medical care, psychological and legal assistance 
as well vocational training. Ewa&#8217;a shelters also operate a 24-hour hotline in six languages; 
the hotline received information on 15 trafficking cases in 2011, and six as at March 2012. 
</p>
<p>55. DFWC, established in 2007, runs the shelter in Dubai for women and children 
victims of domestic violence, child abuse and trafficking. In 2011, it accommodated 23 
persons trafficked for sexual exploitation, aged between 10 and 37 years old, of whom four 
were boys, and provided assistance to two victims outside the shelter. The shelter provides 
victims with non-residential and residential services, including meals, medical care, case 
management, psychological support, counselling, legal, consular and immigration 
assistance, learning and empowerment opportunities and vocational training. It also 
operates a 24-hour hotline whereby its staff members receive information and determine the 
kind of services needed and the level of urgency in each case. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that two victims had received services 
while residing outside the DFWC shelter and that Ewa&#8217;a shelters were also considering 
assisting victims in finding jobs in the United Arab Emirates. Furthermore, she noted that 
trafficked victims resided at the shelters for periods ranging from two to 12 months. 
However, much more needs to be done to ensure that victims residing at the shelters enjoy 
freedom of movement and their rights to earn an income and live a decent life. While some 
of the victims she met were interested in staying in the Emirates should they be given the 
opportunity to find a decent job, the majority expressed their desperate eagerness to be 
repatriated to their home countries as soon as possible. This pattern illustrates that in the 
absence of opportunities to earn a living while staying at shelters for their protection and 
recovery, victims urgently wanted to leave the country. In this regard, she notes that Federal 
Law 51 regrettably does not contain any provision giving trafficked persons the right to 
temporarily stay and work in the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>57. Additionally, while the shelters are doing their utmost with available resources, 
mainly comprising individual donations, the level of psychosocial, training and recovery 
support provided to victims requires further strengthening. For instance, although trafficked 
victims received by the shelters come from at least 20 different countries in different 
regions of the world, with different languages and dialects, on-site interpreters were not 
always available to assist them on a daily basis. The Special Rapporteur further noted that 
the shelters did not have enough medical officers, social workers and psychologists. In 
addition, while, in general, victims are provided with vocational training in crafts 
traditionally associated with women, such as weaving and embroidery, this may not 
correspond to their ambitions and talents, which may be the reason for the reported 
disinterest of some victims. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>60. Lastly, the Human Rights Care Department of the Dubai Police provides legal and 
financial support to trafficked women and children residing at the DWFC shelter. It also 
launched the &#8220;You are not alone&#8221; programme which supports victims who opt to stay 
outside the shelter. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>61. The police usually carry out a preliminary investigation in trafficking cases and have 
the obligation to inform the public prosecution of any such case within 20 hours. 
Thereafter, prosecutors take on the investigation, evaluate the case and decide whether to 
refer it to court. Federal Law 51 contains no specific provision for the protection of 
trafficked persons as witnesses at either the pretrial, trial or post-trial stages. However, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that special measures were usually taken by the 
prosecution to avoid confrontation between victims and their perpetrators, such as 
interrogating victims in special rooms or recording their statements with video cameras at 
shelters, or by police officers wearing plain clothes. 
</p>
<p>62. Recently, there has been a number of successful prosecutions in the United Arab 
Emirates for trafficking offences, mainly for the purpose of sexual exploitation. In 2011, 44 
trafficking cases were registered by the police, and the prosecution referred 37 of these to 
court, involving 111 alleged perpetrators. Nineteen cases resulted in convictions; three in 
acquittals and 15 were still pending before the courts. Punishment in those cases ranged 
from two months&#8217; to life imprisonment. The Special Rapporteur notes that the number of 
</p>
<p>cases registered and prosecuted, though positive, is clearly low compared to the scale of 
trafficking. She further notes that although Federal Law 51 provides for the confiscation of 
assets of persons found guilty of trafficking, to date no such confiscation has ever been 
ordered by the courts. The low prosecution rate is due to a combination of factors, including 
the absence of structures encouraging effective witness cooperation in trafficking cases. 
Indeed, in the absence of any provision for witness protection or compensation, the 
majority of trafficked persons are afraid to come forward and report their cases to 
authorities. Furthermore, the fear of being arrested for illegal stay in the country, or, for 
those who are sexually exploited, for engaging in prostitution deter them from going to the 
police. 
</p>
<p>63. Another factor contributing to the low prosecution rate relates to the fact that 
although several prosecutors have attended a number of training sessions on trafficking, 
they have not necessarily been trained and/or adequately sensitized on identifying and 
prosecuting trafficking cases involving persons trafficked for labour exploitation. This is 
further demonstrated by the nature of the cases prosecuted in 2011, in which all, but two 
cases linked to &#8220;enslavement,&#8221; involved sexual exploitation. In this regard, the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office in Abu Dhabi conceded that in the absence of clear precedents to guide 
them on the interpretation of the concept of &#8220;forced labour&#8221; under Federal Law 51, 
</p>
<p>prosecutors and even judges were facing challenges in applying this concept. The same 
factors also impede effective investigation of trafficking cases by the police, as, based on 
the cases registered, it seems that there is a general tendency for the police to only arrest 
offenders in trafficking cases involving prostitution, and not labour exploitation. The police 
and prosecution rely primarily on the Ministry of Labour to handle those cases. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b> G. Redress for victims 
</b></p>
<p>65. Besides the general provisions in criminal and civil laws, there is no specific 
mechanism for trafficked persons to seek compensation, such as a statutory compensatory 
scheme that does not require criminal or civil prosecution. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that prosecutors could seek compensation on behalf of victims in criminal 
proceedings and that, since June 2011, a Legal Aid Office in the Abu Dhabi Judicial 
Department provided all eligible persons, including trafficking victims, with the necessary 
support and legal assistance. However, to-date there has been no case in which trafficked 
persons have claimed or received compensation. This may be partly owing to prosecutors 
themselves not being familiar with the procedures for seeking compensation in trafficking 
cases, so that the very few trafficked persons identified are not consistently informed of 
their rights to claim compensation and to legal aid. 
</p>
<p>66. Indeed several victims interviewed by the Special Rapporteur, who had already 
testified in court and were waiting for their travel documents before being repatriated to 
their country of origin, queried whether they had a right to any compensation for the harm 
suffered and the income they generated for their traffickers through forced prostitution. 
This shows that they had not been informed of their right to compensation. Furthermore, 
victims often choose not to seek compensation, as this would involve lengthy judicial 
procedures and they would have to remain in the country without any opportunity to earn a 
living. On humanitarian grounds, the shelters and charitable institutions provide the victims 
with nominal amounts ranging from US$100 to $300 at the time of repatriation to their 
home countries. While permanent or temporary residence is another remedy that may be 
necessary and appropriate in some situations, to date only one trafficked person has been 
allowed to remain and work in the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Repatriation and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>67. When victims of trafficking wish to return to their home countries, the shelters 
arrange their repatriation in coordination with the Emirates police and NGOs in their home 
countries. Victims who cannot be repatriated to their countries of origin are resettled in 
other countries, in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) and host countries. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn 
that four child victims had been successfully resettled in countries other than their countries 
of origin. Moreover, while the International Office for Migration does not have a formal 
return and reintegration programme in the Emirates to assist trafficked persons, it does 
assist in the safe return and follow-up of victims of trafficking in their home country upon 
request. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Prevention

</b></p>
<p>identify wanted persons, as well as face recognition technologies and modern equipment to 
detect visa or passport frauds and control entry into and exit from the United Arab 
Emirates. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was also informed that in order to curb 
trafficking, the authorities in some emirates have imposed restrictions on women under 30 
years old travelling to the Emirates on visitor&#8217;s visas. While these are important measures 
that may prevent trafficking to some extent, she underlines the imperative that responses to 
trafficking should not violate other human rights. 
</p>
<p>69. The labour care units in several emirates also implemented certain measures to 
protect and increase awareness of workers&#8217; rights. These included conducting lectures to 
some 83,000 workers in 2011 and distributing information brochures. Additionally, Dubai 
Police carried out awareness-raising campaigns among workers and employers, and in 
2010, it launched the campaign entitled, &#8220;Pay the employee his wages before his sweat 
dries,&#8221; aimed at encouraging employers to comply with their obligation of timely payment 
of wages and respecting workers&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the various efforts made by NCCHT and the 
relevant ministries. However, she finds that more efforts are needed and campaigns through 
mass media, such as radio, television and newspapers, should be carried out to raise general 
public awareness about trafficking, appropriately targeting trafficked persons, those at risk 
of being trafficked or otherwise exploited, their employers or workplaces. 
</p>
<p>71. She further underscores the importance of addressing demand in prevention 
strategies, especially in the context of the United Arab Emirates, where besides the huge 
demand for commercial sex services, there is also a high demand for cheap and exploitable 
labour. Adopting a policy that separates trafficking and labour issues and thus deliberately 
leaving foreign workers, including domestic workers, unprotected contravenes the 
Emirates&#8217; mandatory obligation under article 9, paragraph 5, of the Trafficking Protocol, 
especially given that lack of enforcement of labour standards in countries of destination and 
origin creates a major incentive for trafficking in labour. As such, tolerating restrictions on 
freedom of movement, including confiscation of passports, long hours of work, poor 
working and living conditions and withholding of wages contribute to expanding the 
demand for trafficked migrants and creating lucrative opportunities for exploiters, recruiters 
and brokers. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur heard concerns from several stakeholders that partnership 
between the Government and civil society is limited, including in the field of trafficking. 
She indeed observed that except for the Emirates Human Rights Association, and despite 
huge efforts made to contact NGOs in the Emirates, she could not find any other registered 
NGO working on human rights in the country. She further learned that individual human 
rights defenders were frequently harassed and faced censorship 
</p>
<p><b> 2. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>important steps, no information was provided on their contents or on specific plans of 
action and operational procedures for their effective implementation. 
</p>
<p>74. The United Arab Emirates has also entered into bilateral labour agreements with 
several sending countries. A positive example of bilateral cooperation is the 2009 pilot 
project on management of contractual work cycle and workers&#8217; rights carried out with India 
</p>
<p>and the Philippines, two important labour sending countries, and which had reached its 
second phase. This project established an electronic contract validation system allowing 
labour ministries in the United Arab Emirates and in the sending countries to monitor 
workers&#8217; contracts. The Emirates also introduced a web-based system accessible to labour 
authorities in both the Emirates and India in order to centralize the attestation of papers 
related to labour contracts of Indian workers and to check discrepancies therein. 
</p>
<p>75. At regional level, the United Arab Emirates is involved in the study on a 
comprehensive Arab strategy to combat trafficking. It participated in the Regional 
Consultative Forum against Human Trafficking in view of establishing regional 
mechanisms for the implementation of the Arab Initiative for building national capacities 
for combating trafficking. Additionally, it is also part of the 20-member Group of Friends 
United against Human Trafficking and has signed the Declaration on the Global Efforts to 
Combat Trafficking in Persons. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The United Arab Emirates has demonstrated its serious commitment to 
combating trafficking through its domestic legal framework and the establishment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>NCCHT.  However, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that there is a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherence in the implementation of the policy and legal framework as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures adopted to combat trafficking at the national level. In the absence of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national plan of action for combating trafficking and a strategic implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework containing clear and measurable indicators for outcome and impact, 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation remains weak and fragmented, varying not only from emirate to 
</b></p>
<p><b>emirate but also between different line ministries and different departments within an 
</b></p>
<p><b>emirate. Without clear guidelines and uniform standard operating procedures applied 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematically in all the concerned ministries and their respective departments in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>seven emirates, particularly by front line law enforcement officers, identification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficked persons and their protection will continue to suffer. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>While the United Arab Emirates has actively engaged in raising awareness on 
trafficking, it has not effectively addressed the root causes of trafficking, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>demands for cheap and exploitative labour. Collection of statistical information to 
</b></p>
<p><b>determine the prevalence rate, forms, trends and manifestation of trafficking is also 
</b></p>
<p><b>incomplete owing to attention being focused almost exclusively on trafficking for 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual exploitation and viewed as affecting only women and girls. Other forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking have remained invisible and unrecognized by the competent authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the general population and the victims themselves. Equal emphasis should be placed 
</b></p>
<p><b>on all forms and manifestations of trafficking and exploitation, and the lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations and labour rights should be addressed as one of the key structural factors 
</b></p>
<p><b>fostering trafficking of men, women and children in the United Arab Emirates, 
</b></p>
<p><b>whether for sexual exploitation or forced labour or domestic servitude or other 
</b></p>
<p><b>services. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Identification of victims of trafficking generally remains very weak, while that 
of persons trafficked for labour exploitation is totally lacking. Investigation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution of trafficking cases have also remained low despite the scale of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Moreover, trafficked persons are not always provided with adequate support in 
their recovery process. Their right to compensation is not specifically recognized and 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are not routinely given adequate information on this and the necessary support 
</b></p>
<p><b>to exercise this right, such as legal aid. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that the Government is not engaging 
enough with civil society organizations </b>&#8211;<b> particularly with those having specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>expertise </b>&#8211;<b>, and viewing them as real partners in efforts to combat trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Based on her findings, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the United 
Arab Emirates: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>Workers and Members of Their Families and ILO Convention No. 189 concerning 
</b></p>
<p><b>decent work for domestic workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Examine the proposed changes in Federal Law 51 in relation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and speed up 
</b></p>
<p><b>the process of adopting the proposed amendments and ensure full compliance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Consult with all relevant stakeholders and examine the new draft law on 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic workers in relation to international standards, especially ILO Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 189 concerning decent work for domestic workers and speed up the process of 
</b></p>
<p><b>enacting this law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Review its labour and migration laws to ensure that the high demand for 
</b></p>
<p><b>cheap, low- or semi-skilled foreign labour and the <i>kafala</i> system are not used as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>channel for traffickers and agents to exploit foreign workers; increase options for safe 
</b></p>
<p><b>and legal migration; and respect and protect the rights of migrant workers and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>families in order to eliminate their vulnerabilities to all forms of trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Develop and build capacity for systematic data collection, disaggregated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by age and gender, in collaboration with independent research institutions and civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Design, in consultation with all stakeholders, a national strategy to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat trafficking that has specific targets, performance indicators and timelines for 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation by different national government and non-governmental entities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Strengthen the mandate of the National Committee to Combat Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Trafficking (NCCHT) to make it the central mechanism responsible for monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance and ensuring consistency, review evaluation and accountability in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the national strategy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to enable NCCHT to 
</b></p>
<p><b>perform its functions, including those related to coordination, effectively and 
</b></p>
<p><b>efficiently; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1

<p><b>(j) Review all existing domestic and international memoranda of 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding (MoUs) to ensure compliance with international standards and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee that the rights of trafficked persons are protected, respected and enforced; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Intensify efforts for building the capacity of all relevant public officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>including law enforcement and immigration officials, judges, prosecutors, labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>inspectors, with special focus on increasing the knowledge and skills of front line 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials to identify, protect and assist trafficked persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Strengthen the capacity of the </b>Ministry of Interior&#8217;s<b> Federal Anti-
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Trafficking Section to undertake high-quality, ethical and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations. The role of each section/unit within the Ministry in investigating 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking cases should be strengthened and well-defined with a clear and efficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>division of labour; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Strengthen the capacity of prosecutors to effectively prosecute 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking cases with due attention to the rights of accused persons to a fair trial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of victims and witnesses to protection and support at all stages; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Further strengthen informal (police-to-police) cooperation with other 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries with a view to improving the identification and protection of victims and the

<p><b>rights of all workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(s) Establish a national hotline dedicated to receiving information on 
</b></p>
<p><b>potential trafficking cases and staffed by personnel adequately trained in trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues and speaking languages and dialects commonly spoken by trafficked persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(t) Ensure that victims are not criminalized or penalized, including through 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention for status-related offences and other crimes directly resulting from their 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations as trafficked persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(u) Establish shelters for male victims of trafficking, including for labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Ensure that shelters are fully equipped to provide comprehensive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>individually tailored assistance to all trafficked persons, including men, by highly 
</b></p>
<p><b>qualified personnel trained to work with trafficked persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(w) Provide earmarked funding on a regular basis to shelters, service 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers and civil society in order to enhance their capacity to provide trafficked 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with comprehensive support at all times, including the strengthening of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>level of psychological support, training, rehabilitation and recovery; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Provide trafficked persons with a reflection period and the choice of 
</b></p>
<p><b>remaining in or outside shelters and ensure that they are effectively provided with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary support and assistance to seek remedies, such as legal aid and interpretation 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(y) Adopt measures to ensure that victims of trafficking who need 
</b></p>
<p><b>international protection are properly identified and referred to the asylum system, 
</b></p>
<p><b>when appropriate;

<p><b>(z) Maintain close cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Migration (IOM) for the safe return of trafficked victims, with due regard to any need
