Exhibit 99.1
Veris Gold Corp. Reports Third Quarter Results for 2014
VANCOUVER, Nov. 14, 2014 /CNW/ - Veris Gold Corp. ("Veris" or the "Company") has
released its unaudited interim financial and operational results for the quarter ended September
30, 2014 on November 14, 2014. This earnings news release should be read in conjunction with
the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, along with the
related Management's Discussion and Analysis as filed on SEDAR on November 14, 2014 and
available on the Company's website at www.verisgold.com.
All dollar amounts are expressed in United States Dollars unless otherwise specified.
Highlights for Q3-2014 include:
44,319 payable ounces were produced in the third quarter of 2014 ("Q3-14"),
representing an 18% increase from the 37,544 ounces produced in the three month
period ending September 30, 2013 ("Q3-13");
45,216 ounces were sold in Q3-14 a 6% increase from the 42,760 ounces sold in Q3-
13 primarily due to the improvement in mining at Starvation Canyon and improved
overall mill recoveries;
Gold revenue in Q3-14 was $57.3 million compared to $57.0 million in Q3-13, driven by
a 6% increase in gold ounces sold offset by a 4% decrease in the price-per-ounce of
gold sold in Q3-14 compared to Q3-13;
Total mine production from underground and surface for Q3-14 was 319,513 tons
containing an estimated 51,678 ounces of gold, a 16% increase from the 275,825 tons
mined in Q3-13 and an 11% increase in contained ounces of gold compared with
46,637 ounces mined in Q3-13. The primary contributor to the increase in tons as well
as contained ounces arose from the significant increase in mined ore produced from
the Starvation Canyon mine, approximately 32,478 tons (57%) higher than Q3-13.
With the transition to contract mining in the SSX-Steer the Company focused
primarily on placing the necessary backfill during the quarter to recover from the
deficit built up however this mine continued to produce at levels comparable to the
2013 quarter.
In Q3-14 the Jerritt Canyon roaster facility achieved total average throughput of 3,590
tons per day ("TPD"), 5% more than the 3,419 TPD achieved in Q3-13 which included
a 10 day shutdown;
Development of Saval 4, the fourth underground mine at Jerritt Canyon continued
throughout the third quarter of 2014, completing the primary access portal and
substantially advancing the secondary access to allow for the commencement of
production. The Company will mine the Saval 4 using existing equipment and crews
at a scheduled mining rate between 250 and 350 tons per day grading approximately
0.22 opt. Commercial production, determined based on the mine achieving these
planned tonnage rates on a consistent basis, is expected to be achieved late in the
fourth quarter of 2014; and
The Company recorded a net loss of $6.5 million, during Q3-14, which represented an
$11.7 million decreased loss from the $18.2 million net loss recorded in Q3-13.
The Company continued to advance proceedings under the Companies' Creditors
Arrangement Act ("CCAA"), order, signing a final cash collateral order with Deutsche
Bank AG ("DB") which provided the framework for the restructuring process in the
coming months. Under this order the Company will continue refinancing efforts to
allow for the purchase the DB Gold Forward Facility and also, effective November 1,
2014, commenced sales proceedings for some or all of the Company's assets. The
final plan of arrangement is yet to be determined and will be dependent on the
outcome of these two processes.

Gold Sales amount does not include either (a) toll milling revenue, which commenced in Q2-
2013 (Q3-2014: $nil, Q2-2014: $0.8 million, Q1-14: $nil, Q4-2013: $3.1 million, Q3-2013: $3.3
million, Q2-2013: $1.7 million); nor (b) gold produced from mines treated as development
stage assets for accounting purposes which includes gold produced and sold from Starvation
Canyon during Q2-2013 (2,453 ounces or $3.5 million gold sales) and gold produced and sold
from Saval 4 during Q3-2014 (458 ounces or $0.6 million gold sales).
The Company had a net loss of $6.5 million during Q3-14, an $11.7 million improvement from the
net loss of $18.2 million in Q3-13. The loss in 2014 is primarily the result of a $6.3 million
reduced income from operations due primarily to a $2.4 million decreased gross margin before
D&D resulting from lower gold prices despite increased gold sales, a $2.3 million increase in
depreciation and depletion driven by the commissioning and improved mining of the Starvation
Canyon mine and the commissioning second tailing facility in mid-2013, and a $1.6 million
increase in G&A from increased professional fees and directors fees incurred since the Company
entered creditor protection, on June 9, 2014, under the CCAA, offset by a lower realized
exchange rate on the Canadian dollar, reduced salaries and benefits as well as business
development costs. As well, Q3-14 recognized a $2.9 million in decreased interest expense due
primarily to a $2.4 million reduction in interest from the decreased time to maturity of the Senior
Secured Gold Facility ("SSG"), $0.3 million decrease in interest on the convertible debt from the
reduced time to maturity, $0.1 million reduction in interest on forward contracts which are
currently included in the Creditor Protection Proceedings, and $0.1 million reduction in accretion
from a reduction in short term interest rates.
Gold Sales/Revenue
For Q3-14, the Company realized gold sales of $57.3 million on the sale of approximately 45,216
ounces of gold, this compares to $57.0 million on sales of approximately 42,760 ounces of gold
sold in Q3-13. The primary driver of the increased revenue in Q3-14 versus Q3-13 was a 6%
increase in the number of gold ounces sold offset by a 4% decline in the market price for gold.
The Company had $nil in toll milling revenue in Q3-14 compared with $3.3 million in toll milling
in Q3-13 as the Company maintained a focus on allocating the majority of available milling
capacity to process the Company's increased high grade ore stockpiles.
Gross Margins before D&D
In Q3-14, the Company had a Gross Margin of $8.8 million before D&D compared to $11.2
million in Q3-13. As previously discussed, this $2.4 million decline was primarily driven by
reduction in toll milling revenue from $3.3 million in Q3-13 to $nil Q3-14. The Company was able
to offset the 4% reduction in gold revenue per ounce with a 6% increase in gold ounces sold. The
successes of the Company's cost reduction programs were evidenced by a 7% reduction in cash
costs per ounce from $1,148 per ounces in Q3-13 to $1,072 per ounce in Q3-14. The most
significant contributor to this decreased mining cost resulted from a continued improvement in
production rates at Starvation Canyon as the current quarter benefited from a year of production
compared to Q3-13 which was the first quarter of production since the mine had been
commissioned.
Jerritt Canyon Underground Mining
The Company mined a total of 309,538 tons from the underground mines, which includes 5,075
Saval 4 development tons, containing a total of 50,739 gold ounces. An additional 9,975 tons
containing 939 ounces were mined from remote stockpiles in Q3-14. The total underground and
surface Q3 mining production of 319,513 tons containing 51,678 ounces represents a 16%
increase from 275,825 tons of mine production in Q3-13; and is an 11% increase from the
estimated 46,637 ounces mined in Q3-13. The majority of this increased mine production in Q3-
14, compared to Q3-13, resulted primarily from increased tonnage from Starvation Canyon as the
production rate in the comparative 2013 quarter continued to ramp up to current levels as well as
improved tonnage from the SSX-Steer with the transition to contract mining.
Smith Mine
In Q3-14 Small Mine Development, LLC ("SMD") delivered approximately 134,127 tons of ore
containing an estimated 22,202 ounces of gold from the Smith mine. This represents mine
production of 1,458 tons-per-day ("TPD") in Q3-14, above the targeted 1,200 TPD. This is a
decrease of mined ore from the Smith mine from Q3-13, which was 141,369 tons mined,
containing an estimated 22,518 ounces, an average of 1,537 TPD for that quarter. The estimated
average blended grade achieved at the Smith mine was 0.17 ounces-per-ton ("OPT") in Q3-14,
an increase from the 0.16 OPT achieved in Q3-13.
Starvation Canyon Mine
In Q3-14 SMD delivered approximately 89,158 tons of ore from the Starvation Canyon mine
containing an estimated 17,108 gold ounces, an average grade of 0.19 OPT. This mining rate
translates to 969 TPD for the quarter, well above the 700 TPD that was targeted. This is also an
increase of mined ore from the 56,680 tons, or 616 TPD, mined in Q3-13 containing an estimated
12,234 ounces, the first full quarter of operations at Starvation Canyon, at an average grade of
0.22 OPT.
SSX-Steer Mine
Mine production at the SSX-Steer mine was 81,178 tons for Q3-14, containing an estimated
10,903 gold ounces. This is approximately 882 TPD in Q3-14, slightly less than the 1,000 TPD
targeted, but greater than the 845 TPD achieved in Q3-13. In addition, Q3-14 results represent a
4% increase from the 77,776 tons mined from the SSX-Steer mine in Q3-13, but an 8% decrease
in contained ounces where 11,885 ounces were delivered from the mine in Q3-13. The
improvement in mined tons in Q3-14 was achieved even while SMD focused on catching up on
stope and drift backfill and mine development deficits. The lower overall SSX-Steer grade (0.13
OPT in Q3-14 versus 0.15 OPT in Q3-13) was a result of this focus.
The Company is in a good position to achieve the 2014 production targets as it expects
continued improvement in mining production which will be supplemented by mining at the Saval
4 mine upon the commencement of production later in Q4-2014. The Company exited the third
quarter of 2014 with a ROM stockpile of 70,624 wet tons containing approximately 7,969 ounces.
Mine production from Starvation Canyon and Smith mines continue to exceed targets. The
backfill and development deficit that has been built up at the SSX-Steer is targeted to be
completely caught up by Q1-15. In addition, production rates at SSX-Steer will continue to
improve throughout that time period.
Jerritt Canyon Processing
The Jerritt Canyon roaster facility processed approximately 330,300 tons in Q3-14, a 5%
increase from the approximately 314,506 tons processed through the roasters in Q3-13. The
Company continued to optimize mill throughput and took minimal scheduled down periods
during the quarter which accounted for the improvement in Q3-14 compared to Q3-13.
Outlook
As a result of the events leading up to, and including, the initiation of the Creditor Protection
Proceedings, the Company has significantly curtailed non-essential capital expenditures.
However, this curtailment of capital expenditures, if continued, will eventually result in a decline
in production levels, although the Company believes it can maintain current production levels for
an extended period of time. To maintain current targeted production the Company is evaluating
additional areas (mine faces) within Jerritt Canyon where additional near-mine reserves can be
accessed in the short term, to supplement production from the existing mine plan. The Company
is also in discussions with third parties for toll treatment of their ores and has recently signed an
agreement with Anova Metals USA, LLC, for potential ore deliveries commencing in mid-2015.
The Company is having continued discussions with Newmont USA Ltd. and continues to believe
that will be the primary source of third party ore.
Despite the operational setbacks and lack of available liquidity the Company believes it can
sustain a 2014 total gold production level of between approximately 145,000 and 155,000
ounces from its four underground mines. This includes increases coming from the fourth new
mine, Saval 4 that was recently permitted for production in October 2014 with the completion of
the secondary access portal.
Creditor Protection Proceedings
On June 9, 2014, the Company commenced proceedings under the Companies' Creditors
Arrangement Act ("CCAA"), establishing an initial stay of proceedings until July 8, 2014, in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia (the "Court") and received a temporary restraining order
under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Nevada ("US Court"). The Company and the wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company are parties to the CCAA and Chapter 15 proceedings (collectively, the "Creditor
Protection Proceedings"). On July 23, 2014 the US Court granted provisional relief under Section
1519 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States. This ruling recognized the Canadian
proceeding of Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ("CCAA") and as a result protects the
assets of the Company and the interests of the creditors until such time as a ruling on the Petition
for Recognition and Chapter 15 Relief is granted. The Company received CCAA extension
orders on July 4, August 1, September 12, and October 10, 2014 extending the stay of
proceedings granted by the Court to February 2, 2015.
After extensive exploration of alternatives following consultation with the Company's legal
advisors, financial advisors and the Special Committee, it was decided to commence CCAA
proceedings primarily to forestall actions that could have been taken subsequent to the demands
for payment made by Deutsche Bank AG ("DB") on June 3 but also to address near term liquidity
issues arising from declining gold prices and unexpected shut downs including the January 2014
shutdown resulting from the December 2013 fire as well as the extended maintenance shutdown
taken in March of 2014. During the third quarter the Company continued to advance the
restructuring plans as outlined further below.
On August 24, 2014 the Company finalized the terms for a Final Cash Collateral Order ("CCO")
with DB and this agreement was filed with the US Bankruptcy Court on August 25, 2014 and
subsequently approved in a hearing in Reno, Nevada on August 29, 2014. The terms of the CCO
required a number of milestones be met and agreed to by the Company in order to continue to
use the cash collateral (as defined under the US Bankruptcy code, but which would include cash
on hand and gold inventories). The significant milestones were as follows:
On or before August 31, 2014 â€“ the Company retains an Investment Bank acceptable to DB
to conduct a sale process for all or substantially all of the Company's assets with a closing
no later than January 30, 2015;
This work is to commence internally on September 1, 2014, however the sales
process will not commence externally until November 1, 2014 unless written notice is
provided by September 30, 2014 from the Monitor and the Chief Restructuring Officer
that there are no reasonable prospects for the purchase of the DB Gold Facility at
which point the sales process commences October 1, 2014;
On or before September 30, 2014 - Completion of Independent Technical Review by the
technical advisor including a review of the underlying assumptions of the CCO budget;
On or before October 31, 2014 â€“ the Company must close a refinancing transaction
sufficient to repay the indebtedness to DB at an agreed upon price or the Company
commences the sales process as outlined above on November 1, 2014;
On or before November 10, 2014 â€“ the Company is to file a motion seeking approval of the
procedures for the sale process into the Court and the US Court;
The orders approving the sales process are to be received no later than December
10, 2014;
December 31, 2014 is the closing date for bid documents under the sales process;
Subsequently the agreement requires the commencement of an auction process by
January 15, 2015 with Court and US Court approving the agreed sale by January 22,
2015 and expected closing by January 31, 2015.
Pursuant to the CCO outlined above, the Company engaged Moelis & Co. as the investment
banker for the purposes of conducting a sales process for the Company's assets. In their role they
will assist in identifying and evaluating candidates for a purchase transaction and contact
potential acquirers. This process does not preclude the Company from continuing to explore
opportunities to refinance the senior and subordinated debts at the same time. The sale process
has commenced on November 1, 2014 and the motion has been filed in the Court on November
10, 2014.
On September 3, 2014 the Court granted an order recognizing the CCO and giving full force and
effect to the CCO in the Creditor Protection Proceedings.
In September a $12 million revolving Debtor-in-Possession facility ("DIP loan") was secured from
Whitebox Advisors which could be drawn on to fund cash requirements based on the 13 week
cashflow forecast the Company had prepared for the Creditor Protection Proceedings. The Court
granted an order approving the DIP loan on October 3, 2014 and the Company has drawn $7.5
million since that time, primarily to fund required capital spend and the ongoing professional fee
costs as well as bonding requirements.
During the Creditor Protection Proceedings, the Company continues its daily operations while
pursuing a restructuring through a plan of compromise and arrangement (the "Plan"). The Plan
will involve a restructuring of the Company's current liabilities and will be subject to creditors'
vote and the approval of both the Court and US Court.
