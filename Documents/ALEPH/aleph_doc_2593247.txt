BRIGHTLANE CORP.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
(UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Brightlane Corp. (“we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” or the “Registrant”) was initially incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware in December 2006 under the name “Cold Gin
Corporation.” On December 27, 2010, in connection with an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization we changed our domicile from Delaware to Nevada, our name to Bonanza Gold
Corp.  In the third quarter of 2015, Brightlane Acquisition Corp. acquired a controlling interest in
the Company from existing shareholders.  This change of control began the transitioning to a
lease-to-own real estate company.  In connection with this transition, effective September 22,
2015 we changed our name to Brightlane Corp.
Our business model is oriented around acquiring single family homes and portfolios of single
family homes and then lease-to-own the properties whereby the lessees will eventually own the
home if they so choose.  Once the tenants fulfill their obligations under the contract, we will
deliver the deed to the lessees.  We will actively pursue the acquisition of these types of homes
through the purchase of bank REOs, portfolios and other methods of acquisition.
On December 21, 2015, we completed the agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Brightlane Homes, Inc. which through its wholly owned subsidiary acquired a 99.9% limited
partner interest in Brightlane RECA LP which is the beneficiary of the Brightlane RECA Trust
which owns a portfolio of assets here in referred to as the Brightlane RECA portfolio.  The
Brightlane RECA portfolio consists of approximately 350 income-producing owner-financed and
purchase money notes related to 350 single-family homes.  The underlying homes are
geographically dispersed across the Great Lakes, Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, Midwest and
Southeast regions of the U.S. and are held in a statutory trust known as Brightlane RECA Trust
for which Brightlane RECA LP is the sole beneficiary. The largest concentrations are in the
Southeast, particularly in South Carolina and North Carolina.  In addition to these income-
producing owner-financed and purchase money notes, there are additional REO properties in the
portfolio.
In May 2016, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary BrightLife Management.  This
operation will begin handling the management of newly acquired homes and begin the process
of vertically integrating property management services.  In the long-term this will allow us to:  (1)
manage our own assets; and (2) transition assets currently managed by third parties into our
integrated operations.  Both of these scenarios will have a positive impact on profitability.  We
have begun investing in the appropriate software assets and personnel to effectively operate this
new addition and enhancement to our operations.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business.    The  Company  has  not  generated  any  revenues  since  inception  and  has  an
accumulated  deficit  of  $1,474,731  as  of  June  30,  2016.  These  factors,  among  others,  raise
substantial  doubt  about  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  for  a
reasonable period of time.  The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon,
among  other  things,  its  ability  to  generate  revenues  and  its  ability  to  obtain  capital  from  third
parties.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.
6
The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and
classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The  accompanying  unaudited  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  for  interim  financial
statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United
States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (“SEC”).  Accordingly,  they  do  not  contain  all
information  and  footnotes  required  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United
States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management,
the  accompanying  unaudited  financial  statements  contain  all  the  adjustments  necessary
(consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as
of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The
results  of  operations  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  are  not  necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
related notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with
the SEC on April 14, 2016.
Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the
financial  statements  and  the  reported  amount  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company accounts for cash and cash equivalents under FASB ASC 305, “Cash and Cash
Equivalents”, and considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes.  Under the asset and
liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment
occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred tax assets
or liabilities were recognized at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Financial Instruments
The  Company’s  balance  sheet  includes  certain  financial  instruments:  primarily  accounts
payable,  accruals  and  debt  obligations.  The  carrying  amounts  of  current  assets  and  current
liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the
origination of these instruments and their expected realization.
7
ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” defines fair value as the exchange price
that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
most  advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants  on  the  measurement  date.  ASC  820  also  establishes  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that
distinguishes  between  (1)  market  participant  assumptions  developed  based  on  market  data
obtained  from  independent  sources  (observable  inputs)  and  (2)  an  entity’s  own  assumptions
about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances  (unobservable  inputs).  The  fair  value  hierarchy  consists  of  three  broad  levels,
which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of
the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement
date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest
rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
correlation or other means.
Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent
information  available  to  management  as  of  June  30,  2016.  The  respective  carrying  value  of
certain  on-balance-sheet  financial  instruments  approximated  their  fair  values  due  to  the  short-
term nature of these instruments.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries
Investments in non-consolidated entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis
depending  upon  the  level  of  ownership  and/or  the  Company's  ability  to  exercise  significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When the equity method is
used,  investments  are  recorded  at  original  cost  and  adjusted  periodically  to  recognize  the
Company's  proportionate  share  of  the  investees'  net  income  or  losses  after  the  date  of
investment. When net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed
its  carrying  amount,  the  investment  balance  is  reduced  to  zero  and  additional  losses  are  not
provided for. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the
entity subsequently reports net income and the Company's share of that net income exceeds the
share  of  net  losses  not  recognized  during  the  period  the  equity  method  was  suspended.
Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is
other than temporary has occurred.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived  assets  such  as  property,  equipment  and  identifiable  intangibles  are  reviewed  for
impairment  whenever  facts  and  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  may  not  be
recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized
based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future
cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows,
an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of
the  asset.  When  fair  values  are  not  available,  the  Company  estimates  fair  value  using  the
expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the
recovery of the assets. We did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.
8
Related Parties
The Company follows ASC 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related
parties and disclosure of related party transactions.
Stock-Based Compensation
FASB  ASC  718 “Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation,”  prescribes  accounting  and  reporting
standards for all stock-based payments award to employees, including employee stock options,
restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, may be classified
as either equity or liabilities. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-
based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or
other  assets  exists  if:  (a)  the  option  to  settle  by  issuing  equity  instruments  lacks  commercial
substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of an entity’s past practices or stated
policies.  If  a  present  obligation  exists,  the  transaction  should  be  recognized  as  a  liability;
otherwise, the transaction should be recognized as equity.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants
in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  FASB  ASC  505-50  “Equity  –  Based  Payments  to  Non-
Employees.” Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based
on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or
(b)  the  equity  instruments  issued.  The  fair  value  of  the  share-based  payment  transaction  is
determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We  have  reviewed  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  accounting
pronouncements  and  interpretations  thereof  that  have  effectiveness  dates  during  the  periods
reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements
that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or
modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or
operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our
financial management and certain standards are under consideration.
NOTE 4 – INVESTMENT IN NON-CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY
On December 21, 2015, we completed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Brightlane  Homes,  Inc.  which  through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  had  previously  acquired  a
99.9% limited partner interest in Brightlane RECA LP which is the beneficiary of the Brightlane
RECA Trust which owns a portfolio of assets here in referred to as the Brightlane RECA portfolio.
 The Brightlane RECA portfolio consists of approximately 350 income-producing owner-financed
and purchase money notes related to 350 single-family homes and real estate properties owned.
 The Company is accounting for its investment under the equity method of accounting due to the
Company not maintaining control of Brightlane RECA, LP, which full control remains with the
general partner, but having significant influence through its 99.99% limited partner interest. The
consideration  for  the  acquisition  was  12,000,000  shares  of  common  stock.  The  cost  of  the
acquisition was determined according to ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions, whereby the cost
of a nonmonetary asset acquired in exchange for another nonmonetary assets is the fair value of
the  asset  surrendered  or  received,  whichever  is  more  clearly  evident.  The  Company  has
determined that due to the inactive trading market of its common stock surrendered, the fair value
of the assets received were more clearly evident. The transaction was valued at the underlying
value of the assets in the Brightlane RECA portfolio, net of the associated debt.
9
The Company determined the value to be the fair value of the unpaid principal balance of the
individual purchase money notes and the fair value of the real estate owned, net of an underlying
“defined”  debt  (which  is  defined  in  the  original  contribution  agreement).    The  fair  value  of  the
purchase money notes and real estate owned was $8,885,152 and the balance of the defined
debt was $5,799,631 (resulting in a net value of $3,085,521) at the acquisition date of December
21,  2015.  According  to  the  limited  partner  agreement,  the  general  partner  will  recognize  all
income and receive all net cash flow from the Brightlane portfolio. Upon the company investing
additional  capital  into  Brightlane  RECA  LP,  which  will  be  used  to  pay  the  defined  debt,  the
general partner will transfer 90% of its general partner interest to the Company.
NOTE 5 – NOTES PAYABLE
On  September  30,  2015  the  Company  borrowed  $60,723  from  a  third  party.    The  note  bears
interest at 8% and is payable on demand. Interest is paid quarterly. The note is convertible into
common stock of the Company at $0.50 per share.  On January 28, 2016, the Company made a
principal payment of $10,723, bringing the outstanding principal to $50,000 on this note.  Interest
expense incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2,061.
NOTE 6 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On December 9, 2015, we entered into a subscription agreement to sell one unit consisting of a
$250,000 promissory note, one share of Series A Preferred Voting Stock and one share of Series
B Preferred Voting Stock to an accredited investor in exchange for $250,000 and the investor’s
agreement to utilize its best efforts to cause a capital injection of up to $3,000,000.00 into the
Company on or before January 1, 2017.  The promissory note carries an interest rate of 6% per
annum with a maturity date of December 9, 2018.  The lender may convert into shares of our
common  stock  after  one  year,  at  $0.50  per  share.    In  addition,  the  lender  has  the  option  of
accruing interest or receiving interest only payment annually. Interest expense for this note for the
six and three months ended June 30, 2016 was $7,500 and $3,750 respectively.
On  March  24,  2016,  we  received  an  additional  $110,000  in  capital  from  the  aforementioned
related party as an advance on the commitments this related party has to us.  We are carrying this
additional  note  at  the  same  terms  in  which  prior  note  was  receive  from  this  related  party  (an
interest  rate  of  6%  per  annum  with  a  three-year  maturity  date).    The  lender  has  the  option  of

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $59,411 and had a working capital deficit
of $21,010.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $195,944.  We had a
negative change of $5,266 due to accounts payable, a positive change of $9,062 due to accrued
interest, and a negative change of $62,900 due to the acquisition of real estate consisting of three
homes.  As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $255,058 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $8,421.  We had an
adjustment of $484 due to depreciation expenses.  We had a positive change of $1,937 due to
accounts payable and a positive change of $6,000 due to accrued expenses.  As a result, we had
net cash used in operating activities of $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we spent $700 on the purchase of equipment, resulting
in net cash used in investing activities of $700 for the period.  We did not pursue any investing
activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received $110,000 as proceeds from a related party
and repaid a demand note payable of $10,723.  As a result, we had net cash provided by
financing activities of $99,277 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  We did not pursue any
financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Our working capital deficit at June 30, 2016 was $21,021 and our working capital at December
31,  2015  was  $128,522  respectively.  The  increase  in  our  working  capital  is  attributed  to
increased activity in real estate acquisition of $62,900.
The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are
beyond our control. We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong.
We  may  need  to  obtain  additional  funds  sooner  or  in  greater  amounts  than  we  currently
anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of
our shares or debt and other sources. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets
when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements.  While we have a best
efforts  commitment  from  the  aforementioned  accredited  investor  it  is  uncertain  when  such
additional funding will be available and whether the terms will be acceptable to us. If we raise
funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common
stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to
obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we
may have to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of
operations would be materially harmed.
We have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties
as of June 30, 2016, other than the work commitment previously mentioned, that will result in or
that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.
Capital Resources
We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of June 30, 2016.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Not applicable because the Company is a smaller reporting company.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  our  reports  filed  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial Officer, or persons
performing  similar  functions,  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required
disclosure.  Our  management  carried  out  an  evaluation  under  the  supervision  and  with  the
participation of our Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  ("Exchange  Act").
Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June
30,  2016,  due  to  the  material  weaknesses  resulting  from  the  Board  of  Directors  not  currently
having  any  independent  members  and  no  director  qualifies  as  an  audit  committee  financial
expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in
place  to  ensure  that  all  disclosures  required  were  originally  addressed  in  our  financial
statements.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have
been  no  significant  changes  in  our  internal  controls  or  in  other  factors  that  could  significantly
affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.
