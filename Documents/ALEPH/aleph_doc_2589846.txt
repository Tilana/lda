CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
As used in this report, the terms “Valero,” “we,” “us,” or “our” may refer to Valero Energy
Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole.
These unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States
(U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Financial information for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included in these Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements is derived from our unaudited financial statements. Operating results for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.
The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from our audited financial
statements as of that date. For further information, refer to our financial statements and notes
thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts reported as of December 31, 2015 have been reclassified in order to conform to
the 2016 presentation, including the retrospective adoption of certain amendments to the
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of the
amendments to ASC Subtopic 835-30, “Interest–Imputation of Interest,” resulted in the
reclassification of certain debt issuance costs from “deferred charges and other assets, net” to
“debt and capital lease obligations, less current portion.” The adoption of the amendments to
ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax
assets and current deferred income tax liabilities to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities.
The following table presents our previously reported balance sheet line items retrospectively
adjusted for the adoption of these pronouncements (in millions):

Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we
review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and
circumstances may result in revised estimates.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period
In February 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” were amended to improve
consolidation guidance for certain types of legal entities. The guidance modifies the evaluation of
whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or
voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a
limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with
VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. These
provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and
interim periods within those annual periods. With the adoption of this guidance effective
January 1, 2016, we have determined that Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP) is a VIE. Since we
previously consolidated the financial statements of VLP, the adoption of this guidance did not
affect our financial position or results of operations. See Note 9 for disclosures related to our
consolidated VIEs.
In April 2015, the provisions of ASC Subtopic 835-30, “Interest–Imputation of Interest,” were
amended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt
issuance costs related to a note be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
face amount of that note, consistent with debt discounts, and that amortization of debt issuance
costs be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, these provisions were further amended
with guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff, which provides that the staff
would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-
credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs
ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any
outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These provisions are to be applied
retrospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance effective
January 1, 2016 did not materially affect our financial position and did not affect our results of
operations because we already reported the amortization of debt issuance costs as interest
expense. See “Basis of Presentation–Reclassifications” above for the reclassified presentation in
our balance sheet. Debt issuance costs associated with our line-of-credit arrangements will
continue to be reported in the balance sheet as “deferred charges and other assets, net.”
In May 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” were amended to
remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair
value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The guidance also
removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be
measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and limits those disclosures to
investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical
expedient. These provisions are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual
periods. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 did not affect our financial
position or results of operations, but will result in revised annual disclosures related to the fair
value presentation of
6
Table of Contents
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION
CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
certain assets of our defined benefit pension plans for which fair value is measured using net
asset value per share as a practical expedient. In accordance with the new guidance, these
investments will no longer be categorized within the fair value hierarchy. Changes to prior period
disclosures will be applied retrospectively in accordance with the guidance.
In September 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” were amended
to simplify the accounting and reporting of adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized
in a business combination. The amendment requires that an acquirer (i) record, in the same
period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or
other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if
the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and (ii) present separately on the
statement of income or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period
earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the
adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. These
provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and
interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied prospectively to adjustments
made to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance
effective January 1, 2016 did not affect our financial position or results of operations; however, it
may result in changes to the manner in which adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in
a future business combination, if any, are presented in our financial statements.
In November 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” were amended to simplify
the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities
and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The amendments are
effective for financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of
any interim or annual period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all
deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Entities applying the
guidance retrospectively should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of adoption the
nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative information about
the effects of the accounting change on prior periods. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted this
guidance on a retrospective basis, but such adoption did not materially affect our financial
position and it did not impact our results of operations. Upon adoption, our current deferred
income tax assets of $74 million and current deferred income tax liabilities of $366 million as of
December 31, 2015 were reclassified to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities. See “Basis of
Presentation–Reclassifications” above for the reclassified presentation. Adoption of this
guidance simplifies the future presentation of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
In March 2016, the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation–Stock Compensation,” were
amended to simplify the accounting and reporting for employee share-based payments. These
amendments involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including accounting for income taxes as it pertains to the recognition of excess tax benefits and
tax deficiencies in the statements of income, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding
requirements, as well as classification of excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid in the
statement of cash flows. These provisions are effective for public companies for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods,
with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period. The amendments provide specific transition and disclosure
guidance for each provision.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION
CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis, and such adoption
did not materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Excess tax
benefits, which were previously reported in cash flows from financing activities, are currently
reported in cash flows from operating activities.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In May 2014, the ASC was amended and a new accounting standard, ASC Topic 606, “Revenue
from Contracts with Customers,” was issued to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. The
standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim reporting periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the effect that
adopting this standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.
In July 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 330, “Inventory” were amended to simplify the
measurement of inventory measured using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. These
provisions are to be applied prospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early
adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2017 will not affect our
financial position or results of operations.
In January 2016, the provisions of ASC Subtopic 825-10, “Financial Instruments–Overall,” were
amended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments regarding certain aspects of
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure. These provisions are effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
annual periods. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this standard will have on our
financial statements and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the ASC was amended and a new accounting standard, ASC Topic 842,
“Leases,” was issued to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for public companies for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within
those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that
adopting this standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.

2.IMPAIRMENT
In 2012, we suspended the operations of the Aruba Refinery and reorganized the associated
crude oil and refined products terminal assets into a terminaling and transshipment facility
(collectively, the Aruba Terminal), which we continue to operate. We also wrote off all of the
carrying value of the refining assets at that time because we determined they had no value after
considering estimated salvage costs, and in 2014, we formally abandoned those refining assets.
(We now refer to those refining assets as the Aruba Refinery.) Since that time, we have been in
negotiations with the Government of Aruba (GOA) to settle our obligations under various
agreements, including agreements that require us to dismantle our leasehold improvements
under certain conditions.
In June 2016, the GOA entered into definitive agreements with an unrelated third party that
provide for such third party to lease the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal from the GOA, restart
and operate the Aruba Refinery, and operate the Aruba Terminal. Because of this development,
we now believe that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately transfer ownership of the
Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA and settle the obligations mentioned above.
Therefore, we evaluated the Aruba Terminal for potential impairment as of June 30, 2016 and
concluded that it was impaired, resulting in an asset impairment loss of $56 million related to our
refining segment. See Note 12 for disclosure related to the method to determine fair value. No
income tax benefit was recorded for this asset impairment loss as we do not expect to realize a
tax benefit.
We are continuing to negotiate with the GOA regarding the matters discussed above and with the
unrelated third party, but the resolution of those matters is not yet known. In addition, a negotiated
resolution, if reached, must ultimately be voted on and approved by the Aruba Parliament.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. As of December 31, 2015, we had a
valuation reserve of $766 million in order to state our inventories at market. As of June 30, 2016,
we reevaluated our inventories and determined that our cost was lower than market. As a result,
for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a change in our lower of cost or market
inventory valuation reserve that resulted in a net benefit to our results of operations of
$747 million. The income statement benefit for the six months ended June 30,

CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
2016 differs from the change in the balance sheet reserve due to the foreign currency effect of
inventories held by our international operations.
As of June 30, 2016, the replacement cost (market value) of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories
exceeded their LIFO carrying amounts by $713 million. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, our non-LIFO inventories accounted for $681 million and $668 million, respectively, of our
total inventories.

Credit Facilities
Revolver
We have a $3 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolver) that matures in November 2020. We
have the option to increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolver to $4.5 billion,
subject to certain conditions. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up
to $2.0 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the Revolver as of June 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015, and we had no borrowings under the Revolver during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015.
VLP Revolver
VLP has a $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver) that matures
in November 2020. The VLP Revolver is available only to the operations of VLP, and creditors of
VLP do not have recourse against Valero. VLP has the option to increase the aggregate
commitments under the VLP Revolver to $1.0 billion, subject to certain conditions. The
VLP Revolver also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $100 million. Outstanding
borrowings under the VLP Revolver bear interest at a variable rate, which was 1.75 percent as of
June 30, 2016.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, VLP borrowed $139 million under the VLP Revolver
in connection with VLP’s acquisition of the McKee Terminal Services Business from us in April
2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, VLP borrowed $200 million under the
VLP Revolver in connection with VLP’s acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal
Services Business from us. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, VLP made
no repayments under the VLP Revolver.
Canadian Revolver
One of our Canadian subsidiaries has a C$50 million committed revolving credit facility (the
Canadian Revolver) that matures in November 2016. No amounts were outstanding under the
Canadian Revolver as of June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, and we had no borrowings under
the Canadian Revolver during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Accounts Receivable Sales Facility
We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial
institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis. In July 2016, we amended our
agreement to decrease the facility from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion and extended the maturity date
to July 2017. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt. Under
this program, one of our marketing subsidiaries (Valero Marketing) sells eligible receivables,
without recourse, to another of our subsidiaries (Valero Capital), whereupon the receivables are
no longer owned by Valero Marketing. Valero Capital, in turn, sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the
10

CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
third-party entities and financial institutions. To the extent that Valero Capital retains an
ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased from Valero Marketing, such interest is
included in our financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial
statements of Valero Capital with those of Valero Energy Corporation; the receivables are not
available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Valero Marketing or Valero Energy Corporation.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no proceeds from or repayments
under the accounts receivable sales facility.

As of June 30, 2016, the actual availability under the accounts receivable sales facility fell
below the facility borrowing capacity to $1.2 billion primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade
receivables as a result of the current market price environment for the finished products that
we produce.
In July 2016, we amended one of our committed letter of credit facilities to extend the maturity
date from June 2016 to June 2017.

Non-Bank Debt
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings or repayments under our
non-bank debt.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we issued $600 million of 3.65 percent senior notes
due March 15, 2025 and $650 million of 4.9 percent senior notes due March 15, 2045. Proceeds
from these debt issuances totaled $1.246 billion. We also incurred $12 million of debt issuance
costs.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we made scheduled debt repayments of
$400 million related to our 4.5 percent senior notes and $75 million related to our 8.75 percent
debentures.

Other Debt
In June 2016, a joint venture in Canada that we consolidate entered into a C$72 million senior
secured credit facility. This non-revolving credit facility bears interest at a fixed rate (as defined by
the lender) plus the applicable margin and matures in June 2023. Borrowings under this facility
totaled C$72 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the effective
interest rate of this facility was 3.85 percent.
Capitalized Interest
Capitalized interest was $19 million and $16 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and $39 million and $32 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
5.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Matters
We are involved, together with several other companies, in an environmental cleanup in the
Village of Hartford, Illinois (the Village) and during 2015, one of these companies assumed the
ongoing remediation in the Village pursuant to a federal court order. We had previously
conducted an initial response in the Village, along with other companies, pursuant to an
administrative order issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The parties
involved in the initial response may have further claims between themselves for costs already
incurred. We also continue to be engaged in site assessment and interim measures at the
adjacent shutdown refinery site, which we acquired as part of an acquisition in 2005, and we are
in litigation with other potentially responsible parties and the Illinois EPA relating to the
remediation of the site. In each of these matters, we have various defenses and rights for
contribution from the other responsible parties. We have recorded a liability for our own expected
contribution obligations. However, because of the unpredictable nature of these cleanups, the
methodology for allocation of liabilities, and the state of Illinois’ failure to directly sue third parties
responsible for historic contamination at the site, it is reasonably possible that we could incur a
loss in a range of $0 to $200 million in excess of the amount of our accrual to ultimately resolve
these matters. Factors underlying this estimated range are expected to change from time to time,
and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate.
Litigation Matters
We are party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We have
not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to some of these matters because we have
determined that it is remote that a loss has been incurred. For other matters, we have recorded a
loss contingency liability where we have determined that it is probable that a loss has been
incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. These loss contingency liabilities are not
material to our financial position. We re-evaluate and update our loss contingency liabilities as
matters progress over time, and we believe that any changes to the recorded liabilities will not be
material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

9.VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
In the normal course of business, we have financial interests in certain entities that have been
determined to be VIEs. We consolidate a VIE when we have a variable interest in an entity for
which we are the primary beneficiary such that we have (a) the power to direct the activities of the
VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to
absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to
the VIE. In order to make this determination, we evaluated our contractual arrangements with the
VIEs, including arrangements for the use of assets, purchases of products and services, debt,
equity, or management of operating activities.
The following discussion summarizes our involvement with our VIEs:
•
VLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership whose common limited partner units are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange under “VLP.” We formed VLP in July 2013 to own,
operate, develop, and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products pipelines, terminals, and
other transportation and logistics assets. VLP’s assets include crude oil and refined products
pipeline and terminal systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that are
integral to the operations of nine of our refineries. As of June 30, 2016, we owned a 66.1 percent
limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in VLP, and public unitholders
owned a 31.9 percent limited partner interest.
VLP was determined to be a VIE because the public limited partners of VLP (i.e., parties other
than entities under common control with the general partner) lack the power to direct the activities
of VLP that most significantly impact its economic performance because they do not have
substantive kick-out rights over the general partner or substantive participating rights in VLP.
Furthermore, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of VLP because (a) we are the
single decision maker and because our general partner interest provides us with the sole power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact VLP’s economic performance and (b) our
66.1 percent limited partner interest and 2 percent general partner interest provide us with
significant economic rights and obligations. All of VLP’s revenues are derived from us; therefore,
there is limited risk to us associated with VLP’s operations.
•
Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD) is a joint venture with Darling Green Energy LLC, a
subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc., that was formed to construct and operate a biodiesel plant
that processes animal fats, used cooking oils, and other vegetable oils into renewable green
diesel. The plant is located next to our St. Charles Refinery and began operations in June 2013.
Our significant agreements with DGD include a debt agreement whereby we financed
approximately 60 percent of the construction costs of the plant, an operations agreement that
outlines our responsibilities as operator of the plant, and a marketing agreement.
In the event of certain conditions, the debt agreement provides us (as lender) with certain power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact DGD’s economic performance. Because the
loan agreement conveys such power to us and is separate from our ownership rights, DGD was
determined to be a VIE. For this reason and because we hold a 50 percent ownership interest
that provides us with significant economic rights and obligations, we determined that we are the
primary beneficiary
19
Table of Contents
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION
CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
of DGD. DGD has risk associated with its operations because it generates revenues from third-
party customers.
•
We also have financial interests in other entities in which we hold a 50 percent ownership
interest, which is a significant variable interest. These entities were determined to be VIEs
because the entities’ contractual arrangements transfer the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact their economic performance or reduce the exposure to operational
variability and risk of loss created by the entity that otherwise would be held exclusively by the
equity owners. Furthermore, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs
because (a) certain contractual arrangements (exclusive of our ownership rights) provide us with
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of
these entities and (b) our 50 percent ownership interests provide us with significant economic
rights and obligations. The financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of these VIEs
are not material to us.
The VIEs’ assets can only be used to settle their own obligations and the VIEs’ creditors have no
recourse to our assets. We do not provide financial guarantees to our VIEs. Although we have
provided credit facilities to the VIEs in support of their construction or acquisition activities, these
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows are impacted by our consolidated VIEs’ performance, net of intercompany
eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in each VIE.
The following tables present summarized balance sheet information for the significant assets and
liabilities of our VIEs, which are included in our balance sheets (in millions).

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts
reflected in the applicable balance sheets for the respective periods for the following reasons:
the amounts shown above exclude changes in cash and temporary cash investments, deferred
income taxes, and current portion of debt and capital lease obligations;
amounts accrued for capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs are
reflected in investing activities when such amounts are paid;
amounts accrued for common stock purchases in the open market that are not settled as of the
balance sheet date are reflected in financing activities when the purchases are settled and paid;
and
certain differences between balance sheet changes and the changes reflected above result from
translating foreign currency denominated balances at the applicable exchange rates as of each
balance sheet date.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
General
U.S. GAAP requires or permits certain assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value on a
recurring or nonrecurring basis in our balance sheets, and those assets and liabilities are
presented below under “Recurring Fair Value Measurements” and “Nonrecurring Fair Value
Measurements.” Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, such as
derivative financial instruments, are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as the impairment of
property, plant and equipment, are measured at fair value in particular circumstances.
U.S. GAAP also requires the disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments when an option
to elect fair value accounting has been provided, but such election has not been made. A debt
obligation is an example of such a financial instrument. The disclosure of the fair values of
financial instruments not recognized at fair value in our balance sheet is presented below under
“Other Financial Instruments.”
U.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques based on the degree to which objective
prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. Following is a description of
each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
•
•
markets that are not active.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect our own
assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs
are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might
include
•

occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as
internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments
for which the fair value determination requires significant judgment.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The tables below present information (in millions) about our assets and liabilities recognized at
their fair values in our balance sheets categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the
inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative
contracts executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral assets or
obligations as shown below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented in the
tables below on a gross basis. We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting
arrangements that are reflected gross on the balance sheet.

A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation
methods and inputs we used to develop their fair value measurements are as follows:
Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures and swaps, and as
disclosed in Note 13, some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. These
contracts are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are
valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair
•
•value hierarchy. Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and
exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but because
they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a
comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy.
Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts. The
fair values of these purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted
prices from the commodity exchange or an independent pricing service and are categorized in
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Investments of certain benefit plans consist of investment securities held by trusts for the
purpose of satisfying a portion of our obligations under certain U.S. nonqualified benefit plans.
The assets categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a
market approach based on quoted prices from national securities exchanges. The assets
categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair value of
which is provided by the insurer.
•

•
Foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts entered
into for our international operations to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of those
operations. These contracts are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Environmental credit obligations represent our liability for the purchase of (i) biofuel credits
(primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the U.S.) needed to satisfy our obligation
to blend biofuels into the products we produce and (ii) emission credits under the California
Global Warming Solutions Act (the California cap-and-trade system, also known as AB 32) and
Quebec’s Regulation respecting the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission
allowances (the Quebec cap-and-trade system), (collectively, the cap-and-trade systems). To
the degree we are unable to blend biofuels (such as ethanol and biodiesel) at percentages
required under the biofuel programs, we must purchase biofuel credits to comply with these
programs. Under the cap-and-trade systems, we must purchase emission credits to comply with
these systems. These programs are further described in Note 13 under “Environmental
Compliance Program Price Risk.” The liability for environmental credits is based on our deficit
for such credits as of the balance sheet date, if any, after considering any credits acquired or
under contract, and is equal to the product of the credits deficit and the market price of these
credits as of the balance sheet date. The environmental credit obligations are categorized in
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured at fair value using the market approach
based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for assets and liabilities held as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
There was no activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 related to
the fair value amounts categorized in Level 3 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
As discussed in Note 2, we concluded that the Aruba Terminal was impaired as of June 30,
2016, which resulted in an asset impairment loss of $56 million that was recorded in June 2016.
The fair value of the Aruba Terminal was determined using an income approach and is classified
in Level 3. We employed a probability-weighted approach to possible future cash flow scenarios,
including transferring ownership of the business to the GOA or continuing to operate.
There were no liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30,
2016.
There were no assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of
December 31, 2015.

The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these financial
instruments are as follows:
The fair value of cash and temporary cash investments approximates the carrying value due to
the low level of credit risk of these assets combined with their short maturities and market
interest rates (Level 1).
The fair value of debt is determined primarily using the market approach based on quoted prices
provided by third-party brokers and vendor pricing services (Level 2).

13.PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities,
foreign currency exchange rates, and the price of credits needed to comply with various
government and regulatory programs. We enter into derivative instruments to manage some of
these risks, including derivative instruments related to the various commodities we purchase or
produce, and foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below under
“Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk.” These derivative instruments are recorded as
either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see Note 12), as summarized below
under “Fair Values of Derivative Instruments,” with changes in fair value recognized currently in
income, except for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges whose changes in fair
value are recognized in income in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect
income. The effect of these derivative instruments on our income is summarized below under
“Effect of Derivative Instruments on Income.” The cash flow effects of all of our derivative
instruments are reflected in operating activities in our statements of cash flows for all periods
presented.
Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk
Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products
(primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our
operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows,
we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, and options. We use the
futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our
hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. Our
positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by
our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been
approved by our board of directors.
To manage commodity price risk, we use economic hedges, which are not designated as fair
value or cash flow hedges, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. We
also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objectives for
entering into hedges or trading derivatives are described below.
Economic Hedges – Economic hedges represent commodity derivative instruments that are
used to manage price volatility in certain (i) feedstock and refined product inventories, (ii) fixed-
•
price purchase contracts, and (iii) forecasted feedstock, refined product or natural gas purchases
and refined product sales. The objectives of our economic hedges are to hedge price volatility in
certain feedstock and refined product inventories and to lock in the price of forecasted feedstock,
refined product, or natural gas purchases or refined product sales at existing market prices that
we deem favorable. Economic hedges are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes, usually due to the difficulty of establishing the required documentation at
the date the derivative instrument is entered into for them to qualify as hedging instruments for
accounting purposes.
As of June 30, 2016, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that
were used as economic hedges, as well as commodity derivative instruments related to the
physical purchase of corn at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of
outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels,

Trading Derivatives – Our objective for entering into commodity derivative instruments for
trading purposes is to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of
operations and cash flows.
As of June 30, 2016, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that
were entered into for trading purposes. The information presents the notional volume of

We had no commodity derivative contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 or during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 that were designated as fair value or cash flow
hedges.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international
operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of those
operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign
currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments for accounting purposes and therefore are classified as economic hedges. As of
June 30, 2016, we had forward contracts to purchase $356 million of U.S. dollars. These
contracts matured on or before July 31, 2016.
Environmental Compliance Program Price Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply
with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this
risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some
of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception
and do not record these contracts at their fair values. Certain of these programs require us to
blend biofuels into the products we produce, and we are subject to such programs in most of the
countries in which we operate. These countries set annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels
that must be blended into the motor fuels consumed in these countries. As a producer of motor
fuels from petroleum, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at
31
Table of Contents
VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION
CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
a rate that is at least equal to the applicable quota. To the degree we are unable to blend at the
applicable rate, we must purchase biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.). We are exposed to
the volatility in the market price of these credits, and we manage that risk by purchasing biofuel
credits when prices are deemed favorable. The cost of meeting our obligations under these
compliance programs was $173 million and $56 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and $334 million and $189 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are reflected in cost of sales.
Effective January 1, 2015, we became subject to additional requirements under greenhouse gas
emission programs, including the cap-and-trade systems, as discussed in Note 12. Under these
cap-and-trade systems, we purchase various greenhouse gas emission credits available on the
open market. Therefore, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these credits. The
cost to implement certain provisions of the cap-and-trade systems are significant; however, we
recovered the majority of these costs from our customers for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 and expect to continue to recover the majority of these costs in the future. For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the net cost of meeting our obligations under
these compliance programs was immaterial.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments
The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions) and the line items in the balance sheets in
which the fair values are reflected. See Note 12 for additional information related to the fair
values of our derivative instruments.
As indicated in Note 12, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative
contracts executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements, including
cash collateral assets and obligations. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross
asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts
and certain liabilities in asset accounts.

Market and Counterparty Risk
Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments
into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in
market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our
exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of
directors. Market risks are monitored by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our
stated risk management policy. We do not require any collateral or other security to support
derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that
require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
This Form 10-Q, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading
“OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,”
“expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,”
“guidance,” “target,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions.
These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:
•
•
•future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins;
•future ethanol margins;
expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating
expenses;
•anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories;
our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred costs for refinery turnarounds and
catalyst, capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and joint venture
investments, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations;
anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined
products in the regions where we operate, as well as globally;
•expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and
the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and ethanol industry
fundamentals.
•
•
We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections
about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In
addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future
events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from
the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements.
Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-
looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following:
•
•
•
acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to
produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks;
•political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined products;
demand for, and supplies of, refined products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals,
and ethanol;
•demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks;
the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and
to maintain crude oil price and production controls;
•the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;
•refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;
•our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations;
the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in
response to market conditions;
•the level of competitors’ imports into markets that we supply;

Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future
results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate.
Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and
future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements.
We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do
so.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting
on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no
obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be
made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.
This Form 10-Q includes references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include
adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders, adjusted earnings
per common share –assuming dilution, adjusted operating income, and gross margin. We have
included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating
results between periods. See the accompanying financial tables in “RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS” for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. In note (c) to the accompanying tables, we disclose
the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful
information.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
Overview
Second Quarter Results
In the second quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of
$814 million, or $1.73 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $1.4 billion, or $2.66 per share
(assuming dilution), in the second quarter of 2015, which represents a decrease of $537 million.
However, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders in the second quarter of 2016
of $503 million, or $1.07 per share (assuming dilution), decreased by $848 million from the
comparable 2015 period.
Our results for the second quarter of 2016 include a noncash benefit of $454 million from a lower
of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, of which $434 million was attributable to our
refining segment and $20 million was attributable to our ethanol segment. This benefit less
related tax expense of $87 million resulted in an after-tax benefit of $367 million, or $0.78 per
share (assuming dilution). In addition, our results for the second quarter of 2016 include a
noncash charge of $56 million, or $0.12 per share (assuming dilution), from an asset impairment
loss related to our Aruba Terminal, which was attributable to our refining segment. These matters
are more fully described in Notes 3 and 2, respectively, of Condensed Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. These items are excluded from our actual results to determine the adjusted
amounts.
The decrease of $537 million in net income attributable to Valero stockholders and the decrease
of $848 million in adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders in the second quarter of
2016 from the second quarter of 2015 were due to decreases in our operating income and
adjusted operating income, respectively. Our second quarter 2016 operating income decreased
$847 million from the second quarter of 2015 as outlined by segment in the following table (in
millions).

The $1.2 billion decrease in refining segment adjusted operating income was due primarily to
lower margins on refined products and lower discounts on light sweet crude oils relative to
Brent crude oil. Our ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased $59 million due
primarily to lower ethanol margins that resulted from higher corn prices and lower co-product
prices.

First Six Months Results
For the first six months of 2016, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of
$1.3 billion, or $2.78 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $2.3 billion, or $4.52 per share
(assuming dilution), for the first six months of 2015, which represents a decrease of $1.0 billion.
However, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders for the first six months of 2016
of $786 million, or $1.67 per share (assuming dilution), decreased by $1.5 billion from the
comparable 2015 period.
Our results for the first six months of 2016 include a noncash benefit of $747 million from a lower
of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, of which $697 million was attributable to our
refining segment and $50 million was attributable to our ethanol segment. This benefit less
related tax expense of $168 million resulted in an after-tax benefit of $579 million, or $1.23 per
share (assuming dilution). In addition, our results for the first six months of 2016 include a
noncash charge of $56 million, or $0.12 per share (assuming dilution), from an asset impairment
loss related to our Aruba Terminal, which was attributable to our refining segment. These matters
are more fully described in Notes 3 and 2, respectively, of Condensed Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. These items are excluded from our actual results to determine the adjusted
amounts.
The decrease of $1.0 billion in net income attributable to Valero stockholders and the decrease
of $1.5 billion in adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders in the first six months of
2016 from the first six months of 2015 were due to decreases in our operating income and
adjusted operating income, respectively. Our first six months of 2016 operating income
decreased $1.5 billion from the first six months of 2015 as outlined by segment in the following
table (in millions).

The $2.2 billion decrease in refining segment adjusted operating income was due primarily to
lower margins on refined products and lower discounts on light sweet crude oils relative to
Brent crude oil. Our ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased $62 million due
primarily to lower ethanol margins that resulted from lower ethanol prices and lower co-product
prices.

Outlook
Energy markets and margins were volatile during the second quarter of 2016, and we expect
them to continue to be volatile during the remainder of 2016. Below is a summary of factors that
have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the third quarter of 2016:
Gasoline margins are expected to decline seasonally due to high industry-wide inventory levels
and the end to the summer driving season. Distillate margins are expected to improve as
industry-wide inventory levels have declined.
Medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain wide as sour crude oil
remains oversupplied. Fuel oil price weakness continues to put pressure on heavy sour crude
oil discounts. Sweet crude oil discounts are expected to remain narrow with the expectation of a
continued decline in domestic sweet crude oil production.
•Ethanol margins are expected to improve slightly primarily due to lower expected corn prices.
A decline in market prices of refined products may negatively impact the carrying value of our
inventories.

General
Operating revenues decreased $5.5 billion (or 22 percent) and cost of sales decreased
$4.3 billion (or 20 percent) in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015
primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively.
Operating income decreased $847 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second
quarter of 2015, with refining segment operating income decreasing by $829 million and ethanol
segment operating income decreasing by $39 million. Adjusted operating income decreased
$1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, with refining
segment adjusted operating income decreasing $1.2 billion and ethanol segment adjusted
operating income decreasing $59 million. The reasons for these changes in the adjusted
operating results of our segments, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed
below.
Refining
Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased $1.2 billion for the second quarter of
2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to a $1.2 billion decrease in refining
gross margin and a $33 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a
$33 million decrease in operating expenses.
Refining gross margin decreased $1.2 billion (a $4.78 per barrel decrease) for the second quarter
of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, due primarily to the following:
•
Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins in all of our
regions in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. For example, the
Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was
$9.47 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $13.41 per barrel in the second
quarter of 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $3.94 per barrel. We estimate that the
decrease in distillate margins in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of
2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $400 million.
•
Decrease in gasoline margins - We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins in all of our
regions in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. For example, the
WTI-based reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was $13.77 per barrel in
the second quarter of 2016 compared to $19.87 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015,
representing an unfavorable decrease of $6.10 per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based
reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB gasoline that was $21.56 per barrel in the
second quarter of 2016 compared to $30.63 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015,
representing an unfavorable decrease of $9.07 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in
gasoline margins per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of
2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $350 million.
•
Lower discounts on light sweet crude oils - The market prices for refined products generally
track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we
process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, such as WTI and LLS crude
oils in periods when pricing terms are favorable. During the second quarter of 2016, we
benefited from processing WTI; however, that benefit declined when compared to the benefit
from processing WTI during the second quarter of 2015. For example, WTI crude oil processed
in our U.S. Mid-Continent region sold at a discount of $1.47 per barrel to Brent crude oil in the
second quarter of 2016 compared to a discount of $5.66 per barrel in the second quarter of
2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $4.19 per barrel. LLS crude oil processed during
the second quarter of 2016 priced at a premium to Brent crude oil of $0.39 per barrel compared
to a discount of $0.53 per barrel during the second quarter of 2015, representing an unfavorable
decrease of $0.92 per barrel. We estimate that the cost to process light sweet
49
Table of Contents
crude oils in the second quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of
approximately $330 million.
Higher costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending
obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these
•credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $117 million from $56 million in the second
quarter of 2015 to $173 million in second quarter of 2016. This increase was due to an increase
in the market price of RINs caused by an expected shortage in the market of available RINs.
The decrease of $33 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $26 million decrease
in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices ($2.08 per MMBtu in the second quarter of
2016 compared to $2.69 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2015).
The increase of $33 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an
increase of $14 million in depreciation expense associated with new capital projects and
$9 million in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense resulting from the completion
of turnaround projects at several of our refineries.
Ethanol
Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased $59 million for the second quarter of
2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to a $53 million (or $0.16 per gallon)
decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in operating expenses.
The decrease in ethanol segment gross margin of $53 million was due primarily to the following:
•
Higher corn prices - Corn prices were higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the
second quarter of 2015 primarily due to forecasted unfavorable weather conditions on the
current corn crop in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent combined with
increased export demand for U.S. corn supplies. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade corn
price was $3.91 per bushel in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $3.66 per bushel in the
second quarter of 2015. We estimate that the increase in the price of corn that we processed
during the second quarter of 2016 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of
approximately $30 million.
•
Lower co-product prices - A decrease in export demand had an unfavorable effect on the prices
we received for corn-related co-products, primarily distillers grains. We estimate that the
decrease in distillers grain prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of
approximately $30 million.
The $9 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $6 million decrease in
energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.08 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2016
compared to $2.69 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2015).
The increase of $15 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due a
$10 million gain on sale of certain plant assets in the second quarter of 2015 that was reflected in
depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense
in that quarter.

We evaluated the Aruba Terminal for potential impairment as of June 30, 2016 and concluded
that it was impaired, resulting in an asset impairment loss of $56 million related to our refining
segment. This matter is more fully described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Income tax expense decreased $317 million from the second quarter of 2015 to the second
quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax
rates of 26 percent in the second quarter of 2016 and 31 percent in the second quarter of 2015
are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international
operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in the
second quarter of 2016 was lower than the rate in the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to the
impact from the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve of $454 million
in the second quarter of 2016. The majority of that amount impacted our international operations,
which increased the amount of income before income tax expense generated by our operations
with lower statutory tax rates.

The following notes relate to references on pages 39 through 48 and pages 52 through 61.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or
(a)
market. When the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record a lower of cost or
market inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market. In subsequent
periods, the value of our inventory is reassessed and a lower of cost or market inventory
valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the lower of cost or market
inventory valuation reserve between periods. In recent periods, the market price of our
inventory has risen above cost; therefore, we did not record a lower of cost or market inventory
valuation reserve as of June 30, 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we
recorded a change in our inventory valuation reserve that resulted in a noncash benefit of
$454 million, of which $434 million and $20 million were attributable to our refining segment
and ethanol segment, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded
a change in our inventory valuation reserve that resulted in a noncash benefit of $747 million,
of which $697 million and $50 million were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol
segment, respectively. This adjustment is further discussed in Note 3 of Condensed Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b)
In June 2016, the Government of Aruba (GOA) entered into definitive agreements with an
unrelated third party that provide for such third party to lease the Aruba Refinery and Aruba
Terminal from the GOA, restart and operate the Aruba Refinery, and operate the Aruba
Terminal. Because of this development, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will
ultimately transfer ownership of the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA and settle
our obligations under various agreements with the GOA. Therefore, we evaluated the Aruba
Terminal for potential impairment as of June 30, 2016 and concluded that it was impaired. We
further determined that the Aruba Terminal’s carrying value of $56 million was not recoverable
and we wrote off the entire amount, resulting in an impairment loss of $56 million relating to
our refining segment in the six months ended June 30, 2016. No income tax benefit was
recorded for this asset impairment loss as we do not expect to realize a tax benefit.
◦
(c)Defined terms are as follows:
Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net
income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the lower of cost or
market inventory valuation adjustment, its related income tax effect, and the asset impairment
loss.
Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution is defined as adjusted net income
attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted
average shares outstanding in the applicable period, assuming dilution.
Gross margin is defined as operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory
valuation adjustment, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and asset
impairment loss.
◦Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income excluding lower of cost or market
inventory valuation adjustment and asset impairment loss.
◦
◦
These terms are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures.
Management has defined these terms and believes that the presentation of the associated
measures are useful to external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts,
investors, lenders, and rating agencies, to assess our ongoing financial performance that, when
reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, provide improved comparability
between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not
indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results
and trends.
Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders, adjusted earnings
per common share – assuming dilution, gross margin, and adjusted operating income should not
be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation
stockholders, earnings per common share – assuming dilution, or operating income presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, because
adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders, adjusted earnings
per common share – assuming dilution, gross margin, and adjusted operating income may be
defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these terms may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

(f)
Throughput margin per barrel represents gross margin (as defined in (c) above) for our refining
segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput volumes. Gross margin per
gallon of production represents gross margin for our ethanol segment divided by production
volumes. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and
production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in
the applicable period.
(g)
Adjusted operating income per barrel represents adjusted operating income (defined in (c)
above) for our refining segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput
volumes. Adjusted operating income per gallon represents adjusted operating income
(defined in (c) above) for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. Throughput and
production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and production volumes per day
(as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period.
Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the
price of LLS and other types of crude oils, and price differentials between Mars crude oil and
other types of crude oils are reflected without adjusting for the impact of the futures pricing for
the corresponding delivery month. Therefore, the prices reported reflect the prompt month
(h)pricing only, without an adjustment for futures pricing (known in industry as the Calendar
Month Average (CMA) “roll” adjustment). We previously had provided average market
reference prices that included the CMA “roll” adjustment. Accordingly, the average market
reference price for LLS crude oil and price differentials for LLS and Mars crude oils for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.
General
Operating revenues decreased $11.2 billion (or 24 percent) and cost of sales decreased
$8.9 billion (or 23 percent) in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015
primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively.
Operating income decreased $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six
months of 2015, with refining segment operating income decreasing by $1.5 billion and ethanol
segment operating income decreasing by $12 million. Adjusted operating income decreased
$2.2 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, with refining
segment adjusted operating income decreasing $2.2 billion and ethanol segment adjusted
operating income decreasing $62 million. The reasons for these changes in the operating results
of our segments, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.
Refining
Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased $2.2 billion in the first six months of
2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 primarily due to a $2.1 billion decrease in refining
gross margin and a $77 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially
offset by a $66 million decrease in operating expenses.
Refining gross margin decreased $2.1 billion (a $4.63 per barrel decrease) in the first six months
of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, due primarily to the following:
•
Decrease in distillate margins - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all
of our regions for the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015. For
example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur
diesel was $8.70 per barrel for
63
Table of Contents
the first six months of 2016 compared to $14.58 per barrel for the first six months of 2015,
representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.88 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based
benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $11.38 per
barrel for the first six months of 2016 compared to $20.36 per barrel for the first six months of
2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $8.98 per barrel. We estimate that the decrease
in distillate margins per barrel in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of
2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.3 billion.
Decrease in gasoline margins - We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins throughout
most of our regions during the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015.
For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB
gasoline was $11.89 per barrel during the first six months of 2016 compared to $17.29 per barrel
•
during the first six months of 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.40 per barrel.
Another example is the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB 87 gasoline
that was $19.45 per barrel during the first six months of 2016 compared to $25.02 per barrel
during the first six months of 2015, representing an unfavorable decrease of $5.57 per barrel.
We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins per barrel during the first six months of 2016
compared to the first six months of 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of
approximately $460 million.
•
Lower discounts on light sweet crude oils - The market prices for refined products generally
track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we
process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, such as WTI and LLS crude
oils in periods when pricing terms are favorable. During the first six months of 2016, we
benefited from processing WTI; however, that benefit declined compared to the benefit from
processing WTI during the first six months of 2015. For example, WTI crude oil processed in our
U.S. Mid-Continent region sold at a discount of $1.68 per barrel to Brent crude oil in the first six
months of of 2016 compared to a discount of $6.12 per barrel in the first six months of of 2015,
representing an unfavorable decrease of $4.44 per barrel. LLS crude oil processed during the
first six months of 2016 priced at a premium to Brent crude oil of $0.17 per barrel compared to a
discount of $1.44 per barrel during the first six months of 2015 representing an unfavorable
decrease of $1.61 per barrel. We estimate that the cost to process light sweet crude oils during
the first six months of 2016 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately
$450 million.
•
Higher costs of biofuel credits - As more fully described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending
obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these
credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by $145 million from $189 million in the first six
months of 2015 to $334 million in the first six months of 2016. This increase was due to an
increase in the market price of RINs caused by an expected shortage in the market of available
RINs.
•
Higher throughput volumes - Refining throughput volumes increased by 94,000 barrels per day
during the first six months of 2016. We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes
had a favorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $140 million.
The decrease of $66 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $52 million decrease
in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices ($2.01 per MMBtu for the first six months of
2016 compared to $2.73 per MMBtu for the first six months of 2015).
64
Table of Contents
The increase of $77 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an
increase of $31 million in depreciation expense associated with new capital projects and
$28 million in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense resulting from the
completion of turnaround projects at several of our refineries.
Ethanol
Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased $62 million primarily due to a $78 million
(or $0.11 per gallon) decrease in gross margin and a $14 million increase in depreciation and
amortization expense, partially offset by a $30 million decrease in operating expenses.
The decrease in ethanol segment gross margin of $78 million was due primarily to the following:
Lower ethanol prices - Ethanol prices were lower in the first six months of 2016 primarily due to
the decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first
six months of 2015. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.55 per gallon in the
first six months of 2016 compared to $1.59 per gallon in the first six months of 2015. We estimate
that the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during the first six months of 2016 had an
unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $30 million.
Lower co-product prices - A decrease in export demand had an unfavorable effect on the prices
we received for corn-related co-products, primarily distillers grains. We estimate that the
decrease in distillers grain prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of
approximately $50 million.
•
•
The $30 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $20 million decrease in
energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.01 per MMBtu for the first six months of 2016
compared to $2.73 per MMBtu for the first six months of 2015).
The increase of $14 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due a
$10 million gain on sale of certain plant assets in the first six months of 2015 that was reflected in
depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense
in that period combined with an increase of $7 million in depreciation expense associated with
new capital projects.
Other
We evaluated the Aruba Terminal for potential impairment as of June 30, 2016 and concluded
that it was impaired, resulting in an asset impairment loss of $56 million related to our refining
segment. This matter is more fully described in Note 2 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Income tax expense decreased $550 million from the first six months of 2015 to the first six
months of 2016 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. The effective
tax rates of 27 percent in the first six months of 2016 and 31 percent in the first six months of 2015
are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international
operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in the
first six months of 2016 was lower than the rate in the first six months of 2015 primarily due to the
impact from the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve of $747 million
in the first six months of 2016. The majority of that amount impacted our international operations,
which increased the amount of income before income tax expense generated by our operations
with lower statutory tax rates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016
Our operations generated $3.0 billion of cash in the first six months of 2016, driven primarily by
net income of $1.4 billion and excluding $460 million of noncash charges to income, along with a
positive change in working capital of $1.1 billion. Noncash charges include $956 million of
depreciation and amortization expense, $56 million for the asset impairment loss associated with
our Aruba Terminal, and $195 million of deferred income tax expense, partially offset by a benefit
of $747 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. See “RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is
further detailed in Note 11 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This
source of cash mainly resulted from:
an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in receivables, primarily as a
result of increasing commodity prices; and
•the partial liquidation of our inventories.
•
•
The $3.0 billion of cash generated by our operations, along with debt borrowings of $197 million
(primarily $139 million under the VLP Revolver, as discussed in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to:
fund $940 million in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred
turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments;
pay off a long-term liability of $137 million owed to a joint venture partner for an owner-method
joint venture investment;
•purchase common stock for treasury of $665 million;
•pay common stock dividends of $564 million;
•pay distributions of $47 million to noncontrolling interests; and
•increase available cash on hand by $811 million.
•
Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Our operations generated $3.8 billion of cash in the first six months of 2015, driven primarily by
net income of $2.3 billion and excluding $784 million of noncash charges to income. Noncash
charges include $866 million of depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a
deferred income tax benefit of $82 million. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further
discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital in the first six months of 2015
had a positive impact to cash generated by our operations of $615 million. This source of cash
mainly resulted from an increase in accounts payable as a result of increased crude purchase
activity during June 2015 compared to December 2014.
The $3.8 billion of cash generated by our operations in the first six months of 2015, along with
$1.45 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt ($600 million of 3.65 percent senior notes due
March 15, 2025, $650 million of 4.9 percent senior notes due March 15, 2045, and borrowings
•
under the VLP Revolver of $200 million as discussed in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to:
fund $1.2 billion in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround
and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments;
make note repayments of $400 million related to our 4.5 percent senior notes, $75 million
related to our 8.75 percent debentures, and $2 million related to other non-bank debt;
•purchase common stock for treasury of $992 million;
•pay common stock dividends of $409 million; and
•increase available cash on hand by $2.1 billion.

Table of Contents
Capital Investments
For 2016, we expect to incur approximately $2.6 billion for capital investments, including capital
expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture
investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business capital and
$1.0 billion for growth strategies, including our continued investment in Diamond Pipeline
LLC (Diamond Pipeline) described below. This capital investment estimate excludes potential
strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as
conditions warrant.
We hold equity-method investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or
enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations. In December 2015, we
exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in Diamond Pipeline, which was formed
by Plains Pipeline, L.P. (Plains) to construct and operate a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline
expected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 barrels per day of domestic sweet crude oil from
the Plains Cushing, Oklahoma terminal to our Memphis Refinery, with the ability to connect into
the Capline Pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated
$925 million, pending receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. We contributed $136 million
upon exercise of our option and expect to invest an additional $170 million in 2016.
Contractual Obligations
As of June 30, 2016, our contractual obligations included debt, capital lease obligations,
operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. There were no material
changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to these contractual obligations
during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Currently, we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and
financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis up to $1.3 billion. As of
June 30, 2016, the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to
$1.2 billion primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade receivables as a result of the current
market price environment for the finished products that we produce.
Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically
require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior
unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit
facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of the ratings on our senior unsecured debt
are at or above investment grade level as follows:
 Rating
Rating Agency
Moody’s Investors Service
 Baa2 (stable outlook)
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)
 BBB (stable outlook)
Fitch Ratings
We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time
or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.
We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and
may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of
one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain
short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.

Pension Plan Funding
We plan to contribute approximately $36 million to our pension plans and $20 million to our other
postretirement benefit plans during 2016. We contributed $14 million to our pension plans and
$8 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities
relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution
prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and
distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and
stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or
proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in
the future as previously discussed above in “OUTLOOK.” In addition, any major upgrades in any
of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with
environmental laws and regulations. See Note 5 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.
Tax Matters
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns
from 2008 through 2011, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection
with these audits. We are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs
and continue to make progress in
68
Table of Contents
resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. We expect to settle our audit for tax years 2008
and 2009 within the next 12 months. In addition, our net uncertain tax position liabilities,
including related penalties and interest, did not change significantly during the six months ended
June 30, 2016. Should we ultimately settle these audits for amounts consistent with our
estimates, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such
payments.
Cash Held by Our International Subsidiaries
We operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries,
and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated.
We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we
are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should
we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated.
In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could
significantly impact our results of operations. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of
our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through
means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of June 30, 2016, $2.0 billion of our cash and
temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.
Concentration of Customers
Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are
refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our
overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be
similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our
portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize
potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our
accounts receivable.
Sources of Liquidity
We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from
borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect
that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or
debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit
facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings
or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made
available on terms that are acceptable to us.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of June 30, 2016, there
were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies since the date our annual report on
Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was filed.

Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products
(primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our
operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows,
we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the
volatility of:
inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our
current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our
•
previous year-end LIFO inventory levels, and
forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas
purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing
market prices that we deem favorable.
•
We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in
transacting our price risk activities. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We
also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of
existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.
Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis
by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has
been approved by our board of directors.
The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with
which we have market risk (in millions):

COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISK
We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and GHG
emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To
manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed
favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal
purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of June 30, 2016,
there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that
would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See
Note 13 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these
compliance programs.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.Legal Proceedings
The information below describes new proceedings or material developments in proceedings that
we previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Litigation
We hereby incorporate by reference into this Item our disclosures made in Part I, Item 1 of this
report included in Note 5 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the
caption “Litigation Matters.”
Environmental Enforcement Matters
While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any
one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect
on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. We are reporting these proceedings to
comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings
arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will
result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Ardmore Refinery). In May 2016, we received a
penalty demand in the amount of $730,820 from the EPA for alleged reporting violations at our
Ardmore Refinery. We are currently working with the EPA to resolve the matter.
EPA (Benicia Refinery). In May 2016, we received settlement communications from the EPA
regarding various alleged reporting and storage violations at our Benicia Refinery, which we
reasonably believe will result in penalties in excess of $100,000. We are currently working with
the EPA to resolve the matter.
Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) (Benicia Refinery). We currently have
multiple outstanding Violation Notices (VNs) issued by the BAAQMD from 2011 to the present.
These VNs are for alleged reporting violations and excess emissions at our Benicia Refinery and
asphalt plant. In the second quarter of 2016, we entered into an Agreement with BAAQMD to
resolve various VNs and continue to work with the BAAQMD to resolve the remaining VNs.
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) (Wilmington Refinery). We currently
have multiple Notices of Violations (NOVs) issued by the SCAQMD from 2013 to present. These
NOVs are for alleged reporting violations and excess emissions at our Wilmington Refinery. In
the second quarter of 2016, we entered into an Agreement with SCAQMD to resolve various
NOVs and continue to work with the SCAQMD to resolve the remaining NOVs.
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) (McKee Refinery). In May 2016, we
received a proposed Agreed Order in the amount of $121,314 from the TCEQ as an
administrative penalty for alleged excess emissions at our McKee Refinery. We are working with
the TCEQ to resolve the matter.
TCEQ (Port Arthur Refinery). In our quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we
reported that we received a Notice of Enforcement (NOE) from the TCEQ for excess emissions at
our Port Arthur Refinery. We have resolved this NOE with the TCEQ.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
We disclose the following risk factor in addition to the risk factors we have disclosed in our
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Renewable Fuel Standard
(RFS) could adversely affect our performance.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented a Renewable Fuel Standard
(RFS) pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act
of 2007. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as
ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the United States. A
Renewable Identification Number (RIN) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in
or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are
obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least
commensurate to the EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the
open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program.
We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of
RINs. RINs prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations, the
availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, and levels of
transportation fuels produced, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If
sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for
RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA’s RFS mandates, our results of operations
and cash flows could be adversely affected.
