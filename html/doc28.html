Summary of Facts
1. The communication is submitted by the Anuak Justice Council, through Obang Metho the Director for
International Advocacy, Anuak Justice Council which was prepared by the International Human Rights
Clinic, Washington College of Law, in Washington D.C., the United States of America against the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Respondent State, a party to the African Charter since 1998.
2. The Complainant avers that the Respondent through its agents, the Ethiopian Defence Forces has been
engaged in massive discrimination resulting in serious human rights abuses and violations of the people of
Anuak ethnicity. They claim that the abuses by the Ethiopian Defence Forces include the massacre of over
four hundred and twenty-four (424) civilians, the wounding of over two hundred (200) civilians and the
disappearance of over eighty-five (85) civilians in the Gambella region in the three day period of 13th to 15th
December 2003. The Complainant states that the abuses have continued against the Anuak since that
period including extrajudicial killing, torture, detention, rape and property destruction throughout the
Gambella region resulting in one thousand (1000) Anuak deaths and that, over fifty-one thousand (51,000)
Anuak have been displaced within the Gambella region.
3. The Complainant adds, that the Republic of Ethiopia has violated its legal obligations to uphold the rights
and principles of all Ethiopian citizens, and has violated its obligation to uphold the rights and protections
enshrined in the African Charter under Articles 4, 5, 6, 12, 14 and 18.
4. The Anuak Justice Council requests the African Commission to grant provisional measures Rule 11 and
declare them binding on the Ethiopian government.
5. The Complainant states that the Anuak are an indigenous minority group living in south-western
Gambella region of Ethiopia and that despite their dominance in the region, the Ethiopian government has
a long history of marginalising, excluding and discriminating against them. The Complainant claims that due
to Gambella's natural resources, the Ethiopian government has resettled over sixty thousand (60,000)
highlanders, who had almost completely destroyed the Anuak way of life within Gambella.
6. The Complainant avers that the Anuak believe that oil in the region should belong to them, while the
Federal Government argues that under the Federal Constitution all mineral resources belong to the
Ethiopian State. The complainant adds that the Ethiopian Defence Forces are stationed throughout the
Gambella in order to identify and destroy disparate groups of armed Anuak known collectively as shifta that
have attacked highlander civilians.
7. The Complainant submits that the December 2003 massacre was sparked by the killing of eight (8)
highlander refugee camp officials and propelled the Ethiopian Defence Forces into a broad-based assault
on Gambella's Anuak community. The Complainant states that despite the fact that nobody was
immediately found responsible for the death of the eight people, there is no indication that the Ethiopian
government had undertaken an official investigation into the ambush of the refugee camp officials thus
blaming the Anuak community for the attacks.
8. The Complainant avers that the violence in the Gambella region has continued since December 2003
and remains a serious threat to Anuak citizens as well as other ethnic groups in the region. The
Complainant allege that the Ethiopian Defence Forces search for shifta has become the pretext for bloody
and destructive raids on numerous Anuak villages since the December 2003 massacre on the Gambella
town. The Complainant further allege[s] that unarmed Anuak within Gambella are currently being killed by
Ethiopian Defence Forces without due process or the use of judicial proceedings without even making an
effort to distinguish Anuak civilians from the shifta they claim to be looking for.
9. The Complainant further allege[s] that many Anuak have been detained in prison without charge both in
Gambella and Addis Ababa which accounts to about one thousand (1000) detained to this day. The
Complainant also adds that a substantial group of Gambella's educated Anuak have been imprisoned or
forced into exile and that many have been charged with offences relating to alleged collaboration with
Anuak insurgents and put on trial but none of the leaders are yet to be convicted.
10. The Complainant further alleged that in rural areas the Ethiopian military continues to burn homes,
destroy crops, burn food stores, disrupt planting cycles, and destroy agricultural equipment of the Anuak to
prevent them from sustaining themselves. The Complainant asserts that as recently as January 2005 the
Ethiopian government threatened Anuak elders in Gambella that anyone attempting to tarnish the
reputation of the Ethiopian government over the massacres would be dealt with.
1

11. The Complainant claims that the Ethiopian government's response to the December massacre has
been grossly inadequate and disingenuous. The Complainant states that the government's initial position
that no soldiers had taken part in the massacre had become impossible to defend and adds that the
Commission of Inquiry set up by the Government was biased and ineffectual and did not investigate the
behaviour of the Ethiopian Defence Forces as an organisation despite numerous reports.

Complaint
12. The Complainant states that crimes against humanity, such as extrajudicial killing, torture, and rape,
crimes that take place against the Anuak civilians is in violation of international law as well as a violation of
Articles 4, 5, 6, 12,14 and 18 of the African Charter. The Anuak Justice Council urges the African
Commission to intervene to prevent further human rights abuses of the Anuak by the Ethiopian
government.
13. The Comp[lainant] further makes an urgent request for provisional measures under Rule 111 of the
Rules of Procedure of the African Charter [sic] that the African Commission may intervene to "avoid
irreparable damage being caused to the victim of the alleged violation".
Request for provisional measures - summary

14. The Complainant, requests for provisional measures to the African Commission pursuant to Rule 111 of
the Rules of Procedures of the Commission. The complaint relates to the alleged actions of the Defence
Forces of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. These actions according to the Complainant reveal
a pattern of serious and massive human and peoples' rights violations by the Ethiopian Defence Forces.
That, bound by the African Charter, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, has and continues to
violate Articles 4, 5, 6, 12, 14 and 18 of the African Charter.
15. The Anuak Justice Council therefore seeks the [African] Commission's intervention and issuance of
Provisional Measures requesting that the Ethiopian government stops the human rights abuses of the
Anuak pending a decision of the African Commission on the concurrent communication and is also seeking
an in-depth study of the treatment of the Anuak by the African Commission pursuant to Article 58 of the
Charter.
16. The Anuak Justice Council notes that it does not request the [African] Commission to evaluate the
merits of this case rather, in this provisional measures submission, the Anuak Justice Council merely asks
that the [African] Commission request that the Ethiopian government immediately stops the series of
serious and massive violations of human and peoples' rights of the Anuak people prior to the issuance of a
decision by the African Commission on the merits.
17. That the [African] Commission has jurisdiction to issue provisional measures under Rule 111 of the
Rules of Procedure of the African Charter [sic], see Registered Trustees of the Constitutional Rights Project
v. the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Five Others[sic]. Similar to the Nigeria case, many
Anuak have also been, and continue to be, sentenced to death. The [African] Commission should therefore
find the Anuak situation as even more sever[e] and compelling than the Nigeria case and grant provisional
measures.
18. The Complainant notes further that while the African Commission has not decided whether grants of
provisional measures should be binding on State Parties, other international and regional human rights
bodies have declared that provisional measures be binding on States including the European Court of
Human Rights, Inter-American Commission, the International Court of Justice and the UN Human Rights
Committee. Due to the severity of the situation that the Anuak find themselves subject to in the Gambella,
in prisons throughout Ethiopia and as refugees in Sudan and Kenya, petitioners plead that the African
Commission grant provisional measures and declare them binding on the Ethiopian government.
19. The Complainant seeks the [African] Commission's intervention and issuance of provisional measures
requesting that the Ethiopian government stop human rights abuses of the Anuak, pending the decision of
this Commission on the Anuak Justice Council's concurrent communication to the African Commission on
the merits of this claim and further urges the Commission to find that its order of provisional measures in
this case be binding upon the Ethiopian government.

32. By Note Verbale of 29th May 2006 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the
African Commission's decision.
Complainant's submission on admissibility

33. The Complainant submits that Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that complainants exhaust
domestic remedies before a case is considered by the African Commission. The Complainant notes further
that if the potential domestic remedies are unavailable or unduly prolonged, the Commission may
nevertheless consider a communication, adding that this is especially true when the country against which
the complaint is lodged has committed vast and varied scope of violations and the general situation in the
country is such that domestic exhaustion would be futile.
34. The Complainant argue that in the Anuak Justice Council case, pursuing domestic remedies would be
futile due to the lack of an independent and impartial judiciary, a lack of an efficient remedy, the significant
likelihood of an unduly prolonged domestic remedy, and most importantly, the potential for violence against
the Anuak or those supporting them within the legal system.
35. Anuak Justice Council alleges that it cannot seek exhaustion of domestic remedies because of its
inability to receive an independent and fair hearing, as a direct consequence of the fact that the aggressor
is the government of Ethiopia. The Complainant notes that in spite the protection in Article 78
×
1. An independent judiciary is established by this Constitution.
2. Supreme Federal judicial authority is vested in the Federal Supreme Court. The House of Peoples'
Representatives may, by two-thirds majority vote, establish nationwide, or in some parts of the country
only, the Federal High Court and First-Instance Courts it deems necessary. Unless decided in this manner,
3

the jurisdictions of the Federal High Court and of the First-Instance Courts are hereby delegated to the
State courts.
3. States shall establish State Supreme, High and First-Instance Courts. Particulars shall be determined by
law.
4. Special or ad hoc courts which take judicial powers away form the regular courts or institutions legally
empowered to exercise judicial functions and which do not follow legally prescribed procedures shall not be
established.
5. Pursuant to sub-Article 5 of Article 34 the House of Peoples' Representatives and State Councils can
establish or give official recognition to religious and customary courts. Religious and customary courts that
had state recognition and functioned prior to the adoption of the Constitution shall be organised on the
basis of recognition accorded to them by this Constitution.
of the Respondent State's Constitution guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, it is perceived by
individuals both at home and abroad that the executive has considerable and even undue influence on the
judiciary.
36. The Complainant quoted a World Bank Report entitled Ethiopia: Legal and Judicial Sector Assessment
(2004) which concluded that "... of the three branches of government, the judiciary has the least history and
experience of independence and therefore requires significant strengthening to obtain true independence".
According to the Complainant, the Report notes that the interference in the judiciary is more flagrant at
State level where there are reports of administrative officers interfering with court decisions, firing judges,
dictating decisions to judges, reducing salaries of judges and deliberately refusing to enforce certain
decisions of the courts.
37. The Complainant also alleges that bringing the case before Ethiopian courts would unduly prolong the
process as the Ethiopian judiciary suffers from a complex system of multiple courts that lack coordination
and resources, including "dismal conditions of service, staff shortages, lack of adequate training,
debilitating infrastructure and logistical problems". The Complainant claims court proceedings take years to
yield results, and concluded that the Respondent State's judicial system is so under resourced that
prosecutions would be nearly impossible, noting that to date, no action had been taken to prosecute any of
the Ethiopian Defence Forces or government officials for the atrocities they committed against the Anuak.
38. The Complainant also alleges that the Anuak fear for their safety in bringing the case in Ethiopia adding
that there are no Anuak trained as lawyers who could bring the case before Ethiopian courts. The
Complainant notes that the overwhelming sentiment in the Gambella Region and of the Anuak who have
fled the country is that non-Anuak lawyers within Ethiopia would be unwilling to take the case due to the
potential persecution they would face, as well as the insurmountable odds of achieving a just remedy. The
Complainant added that Anuak who remain in the Gambella Region continue to suffer from extra-judicial
executions, torture, rape and arbitrary detention from the authorities of the Respondent State adding that
several of them have been threatened and warned specifically against pursuing a case against the
Respondent State. The Complainant noted that as recently as January 2005, the Respondent State
threatened Anuak leaders, declaring that anyone attempting to tarnish the reputation of the Respondent
State would be dealt with. The Complainant concluded by stating that to bring the case within the
Respondent State would only further endanger the lives of the remaining Anuak in the Ethiopia.
39. The Complainant added that the Respondent State had been given notice and adequate time to
remedy the human rights violations against the Anuak but has utterly failed to do so. That the Respondent
State received notice of the violations but chose not to take action to halt the atrocities or to make its forces
accountable. The Complainant added that the Respondent State's response to the massacres in December
2003 in the Gambella Region was inadequate and disingenuous. That under international pressure, the
Respondent State established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the killings, however, according to the
Complainant, the inquiry was biased and ineffectual and did not meet international standards of an
independent investigation.

4

Respondent State's submissions on admissibility

40. The Respondent State claims that the cases of those involved in the alleged violations that took place
in the Gambella Region are currently pending before the Federal Circuiting Court and the Respondent,
therefore, argued that domestic remedies have not yet been exhausted. The State provided a list of about
nine such cases including their file numbers and previous and future dates of adjournments.
41. The Respondent State argues that the rule that local remedies be exhausted is not limited to individuals
and also applies to organisations, including those in no way subject to the jurisdiction of the Respondent
State. According to the Respondent, the Complainant could have sought redress from the domestic courts,
the Judicial Administration Office, the Commission of Inquiry or the Human Rights Commission but did not.
The Complainant has not, argued the State, shown the existence of any impediment to the use of these
remedial processes or that such were unduly long.
42. Without indicating the status of the proceedings, the State argued that all those alleged of human rights
offences associated with the Gambella incident of December 2003 were brought before the Federal Circuit
Court. The State indicated that three domestic remedies were available to the Complainants: the competent
courts, the Judicial Administration Officer and the Human Rights Commission but the Complainants failed
to approach any of them.
Provisional measures
43. The Republic of Ethiopia argues that the Complainant has sought only to present what it claims is prima
facie evidence of violations and has not shown that if such alleged violations continue there will be
'irreparable injury', as required. Finally, the Respondent submits that the Government has presented
sufficient evidence that it has taken adequate measures to rectify the situation and that the situation in
general has stabilised and does not warrant any provisional measures from the African Commission. The
Respondent State submits as follows:
• In February 2004, the Office of the Prime Minister issued instructions to Federal institutions to assist
the Regional Administration in safeguarding the security of the people and institutions and
preventing further violence; soliciting the support of elders, the youth and civil servants in the effort
towards sustainable peace, democracy and development; rehabilitating victims of the violence and
internally displaced people; and bringing to justice those responsible for committing the violence
and the destruction of property.
• The Defence Forces, once deployed, protected the civilian population and allowed humanitarian
assistance and rehabilitation.
• The Federal Government, in cooperation with international agencies, coordinated humanitarian
assistance to alleviate the suffering of the victims of violence and the displaced.
• A Commission of Inquiry has been established to investigate the circumstances surrounding the
crisis; charges have been filed against several individuals as a result.
• The Government has organised various consultations and workshops with the participation of the
local population which have proposed concrete solutions aimed at resolving the problems facing the
region and have identified the root causes of the crisis.
• The Federal Police have recently graduated more than three hundred police officers from the
Gambella region to aid in maintaining law and order in the region once the situation has stabilised.

Law
Admissibility
44. The current communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter which allows the
African Commission to receive and consider communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of
the African Charter provides that the admissibility of a communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is
subject to seven (7) conditions. The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in
Article 56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is absent, the communication will be declared
5

inadmissible.
45. The Complainant in the present communication argued that it has satisfied the admissibility conditions
set out in Article 56 of the African Charter and as such, the communication should be declared admissible.
The Respondent State on the other hand submitted that the communication should be declared
inadmissible because, according to the State, the Complainant has not complied with Article 56(5) of the
African Charter. As there seems to be agreement by both parties as to the fulfillment of the other
requirements under Article 56, this Commission will not make any pronouncements thereof.
46. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that communications relating to human and peoples' rights
shall be considered if they: "[a]re sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this
procedure is unduly prolonged".
47. Human rights law regards it as supremely important for a person whose rights have been violated to
make use of domestic remedies to right the wrong, rather than address the issue to an international
tribunal. The rule is founded on the premise that the full and effective implementation of international
obligations in the field of human rights is designed to enhance the enjoyment of human rights and
fundamental freedoms at the national level. In Free Legal Assistance Group, Lawyers' Committee for
Human Rights, Union Interafricaine des Droits de l'Homme, Les Témoins de Jehovah / DRC, Paragraph 36
and Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme (RADDHO) / Zambia, Paragraph 11, this
Commission held that "a government should have notice of a human rights violation in order to have the
opportunity to remedy such violations before being called before an international body." 1 Such an
opportunity will enable the accused state to save its reputation, which would be inevitably tarnished if it
were brought before an international jurisdiction.
48. The rule also reinforces the subsidiary and complementary relationship of the international system to
systems of internal protection. To the extent possible, an international tribunal, including this Commission,
should be prevented from playing the role of a court of first instance, a role that it cannot under any
circumstances arrogate to itself. Access to an international organ should be available, but only as a last
resort; after the domestic remedies have been exhausted and have failed. Moreover, local remedies are
normally quicker, cheaper, and more effective than international ones. They can be more effective in the
sense that an appellate court can reverse the decision of a lower court, whereas the decision of an
international organ does not have that effect, although it will engage the international responsibility of the
state concerned.
49. The African Charter states that this African Commission shall consider a communication after the
applicant has exhausted local remedies, "if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly
prolonged". The Charter thus recognises that, though the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is a
conventional provision, it should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access to international
remedies. This Commission has also held that Article 56(5) "must be applied concomitantly with Article 7,
which establishes and protects the right to fair trial". th 2 In interpreting the rule, the African Commission
appears to take into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which
the formal remedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant. Its interpretation of the local
remedies criteri[ion] can therefore not be understood without some knowledge of that general context.
50. A local remedy has been defined as "any domestic legal action that may lead to the resolution of the
complaint at the local or national level." 3 The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that
"[t]he Commission shall determine questions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter" 4
Generally, the rules require applicants to set out in their applications the steps taken to exhaust domestic
remedies. They must provide some prima facie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies.5
According to the African Commission's guidelines on the submission of communications, applicants are
expected to indicate, for instance, the courts where they sought domestic remedies. Applicants must
indicate that they have had recourse to all domestic remedies to no avail and must supply evidence to that
effect. If they were unable to use such remedies, they must explain why. They could do so by submitting
evidence derived from analogous situations or testifying to a state policy of denying such recourse.
51. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, three major criteria could be deduced in determining the rule
on the exhaustion of local remedies, namely: that the remedy must be available, effective and sufficient. 6
According to this Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner can pursue it without
impediments 7 or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.8 The word 'available' means
'readily obtainable; accessible'; or 'attainable, reachable; on call, on hand, ready, present; . . . convenient,
at one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck and call'.9 In other words, "remedies,
the availability of which is not evident, cannot be invoked by the State to the detriment of the Complainant."
6

10

52. A remedy will be deemed to be effective if it offers a prospect of success. 11 If its success is not
sufficiently certain, it will not meet the requirements of availability and effectiveness. The word 'effective'
has been defined to mean "adequate to accomplish a purpose; producing the intended or expected result,"
or "functioning, useful, serviceable, operative, in order; practical, current, actual, real, valid".12 Lastly, a
remedy will be found to be sufficient if it is capable of redressing the complaint.13 It will be deemed
insufficient if, for example, the applicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of a generalised
fear for his life "or even those of his relatives."14 This Commission has also declared a remedy to be
insufficient because its pursuit depended on extrajudicial considerations, such as discretion or some
extraordinary power vested in an executive state official. The word 'sufficient' literally means "adequate for
the purpose; enough"; or "ample, abundant; . . . satisfactory."15
53. In the present communication, the author of the communication is based in Canada, alleging human
rights violations in the Respondent State following an incident that occurred in the country. The
Complainant does not hide the fact that local remedies were not attempted but argued that pursuing
domestic remedies in the Respondent State would be futile "due to the lack of an independent and impartial
judiciary, a lack of an efficient remedy, the significant likelihood of an unduly prolonged domestic remedy,
and most importantly, the potential for violence against the Anuak or those supporting them within the legal
system". The Complainant argued that the violations that took place in Gambella were massive and serious
and involved many people; it noted that "the government forces and its collaborators, having previously
drawn a list of targets, went from door to door, slaughtering any educated Anuak men they could find,
women and children were raped, and homes and schools were burnt to the ground...".
54. The Complainant noted further that the judiciary in the Respondent State is not independent due to
interference at State level where there are reports of administrative officers interfering with court decisions,
firing of judges, dictating decisions to judges, reducing salaries of judges and deliberately refusing to
enforce certain decisions of the courts; and that bringing the case before Ethiopian courts would be unduly
prolonging the process as the Ethiopian judiciary suffers from "a complex system of multiple courts that lack
coordination and resources", including "dismal conditions of service, staff shortages, lack of adequate
training, debilitating infrastructure and logistical problems". The Complainant claims court proceedings
"take years to yield results", and concluded that the Respondent State's judicial system is "so under
resourced that prosecutions would be nearly impossible".
55. The Complainant also alleges that the Anuak fear for their safety in bringing the case in Ethiopia adding
that there are no Anuak trained as lawyers who could bring the case before Ethiopian courts. The
Complainant concluded by stating that to bring the case within the Respondent State would only further
endanger the lives of the remaining Anuak in the Ethiopia. The Complainant added that the Respondent
State had been given notice and adequate time to remedy the human rights violations against the Anuak
but has utterly failed to do so.
56. Can this Commission conclude, based on the above allegations by the complainant that local remedies
in the Respondent State are not available, ineffective or insufficient?
57. It must be observed here that the Complainant's submissions seem to suggest that local remedies may
in fact be available but it is apprehensive about their effectiveness as far as the present case is concerned.
From the Complainant's submissions, it is clear that the Complainant has relied on reports, including a
World Bank report which concluded that "of the three branches of government, the judiciary has the least
history and experience of independence and therefore requires significant strengthening to obtain true
independence".
58. The Complainant's submissions also demonstrate that it is apprehensive about the success of local
remedies either because of fear for the safety of lawyers, the lack of independence of the judiciary or the
meagre resources available to the judiciary. Apart from casting aspersions on the effectiveness of local
remedies, the Complainant has not provided concrete evidence or demonstrated sufficiently that these
apprehensions are founded and may constituted [sic] a barrier to it attempting local remedies. In the view of
this Commission, the Complainant is simply casting doubts about the effectiveness of the domestic
remedies. This Commission is of the view that it is incumbent on every complainant to take all necessary
steps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of, local remedies. It is not enough for the complainant
to cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated or past incidences. In
this regard, the African Commission would like to refer to the decision of the [UN] Human Rights Committee
in A v. Australia16 in which the Committee held that "mere doubts about the effectiveness of local remedies
... did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies".17 The African Commission can therefore not
7

declare the communication admissible based on this argument. If a remedy has the slightest likelihood to
be effective, the applicant must pursue it. Arguing that local remedies are not likely to be successful,
without trying to avail oneself of them, will simply not sway this Commission.
59. The Complainant also argue[s] that the violations alleged are serious and involve a large number of
people and should be declare admissible as the African Commission cannot hold the requirements of local
remedies to apply literally in cases where it is impracticable or undesirable for the Complainant to seize the
domestic courts in the case of each violation. In the 54.91-61.91-98.93-164.97_196.97-210.98 case18 , for
example, this Commission observed that [t]he gravity of the human rights situation in Mauritania and the
great number of victims involved render[ed] the channels of remedy unavailable in practical terms, and,
according to the terms of the Charter, their process [was] 'unduly prolonged'. In like manner, the Amnesty
International, Comité Loosli Bachelard, Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, Association of Members of
the Episcopal Conference of East Africa / Sudan, Paragraph 32 case 19 involved the arbitrary arrest,
detention and torture of many Sudanese citizens after the coup of 30th July 1989. The alleged acts of
torture included forcing detainees into cells measuring 1.8 metres wide and 1 metre deep, deliberately
flooding the cells, frequently banging on the doors to prevent detainees from lying down, forcing them to
face mock executions, and prohibiting them from bathing or washing. Other acts of torture included burning
detainees with cigarettes, binding them with ropes to cut off circulation, and beating them with sticks until
their bodies were severely lacerated and then treating the resulting wounds with acid. After the coup, the
Sudanese government promulgated a decree that suspended the jurisdiction of the regular courts in favour
of special tribunals with respect to any action taken in applying the decree. It also outlawed the taking of
any legal action against the decree. These measures, plus the "seriousness of the human rights situation in
Sudan and the great numbers of people involved," the Commission concluded, "render[ed] such remedies
unavailable in fact." 20
60. Thus, in cases of massive violations, the state will be presumed to have notice of the violations within
its territory and the State is expected to act accordingly to deal with whatever human rights violations. The
pervasiveness of these violations dispenses with the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies,
especially where the state took no steps to prevent or stop them. 21
61. The above cases must however be distinguished from the present case which involves one single
incident that took place for a short period of time. The Respondent State has indicated the measures it took
to deal with the situation and the legal proceedings being undertaken by those alleged to have committed
human rights violations during the incident. By establishing the Gambella Commission of Inquiry and
indicting alleged human rights perpetrators, the state, albeit under international pressure, demonstrated
that it was not indifferent to the alleged human rights violations that took place in the area and in the view of
this Commission could be said to have exercised due diligence.
62. This Commission has also held in many instances that domestic remedies have not been exhausted if a
case that includes the subject matter of the petition before it is still pending before the national courts. In
45.90, 22 the African Commission declined to consider a communication with respect to which a claim had
been filed but not yet settled by the courts of the Respondent State. In the present communication, the
Respondent State indicates that the matter is still pending before its courts and attached a list of cases still
pending before the Federal Circuit Court in relation with the Gambella incident. The list provided the names
of the suspects, file number of their cases, previous and future dates of adjournments. The Complainant
does not deny this process is going on. In the view of this Commission, it does not matter whether the
cases still pending before the courts have been brought by the Complainant or the state. The underlying
question is whether the case is a subject matter of the proceedings before the African Commission and
whether it is aimed at granting the same relief the Complainant is seeking before this Commission. As long
as a case still pending before a domestic court is a subject matter of the petition before this Commission,
and as long as this Commission believes the relief sought can be obtained locally, it will decline to entertain
the case. It is the view of this Commission that the present communication23 is still pending before the
courts of the Respondent State and therefore does not meet the requirements under Article 56(5).

Holding

For the above reasons, the African Commission declares communication 299/05 Anuak Justice
8

Council/Ethiopia inadmissible for non-exhaustion of local remedies in conformity with Article 56(5)
of the African Charter.
