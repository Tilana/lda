<U>Sale of Placement Shares by the Agents</U>. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, upon the Company&#146;s issuance of a Placement
Notice,
and unless the sale of the Placement Shares described therein has been declined,
suspended, or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the applicable Agent will severally and not jointly use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales
practices to sell on behalf of the Company and as agent, such Placement Shares
up to the amount specified during the time period specified, and otherwise in
accordance with the terms of such Placement Notice. The Agents covenant and the
Company acknowledges that the Agents will conduct the sale of Placement Shares
in compliance with applicable law, rules and regulations including, without
limitation, all applicable United States state and federal securities laws,
including, the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
&#147;<B>Securities Act</B>&#148;), the United States Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as
amended (the &#147;<B>Exchange Act</B>&#148;), all applicable Canadian 
Securities Laws (as
defined below), and, if applicable, the rules of the NYSE MKT LLC (the 
&#147;<B>NYSE
MKT</B>&#148;) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (the &#147;<B>TSX</B>&#148;), and 
that such
compliance may include a delay in commencement of sales efforts after receipt of
a Placement Notice. The applicable Agent will severally and not jointly provide
written confirmation to the Company (with a copy to the other Agent) no later
than the opening of the Trading Day (as defined below) immediately following the
Trading Day on which it has made sales of Placement Shares hereunder setting
forth the number of Placement Shares sold on such day (showing the number of
Placement Shares sold on the TSX, on any other &#147;marketplace&#148; (as such 
term is
defined in National Instrument 21-101 <I>Market Operations</I> (&#147;<B>NI
21-101</B>&#148;)) in Canada (a &#147;<B>Canadian Marketplace</B>&#148;), on the

United
States (a &#147;<B>United States Marketplace</B>&#148;) and pursuant to any 
other sales
method used by the Agents), the average price of the Placement Shares sold
(showing the average price of the Placement Shares sold on the TSX, a Canadian
Marketplace, the NYSE MKT, a United States Marketplace and pursuant to any other
sales method used by the Agents), the compensation payable by the Company to the
Agents with respect to such sales, and the Net Proceeds (as defined below)
payable to the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Placement
Notice, the Agents may sell Placement Shares by any method permitted by law
deemed to be an &#147;at the market distribution&#148; under NI 44-102, 
including, without
limitation, sales made directly on the NYSE MKT and the TSX, or on any Canadian
Marketplace or United States Marketplace. The Agents severally and not jointly 
acknowledge and agree
that the aggregate number of Placement Shares sold on the TSX and all other
Canadian Marketplaces on any Trading Day shall not exceed 25% of the total
trading volume of the Shares on the TSX and all other Canadian Marketplaces on
that Trading Day, and covenant not to exceed that threshold. If expressly
authorized by the Company in a Placement Notice, the Agents may sell Placement
Shares in privately negotiated transactions in the United States, subject to any
required pre-clearance of any such transactions by the NYSE MKT and the TSX.
During the term of this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Agents severally and not jointly agree that in no event will they or
any of their affiliates engage in any market making, bidding, stabilization or
other trading activity with regard to the Shares if such activity would be
prohibited under Regulation M or other anti-manipulation rules under the
Securities Act, Exchange Act or Canadian Securities Laws. Notwithstanding
sections 7(rr) and 8(cc) of this Agreement, the Agents shall not purchase
Placement Shares for their own account as principal unless expressly authorized
to do so in a Placement Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement or a Placement Notice, the Company acknowledges and
agrees that (i) there can be no assurance that the Agents will be successful in
selling any Placement Shares or as to the price at which any Placement Shares
are sold, if at all, and (ii) the Agents will incur no liability or obligation
to the Company or any other person or entity if they do not sell Placement
Shares for any reason other than a failure by the Agents to use their
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales
practices to sell on behalf of the Company and as agent such Placement Shares as
provided
under this Section 3. For the purposes hereof, &#147;<b>Trading Day</b>&#148;

all material respects with Canadian Securities Laws. The Canadian Prospectus, as
amended or supplemented, as of its date, did not and, as of each Applicable Time
and Settlement Date, if any, will not contain a misrepresentation, as defined
under Canadian Securities Laws, or include any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Canadian Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of its date,
did and, as of each Applicable Time and Settlement Date, if any, will contain
full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the Placement
Shares and to the Company. The representations and warranties set forth in the

      assume the defense of such proceeding, including the employment of counsel
      reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees
      and expenses; provided, however, that the failure to so notify such
      indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any
      liability which such indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party
      or otherwise, except, the indemnifying party&#146;s liability will be 
reduced
      to the extent that such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive
      rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. (The indemnified party or
      parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any
      such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
      expense of such indemnified party or parties unless the employment of such

      direct the defense of such proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party
      or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne
      by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood,
      however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable to the expenses
      of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in
      any one proceeding or series of related proceedings in the same
      jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such
      proceeding). No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of
the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent
      to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened
      action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be

      and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault,
      culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
      No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or

      in this Section 11 is unavailable to or is insufficient to hold harmless
      an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any
      losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
      referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the
      amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
      losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in
      such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
  benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the
other from the offering of the Placement Shares. If, however, the allocation
provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable
law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under
subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection
with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the Offering (before deducting
expenses) received by the Company, bear to the total underwriting discounts,
commissions and other fees received by the Agents. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or
the Agents on the other and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access
to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection (d), the Agents shall not be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Placement Shares
distributed to the public by it were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
any damages which the Agents have otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>

exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of British Columbia, for
the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection with any transaction
contemplated hereby, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in

<U>Absence of Fiduciary Duties</U>. The parties acknowledge that they are
sophisticated in business and financial matters and that each of them is solely
responsible for making its own independent investigation and analysis of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. They further acknowledge that the
Agents have not been engaged by the Company to provide, and have not provided,
financial advisory services in connection with the terms of the offering and
sale of the Shares nor have the Agents assumed at any time a fiduciary
relationship to the Company in connection with such offering and sale. The
parties also acknowledge that the provisions of this Agreement fairly allocate
the risks of the transactions contemplated hereby among them in light of their
respective knowledge of the Company and their respective abilities to
investigate its affairs and business in order to assure that full and adequate
disclosure has been made in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (and
any amendments and supplements thereto). The Company hereby waives, to the 
fullest
extent permitted by law, any claims it may have against the Agents for breach of
fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agrees the Agents shall
have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to the Company in respect of such
a fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting a fiduciary duty claim on
behalf of or in right of the Company, including shareholders, employees or
creditors of Company. </P>

Offering of up to US$100 Million </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Vancouver, August 11, 2016 &#150; </B>B2Gold Corp.
(&#147;<B>B2Gold</B>&#148; or the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;) (TSX: BTO, NYSE 
MKT: BTG, NSX: B2G)
announces that it has entered into an equity distribution agreement dated August
11, 2016 (the &#147;<B>Equity Distribution Agreement</B>&#148;) with
Canaccord Genuity Corp. and Canaccord Genuity Inc. (collectively,
&#147;<B>Canaccord</B>&#148;) and HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. and HSBC 
Securities (USA)
Inc. (collectively, &#147;<B>HSBC</B>&#148;, and together with Canaccord, the
&#147;<B>Agents</B>&#148;). Under the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company
will be
entitled, at its discretion and from time-to-time during the term of the Equity
Distribution Agreement, to sell, through the Agents, such number of common
shares of the Company (the &#147;<B>Common Shares</B>&#148;) having an aggregate
gross
offering price of up to US$100,000,000 (the &#147;<B>Offering</B>&#148;). Sales 
of Common
Shares will be made through &#147;at the market distributions&#148; as defined 
in National
Instrument 44-102, on the NYSE MKT LLC (&#147;<B>NYSE MKT</B>&#148;), the 
Toronto Stock
Exchange (&#147;<B>TSX</B>&#148;) or on any other existing trading market for 
the Common
Shares in the United States or Canada. The Common Shares will be distributed 
either (i) at the market
prices prevailing at the time of the sale; or (ii) at prices to be negotiated
with purchasers. As a result, prices may vary as between purchasers and during
the period of distribution. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company has filed a prospectus supplement dated August 11, 
2016 to the Company&#146;s existing U.S. shelf registration
statement on Form F-10 (the &#147;<B>Registration Statement</B>&#148;) and 
Canadian short
form base shelf prospectus (the &#147;<B>Base Shelf Prospectus</B>&#148;), each 
dated
January 11, 2016. The Canadian prospectus supplement (together with the Base
Shelf Prospectus) is available on the SEDAR website maintained by the Canadian
Securities Administrators at www.sedar.com. The U.S. prospectus supplement
(together with the related U.S. base shelf prospectus and the Registration
Statement) is available on the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively,
the
Agents will send the Canadian or U.S. prospectus supplement (together with the
applicable base shelf prospectus) upon request by contacting Canaccord<B> </B>at

Syndication, phone: 1-416-869-7368, email: ecm@canaccordgenuity.com, or HSBC at

Department, toll-free: 877-429-7459, email: ny.equity.syndicate@us.hsbc.com.</P>
<P align=justify>The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering, if
any, to fund ongoing general corporate expenditures, discretionary capital
programs, accelerated exploration at the Fekola Project and exploration and
feasibility work at the Kiaka Project.<B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>The Company will pay the Agents a placement fee for the Common
Shares sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement equal to 2% of the gross
proceeds from each placement. </P>
<P align=justify>The TSX has conditionally approved the listing of the Common
Shares offered hereunder, subject to the Company fulfilling all of the listing
requirements of the TSX. The NYSE MKT has approved the listing of the Common
Shares offered hereunder. </P>
<P align=justify>To the extent certain insiders of the Company, including
existing shareholders holding 10% or more of the Company&#146;s outstanding 
Common
Shares, purchase Common Shares under the Offering, such purchases would 
constitute a &#147;related party transaction&#148; under
Multilateral Instrument 61-101 &#150; <i>Protection of Minority Shareholders in
Special Transactions</i> (&#147;<b>MI 61-101</b>&#148;). Although the extent of 
any such
purchases is not known at this time, the potential participation by insiders in
the Offering would be exempt from the requirements to obtain a formal valuation
report and minority shareholder approval under Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of
MI 61-101 as the fair market value of the entire Offering represents less than
25% of the Company&#146;s market capitalization. </P>
