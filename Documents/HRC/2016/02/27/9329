</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102. It 
should also be read in the context of my report submitted to the sixty-second session of the 
General Assembly.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>2. The particular importance of the present report is related to the culmination of the 
institution-building phase of the Human Rights Council and the beginning of the actual 
functioning of its new or rationalized mechanisms within the framework of a standing body. The 
implementation of reform is an important challenge regarding the effectiveness of these human 
rights mechanisms and we should approach this coming phase with a spirit of constructive 
engagement and willingness to learn and further develop them together.  
</p>
<p>3. One of the main calls of Member States during the past months has been the need for 
greater interaction and consultations between the Council and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Though the demands of the 
institution-building process often limited the space and time for this interaction, OHCHR intends 
to continue and enhance a structured dialogue with the Council, such as the round of 
consultations with regional groups carried out by the Deputy High Commissioner in 2007. 
</p>
<p>4. The content of the present report constitutes another important tool for dialogue, which is 
why it addresses not only activities undertaken by OHCHR, but also provides a substantive 
overview of the human rights challenges we are facing and the strategies the Office is using to 
address them. 
</p>
<p><b>II. SUPPORT FOR THE WORK OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
AND THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF ITS MECHANISMS 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since my last report, the Council has fulfilled the mandate entrusted to it by the 
General Assembly by adopting in resolution 5/1 its land-mark agreement on institution-building 
on 18 June 2007, one year after its inaugural meeting. Over the past months, the Council, with 
the unabated support of my Office, has embarked on translating into practice the letter and spirit 
of its resolution 5/1. While considerable progress has been made, further resolve is required for 
all mechanisms of the Council to be established effectively and to be able to carry out their 
mandates in a meaningful manner to ensure the effective protection and promotion of human 
rights. In the year to come, institution-building will be finalized and implementation will be at 
the centre of the Council&#8217;s attention, with specific focus on pragmatic, meaningful and realistic 
responses to the human rights challenges of our times. My Office continues to be firmly 
committed to lending substantial support to these endeavours.  
</p>
<p>6. Significant progress has been made in setting in motion the universal periodic review 
mechanism. The Council has adopted general guidelines regarding the preparation of the 
information by the State, on the basis of which my Office has prepared the first compilations of 
information contained in the reports of treaty bodies, special procedures and other relevant 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  <i>Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-second Session, Supplement No. 36</i> (A/62/36). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>United Nations documents. In addition, my Office has been given the task of summarizing the 
credible and reliable information provided by relevant stakeholders. Such a broad basis of 
information is critical to the development of an inclusive and objective review process. Further 
developments were seen with regard to the universal periodic review mechanism, including the 
selection of the order of review of the 192 countries to be considered by the Working Group 
during the first four-year cycle.  
</p>
<p>7. Resolution 5/1 provides the general framework of the review, yet remains silent on several 
details. My Office has comprehensively contributed to further refining the modalities of the 
process with a view to developing an effective, meaningful and transparent mechanism on the 
basis of open and constructive dialogue. Policy issues associated with the establishment of the 
universal periodic review continue to be addressed both by the Council Bureau and within 
OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>8. Progress has also been made in discussing the troika selection system. It is essential that all 
troikas function in a consistent and coherent manner. This is crucial to ensuring effective 
interaction with States under consideration by the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition to providing substantive and technical support to member States in establishing 
the universal periodic review, I welcome the approval by the General Assembly of my request 
for additional resources to enable my Office to take on this additional responsibility in 
accordance with Council resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>10. I also encourage United Nations partners to further engage in the process, not only 
concerning their input during the preparatory phase of the universal periodic review, but also in 
the implementation and follow-up of the outcome, especially at the national level. The universal 
periodic review is an opportunity to create greater synergies and coherence in the work of the 
United Nations at the national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>11. As I have mentioned on repeated occasions, I consider the universal periodic review one 
of the main pillars of the institutional architecture of the Council. The review of the first 
48 countries within this framework, in the course of 2008, constitutes an opportunity for the 
Council to demonstrate that it has moved beyond politicization and selectivity by applying 
universal and equal standards and parameters to the review of the commitments and obligations 
of all States in the field of human rights. At the same time, I would like to emphasize that the 
credibility of the Council will be put to the test and the success of the universal periodic review 
will to a large extent depend on the willingness of States to engage in the process in a 
meaningful and constructive manner. I therefore encourage all States Members of the 
United Nations to live up to the commitments embodied in the institution-building package.  
</p>
<p>12. In my report to the General Assembly at the sixty-second session, I expressed my hope that 
the Council would devise transitional measures to avoid a protection gap in relation to the new 
complaint procedure, as the mandate of the Working Group on Communications expired on 
18 June 2007. I welcome the decision adopted by the Council at its sixth session, which enabled 
the holding of the first session of the Working Group on Communications in its former 
composition, pending the nomination of new members from among the Human Rights Council 
Advisory Committee. I am pleased to note that this agreement secured a seamless transition from 
the 1503 procedure to the new complaint procedure. In the light of the many similarities between </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the old and the new complaint mechanisms, in terms of their overall architecture, but also in 
relation to the admissibility of communications, it continues to be critical to operationalize the 
new and distinct parameters to ensure a more transparent and efficient mechanism as is called for 
by the Council in its resolution 5/1.  
</p>
<p>13. Another challenge for the coming year will be to develop the analytical capacities of the 
Council and of its subsidiary organ, the Advisory Committee. New impetus should be given to 
the consideration of thematic matters through rejuvenated procedures, such as the holding of 
panel discussions and general debates. As for the latter, further thought should be given to their 
format with a view to making them more substantive in nature and less bureaucratic in style.  
</p>
<p>14. I welcome the establishment by consensus of a new expert mechanism on the human rights 
of indigenous peoples to provide thematic expertise in this area, in continuation of the work of 
the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the former Sub-Commission. This new 
mechanism will be composed of six independent experts, of which at least three will be 
representatives of indigenous peoples. This is an example of how the Council can ensure that the 
needs of those concerned will be adequately taken into account in the mainstreaming of the 
rights of specific groups. Another welcome initiative to foster the Council&#8217;s thematic expertise 
was its decision to establish a forum on minority issues to provide a platform for promoting 
dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to people belonging to national or ethnic, religious 
and linguistic minorities. The establishment of interlinkages between the forum and the work of 
the independent expert on minority issues not only encourages the cross-fertilization between 
various elements of the system of protection and promotion of human rights, but also ensures a 
consistent and coherent approach. 
</p>
<p>15. Concerning the establishment of the Advisory Committee, my Office has maintained and 
prepared a list of the candidatures received, which was closed at the beginning of the year, and 
from which the 18 members of the new body will be elected. When casting their ballots at the 
current session, the Council members should bear in mind that the level of expertise, 
independence and impartiality of the new body will be decisive if this think-tank is to effectively 
provide research-based advice to the Council on emerging or underdeveloped thematic issues. 
While it appears that, in terms of composition, the new body may not be fundamentally different 
from its predecessor, I believe it is critical that, in discharging its mandate, the Committee adopt 
an approach that is oriented towards implementation rather than theory, and therefore actively 
engages with State and non-State actors, including non-governmental organizations and national 
human rights institutions, in a meaningful manner.  
</p>
<p>16. The system of special procedures remains one of the key tools of the Council in the 
protection and promotion of human rights and my Office continues to provide strong and 
efficient support to the activities of the various mandate-holders and their Coordination 
Committee. I have advocated for the substantive participation of the mandate-holders in the 
review, rationalization and improvement of their mandates and I am pleased to note that this 
process is well under way. I am confident that the Council at its current session will pursue its 
efforts to further strengthen the system of special procedures with the objective, to the greatest 
extent possible, of universality of coverage of human rights issues.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. As for the process of selection and appointment of new special procedures 
mandate-holders, my Office has been given the task of preparing, maintaining and periodically 
updating a public list of eligible candidates nominated by Governments, regional groups, 
international and non-governmental organizations, other human rights bodies and individuals. 
I welcome the enhanced transparency and inclusive nature of the nomination process, as well as 
the opportunity for a variety of interested stakeholders to put forward candidatures of highly 
qualified individuals with the required competence and experience in the field of human rights. 
Moreover, my Office is undertaking a preliminary screening of the nominations received with a 
view to including in the public list those nominees who meet the technical and objective criteria 
adopted by the Council, thereby contributing to maintaining a system of special procedures that 
is rooted in independence, impartiality, integrity, objectivity, expertise and experience. 
</p><p>18. My Office is pleased about the expanded opportunities for interactive dialogue between the 
Council and the special procedures mandate-holders. Consideration might be given to further 
enhancing such dialogue and to taking measures to ensure that the dialogue with special 
procedures at the General Assembly remains fruitful. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  DEVELOPMENTS IN STRATEGIC THEMATIC AREAS 
</b></p>
<p>19. Despite the many advances made in recent years in the development of legal standards, in 
awareness and commitment of the international community and in the increasing recognition that 
respect for human rights is a precondition for development, peace and security, obstacles to the 
full realization of human rights remain in the strategic thematic areas identified in the OHCHR 
Plan of Action. These are impunity, poverty, discrimination, armed conflict and violence, 
democratic deficits and weak institutions. 
</p>
<p>20. Impunity for human rights violations is still present in all regions of the world and poses a 
serious challenge to the pursuit of justice. In post-conflict situations, ongoing impunity makes it 
difficult to stamp out abusive practices after peace has been restored. 
</p>
<p>21. In 2006 and 2007, to help end impunity, OHCHR, through its technical cooperation, 
advisory and advocacy activities, led international efforts to support national protection systems 
in a variety of ways, such as support for fact-finding or investigation missions and for treaty 
bodies and special procedures mandate-holders. In November 2006, a decision by the Policy 
Committee of the Secretary-General on the rule of law entrusted OHCHR with leading 
United Nations initiatives on transitional justice, both in the field and at the international level. 
In 2006 and 2007, OHCHR developed nine tools in the field of transitional justice, on issues 
such as truth commissions, prosecution initiatives, amnesties and vetting. My Office also plans a 
tenth tool, on the issue of preservation of national archives, and will give strong emphasis to its 
work on the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms as an essential component in the 
fight against impunity. 
</p>
<p>22. As the United Nations focal point for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, 
OHCHR has promoted recognition of the connection between human rights and poverty. My 
Office has deepened its expertise and committed its substantive support to human rights 
mechanisms and other bodies dealing with these issues, including the high-level task force and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>open-ended working group on the right to development. OHCHR has also issued major 
publications on poverty and a human rights-based approach to development, and through 
advocacy, strengthened partnerships and capacity-building activities has helped to advance 
knowledge and capacities to deal with these issues. 
</p>
<p>23. Conscious that the fight against poverty and global inequities requires the concerted effort 
of many actors, OHCHR worked in 2007 with United Nations human rights mechanisms, such as 
the independent expert on extreme poverty; the independent expert on the effects of economic 
reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights; the ad hoc working group on the implementation of existing human 
rights norms and standards in the context of the fight against extreme poverty; and the Social 
Forum. My Office has collaborated with its United Nations sister agencies and programmes, as 
well as with States, to integrate human rights-based approaches into poverty reduction strategies 
and programmes. The presence of OHCHR on the ground has facilitated the adoption of human 
rights-based approaches in different programming and planning frameworks. 
</p>
<p>24. In order to fight discrimination, during the past biennium, OHCHR has provided advisory 
services in the drafting of anti-discrimination laws; produced guidelines to assist States in the 
development of national action plans; organized regional workshops; and engaged in 
inter-agency cooperation on anti-discrimination issues so as to strengthen national protection 
systems. My Office has also supported national institutions and civil society organizations and 
assisted in the empowerment of victims of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>25. In my Plan of Action, I advocated that the protection of human rights should be at the core 
of policies to address conflict, as when patterns of abuse are tackled effectively, escalation can 
often be halted. As human rights protection has become a major cross-cutting issue to be 
incorporated in humanitarian activities, OHCHR has become increasingly involved in the 
inter-agency response to humanitarian crises and the development of human rights training 
manuals and operational guidance. In addition, OHCHR has increased its collaboration with the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political Affairs and United Nations 
peace missions, including through supporting their human rights components, and contributed to 
the development of guidance on human rights for military and police components. 
</p>
<p>26. In my 2005 Plan of Action, I stated that human rights standards must underpin any 
meaningful conception of democracy, so that physical integrity is protected and freedoms of 
participation, elections, assembly, association, opinion, expression and information are 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>27. OHCHR has therefore carried out democracy-building and support activities under the 
various components of the United Nations human rights programme. Technical cooperation 
projects have been mainly geared towards enhancing the capacity of State institutions to promote 
democratic governance, notably through a strong and independent judiciary; effective parliament 
oversight mechanisms; independent and powerful national human rights institutions; and a 
vibrant civil society. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. In addition, given the importance of constitution-making and constitutional reforms in the 
context of democratic transitions and peace building, OHCHR has worked with the rest of the 
United Nations system towards a coordinated approach to constitution-building, and this work 
will continue in 2008 and 2009. My Office is currently engaged in an exercise to further develop 
its relationships with key actors in and outside the United Nations system, with a view to 
strengthening its legal and human rights advisory capacities in this area and developing a 
publication on this subject.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  STRENGTHENING COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT 
</b></p>
<p>29. Throughout 2007, engagement at the country level remained at the core of OHCHR action, 
not only through the consolidation and establishment of field presences, but also through 
enhanced dialogue with and capacity-building of national counterparts. Dynamic partnerships 
within the United Nations system and interaction with regional organizations<b> </b>were also a priority 
of my Office to further strengthen country engagement. In addition, OHCHR continued to 
improve the capacity of its headquarters to support country engagement. In particular, its rapid 
response capacity was significantly strengthened, which enabled my Office to initiate and 
support various emergency or technical missions. 
</p>
<p>30. At the end of 2007, OHCHR was running and supporting a total of 47 field presences, 
including regional offices, country offices, human rights components in United Nations peace 
missions and human rights advisers in United Nations country teams. 
</p>
<p>31. By the end of 2007, my Office had 11 country offices at the country level,<b>2</b> including a 
new office in La Paz, which was established early in 2007. As envisaged in the Strategic 
Management Plan for 2006-2007, the offices in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia (Belgrade) 
were closed in June 2007 while the office in Kosovo was strengthened in light of remaining 
human rights concerns and upcoming challenges. 
</p>
<p>32. I welcome the renewal of memorandums of understanding with OHCHR by the 
Government of Nepal<b>3</b> in May 2007, Colombia in September 2007 and the Government of 
Cambodia in November 2007.<b>4</b> The latter agreement, extending the mandate of OHCHR in 
Cambodia for 18 months, was reached on the understanding that negotiations aimed at 
concluding a standard agreement for future operations of the office would resume in 2008. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Country offices in Angola, Bolivia, Cambodia, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Nepal, Togo 
</p>
<p>and Uganda, as well as presences in Kosovo (Serbia) and Palestine. 
<b>3
</b>  A report of the High Commissioner on the human rights situation and activities of her office, 
</p>
<p>including technical cooperation in Nepal, is being submitted to the Human Rights Council at its 
seventh session. 
<b>4
</b>  A report of the Secretary-General on the role and achievements of OHCHR in assisting the 
</p>
<p>Government and people of Cambodia in the promotion and protection of human rights is being 
submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/75). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>33. By December 2007, OHCHR was also running nine regional human rights presences.<b>5</b> This 
included a regional office for Central America, based in Panama and established early in 2007.<b>6</b> 
In November 2007, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Government of 
Senegal for the establishment of a regional office for West Africa in Dakar. 
</p>
<p>34. It is expected that, in the course of 2008, three new regional offices will be established and 
operational - in Central, Asia (Bishkek), South-West Asia and North Africa - and a human rights 
training and documentation centre for South-West Asia and the Arab region.<b>7</b> The setting up of 
such offices was foreseen in the Strategic Management Plan for 2006-2007 (except 
South-West Asia) but, as highlighted in my last report to the Human Rights Council, significant 
delays have been faced in this process. This was essentially due to the complexity of the required 
negotiations, including host country agreements and consultations regarding the selection of the 
seat. 
</p>
<p>35. I would also like to welcome two important achievements concerning dialogue and 
cooperation with countries where OHCHR does not have a country office: the conclusion of a 
framework agreement for cooperation with the Russian Federation; and the completion of 
several technical cooperation activities in China. 
</p>
<p>36. Thanks to its Peace Missions Support and Rapid Response Unit, established in 2006, the 
capacity of OHCHR to react promptly to critical human rights situations significantly increased 
in 2007, which allowed the taking of action and the provision of conceptual and operational 
support to a number of unforeseen human rights situations, including implementation of Council 
resolutions and decisions. 
</p>
<p>37. My Office was thus able to deploy missions and to mobilize surge capacity in support of 
OHCHR country or regional offices as well as United Nations country teams or peace operations 
in seven countries. For instance, early in 2007, in response to the declaration of a state of 
emergency in Guinea, OHCHR extended support to the United Nations country team and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  Regional offices for Southern Africa (Pretoria); East Africa (Addis Ababa); South-East Asia 
</p>
<p>(Bangkok); the Middle East (Beirut); the Pacific (Suva); Central America (Panama City); liaison 
office for Latin America and the Caribbean (Santiago); regional representative for Central Asia 
(Bishkek); and the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa 
(Yaound&#233;). 
<b>6
</b>  It should be noted that, at the end of 2007, owing to budgetary constraints, OHCHR transferred 
</p>
<p>from Santiago the mandate of the regional office for Latin America to Panama where, early 
in 2007, it had established a regional office for Central America. A liaison office has been 
maintained in Chile. 
<b>7
</b>  The establishment of the Qatar centre was requested by the General Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 60/153, mandating the Centre to undertake training and documentation activities 
according to international standards and to support such efforts within the region by 
Governments, United Nations agencies and programmes, national human rights institutions and 
non-governmental organizations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provided assistance to a civil society initiative aimed at documenting allegations of human rights 
violations committed in January 2007 to repress peaceful protests. Other rapid response activities 
included support for a forensic investigation in Afghanistan, assistance to the United Nations 
country team in Somalia, and surge capacity to support OHCHR offices to better respond to 
critical situations, in the context of the violence in the Terai region, in Nepal, in January 2007; 
and of the deteriorating situation in the Occupied Palestinian territories. In October 2007, the 
rapid response capacity also allowed OHCHR to monitor human rights in the context of 
parliamentary elections in Togo. 
</p>
<p>38. As in 2006, the Peace Missions Support and Rapid Response Unit also enabled OHCHR to 
support the prompt implementation of Council resolutions and decisions. Thus, it provided 
secretarial support to the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun, which was reactivated 
in 2007,<b>8</b> to the high-level mission/group of experts mandated by the Council to assess the 
situation of human rights in Darfur,<b>9</b> and assisted the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Myanmar following a special session of the Council in October 2007. The 
Council had requested the Special Rapporteur to assess the human rights situation in Myanmar in 
relation to the crackdown on the protests of August and September 2007.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>39. In 2007, my Office advised the following Member States on the establishment and 
responsibilities of national human rights institutions: Azerbaijan, Burundi, Cambodia, Chile, 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Ethiopia, France, Indonesia, Italy, Lesotho, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, Sudan, 
Swaziland, Tajikistan, Uganda and Timor-Leste. In its work on and with national human rights 
institutions, OHCHR frequently cooperated with regional networks of national institutions and 
with United Nations partners, including the United Nations Development Programme and the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations. 
</p>
<p>40. Furthermore, my Office provided secretarial support to the meetings of the Accreditation 
Subcommittee of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, held in April and October 2007. OHCHR also 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  The Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on Israeli incursions in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory on 15 November 2006 (S-3/1) at a special session. While the secretariat of 
the high-level fact-finding mission has been activated three times upon the request of the 
Council - most recently in December 2007 - the necessary travel clearances have not been 
granted by the Israeli authorities. 
<b>9
</b>  The Council adopted a decision to dispatch a high-level mission to assess the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in Darfur on 13 December 2006 (S-4/101) as a result of a special session on Darfur. Its 
mandate was discontinued at the sixth regular session of the Council, in December 2007. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  The Council adopted a resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
on 2 October 2007 at a special session (S-5/1), which led to the first country visit by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar since 2003. The Special Rapporteur 
submitted his report to the Council at its sixth session, in December 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>supported and facilitated the involvement of national human rights institutions in the Council, 
the human rights treaty monitoring bodies and the special procedures. OHCHR has developed a 
fellowship programme which will start in 2008 and whereby the staff member of a &#8220;A&#8221; status 
national institution will be selected to work in the National Institutions Unit of OHCHR for six 
months, in order to gain knowledge of and experience with the United Nations human rights 
system. 
</p>
<p>41. In 2007, I attended meetings in and conducted visits to Afghanistan, Brazil, Burundi, 
Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan), Colombia, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, France, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Japan, Nepal, 
Rwanda, Sri Lanka and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>42. In France, Ireland and the United States, I discussed human rights in the context of 
counter-terrorism, migration and discrimination. In April, I addressed the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe on the state of human rights in Europe, focusing on issues 
such as migration. It should be underlined that my Office is an active member of the Global 
Migration Group, which promotes a rights-based approach to migration. 
</p>
<p>43. As in previous missions, in most countries I visited, I insisted on the need for 
accountability with a view to putting an end to impunity for all forms of human rights violations, 
past and present. The fight against impunity remains at the heart of the work of OHCHR in 
Cambodia, Colombia, Guatemala, Nepal, Togo, Uganda, Kosovo and Palestine. 
</p>
<p>44. Closely interconnected with the issue of impunity, the independence of the judiciary has 
also been an overarching concern in most missions which I undertook in 2007. Other issues 
which I focused on during my visits included the situation of human rights defenders and of civil 
society in general, women&#8217;s rights, as well as violations of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>45. In 2007, OHCHR substantively continued to assist the work of human rights components 
of 17 peace missions. In particular, OHCHR further stepped up its cooperation with the peace 
missions of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs 
and other relevant counterparts to ensure further implementation of the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
decision on human rights in integrated missions, adopted in October 2005. Significant progress 
was achieved in 2007 regarding the integration of human rights in peace missions, including 
more public human rights reports. 
</p>
<p>46. Increased cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the newly 
established Department of Field Support led to OHCHR participation in all technical 
assessment missions and other significant mission planning activities conducted in 2007. 
As a result, well-tailored human rights components will be part of the new joint 
United Nations/African Union hybrid mission in Darfur as well as of a new mission to be 
established at the border with Darfur in Chad and the Central African Republic. In addition, the 
work of the human rights components of the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
(UNOCI) and the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) will be redefined 
to adjust to the changing situation on the ground. Cooperation between OHCHR and the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations also resulted in the revision of mandates in UNOCI, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
the United Nations Mission in Liberia and UNIOSIL, and contributed to the ongoing process 
of analysis on the role of the United Nations Political Office for Somalia. 
</p>
<p>47. In 2007, my Office intensified its involvement with the work of the humanitarian 
community, particularly through the Geneva-based inter-agency humanitarian settings. In 
particular, OHCHR now chairs the newly established Reference Group on Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Action, which is expected to facilitate the integration of a human rights-based 
approach in humanitarian activities, include a human rights perspective to the advocacy 
initiatives of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and increase the level of awareness and 
information-sharing about human rights initiatives with relevance to humanitarian action. 
OHCHR actively contributes to mainstreaming human rights in humanitarian programming, 
mainly through the Global Protection Cluster Working Group which it is co-leading, and the 
work on the steering committee of the protection capacity programme. OHCHR has also actively 
been involved in the work of the Global Protection Cluster and began providing support and 
information to human rights field presences as the roll-out of the cluster approach continued 
beyond the initial pilot phase. 
</p>
<p>48. The mainstreaming of human rights in the work of the United Nations system at the 
country level remains a priority for OHCHR. To that end, efforts continued to further strengthen 
cooperation with resident coordinators and United Nations country teams. In this context, as at 
December 2007, OHCHR had international human rights advisers in Ecuador, Georgia (covering 
Armenia and Azerbaijan), Guyana, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia. Human rights 
advisers were deployed in Rwanda, Indonesia, Maldives and Papua New Guinea in the course 
of 2007 under Action 2 funds. A national adviser was appointed within the United Nations 
country teams in Skopje and Belgrade. 
</p><p>49. Closer interaction with regional organizations is of great importance, particularly when 
engaging with countries without an OHCHR presence. The Office extensively interacted with the 
regional mechanisms of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, aiming at strengthening cooperation in areas of mutual interest and 
activities. With similar objectives, interaction was enhanced with the Inter-American System, 
particularly with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In Africa, OHCHR has 
continued its engagement with regional organizations, inter alia, by attending the session of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the annual summit of Heads of 
African States. Moreover, in the framework of the 10-year capacity-building programme for the 
African Union, OHCHR organized a consultative meeting to identify priorities for 
African Union-United Nations cooperation in the field of human rights, justice and reconciliation 
for the period 2008-2009. OHCHR also supported activities of the Economic Commission for 
Africa, such as the first African Civil Society Forum on the Millennium Development Goals and 
the African Human Rights and Governance Report. In the Asia and Pacific region, OHCHR 
supported the fourteenth Annual Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region in Bali, Indonesia, in July, and provided 
technical support in efforts to establish subregional human rights arrangements in the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the South Pacific. OHCHR also stepped up 
interaction with the League of Arab States to explore future areas of cooperation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V. SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSAL  
DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>50. A year-long United Nations system-wide human rights advocacy campaign, launched 
on Human Rights Day 2007, is the focus of OHCHR efforts to commemorate the sixtieth 
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. OHCHR spearheaded a strategy to 
mark the historic milestone, resulting in the Secretary-General&#8217;s initiative on the anniversary 
advocacy campaign by all of the United Nations family leading up to the anniversary date 
on 10 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>51. The anniversary year will see the United Nations and its partners advocate specific areas of 
human rights that are most pertinent to their work under the overarching message &#8220;Dignity and 
justice for all of us&#8221;. The overarching theme and messages OHCHR has developed for the 
anniversary reinforce the vision of the Declaration as a universal commitment to dignity and 
justice. Non-discrimination, equality, fairness and universality are core to the values enshrined in 
the Declaration, which was drafted and adopted by representatives of all regions and legal 
traditions. 
</p>
<p>52. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an enduring and vibrant document. It has 
inspired more than 80 international human rights treaties and declarations, a great number of 
regional human rights conventions, domestic human rights bills and constitutional provisions, 
which together constitute a comprehensive legally binding system for the promotion and 
protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>53. The objectives of the campaign are threefold. The first is to empower people all over the 
world to promote and realize their rights through raising public human rights awareness, 
promoting national ownership and wider participation in the anniversary celebration at the 
international, regional and country levels. The second objective is to establish and promote the 
vision of the High Commissioner of human rights in the context of the anniversary and beyond 
as a universal value and a core purpose of the United Nations. The third objective is to highlight 
United Nations-wide achievements in mainstreaming human rights and to advocate further 
system-wide coherence on human rights under the current reform focus. 
</p>
<p>54. The above objectives must be viewed within the bigger picture of ongoing United Nations 
reform endeavours. Human rights mainstreaming has been central to United Nations reform 
efforts since 1997, and important progress has been made in many agencies and areas of work 
across the system. This is particularly important in the light of the current emphasis on 
system-wide coherence, which would require strengthened linkages between the normative work 
of the United Nations and its operational activities at the country level. 
</p>
<p>55. National ownership and local participation are central to the campaign. I have called on all 
national actors, Governments, civil society and human rights institutions to take every 
opportunity during the year-long commemoration campaign to reaffirm their commitment to the 
values and principles of the Declaration. To facilitate the participation of a wide range of local 
and international partners, the Communications Section of OHCHR has issued a monthly 
newsletter entitled <i>Info60</i>, distributed since September 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. The Secretary-General launched the campaign at the OHCHR regional office in Bangkok, 
where he inaugurated a Human Rights Day exhibition. An official event was held in Geneva, 
which coincided with the first day of the resumed sixth session of the Human Rights Council. 
The Secretary-General, via video message, myself, representatives of Member States, special 
procedures, treaty bodies, national human rights institutions and civil society all spoke on the 
launch and the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Celebrations were also 
held on 10 December across the world to mark Human Rights Day and launch the year-long 
campaign. Many partners, such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization, are planning commemorative activities throughout the anniversary year until 
December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  DURBAN REVIEW PROCESS  
</b></p>
<p>57. On 8 September 2001, Member States adopted by consensus the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action. As underlined by victims of racism, including persons of African descent, 
indigenous peoples, migrants and minorities, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
is an historic document because it represents a comprehensive and action-orientated framework 
to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>58. It is recognized that no country is free from racism and that victims should benefit from 
effective remedies and redress through concrete legislative, administrative, preventive and 
judicial measures. My Office, through the Anti-Discrimination Unit, is already providing 
assistance to Member States and to groups of victims along those lines.  
</p>
<p>59. My Office has also strongly supported the mechanisms put in place to follow up the 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. Race, religion and 
ethnicity are important root causes of ongoing violent conflicts in different parts of the world. In 
recent months, several countries have been confronted with situations of extreme violence, some 
linked to the question of participation in democratic structures and multiculturalism, owing to the 
non-acceptance of the principle of equality and non-discrimination in the enjoyment of all human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>60. Last year, the General Assembly adopted resolution 61/149 for the convening of a review 
conference to look at the progress of implementation of the commitments made in Durban. The 
responsibility of organizing this conference was given to the Human Rights Council. The 
Assembly resolution was followed by resolution 3/2 of the Council, which set up a preparatory 
committee to prepare the issues for discussion at the main review conference. 
</p>
<p>61. The first organizational session of the Preparatory Committee was held in August. It 
adopted by consensus 15 decisions on a variety of issues, including the objectives of the Durban 
Review Conference. That meeting was preceded by 19 meetings of the Bureau, all fully serviced 
by the Anti-Discrimination Unit.  
</p>
<p>62. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action is a far-reaching document addressing a 
wide range of relevant issues. Given that the potential of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action has not yet been fully explored, the Durban Review Conference in 2009 is an 
opportunity for the international community to take stock of what has been done and to review 
the obstacles that have impeded significant progress in the eradication of racism, racial </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The Durban Review Conference should be a 
platform to take stock of the best and most effective examples and lessons learned from the fight 
against racism and to move the anti-discrimination agenda forward.  
</p>
<p>63. The preparatory process for the Durban Review Conference should, therefore, be 
comprehensive, taking into account the commitments and the context affecting their 
implementation at the national, regional and international levels. It should be participatory by 
involving all stakeholders, including victims, and should be result-oriented, aiming at setting 
concrete targets to be achieved within a clear time frame. The participatory and inclusive 
preparation of the Conference on the review of challenges and progress in the implementation of 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in the Americas region is a good example to 
be followed. My Office supported this Conference at the request of the Governments of Brazil 
and Chile and I hope that it can serve as a model for other regions. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>64. The human rights treaty body framework was strengthened in 2007 by the 
operationalization of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment established under the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which 
was adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 57/199 and entered into force 
on 22 June 2006. As at 9 January 2008, 34 States had ratified the Optional Protocol.<b>11</b>  
</p>
<p>65. The first 10<b>12</b> members of the Subcommittee were elected on 18 December 2006, and its 
first session was convened in February 2007. It met again in June and November 2007, and 
during the latter session on 20 November 2007, it met jointly with the Committee against 
Torture.  
</p>
<p>66. The Subcommittee is mandated to conduct visits to places where persons are deprived of 
their liberty in order to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and to interact with national preventive mechanisms. The Subcommittee&#8217;s initial 
country visits, to Mauritius and Maldives, were made in October and December 2007; four 
further visits are planned for 2008. 
</p>
<p>67. The Optional Protocol creates a two-pillar system, at the international and national levels, 
directed at preventing torture and other forms of ill-treatment in all places of detention. At the 
national level, within one year of ratification or accession, States parties must have in place one 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Costa Rica, Croatia, 
</p>
<p>Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Honduras, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Maldives, Mali, 
Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Senegal, Serbia, 
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 
Uruguay.  
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  When 50 States ratify or accede to the Optional Protocol, membership of the Subcommittee 
on Prevention will increase to 25. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>or several national preventive mechanisms. No particular type of national mechanism is 
specified, therefore human rights commissions, ombudsmen, parliamentary commissions or 
non-governmental organizations could be designated to carry out this function. States parties 
must ensure that these national bodies function without any interference from the State 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>68. The Optional Protocol provides for the setting up of a special fund, to help finance the 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee after a visit to a State party, 
as well as education programmes of national preventive measures. The special fund, which may 
be financed through voluntary contributions made by Governments, intergovernmental 
organizations and non-governmental organizations and other private or public entities, was 
created in 2007. 
</p>
<p>69. About 350 participants from a number of countries participated in training activities 
organized by the Treaties and Council Branch. Staff members of the Branch participated in a 
number of training activities organized by the Capacity-Building and Field Operations Branch, 
OHCHR field presences or external partners such as the Organisation internationale de la 
francophonie and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and national human rights institutions. A 
memorandum of understanding between the Francophonie and OHCHR, which envisages 
training courses on treaty body and Human Rights Council activities, was concluded in 
September 2007, and a training course on the modalities of universal periodic review was held in 
Rabat on 2 and 3 February 2008. A workshop for parliamentarians on the implementation of 
treaty body recommendations, co-organized by IPU and OHCHR, was held in Ouagadougou 
from 30 September to 2 October 2007. Follow-up workshops are envisaged for the 
Central African Republic, Chad, Mali and Mauritania in 2008.  
</p>
<p>70. A workshop to encourage engagement with the treaty bodies for representatives of 
non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions and the media in Guyana, 
Indonesia and the Philippines was organized in Geneva, in November 2007, and was preceded 
by national preparatory workshops in the three countries. Follow-up workshops will be 
organized in all three countries in 2008.  
</p>
<p>71. A subregional workshop was organized in November 2007 in Ouagadougou, in 
cooperation with Plan International, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the World Health 
Organization, on the implementation of recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child. A similar regional workshop on the implementation of recommendations of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was held in Bishkek. These workshops 
create a momentum among a number of national actors to raise the profile of treaty body 
procedures and in particular the implementation of the recommendations at the national level.  
</p>
<p>72. More than 6,000 copies of a DVD training tool on the work of the treaty bodies have now 
been distributed to Governments, non-governmental organizations, OHCHR field presences, 
United Nations entities and others, and its revision and further development in Arabic, Chinese 
and Russian has begun. The DVD, which presents the treaty implementation and reporting 
procedures in a user-friendly and illustrative manner for use by the different civil society actors 
working at the national level, is used in OHCHR training activities and by United Nations 
agencies, funds and programmes.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. In August 2007, OHCHR took over the Universal Human Rights Index project, which 
compiles observations and recommendations of United Nations human rights treaty bodies and 
rapporteurs, that had been developed by the Government of Switzerland. Presentations of the 
Index have been held for treaty bodies and staff of the Office, and information sessions on its 
utilization in the framework of the universal periodic review were also organized in Geneva for 
French-speaking permanent missions in November and December 2007 by the Treaties and 
Council Branch jointly with the Organisation internationale de la francophonie. A CD-Rom 
providing the information contained on the website is being finalized and will be distributed 
soon to Governments, non-governmental organizations, field presences, United Nations entities 
and others, together with a promotional booklet published in the six official languages of the 
United Nations.  
</p>
<p>74. As is well known, the momentum for reform has accelerated since the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s 2002 proposals, by which he urged the adoption of harmonized working 
methods to create a predictable system for States and other stakeholders, and the introduction of 
streamlined reporting requirements, possibly via a single report on implementation of all 
obligations a State had accepted which would be submitted to all treaty bodies. The need to 
streamline and strengthen the treaty body system, including through the implementation of 
harmonized guidelines on reporting to all treaty bodies so that they could operate as a unified 
system was re-emphasized by the Secretary-General in his 2005 report &#8220;In Larger Freedom&#8221; 
(A/59/2005). In my Plan of Action, released in May 2005, I described the human rights treaty 
system as one of the great achievements of the United Nations, but predicted that its 
inefficiencies would worsen, particularly as progress towards universal ratification and timely 
reporting continues to be made.  
</p>
<p>75. In February 2006, I put forward my concept paper, including the proposal for a unified 
standing treaty body (HRI/MC/2006/2). The concept paper has stimulated debate among States 
parties, treaty body members, United Nations entities, non-governmental organizations, 
academics and others, including at the brainstorming meeting held in July 2006 in Liechtenstein 
(Malbun II). A compilation of views on the proposal formulated since the release of the concept 
paper is kept updated by OHCHR, while the 2007 special issue of the <i>Human Rights Law Review</i> 
on reform of the United Nations human rights machinery includes four articles which directly 
address the proposal and the concept paper.  
</p>
<p>76. All opinions on my proposal acknowledge the challenges facing the treaty body system, 
and a number cite the concept paper as providing an accurate account of these. Several welcome 
the concept paper as an important contribution to thinking about ways to strengthen the 
effectiveness of the treaty monitoring system and deserving of full analysis and consideration. 
Most suggest that the proposal does not respond to the challenges to the system and raises legal 
and political problems that cannot be solved in the short or medium term. Many raise concerns 
that the establishment of a unified standing treaty body could lead to a lack of attention to 
specific rights or the rights of specific groups. Some express concern at the risk that 
implementation of the proposal might lead to the loss of the specific identity of individual 
committees. 
</p>
<p>77. In response to the proposal, other reform options have been put forward by the treaty 
bodies, and a working group on harmonization composed of treaty body representatives met 
twice to discuss these proposals as well as the elements of the concept paper relating to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>harmonization of working methods and streamlined reporting guidelines. The proposals of the 
working group on harmonization were in turn considered at the sixth inter-committee meeting 
and the nineteenth meeting of chairpersons in June 2007. Participants in the meetings recognized 
the need to improve and harmonize further the working methods of the human rights treaty 
bodies and considered it appropriate that the inter-committee meeting be held twice annually.  
</p>
<p>78. Revised guidelines for a common core document to be submitted to all human rights treaty 
bodies accompanied by the relevant treaty-specific report were accepted at the fifth 
inter-committee meeting and the eighteenth meeting of chairpersons; with the agreement of the 
sixth inter-committee meeting and the nineteenth meeting of chairpersons, a note verbale was 
sent to all States parties recommending their use. Several States have submitted common core 
documents and others are preparing such a document. As noted above, Switzerland has 
developed an electronic tool (the Index) based on the guidelines to assist in streamlined 
reporting. The tool is being used in workshops on reporting to human rights treaty bodies. In 
addition, the treaty bodies have begun the task of harmonizing and simplifying their own 
guidelines so that they are in line with those for the common core document, with one treaty 
body having finalized its guidelines and others being well advanced in this task. Reporting 
workshops in which the Treaties and Council Branch participated in 2007 prioritized the 
guidelines on the common core document to address the need to streamline the treaty body 
system, and the preparation of treaty-specific reports. Harmonization of the follow-up activities 
of treaty bodies is also proceeding, including in the context of follow-up to views on individual 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>79. A working group consisting of representatives of seven treaty bodies developed a common 
approach to reservations to human rights treaties and discussed the issue with the International 
Law Commission at a special seminar in May 2007. In this context, it should be noted that the 
responsibility for the support for the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women was transferred to my Office in 2007 and its first Geneva session was held in 
January 2008.  
</p>
<p>80. Participants in the sixth inter-committee meeting held discussions with the bureau of the 
International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection 
of Human Rights on interaction between national human rights institutions and treaty bodies and 
recommended that the conclusions of the round table on the role of national human rights 
institutions in the treaty reporting process, held in Berlin, in November 2006, should form the 
basis for the discussion on the matter in future harmonization meetings of the treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>81. At the nineteenth meeting of chairpersons, discussions were held on the universal periodic 
review mechanism of the Human Rights Council. The chairpersons underlined the 
complementary and mutually reinforcing nature of the treaty body system and the future review 
and emphasized the importance of a continuing dialogue on that matter. They appreciated that 
the findings and recommendations of treaty bodies would form part of the basis of the review, 
highlighted the role of the concluding observations in that regard and further recognized the need 
for developing effective cooperation between the treaty bodies and the Council. The joint 
meeting with special procedures mandate-holders in June 2007 provided a further opportunity to 
exchange views on the above-mentioned issues. <b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>As the report outlines, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights supported the Human Rights Council in its institution-building process and 
the preparations for the universal periodic review are well under way. The Office has also 
made important advances in implementing its Strategic Management Plan for 2006-2007 
and prepared the Plan for 2008-2009 in line with the priorities of the Plan of Action. 
Continued country engagement, the preparations for the sixtieth anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the renewed commitment to the fight against 
racism in the form of the Durban Review Conference have been highlighted as part of my 
Office&#8217;s efforts to address the human rights challenges before us and to affirm the 
universality and indivisibility of human rights. The results of the discussion of the present 
report in the Council are not only welcome, but will help OHCHR to implement these 
mandates effectively.
