FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any 
statements  contained  herein  that  are  not  statements  of  historical  fact  may  be  deemed  to  be  forward-looking 
statements.  In  some  cases,  you  can  identify  forward-looking  statements  by  terminology  such  as  “may”,  “will”, 
“should”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential” or “continue”, 
the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. In evaluating these statements, you should consider 
various factors, including the assumptions, risks and uncertainties outlined in our annual report on Form 10-K for 
the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 
13, 2014, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and, from time to time, in other reports that we file with the SEC. 
These factors or any of them may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. 
Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements in this quarterly report include, among others, statements regarding:
  our capital needs; 
  business plans; and 

expectations.
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith 
and reflect our current judgment regarding future events, our actual results will likely vary, sometimes materially, 
from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Some of the 
risks and assumptions include:
  our need for additional financing; 
  our limited operating history; 
  our history of operating losses; 
  our  exploration  activities  may  not  result  in  commercially  exploitable  quantities  of  potash  on  our
current or any future mineral properties; 
the  risks  inherent  in  the  exploration  for  minerals  such  as  geologic  formation,  weather,  accidents, 
equipment failures and governmental restrictions; 
the competitive environment in which we operate; 
changes in governmental regulation and administrative practices;

 
 
  our dependence on key personnel; 
 
conflicts of interest of our directors and officers; 
  our ability to fully implement our business plan; 
  our ability to effectively manage our growth; and 
  other regulatory, legislative and judicial developments.
We advise the reader that these cautionary remarks expressly qualify in their entirety all forward-looking statements 
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. Important factors that you should also consider, include, but are 
not  limited  to,  the  factors  discussed  under  “Risk  Factors”  in  our  annual  report  on  Form 10-K  for  the  fiscal  year 
ended February 28, 2014 filed with the SEC on June 13, 2014.
The forward-looking statements in this quarterly report are made as of the date of this quarterly report and we do not 
intend or undertake to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results, 
except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States.

Financial Statements
PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Passport Potash Inc. (sometimes referred to as 
“we”, “us” or “our Company”) are included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q:
It is the opinion of management that the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three and nine 
months ended November 30, 2014 and 2013 include all adjustments necessary in order to ensure that the unaudited 
interim consolidated financial statements are not misleading.  These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all 
adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of 
operations  and  cash  flows  for  the  interim  periods  presented  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.    Except  where  noted,  these  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial 
statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as our Company’s audited annual 
financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2014.  All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These 
unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  our  Company’s  audited 
annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 28, 2014.

Passport Potash Inc. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements ‐ unaudited 
(Expressed in United States dollars) 
For the nine months ended November 30, 2014 
 
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 
Passport Potash Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 11, 1987. The Company’s corporate jurisdiction 
is the province of British Columbia, Canada.  The Company is engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral 
properties.  The Company’s shares are listed on the TSX‐Venture Exchange (“TSX‐V”). 
 
The  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  included  herein  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  for  interim  financial  information  and  with  the 
instructions to Form 10‐Q and Regulation S‐X. They do not include all information and notes required by generally 
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has 
been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial for the year ended February 28, 
2014. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary 
for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended November 30, 2014, are 
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or the entire year. For 
further information, these unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in 
conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2014 
included in the Company’s Form 10‐K.  
 
The Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance 
with  US  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  which  contemplates  the  realization  of  assets  and 
discharge  of  liabilities  and  commitments  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  Company  is  in  the  exploration 
stage.  It  has  not  generated  operating  revenues  to  date,  and  has  accumulated  losses  of  $59,684,608  since 
inception.  The Company has funded its operations through the issuance of capital stock and debt.   In the longer 
term, the Company will also need to repay outstanding convertible debentures if these are not converted which 
have a maturity date of August 19, 2016.  At November 30, 2014, the Company had cash of $2,344 and a working 
capital  deficit  of  $2,430,366.  Management  plans  to  raise  additional  funds  through  equity  and/or  debt 
financings.  There is no certainty that further funding will be available as needed.  These factors raise substantial 
doubt  about  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  continue  operating  as  a  going  concern.  The  Company’s  ability  to 
continue its operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of its assets, and discharge its liabilities in the 
normal course of business is dependent upon its ability to raise new capital sufficient to fund its commitments and 
ongoing losses, and ultimately on generating profitable operations.

in the amount of $350,000 with the Court as security for the preliminary injunction, which was disclosed on the 
balance sheet as an injunction bond.  During the year ended February 28, 2014, the injunction bond was returned 
to  the  Company.    On  September  10,  2012,  the  court  granted  the  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction,  which 
enjoined the optionors from terminating the Ringbolt option agreement based upon the grounds alleged by the 
optionors.   
 
On October 30, 2012 the Company entered into an amended option agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) to

which shall accrue and be payable on the earlier of the Maturity Date, or the date the entire principal amount of 
the  convertible  debentures  is  converted  (the  “Tranche  I  Debentures”).  The  principal  amount  of  the  Tranche  I 
Debentures is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of the holder, in whole or in

In  addition,  2.5  common  share  purchase  warrants  were  issued  for  each  US$1.00  of  principal  amount  of  the 
Tranche I Debentures, entitling the holder to acquire one share of common stock of the Company for each warrant

Option Pricing Model with the following assumptions: Expected dividend yield – 0; Expected stock price volatility – 
76%; Risk‐free interest rate – 1.07%; Expected life – 1 year.   
 
The proceeds were allocated to the Tranche I Debentures and the warrants based on their relative fair values and 
accordingly,  $3,827,098  was  allocated  to  the  debentures  and  $1,478,442  was  allocated  to  the  warrants  and 
recorded as a reduction in the liability and an increase in additional paid‐in capital.   
 
In accordance with ASC 470‐20 “Debt with Conversion and Other Options”, the Company recognized the value of 
the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $2,316,159. This value was recorded as a reduction of the liability

Maturity Date, or the date the entire principal amount of each debenture is converted. The principal amount of 
the debentures is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at the option of the holder, in whole or 
in  part,  at  a  price  of  US$0.38  per  share  until  the  Maturity  Date.  The  Debentures  are  secured  by  a  first  ranking

We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral resource 
properties.  We  currently  have  an  interest  in  or  have  the  right  to  earn  an  interest  in  seven  properties:  Southwest 
Exploration  Property,  Twin  Butte  Ranch,  Sweetwater/American  Potash,  Mesa  Uranium,  Joint  Exploration 
Agreement with the Hopi Tribe, Fitzgerald Ranch and Joint Exploration Agreement with HNZ Potash, which are all

jurisdictions of incorporation.
Mineral Properties/Agreements
Southwest Exploration Property
On September 30, 2008 we entered into a mineral property option agreement (the “Southwest Option Agreement”) 
with Southwest Exploration Inc. (“Southwest”) to acquire an undivided 100% interest in 13 Arizona State Land 
Department exploration permits (“ASLD Exploration Permits”) comprising 8,413.3 acres (3,404.76 ha) of mineral 
exploration property located in Navajo County, in the Holbrook Basin, Arizona. Under the terms of the Southwest 
Option Agreement, any after acquired permits within the area of common interest may be made part of the property. 
Pursuant  to  this  clause,  32 additional  ASLD  Exploration  Permits  were  made  part  of  the  property  for  a  total  of 
45 ASLD Exploration Permits.
Under  the  terms  of  the  Southwest  Option  Agreement,  as  amended,  we  could  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the 
Southwest mining claims, subject to a 1% NSR retained by Southwest, in exchange for the following considerations:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
$100,000 on execution of the agreement (paid);
1,000,000 options (issued) upon receipt of TSX-V approval of the agreement;
$125,000  from  90 days  following  issuance  of  a  drilling  permit  from  the  Arizona  State  Land 
Department. This permit was received on June 11, 2009 and $125,000 was paid July 23, 2009;
250,000 shares on April 1, 2009 (issued);
2,681,000 shares on October 1, 2009 (issued);

(j)
5,000,000 shares on November 1, 2010 (issued);
$350,000 from six months following TSX-V approval of the issuance of 5,000,000 shares (paid);
Funding  of  $200,000  in  exploration  expenditures  pursuant  to  the  completion  of  a  NI 43-101 
technical report (completed);
250,000 shares upon completion of a NI 43-101 technical report after drilling (issued); and
Southwest shall retain a 1% NSR (purchased by the Company).
Currently, we have a blanket bond with the Arizona State Land Department in the amount of $15,000 for the ASLD 
Exploration Permits. In addition, we also have a bond with the Arizona Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in 
the amount of $55,000 for drilling permits.
We entered into an amendment to the Southwest Option Agreement, dated September 18, 2009, whereby the parties 
agreed to settle the October 1, 2009 scheduled cash payment of $225,000 with the issuance of 2,681,000 shares of 
the Company.
We entered into a second amendment to the Southwest Option Agreement, dated April 1, 2010, whereby the parties 
agreed  to  extend  the  due  date  for  the  payment  of  $250,000  to  Southwest  until  October 1,  2010.  As  we  had  not 
satisfied this payment obligation by October 1, 2010, we issued 5,000,000 shares of our common stock to Southwest 
on November 8, 2010 in full satisfaction of the outstanding payment.
We completed the exercise of our option to purchase the 100% interest in the Southwest claims and the purchase of 
the  1%  net  smelter  royalty  in  an  agreement  dated  February  13,  2012.  The  Southwest  permits  are  held  by  PPI 
Holding Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary.
Twin Buttes Ranch Property
On  August 28,  2009,  as  amended,  we  entered  into  a  four-year  lease  with  an  option  to  purchase  (the  “Lease  & 
Option Agreement”) with Twin Buttes Ranch, LLC respecting the Twin Buttes Ranch located in the potash-bearing 
Holbrook Basin of east-central Arizona. The Twin Buttes Ranch comprises some 28,526 acres (11,544 hectares) of 
private deeded land with 76.7% or approximately 21,894 acres (8,860 hectares) overlying the potash horizons within 
the Holbrook Basin.
Under the terms of the Lease & Option Agreement, we may acquire a 100% undivided interest in the deeded land 
and  sub-surface  mineral  rights  comprising  the  Twin  Buttes  Ranch  property  by  making  lease  payments  totaling 
$1,250,000 over five and a half years and, upon exercising our option to purchase, by paying $20,000,000 for the 
entire Twin Buttes Ranch including all sub-surface mineral rights except those pertaining to oil and gas, petrified 
wood and geothermal resources.  There are no royalties associated with the sub-surface mineral rights.
On  December 4,  2009,  we  entered  into  an  amendment  to  the  Lease  &  Option  Agreement  whereby  we  signed  a 
mining lease with Twin Buttes Ranch, LLC on the Twin Buttes Ranch with a term from December 4, 2009 through 
August 28, 2013 subject to early termination as provided in the Lease & Option Agreement. Under the mining lease, 
we are entitled to explore, develop, mine, remove, treat and produce all ores, minerals and metals on Twin Buttes 
Ranch solely for the purpose of determining the existence of potash and the economic feasibility of the purchase and 
development of the property. In consideration, we shall remain current in our option payments under the Lease & 
Option Agreement and keep all terms of the Lease & Option Agreement in good standing.
On September 7, 2010, we amended the terms of the Lease & Option Agreement to provide for an extension of a 
portion of the initial cash payment until December 1, 2010.
On August 20, 2013, we further amended the Lease & Option Agreement to extend the term of the option agreement 
from August 28, 2013 to January 6, 2016 and provide for the payments of:
LEGAL_23309662.3
9
(a)
(b)
(c)
$250,000 on the earlier of (i) within 30 days of closing our next round of financing which is a 
minimum  $5  million,  or  (ii) December 1,  2013  (this  payment  obligation  survives  any  early 
termination of the Lease & Option Agreement by us or a termination resulting from an uncured 
breach by us),
$250,000 on August 28, 2014; and
$250,000 on May 1, 2015.
Concurrently with the amendment to the Lease & Option Agreement, we also amended the mining lease to provide 
that the term of the lease will end on the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease & Option Agreement, except 
in the event that we exercise our option pursuant to the Lease & Option Agreement in which event the term shall end 
on the closing date of the Lease & Option Agreement, and any subsequent amendments thereto.
Details of the payments under the Lease & Option Agreement, as amended, are as follows:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)
(h)
A payment of $50,000 and $10,000 legal costs on or before November 26, 2009 (paid);
A payment of $25,000 on September 17, 2010 (paid);
A payment of $75,000 on December 1, 2010 (paid);
A payment of $150,000 on August 28, 2011 (paid);
A payment of $200,000 on August 28, 2012 (paid);
A payment of $250,000 on the earlier of (a) within 30 days of closing our next round of financing 
which is a minimum $5 million, or (b) December 1, 2013 (not paid);
A payment of $250,000 on August 28, 2014 (not paid); and
A payment of $250,000 on May 1, 2015.
The Company has not made the required $250,000 payments that were due on December 1, 2013 and August 28, 
2014; therefore, there are past-due payment obligations.  On April 17, 2014, we were served a notice of breach that 
we  did  not  remedy  within  30  days.    Therefore,  Twin  Buttes  Ranch,  LLC  may  now  terminate  the  option  at  its 
discretion, which would also terminate the Lease, however, we have not received notice of termination from Twin 
Buttes  Ranch, LLC.   We  are  continuing negotiations  to  either  amend  the  Option Agreement  or  enter  into  a new 
option agreement, however, the risk remains that we may not be successful in completing either an amendment to 
the Option Agreement or entering into a new option agreement.
The  Option  Agreement  currently  provides  that  upon  exercise  to  purchase  the  entire  Twin  Butte  Ranch,  we  must 
deliver a certified cheque in the amount of $1,000 on or before 5pm (Arizona time), January 6, 2016 (the option 
expiry date), followed by a payment of $19,999,000 within thirty days.
Sweetwater/American Potash Property
On  November 12,  2010  we  entered  into  an  option  of  Arizona  exploration  leases  (the  “Sweetwater  Option 
Agreement”)  with  Sweetwater  River  Resources,  LLC  (“Sweetwater”)  and  American  Potash,  LLC  (“American 
Potash”) to acquire the right, title and interest in five mineral exploration permits within the Holbrook Basin. The 
five permits consist of Arizona State Land Department exploration permits that cover more than 3,200 acres.
Pursuant to the terms of the Sweetwater Option Agreement, we could acquire a 100% interest in the exploration 
permits for the consideration of: (i) issuing 500,000 shares of our common stock by December 15, 2010; (ii) cash 
payment  of  CAD$90,000  payable  in  three  installments  of  $30,000  each  at  12 months,  18 months  and  24 months
LEGAL_23309662.3
10
from  the  date  of  signing  the  Sweetwater  Option  Agreement;  and  (iii)  meeting  the  exploration  expenditures  a 
required by the Arizona State Land Department.  We are responsible for payment of all exploration expenditures on 
the permits.  Pursuant to the Sweetwater Option Agreement, the property was subject to a 2% net smelter royalty in 
favor of American Potash which we had the option to purchase at a price of $150,000 for 1% or $300,000 for the 
full 2%.
On  March 27,  2012,  we  completed  the  exercise  of  the  option  under  the  Sweetwater  Option  Agreement  and  the 
repurchase of the 2% NSR royalty in respect of the Sweetwater exploration permits.  The permits are held by PPI 
Holding Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary.
Mesa Uranium Property
On August 31, 2010 we entered into a mineral property option agreement (the “Mesa Option Agreement”) with 
Mesa  Uranium  Corp.  (“Mesa”)  in  respect  of  three  Arizona  State  Land  Department  exploration  permits  covering 
approximately 1,950 acres, which are wholly owned by Mesa. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we had the 
right  to  acquire  a  75%  interest  in  the  Mesa  permits  in  consideration  for  the  issuance  of  500,000  shares  of  our 
common  stock  to  Mesa,  the  payment  of  $20,000.00  cash  to  Mesa  and  meeting  the  minimum  exploration 
expenditures as required by the Arizona State Land Department. Upon earning a 75% interest in the permits, we had 
the right to acquire the remaining 25% interest in the Mesa permits by paying $100,000 in cash, stock equivalent or 
work  expenditures.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  we  are  responsible  for  payment  of  all  exploration 
expenditures  on  the  leases.  The  property  was  subject  to  a  2%  net  smelter  royalty  which  we  had  the  option  to 
purchase at a price of $150,000 per 1% or $300,000 for the full 2%.
On February 13, 2012, we exercised our option to acquire a 75% interest in the Mesa permits. On March 9, 2012, we 
announced that we had exercised our option to acquire the remaining 25% interest in the Mesa properties under the 
Mesa  Option Agreement  and  to  acquire  the 2% NSR on  those properties  thereby  acquiring  a royalty-free, 100% 
interest in the Mesa properties. The permits are held by PPI Holding Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary.
Ringbolt Property
On  March 28,  2011  we  entered  into  an  option  agreement  (the  “Ringbolt  Option  Agreement”)  with  Ringbolt 
Ventures Ltd., Potash Green, LLC, Wendy Walker Tibbetts and Joseph J. Hansen (collectively, the “Optionor”) 
pursuant to which we acquired the right to acquire a 100% interest in the Ringbolt potash property located in the 
Holbrook Basin of southeast Arizona. The Ringbolt property is comprised of 15,994.32 acres of mineral exploration 
permits on land managed by the Arizona State Land Department.
Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  Ringbolt  Option  Agreement,  we  may  acquire  a  90%  interest  in  the  property  by: 
(i) making  cash  payments  totaling  $1.0  million  ($50,000  upon  execution  of  the  agreement,  $250,000  upon  TSX 
Venture Exchange approval, $350,000 on or before the 1st anniversary of TSX Venture Exchange approval, and 
$350,000 on or before the 2nd anniversary of TSX Venture Exchange approval), (ii) incurring a total of $2.25 million 
in  exploration expenditures  on  the  property  over  three  years  ($500,000 within 1  year of TSX  Venture  Exchange 
approval, $750,000 within 1 year of the 1st anniversary of TSX Venture Exchange approval, and $1,000,000 within 
1 year of the 2nd anniversary of TSX Venture Exchange approval), and (iii) issuing four million common shares over 
a three-year period (1,000,000 shares upon TSX Venture Exchange approval, 1,400,000 shares on or before the 1st 
anniversary  of  TSX  Venture  Exchange  approval,  and  1,600,000  shares  on  or  before  the  2nd  anniversary  of  TSX 
Venture Exchange approval). Upon satisfaction of these terms, we will have the right to purchase the remaining 10% 
interest  for  a  cash  payment  of  $5 million,  which  shall  remain  exercisable  until  the  Ringbolt  property  goes  into 
commercial production (defined as the sale of any mineral products from the property). In addition, pursuant to the 
Ringbolt Option Agreement, the Ringbolt property will be subject to a 1% gross overriding royalty on production 
from the property.
On October 30, 2012, as part of a settlement agreement between us and the Optionor, we entered into an amendment 
agreement to the Ringbolt Option Agreement pursuant to which we will pay to the Optionor a total of $3,850,000, 
$150,000  of  which  was  paid  upon  execution  of  the  amendment  agreement,  $2,450,000  will  be  paid  upon  TSX 
Ventures Exchange approval of the amendment agreement, and the remaining $1,250,000 on or before October 31, 
2014. In addition, upon TSX Venture Exchange approval of the amendment agreement, we will issue 750,000 shares
LEGAL_23309662.3
11
of common stock to the Optionor and the Optionor will assign to us all of its right, title and interest in and to the 
property  and  will  take  all  necessary  action  with  the  ASLD  to  effect  such  assignment.  The  cash  payment  of 
$2,450,000 and 750,000 shares of our common stock will be placed into escrow and will be released to the Optionor 
upon  receipt  of  confirmation  of  the  assignment  of  the  property  to  us  from  the  ASLD.  There  will  be  no  royalty 
attached to the transferred mineral exploration permits.
Should  we  sell  or  in  any  way  transfer  our  interest  in  the  property,  the  Optionor  will  receive  20%  of  the  gross 
consideration in excess of $30 million to a maximum of $2,000,000 if the aggregate consideration received for the 
transfer of the interest in the property is greater than $30 million and less than $40 million; or $2,000,000 plus 10% 
of the gross consideration in excess of $40 million to a maximum of $1,000,000 if the aggregate consideration is 
greater than $40 million and less than $50 million; or $3,000,000 plus 20% of the gross consideration in excess of 
$50 million if the aggregate consideration is greater than $50 million.
If we sell or transfer less than a 100% interest in the property, then the aforementioned bonus payments shall be 
ratably reduced by multiplying the bonus payment by the percentage of interest subject to the transfer transaction. 
The sale or transfer of the remainder of the interest in the property held by us will continue to be subject to the 
aforementioned bonus payment provisions.
On December 8, 2012, we entered into a second amendment agreement with the Optionor to amend the amendment 
agreement  to  extend  the  deadline  to  make  the  cash  payment  of  $2,450,000  following  TSX  Venture  Exchange 
approval for a period of 30 days from the date of final approval with a payment of $100,000 to Potash Green, LLC, 
which payment will be deducted from the aggregate payment owed.
The amendment agreement and the second amendment agreement to the Ringbolt Option Agreement were approved 
by  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  on  February 27,  2013,  and  all  payments  except  the  $1,250,000  that  was  due  on 
October 31, 2014, have been paid.
According to the terms of the Ringbolt Option Agreement, we had the right at any time to abandon the option with 
written  notice  to  the  Optionors,  which  we  provided  such  notice  to  abandon  the  option  on  October  20,  2014.  
Therefore, we have no further obligations under the Ringbolt Option Agreement to make any option payments.
Cooperative Agreement and Joint Exploration Agreement with The Hopi Tribe
Portions of our Holbrook Basin potash project in Arizona are located adjacent to land privately owned by the Hopi 
Tribe. On March 8, 2011 we finalized a cooperative agreement with the Hopi Tribe which establishes a cooperative 
arrangement between us and the Hopi Tribe and gives us access across the privately owned Hopi lands to conduct 
exploration activities while allowing the Tribe to share in our study results. We are in continuing discussions with 
the Hopi Tribe on the project.
On  November 8,  2012,  but  having  an  effective  date  of  November 1,  2012,  we  and  The  Hopi  Tribe,  a  federally 
recognized Indian Tribe, entered into a Joint Exploration Agreement (the ”JEA”) pursuant to which the parties agree 
to explore the Hopi land sections (the “Hopi Property”) which are checker-boarded with our southern landholdings 
in  accordance  with  an  exploration  program,  which  shall  consist  of  a  two-phase  drilling  campaign  as  set  out  in 
Exhibit 2  to  the  JEA.  The  first  phase  of  the  exploration  program  will  include  8 drill  sites  and  will  cover  a 
25,000 acre swath of the contiguous land sections in the DoBell ranch area of the Holbrook Basin. The second phase 
of drilling, which will be designed by ERCOSPLAN guided from the results from phase one, will include up to 
10 additional drill sites. We will be responsible for all costs, charges and expenses incurred in connection with the 
exploration program.
In addition, under the JEA, we shall indemnify, defend, release, and hold harmless The Hopi Tribe and its elected 
officials, advisors and contractors, employees, agents, lessees, insurers, successors and assigns (the “Indemnities”) 
for, against and from any claim, damage, lien, loss, cost, charge, expense (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) or 
liability  resulting  from,  or  caused  by,  or  incurred  in  connection  with,  or  alleged  to  have  resulted  from,  or  been 
caused by, or been incurred in connection with, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the exploration program. 
Our payment and indemnity obligations shall survive the termination of the JEA.
LEGAL_23309662.3
12
Pursuant  to  the  JEA,  the  Hopi  Tribe  grants  us  and  our  contractors,  which  includes  any  employee  or  contractor

Fitzgerald Ranch Property
On May 7, 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with co-trustees of the Fitzgerald Living Trust (“Fitzgerald 
Living Trust”) to acquire real estate covering a total of 41,000 contiguous acres of royalty-free private land (the 
“Fitzgerald Ranch”) located near Holbrook and adjacent to our Twin Buttes Ranch holdings in the Holbrook Basin 
in exchange for a total purchase price of $15,000,000 on the following material terms: (i) $250,000 to be irrevocably

On November 8, 2012, we entered into an amendment agreement to the original property purchase agreement. In 
accordance with the amendment agreement, in addition to our payment of an aggregate of $500,000 made by July 1, 
2012,  payments  of  $500,000  and  $4,000,000  were  to  be  made  to  Fitzgerald  Living  Trust  upon  execution  of  the 
amendment  agreement  and  on  December 18,  2012,  respectively,  which  December 18,  2012  payment  has  not  yet 
been made. Additionally, a payment of $5,000,000 will be irrevocably paid to Fitzgerald Living Trust on June 30, 
2013  and  the  balance  of  $5,000,000  will  be  paid  at  the  time  of  closing  of  the  sale  which  will  take  place  on 
December 18, 2013.
We also agreed to reimburse Fitzgerald Living Trust for any increase in taxes to it which are attributable to closing 
this sale in 2013 rather than 2012 and to make this reimbursement within 120 days from the date Fitzgerald Living 
Trust provides documentation to us of the increased tax amount.
On  May 29,  2013,  we  entered  into  an  agreement  to  amend  and  restate  the  agreement  to  the  original  property 
purchase agreement (the “Amended and Restated Agreement”) with Fitzgerald Living Trust for the purchase of 
the Fitzgerald Ranch, which also supersedes the amendment agreement dated November 8, 2012, as follows:
(a)
the  purchase  price  has  been  increased  to  $17,000,000,  of  which  $1,000,000  was  paid  and  the 
balance is to be paid as follows:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
a payment of $500,000 on the earlier of October 31, 2013, or within 30 days of closing 
our next financing (not paid);
a payment of $500,000 to be paid on December 31, 2013 (not paid);
a payment of $1,000,000 to be paid on December 31, 2014 (not paid); and
the balance of $14,000,000 to be paid on the closing of the sale which is on or before 
June 15, 2015;
(b)
(c)
we  have  provided  Fitzgerald  Living  Trust  with  the  option  to  enter  into  a  grazing  lease  on  the 
property at the rate currently being charged by the Petrified Forest National Park, with the period 
of  the  lease  being  5  years,  with  the  option  to  renew  for  an  additional  5  year  term.  The  parties 
agreed that any ranching use of the property is secondary, and subject to mineral exploration and 
development;
during the term of the Amended and Restated Agreement, Fitzgerald Living Trust grants to us the 
right to enter into and on the property as set forth in the agreement to explore for, develop, core 
drill and sample ores, minerals and metals which are or may be found therein or thereon; provided 
however, that such ores, minerals and metals may only be removed, treated and produced in de 
minimus amounts from the core borings, solely for the purpose of determining the saturation and 
existence of such ores, minerals and metals and in no event shall we be permitted to sell any such 
ores, minerals or metals; and
(d)
the construction of roads shall be subject to the prior written approval of Fitzgerald Living Trust, 
which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld and shall be given in a timely manner.
We have not made the required $500,000 payments that were due on October 31, 2013 and December 31, 2013 and 
the  $1,000,000  due  on  December  31,  2014;  therefore,  the  Amended  and  Restated  Agreement  is  past-due  and 
$975,000 capitalized to long-term deposits has been written-off as at the year ended February 28, 2014.  We are in 
continuing  negotiations  to  either  amend  the  Amended  and  Restated  Agreement  or  entire  into  a  new  purchase 
agreement.  No default notice has been issued under the Amended and Restated Agreement but the risk remains that 
we may not be successful in completing either an amendment to the Amended and Restated Agreement or entering 
into a new purchase agreement.
The Amended and Restated Agreement is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.

Joint Exploration Agreement with HNZ Potash, LLC
On  July 27,  2012,  we  entered  into  a  Joint  Exploration  Agreement  (the  “Agreement”)  with  HNZ  Potash,  LLC 
(“HNZ”)  to  jointly  explore  and  potentially  develop  twenty-one  permitted  parcels  in  which  we  hold  ASLD 
exploration permits and which are located on the southernmost area of our landholdings (the ”Permit Property”). 
The Permit Property is within HNZ’s private landholdings and has not been previously explored by us. Under the 
terms of the Agreement, HNZ has agreed to pay us 50% of certain costs previously incurred by us with respect to 
the Permit Property, which payment was received by us during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 and we have 
assigned a 50% interest in the Permit Property to HNZ. Each of the parties will be liable for 50% of the future costs 
relating  to  the  permits.    Our  interest  in  the  permits  are  held  by  PPI  Holding  Corporation,  our  wholly  owned 
subsidiary.
The purposes of the Agreement are to: (i) conduct exploration and to evaluate the potential for development and 
mining of the Permit Property; (ii) to acquire interests within the lands owned by the Hopi Tribe commonly referred 
to as the Dobell Ranch lands as more particularly described in the Agreement; (iii) if justified by the exploration 
activities,  the  parties  upon  mutual  agreement  will  form  an  entity  to  seek  a  mining  lease  to  jointly  engage  in 
development  and  mining  of  the  Permit  Property;  (iv) to  complete  and  satisfy  all  environmental  compliance 
obligations and continuing obligations affecting the Permit Property; and (v) to perform any other activity necessary, 
appropriate, or incidental to any of the foregoing. During the term of the Agreement, the parties will equally share 
the costs for maintaining the Permit Property in good standing with the ASLD. The parties may, either alone or 
jointly, conduct exploration of any or all of the Permit Property pursuant to one or more plans of exploration.
The term of the Agreement shall begin on the effective date of the Agreement and extend to the expiration of the 
fifth year term of the last permit covered by the Agreement, or any permit obtained as a replacement therefor (the 
“Term”);  provided, however,  that,  if  during  the  Term  the  participants  (or  any  entity  formed  by  the  participants) 
jointly  apply  for  a  mineral  lease  or  mineral  leases  on  any  portion  of  the  Permit  Property,  the  Term  shall  be 
automatically  extended  to  the  date  a  final  determination  is  issued  by  the  ASLD  regarding  the  last  mineral  lease 
application.
Other provisions in the Agreement include the following:
  The  parties  will  provide  to  each  other  existing  exploration  data  from  their  Holbrook  Basin  potash 
exploration activities. The data provided by each Party may be used by the other party to update their 
existing or future resource reports or any other future reports.
  The  parties  will  provide  each  other  vehicular  access  across  existing  paved  and  unpaved  roads  on
  The parties have established an area of mutual interest and have agreed to jointly pursue opportunities
property controlled by the other party.
within this area.
Additional Exploration Permits
On  May 30,  2013,  we  announced  that  we  had  received  nine  new  exploration  permits  from  the  ASLD,  adding 
4,703.66 acres of Arizona State trust land to our land package. These additional permits are on Arizona State trust 
land sections that had been closed to development related to the proposed expansion of the Petrified Forest National 
Park.  Seven  of  the  sections  lie  within  our  private  landholdings,  while  the  other  two  border  the  Hopi  Property 
development area and abut the south border of the Petrified Forest National Park.  Almost all of these permits are 
held by PPI West Block Holding Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, with a few permits being held by PPI Holding 
Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary.
Employees
As at November 30, 2014, we have one employee, however, we have 10 individuals working on a consulting basis. 
Our operations are managed by our officers with input from our directors. We engage geological and engineering 
consultants  from  time  to  time  as  required  to  assist  in  evaluating  our  property  interests  and  recommending  and 
conducting work programs.

  Administration expenses were $12,657 and $15,036 for the three month periods ended November 30, 2014

November 30, 2013, respectively. The increase in foreign exchange gain of $8,333 was due to fluctuations 
in the USD and CAD exchange rate and the translation of non-monetary assets.  
Investor relations expenses were $21,514 and $72,963 for the three month periods ended November 30, 
2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to cost saving efforts during the

  Management fees were $160,409 and $163,123 for the three month periods ended November 30, 2014 and 
November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in management fees was mainly due to less management 
fees paid during the three month period ended November 30, 2014, compared to the three month period 
ended November 30, 2013.
  Mineral property impairment costs were $Nil and $Nil for the three month periods ended November 30,

periods  ended  November  30,  2014  and  November  30,  2013,  respectively.  The  decrease  was  due  to  the 
Company incurring less exploration costs during the three month period ended November 30, 2014.
  Office and miscellaneous expenses were $17,433 and $25,545 for the three month periods ended November 
30, 2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease was due to the decrease in operating activities 
during the three month period ended November 30, 2014.
  Professional fees were $24,605 and $18,779 for the three month periods ended November 30, 2014 and 
November 30, 2013, respectively. The increase was mainly due to a decrease in provision for audit fees and

2014  and  November  30,  2013,  respectively.  The  decrease  was  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  services  being 
provided by the transfer agent during the three month period ended November 30, 2014, compared to the 
three month period ended November 30, 2013.
Other Items  
During the three month period ended November 30, 2014, our other items accounted for $258,804 in expenses as 
compared to $1,196,704 in expenses for the three month period ended November 30, 2013. The significant changes 
in other items income (expenses) are outlined as follows:
  Accretion expense was $103,008 and $1,035,052 for the three month periods ended November 30, 2014
and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in accretion expense was mainly due to the lower 
values of discount on debenture and beneficial conversion feature upon conversion of debentures and the 
longer term, for accretion of the beneficial conversion feature and accretion of the discount in connection 
with the convertible debentures, which resulted in a decrease in the accretion during the three month period 
ended November 30, 2014, compared to the three month period ended November 30, 2013.
  Change in fair value of derivative liability was $2,725 and $54,711 for the three month periods ended
November 30, 2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. The change in fair value of derivative liability 
was due to a decrease in the outstanding term of the warrants denominated in Canadian dollars which 
resulted in a decrease in the derivative liability in the three month period ended November 30, 2014, 
compared to the three month period ended November 30, 2013. 
Interest income was $Nil and $Nil for the three month periods ended November 30, 2014 and November 
30, 2013, respectively.  There were no funds invested in interest bearing instruments during the three month

Interest expense on convertible debentures was $158,521 and $216,363 for the three month periods ended 
November 30, 2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due 
to the lower interest rate during the three month period, for charging interest in connection with the 
convertible debentures, which resulted in a decrease in the interest expense on convertible debentures in the 
three month period ended November 30, 2014, compared to the three month period ended November 30, 
2013.

  Gain on debt settlement and other income was $Nil and $Nil for the three month periods ended November 
30, 2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. There were no activities in debt settlement or other income

The net loss was $644,427 and $2,112,174 for the three month periods ended November 30, 2014 and November 30, 
2013,  respectively.  The  decrease  in  net  loss  of  $1,467,747  resulted  from  the  decrease  in  operating  expenses  of

and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease of $58,739 was mainly due to $42,286 in stock based

  Accretion expense was $312,777 and $3,111,452 for the nine month periods ended November 30, 2014 and 
November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in accretion expense was mainly due to the lower values of 
discount on debenture and beneficial conversion feature upon conversion of debentures and the longer 
term, for accretion of the beneficial conversion feature and accretion of the discount in connection with the 
convertible debentures, which resulted in a decrease in the accretion during the nine month period ended

November 30, 2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due 
to the lower interest rate during the nine month period, for charging interest in connection with the

nine month period ended November 30, 2014, compared to the nine month period ended November 30, 
2013.
  Gain on debt settlement and other income was $Nil and $Nil for the nine month periods ended November

At November 30, 2014, we had an aggregate of 15,037,363 (2013: 25,484,073) share purchase warrants exercisable, 
561,013  for  CAD$0.50  per  share  and  14,476,350  for  USD$0.12  (2013:  10,956,782  between  CAD$0.40  and 
CAD$0.50) per share and (2013: 14,527,291 for USD$0.38 per share), which have the potential upon exercise to

November  30,  2014,  a  total  of  9,166,812  (2013:  9,166,812)  stock  options  exercisable  between  CAD$0.10  and 
CAD$1.18  (USD$0.09  and  USD$1.03)  per  share  which  have  the  potential  upon  exercise  to  generate  a  total  of 
approximately CAD$5,227,542 (2013: CAD$5,463,442) in cash over the next 3.5 years. There is no assurance that 
these securities will be exercised.
Deficit accumulated since inception of exploration stage increased from ($43,871,806) as at February 28, 2014 to 
($46,169,790) as at November 30, 2014.
Our plan of operations over the next twelve months is to focus on the following:
  Renegotiate the terms of the Fitzgerald Living Trust Agreement which will require approximately
$1,000,000.
$1,000,000.
  Renegotiate the terms of the Twin Buttes Ranch property, which will require a payment of approximately
  Completion of Phase 1 of our planned exploration program which requires approximately $7,500,000.
Therefore, based on the above, we anticipate that we will require a total of approximately $9,500,000 for our plan of 
operations over the next twelve months. At November 30, 2014, we had cash of $2,344 and a working capital deficit 
of $2,430,366. During the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will not generate any revenue. Accordingly, we 
will be required to obtain additional equity financing in order to pursue our plan of operations for and beyond the 
next twelve months. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding 
from the sale of our common stock to fund our exploration programs, property acquisitions and repayment of debt 
going forward. In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue our planned property acquisitions 
and  possibly  our  anticipated  exploration  programs  and  our  business  plan  may  fail.  Even  if  we  are  successful  in 
obtaining financing to fund our exploration program, there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary 
to complete our planned property acquisitions.

($2,182,120)  in  the nine  month period  ended  November  30,  2013.  Significant  changes  in  cash used  in  operating 
activities are outlined as follows:

2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in loss was due to a decrease in the operating 
expenses and a decrease in losses of other items.

November 30, 2013:
  Accretion was $312,777 and $3,111,452 in the nine month periods ended November 30, 2014 and

warrants was a result of the decrease in the number and the term of the outstanding warrants denominated 
in Canadian dollars which resulted in a decrease in the derivative liability in the nine month period ended 
November 30, 2014 as compared to the nine month period ended November 30, 2013.

outstanding warrants at an exercise price of $0.12 and CAD$0.50 per share.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally 
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We  regularly  evaluate  the  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  use  to  prepare  our  financial  statements.  In 
general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, 
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates made by management.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Mineral Property Expenditures
We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-
Mining,” when management has determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash 
inflows  have  been  identified  and  adequate  financial  resources  are  available  or  are  expected  to  be  available  as 
required to meet the terms of property acquisition and budgeted exploration and development expenditures. Mineral 
property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred if the criteria for capitalization are not met. In the event that 
mineral  property  acquisition costs  are  paid with  Company  shares,  those shares  are  recorded  at  the  estimated  fair 
value at the time the shares are due in accordance with the terms of the property agreements.
LEGAL_23309662.3
23
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
When  it  has  been  determined  that  a  mineral  property  can  be  economically  developed  as  a  result  of  establishing 
proven and probable reserves and pre-feasibility, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.
Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are provided over the life of proven reserves 
on a units-of-production basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, 
are estimated each period by management based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology 
and  industry  standards.  Any  charge  is  included  in  exploration  expense  or  the  provision  for  depletion  and 
depreciation  during  the  period  and  the  actual  restoration  expenditures  are  charged  to  the  accumulated  provision 
amounts as incurred.
As of the date of these financial statements, we have incurred property acquisition costs that have been capitalized 
and property option payments and exploration costs which have been expensed.
To date we have not established any proven or probable reserves on our mineral properties.
Stock-based Compensation
We  account  for  Stock-Based  Compensation  under  ASC  718  “Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation”,  which 
addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, 
with  a  primary  focus  on  transactions  in  which  an  entity  obtains  employee  services  in  share-based  payment 
transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award 
of  equity  instruments  based  on  the  grant-date  fair  value  of  the  award  (with  limited  exceptions).  Incremental 
compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized.
We account for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based 
Payments  to  Non-Employees.  Under  ASC  505-50,  we  determine  the  fair  value  of  the  warrants  or  stock-based 
compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity 
instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Any stock options or warrants issued to non-employees 
are recorded in expense and additional paid-in capital in shareholders’ equity/(deficit) over the applicable service 
periods using variable accounting through the vesting dates based on the fair value of the options or warrants at the 
end of each period.
The  value  of  the  common  stock  is  measured  at  the  earlier  of  (i)  the  date  at  which  a  firm  commitment  for 
performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty’s 
performance  is  complete.  We  recognized  consulting  expense  and  a  corresponding  increase  to  additional  paid-in-
capital related to stock issued for services.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and we plan to adopt those that are applicable to us. 
We do not expect the adoption of these pronouncements to have a material impact on our financial position, results 
of operations or cash flows.
Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We  are  exposed  in  varying  degrees  to  a  variety  of  financial  instrument  related  risks.  The  Board  of  Directors 
approves and monitors the risk management processes, inclusive of documented investment policies, counterparty 
limits, and controlling and reporting structures. The type of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is 
managed is provided as follows:
LEGAL_23309662.3
24
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other 
party to incur a financial loss. Our primary exposure to credit risk is on our cash and cash equivalents. As most of 
our cash and cash equivalents are held by the same bank there is a concentration of credit risk. This risk is managed 
by using a major Canadian banks that are high credit quality financial institutions as determined by rating agencies. 
Our secondary exposure to risk is on our other receivables. This risk is minimal as receivables consist primarily of 
refundable government goods and services taxes.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due. Our objective 
in  managing  liquidity  risk  is  to  maintain  sufficient  readily  available  capital  in  order  to  meet  our  liquidity 
requirements at any point in time. We achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and raising 
capital through debt and/or equity financing.
Historically, our sole source of funding has been the issuance of equity securities for cash, primarily through private 
placements.  Our  access  to  financing  is  always  uncertain.  There  can  be  no  assurance  of  continued  access  to 
significant equity funding.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that we will be subject to foreign currency fluctuations in satisfying obligations 
related to our foreign activities. We operate primarily in Canada and the United States and are consequently exposed 
to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in foreign currency. Fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange  rates  may  affect  our  results  of  operations.  We  manage  foreign  exchange  risk  by  closely  monitoring 
relevant exchange rates and when possible, executes currency exchange transactions at times when exchange rates 
are most advantageous for us. We do not use hedging to manage its foreign exchange risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our cash equivalents as these instruments 
have original maturities of three months or less and are therefore exposed to interest rate fluctuations on renewal.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed 
in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and 
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Joshua Bleak (being our principal 
executive  officer),  and  our  Chief  Financial  Officer,  Jeffrey  Kirk  (being  our  principal  financial  and  accounting 
officer),  to  allow  for  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  Our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  our  Chief 
Financial  Officer  are  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  for  our 
Company.
Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2014 
(under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer), 
pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As part of such 
evaluation, management considered the matters discussed below relating to internal control over financial reporting.
LEGAL_23309662.3
25
Based on this evaluation, our Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that 
our Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of November 30, 2014.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The term “internal control over financial reporting” is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, 
the  registrant’s  principal  executive  and  principal  financial  officers,  or  persons  performing  similar  functions,  and 
effected by the registrant’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant;
  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the registrant are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
and directors of the registrant; and
  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the registrant’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
A  material  weakness  is  defined  in  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  Auditing  Standard  No. 5  as  a 
significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that 
results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial 
statements will not be prevented or detected.
There  have  not  been  any  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  our  fiscal 
quarter ended November 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting.
