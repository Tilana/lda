<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, conducted an official mission to Somalia from 14 to 21 
October 2009 with the consent of, and after consultation with, the authorities. Pursuant to 
the Representative&#8217;s mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, he 
sought to examine the dynamics of displacement and the key challenges to the human 
rights of internally displaced persons and highlight to the international public and 
community the very difficult situation of the displaced in Somalia. 
</p>
<p> In the course of his mission, the Representative visited Puntland and Somaliland. He 
was unable to travel to south and central Somalia due to the security situation, but managed 
to interview internally displaced persons who had recently arrived from there. 
</p>
<p> The causes of the displacement of 1.5 million Somali internally displaced persons, 
the vast majority of whom are women and children, are diverse, the major reason being the 
high level of violence and general insecurity in many parts of south and central Somalia 
and natural disasters. Atrocities are committed by all actors engaged in hostilities in south 
and central Somalia in a climate of impunity. Addressing impunity and holding those 
responsible accountable for their action, in addition to ending the fighting in civilian areas

annexed to the summary, is being circulated in the language of submission only.

</p>
<p>are crucial elements in preventing further displacement. 
</p>
<p> During flight and in settlements, the internally displaced remain exposed to grave 
human rights abuses, in particular rape and domestic violence. Many of their rights and 
needs, including shelter, food, water, health care and education, remain unaddressed. The 
severe situation of malnourishment, in particular of children, in camps for internally 
displaced persons is of deep concern. Protracted displacement situations in all parts of 
Somalia are exacerbated by the influx of new arrivals. Existing humanitarian assistance is 
insufficient, because of a lack of humanitarian access as well as a lack of funds. At the 
same time, recovery and development efforts are needed to strengthen the resilience of the 
displaced and the absorption capacities of host communities and to find durable solutions 
for the displaced where this is possible. 
</p>
<p> The Representative urges all actors, including de facto authorities and armed groups 
with territorial control, to grant safe, timely, unconditional and unimpeded humanitarian 
access, in particular to ensure delivery of humanitarian goods to all those displaced. 
</p>
<p> Enhancing the protection of civilians and tackling impunity for atrocities, in 
particular in the context of armed hostilities, are imperative and it is essential to put in place 
appropriate mechanisms to start addressing impunity, justice and reconciliation with regard 
to past atrocities, including by considering &#8212; at an appropriate stage &#8212; the establishment 
of an independent commission of inquiry and/or referral of the situation to the International 
Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p> Further neglect by the international community will not only lead to a deterioration 
of the humanitarian crisis but will in itself contribute to the destabilization of the country. 
The Somali situation, albeit difficult, can be improved, but a greater degree of international 
attention is needed and intensified concerted efforts by all actors involved &#8212; authorities, 
humanitarian and development actors, human rights organizations and also the international 
community as a whole &#8212; are necessary. In particular, the Representative urges donors to 
provide substantial and sustained support to programmes aimed at improving assistance to 
and protection of the internally displaced, and to proactively embark on bringing robust 
recovery and development activities to areas of the country that are sufficiently stable for 
that to be feasible, in order to prevent the humanitarian and security situation from further 
deterioration.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, conducted an official mission to Somalia from 14 to 21 
October 2009 after consultation with the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and 
pursuant to his mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32. The 
Representative undertook this mission to get a first-hand impression of the situation of the 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia, to analyse the dynamics of displacement, 
identify key protection challenges and raise international awareness of the plight of IDPs in 
Somalia. The Representative&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are based on the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement,1<b> </b>which have been recognized by States as an important 
international framework for the protection of IDPs.2 
</p>
<p>2. In the course of his mission, the Representative visited Nairobi and consulted with 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia, the United Nations 
Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), United Nations agencies and other humanitarian 
organizations, as well as civil society representatives. He also visited Dadaab refugee camp 
in north-eastern Kenya and interviewed recent arrivals from south and central Somalia. He 
went to Puntland and Somaliland, visiting settlements of IDPs in Galkayo, Bossasso and 
Hargeisa. He held discussions with the President of Puntland, the Vice-President of 
Somaliland and other authorities, as well as humanitarian organizations and civil society 
representatives. Due to the security situation in south and central Somalia, the 
Representative was unable to travel there and consultations with the Transitional Federal 
Government during the mission therefore remained limited. 
</p>
<p>3. The Representative expresses his gratitude to the Transitional Federal Government 
and the administrations of Somaliland and Puntland for engaging in a dialogue with him. 
He further wishes to sincerely thank the United Nations Country Team, in particular the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as well as 
UNPOS, for facilitating and supporting his mission. He also expresses gratitude to the 
internally displaced he met with and who openly shared their experiences with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context of internal displacement in Somalia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Patterns of internal displacement: background and causes 
</b></p>
<p>4. With the end of Siad Barre&#8217;s regime in 1991 and the subsequent collapse of the 
Government, a power vacuum was created that has brought violence, lawlessness and 
anarchy to Somalia and led to one of the world&#8217;s worst humanitarian crises3 with very high 
levels of suffering among the civilian population, whose rights have remained largely 
unprotected. The country was divided along clan lines by powerful warlords in command of 
different militias who have since been engaged in violent power struggles. In 1991, 
Somaliland unilaterally declared independence but remains internationally unrecognized as 
an independent country. Puntland, in 1998, proclaimed itself as an autonomous region 
within Somalia. Accordingly Somalia is effectively divided into three parts: Somaliland, 
Puntland and the central and southern regions of Somalia. At least 15 attempts were made

<p>before a new national government was established in 2004. The present Transitional 
Federal Government under the presidency of Sheikh Shariif Ahmed &#8212; established in early 
2009 &#8212; remains fragile and is confronted with huge challenges as it faces continued attacks 
from opposition insurgent groups, two major ones being Al Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, and 
militias that still control large parts of the central and southern regions of Somalia. 
</p>
<p>5. Eighteen years of armed conflict have caused massive displacement within Somalia 
and to neighbouring States. The ongoing armed conflict is most heavily pronounced in the 
central and southern regions of Somalia and continues to cause displacement. This region 
was afflicted by new waves of heavy fighting in Mogadishu from February 2007 between 
the Transitional Federal Government forces supported by Ethiopian troops and insurgent 
groups, leading to the internal displacement of an estimated 1 million Somalis. Many 
sought refuge in the Afgooye corridor north-west of the capital, others fled to other regions 
including northwards to Puntland and Somaliland. 
</p>
<p>6. In February 2007, the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of 
the United Nations, authorized the establishment of the African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM) and has since extended its mandate,4 which primarily includes support to the 
reconciliation process in Somalia through protecting and ensuring the safe passage of all 
those involved in this process and, as appropriate, the protection of institutions and key 
infrastructure of the Transitional Federal Government to assist it to carry out its 
governmental functions. 
</p>
<p>7. Fighting continued throughout 2008. The insurgency spread and the insurgents 
regained control over parts of the territory, in particular in south Somalia. Talks between 
the Transitional Federal Government of the time and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of 
Somalia (ARS), an alliance of Somali opposition leaders created in September 2007, began 
in May 2008 and led to the Djibouti Agreement of 9 June 2008 on the termination of all 
acts of armed confrontation.5 This agreement also provided for the withdrawal of Ethiopian 
troops, which eventually took place in January 2009.6 In the ensuing power vacuum, armed 
struggles broke out among numerous insurgent groups over formerly Ethiopian-held 
strongholds, in particular within Mogadishu, with Al Shabaab consolidating control over 
many of these strongholds, including the city of Baidoa. This was followed by an offensive 
launched by Hizbul Islam against the Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM 
troops in February in Mogadishu. Both periods of confrontation caused considerable new 
and renewed displacement. 
</p>
<p>8. In early 2009, a new President, Sheikh Sharif, took office, parliament was expanded 
and a new Transitional Federal Government cabinet formed, integrating the two parties 
which had signed the Djibouti Agreement. This marked a new phase in the process to re-
establish State authority. Initially, as the security situation calmed down in March and April 
2009, approximately 65,000 IDPs returned to the Mogadishu area. In early May 2009, 
however, fighting broke out again, with mortar attacks on the parliament building, which 
also hit residential areas, and on AMISOM bases in Mogadishu, in the context of a 
combined offensive by Hizbul Islam and Al Shabaab against Transitional Federal 
Government and AMISOM forces. Attempts by the Transitional Federal Government to 
conclude a ceasefire for the month of Ramadan failed. Suicide attacks on AMISOM 
Headquarters in September 2009 sparked heavy counter-attacks resulting in the shelling of

<p>residential areas and causing further displacement. The fighting, in particular within the 
capital, was ongoing at the time this report was finalized. These confrontations have caused 
the displacement of an estimated 230,000 persons from Mogadishu. Hostilities among 
insurgent groups, in particular fierce fighting between Al Shabaab and Hizbul Islam over 
the control of the port city of Kismayo, have contributed to the highly insecure situation in 
the central and southern regions of Somalia. People reportedly also fled from areas 
controlled by Al Shabaab to escape their very strict Islamist rule, according to which 
amputations, stoning and beheading of people have been undertaken in the guise of 
religion, as well as the imposition of strict orders and codes of behaviour impacting on 
women&#8217;s rights, freedom of expression and other areas. 
</p>
<p>9. The Representative observes that it is often a combination of the generally violent 
and insecure situation and a specific incident experienced by particular individuals, families 
and communities that eventually triggers the flight of people: 
</p>
<p> (a) Generalized violence and insecurity coupled with widespread lawlessness: 
fighting between the Transitional Federal Government/AMISOM/Ethiopian forces7 and 
opposition insurgent groups and also power struggles between the different insurgent 
groups, in particular Al Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, have led to a situation of generalized 
violence and insecurity in the central and southern regions of Somalia that continuously 
triggers new and renewed displacement of persons; 
</p>
<p> (b) Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law: serious 
violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, such as indiscriminate 
attacks on and shelling of residential areas, are perpetrated by all actors with total impunity. 
Somalis also flee the risk of targeted killings, death threats and intimidation, as well as 
forcible recruitment into armed groups and rape, all of which are reportedly particularly 
high in, but not limited to, areas controlled by Al Shabaab.8 Such acts, which may amount 
to war crimes and crimes against humanity,9 are a major cause of displacement. 
</p><p>10. In Somaliland and Puntland, only limited military confrontations have been reported 
and the civilian population has not been affected by constant armed hostilities. Occasional 
clashes between Somaliland and Puntland forces over the territorially disputed districts of 
Sool and Sanaag continue to trigger displacement from these areas. A general risk of 
violent acts by militias or insurgent groups persists. 
</p>
<p>11. Clashes among different clans and subclans continue in all parts of the country, 
including over land, also contributing to displacement. 
</p>
<p>12. Natural disasters are a significant cause of internal displacement in Somalia. The 
severe, prolonged drought in several parts of Somalia has forced people to move. Among 
the particularly affected groups are nomads and pastoralists whose survival is at stake 
because of loss of their livestock and acute food insecurity. Recent torrential rainfalls in late 
2009 have further caused the displacement of several thousand Somalis and there is the 
prospect of further displacement with the continuance of El Ni&#241;o rains. The majority of 
those displaced because of the drought are from the central regions, while those displaced 
by flooding are from the riverine region between the Juba and Shabelle rivers in southern 
Somalia.

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Magnitude and dynamics of internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>13. The lack of security in most parts of Somalia, coupled with the impact of natural 
disasters, has led to one of the biggest displacement situations in the world. While a large 
number of Somalis have sought refuge abroad, internal displacement was the only option 
left for those with no means to seek safety elsewhere. The overall magnitude of internal 
displacement in Somalia is an estimated 1.5 million internally displaced persons, with 
1,380,000 IDPs in the central and southern regions of Somalia, over 100,000 in Puntland 
and approximately 67,000 in Somaliland.10 The Representative noted that the constant 
movement of persons in Somalia, including return movements, new displacements, multiple 
displacements, a number of so-called &#8220;invisible&#8221; IDPs,11 and lack of access to some parts of 
the country make it difficult to arrive at reliable figures. A profiling of the displacement 
situation in all three regions, based on satellite pictures where access is limited, would help 
to clarify the situation. 
</p>
<p>14. While some of the displacement is a coping strategy for those concerned, other 
instances of displacement, in particular if they result from violations of international 
humanitarian and human rights law, are arbitrary and prohibited under international law.12 
</p>
<p>15. Some of the internal displacement in Somalia dates back to 1991 and has become 
protracted, whereby IDPs remain in displacement without prospect of a durable solution to 
their displacement in a foreseeable future. Such protracted situations can be found in all 
three regions: Somalis who sought refuge in the Mogadishu urban area during the civil war 
in 1991&#8211;1994 have settled in public buildings and many are too destitute to move further to 
seek safety. In Puntland and Somaliland, IDPs have remained for many years in 
settlements, without a solution to their displacement and often living in precarious 
conditions. In Somaliland, many who fled to neighbouring countries in 1991 were unable to 
return to their homes after being repatriated and have since remained in internal 
displacement. 
</p>
<p>16. Today, displacement continues unabated, with waves of newly displaced persons 
joining those who previously fled to the urban areas because they promised increased 
physical and economic security compared to rural areas. These arrivals exacerbate the 
protracted displacement situations as the newly displaced not only impose a huge burden on 
the local authorities and communities, but also on the old communities of IDPs, in 
particular in areas where basic services and resources are already under a lot of strain. 
</p>
<p>17. The majority of IDPs are from the central and southern regions of Somalia, 
particularly from the Mogadishu area. Some remain in that area, often seeking refuge along 
the road between Mogadishu and Afgooye, which is today known as the Afgooye corridor, 
a makeshift settlement with the highest density of internally displaced persons in the world 
&#8211; over half a million IDPs along a stretch of 15 kilometres of road. Others move further 
south and west towards the borders of Kenya and Ethiopia, and some cross into Kenya to 
find refuge in Dadaab refugee camp. Those who move north try to reach safety, in 
particular in Puntland (mainly in Galkayo, Garowe and Bossaso) or Somaliland (mainly in 
Burao and Hargeisa) or try to go to Yemen and elsewhere. Due to continued insecurity, 
IDPs also flee from other areas in the central and southern regions of Somalia, as well as 
from districts in the north, in particular Galkayo, as well as from Sool and Sanaag.

</p>
<p>18. As drought and flooding have become an important cause of displacement, IDPs 
have come also from rural areas, currently in particular from Galgaduud and the riverine 
regions. Nomads and pastoralists are among those particularly exposed to the risk of 
becoming IDPs due to such extreme weather events because of their special attachment to 
land and livestock.13 Some of these IDPs move to settlements in urban areas in search of 
assistance and protection. Others, referred to as &#8220;invisible&#8221; IDPs, remain within their clan 
areas and often receive support from clan members, thus not seeking assistance and 
protection in IDP settlements. Nevertheless, they add to the stress on the limited capacities 
of often poor urban communities. 
</p>
<p>19. Due to their displacement, IDPs are often highly vulnerable and have little 
resilience. This is particularly true for those in the central and southern regions of Somalia 
affected by multiple displacements due to violence. Vulnerability is exacerbated when IDPs 
move to areas where they are stripped of their clan protection, particularly if their clan is 
suddenly in a minority and/or no elders who could invoke traditional clan protection 
mechanisms are present. 
</p>
<p>20. In Somaliland and Puntland, IDPs live intermingled in settlements with returning 
refugees, asylum-seekers and refugees from neighbouring Ethiopia, as well as urban poor 
who often have similar needs. Displacement in these northern areas must further be seen in 
the wider context of mixed migration, including economic migration, human trafficking and 
smuggling. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Responses to internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic response 
</b></p>
<p>21. The fact that Somalia has been without functioning governmental structures at the 
State level for almost two decades is reflected in the overall situation of the country. While 
the Transitional Federal Government is tasked with bringing stability and security to the 
ravaged country, as provided for in the Djibouti Agreement,14 its capacity to do so remains 
limited. Its influence is further curtailed by the fact that it cannot exercise de facto authority 
over large parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>22. The Representative, while recalling the primary duty and responsibility of national 
authorities to provide protection and assistance to its displaced,15 notes the awareness of the 
Transitional Federal Government of the plight of Somali IDPs, as well as its commitment to 
assuming responsibility for its own population. Cooperation with and support by the 
international and national humanitarian community is key to enabling the Transitional 
Federal Government to comply with its obligations as assumed under international law to 
respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of its population. The Djibouti Agreement 
requires all necessary measures to be taken to ensure unhindered humanitarian access and 
delivery of assistance,16 indicating that the deterioration of the humanitarian situation 
would further fuel insecurity and violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>23. All efforts to bring more security and stability to the country help to address the 
underlying causes and main triggers of internal displacement in Somalia. The

</b></p>
<p>Representative welcomes those efforts undertaken by the Transitional Federal Government 
to enter into a dialogue with all actors, including with opposition groups who have 
remained outside the Djibouti process. 
</p><p>24. Somalia was among the first African States to sign the African Union Convention on 
the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala 
Convention) that builds on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The 
Representative commends the Government for this important step and encourages early 
ratification of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>25. The Somaliland and Puntland authorities face particular constraints in terms of 
resources and capacity and are in need of support for capacity-building and other measures. 
The Representative appreciates the continued efforts of these authorities to host IDPs and 
underlines that they must not be prevented from seeking safety, nor should they be met with 
general mistrust or hostility due to their origin. 
</p>
<p>26. The Representative, while noting Somaliland&#8217;s claim to independence, underlines 
the need for all authorities to observe and apply the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement without discrimination.17 He recalls, in this context, that internally displaced 
persons are defined by the Guiding Principles and the recently adopted Kampala 
Convention as &#8220;persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to 
leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to 
avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human 
rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an <i>internationally 
recognized</i> State border&#8221; (emphasis added). The authorities therefore have the duty to 
provide protection and assistance to all IDPs within their administrative control irrespective 
of their origin. 
</p>
<p>27. Given the limited capacities of the Somaliland and Puntland authorities and the 
difficult challenges they face in fulfilling their obligations to provide assistance and 
protection to all the displaced, partly due to lack of resources, cooperation with the 
humanitarian and development community is key. Efforts by the authorities to safeguard 
humanitarian aid workers are appreciated by the humanitarian community in Somaliland 
and Puntland. Support provided by them must not be diverted, through e.g. &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;.18 
Authorities should grant and facilitate free passage of all humanitarian assistance,19 
including non-food items. This also requires general tax and customs exemptions for 
humanitarian goods. 
</p>
<p>28. Representatives of local civil society also play an important role as implementing 
and strategic partners of the international humanitarian community in bringing assistance 
and protection to the displaced in all parts of Somalia. Their role is particularly key in areas 
where the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) lack 
access to the displaced communities, especially in south and central Somalia. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International response 
</b></p>
<p>29. The environment in which international humanitarian agencies and organizations 
operate in Somalia is extremely difficult due to the diversity of situations and the shrinking 
humanitarian and development space in different areas of the country, in particular due to 
threats to the safety of humanitarian workers, such as abductions or killings, impeded 
</p>

<p>humanitarian access, and constraints imposed on organizations due to the overall lack of 
security. 
</p>
<p>30. Nevertheless, conditions in Somaliland and Puntland, although in United Nations 
security phase 4, allow for a limited international presence and offer some space for 
humanitarian and development interventions. Much of south and central Somalia is under 
security phase 4, while Mogadishu and parts of south-west Somalia are in phase 5, with 
most international staff evacuated and severely limited opportunities for intervention 
mostly being run by national staff members. 
</p>
<p>31. The security constraints have a significant impact on operations involving 
international staff. Staff ceilings or even evacuation of international staff and limited access 
to areas with internally displaced populations due to security constraints have pushed the 
international response partly into a &#8220;remote control&#8221; response, whereby assistance and 
protection activities are managed and controlled from Nairobi or, in some instances, safer 
parts of Somalia, and it is not possible to carry out monitoring activities, including directly 
monitoring the activities of implementing partners on the ground. The Representative 
acknowledges the difficulties of the humanitarian community in providing assistance and 
protection within such limited space, but, after consultation with the United Nations 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia and relevant heads of United Nations agencies in 
Nairobi, he is convinced of the need to increase substantially the humanitarian presence at 
locations in Somalia where the required security could be provided and access to different 
parts of the country would be possible. 
</p>
<p>32. A high level of humanitarian assistance remains indispensable in all parts of Somalia 
in order to address the basic needs of all IDPs for shelter, food, water, health care, 
sanitation and education. At the same time, more robust recovery and development 
activities are needed in areas that are stable enough for such measures, in particular in 
places where internal displacement has become protracted. Humanitarian and development 
actors should work together to allow for a smooth transition to more stability, while 
ensuring that the most vulnerable are not falling through cracks in the assistance 
framework. 
</p>
<p>33. In areas where sustained humanitarian access by international humanitarian agencies 
and organizations remains limited, investments in basic infrastructure (water and 
sanitation), services (health and education) and livelihoods may be a more efficient and 
sustainable, or the only, way to address the urgent humanitarian needs of IDPs and host 
communities and thus constitute life-saving interventions. Such development interventions 
reduce dependency on humanitarian aid and strengthen the capacity of displaced and host 
communities to cope with the distress and the burdens imposed upon them as a 
consequence of displacement, at times when humanitarian aid cannot reach them. 
</p>
<p>34. Humanitarian and development assistance is intrinsically linked to human rights. 
The Human Rights Unit within UNPOS (including integrated activities of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights) has been developing its monitoring 
and capacity-building activities, including through regular visits to Somaliland and 
Puntland. More sustained missions, the eventual redeployment of staff to the regions and 
strengthened links with monitoring and protection networks are essential to identify and 
contribute to addressing serious human rights concerns more systematically, including 
those related to alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in 
Mogadishu and other parts of the central and southern regions of Somalia. In this regard, 
there is a need to strengthen awareness of the provisions of international humanitarian law 
and the consequences for all parties, including peacekeepers, if they do not respect such 
provisions, including potential prosecution for war crimes and other crimes under 
international law. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.2

<p>GE.10-10396 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>35. The situation of the displaced in Somalia does not receive as much international 
attention as the situation and the pressing needs of the IDPs require. On the contrary, the 
sharp decline in donor contributions20 has led to a situation where the core needs of the 
displaced cannot be adequately covered and where important and much-needed projects, 
such as livelihood projects, temporary shelter projects or relevant assessment undertakings, 
have had to be halted even where implementation would be possible under the present 
security circumstances. It is essential that the international community engages more 
strongly with Somalia in providing substantial and sustained support to programmes aimed 
at improving assistance to and protection of the internally displaced, and that it proactively 
embarks on bringing robust recovery and development activities to areas of the country that 
are stable enough, in order to prevent the humanitarian and security situation from further 
deterioration. While the Representative notes the risk of aid being diverted by armed 
groups, he calls on donors to reconsider their funding conditionalities and not to reduce 
humanitarian aid, so as not to exacerbate the existing hardship and suffering of the 
population and play into the hands of radical elements who could easily exploit the 
situation and thus contribute to a further deterioration of the humanitarian and security 
situation in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Preventing future displacement and mitigating its 
consequences 
</b></p>
<p>36. As noted above, the level of violence faced by civilians, including very serious 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, is a major trigger for 
displacement. Of particular concern are the many alleged instances of arbitrary 
displacement of persons, who are being forced out of their homes, contrary to the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement,21 as a result of violations of international humanitarian 
and human rights law. Such instances include indiscriminate attacks, shelling of residential 
areas, general resorting to use of force without the necessary precautions to spare the 
civilian population, prohibited methods of warfare, as well as targeted human rights 
violations and abuses, such as killings, rapes or forced recruitment, all taking place in a 
climate of impunity. Stopping such violations and addressing impunity are essential 
measures.22 
</p>
<p>37. An assessment based on reports by media or organizations and witnesses on the 
ground collected by members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) protection 
cluster monitoring system between January and July 2009, suggests that the top four 
reported violations were: (a) physical assaults (658 reported incidents); (b) killings and 
deaths of individuals (515 incidents); (c) rape, attempted rape and domestic violence (243 
incidents); and (d) violence against children, including recruitment into armed groups,

 By 1 October 2009, the 2009 Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) for Somalia was funded to only 54 
</p>
<p>per cent (Somalia Humanitarian Overview, vol. 2, issue 9, September 2009). The CAP funding by 
clusters has declined in the majority of clusters, including education (2008: 42 per cent; 2009: 9 per 
cent), food (2008: 98 per cent; 2009: 69 per cent), livelihoods (2008: 25 per cent; 2009: 13 per cent), 
nutrition (2008: 77 per cent; 2009: 50 per cent), protection (2008: 43 per cent; 2009: 26 per cent), 
shelter (2008: 60 per cent; 2009: 12 per cent) and WASH (2008: 70 per cent; 2009: 23 per cent),

 The Secretary-General in his recent report (S/2009/503) has also raised his concerns over the 
</p>
<p>prevailing impunity for human rights abuses throughout the country. The independent expert on the 
situation of human rights in Somalia has called for observance of international law and ending 
impunity as key priorities (A/HRC/12/44). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10396 
</p>
<p>abandonment and child labour (168 incidents). Such acts are not only a major cause of 
displacement, but may also amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity under the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.23 This evaluation also indicates that such 
atrocities may be committed by all parties to the conflict, including Al Shabaab as the 
major perpetrator, other anti-Government groups, militias and organized criminal groups, 
but also Transitional Federal Government forces as well as supporting militias and foreign 
troops. Reports include allegations of repeated shelling of civilian populated areas of 
Mogadishu by AMISOM troops in the context of counter-attacks against Al Shabaab. 
While the Representative is not in a position to verify or confirm any of these reports, they 
indicate the existence of a very high level of violence raising concerns under international 
law and highlighting the need to address the issue of impunity. 
</p>
<p>38. Preventing future displacement and avoiding conditions that might lead to 
displacement has to be a primary objective of all actors involved in hostilities and they must 
strictly abide by their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law in 
all circumstances.24 While it is primarily the State and all its organs that are bound by 
international human rights law, violations by non-State actors also attract State 
responsibility if elements of governmental authority are exercised in the absence or default 
of official authorities and in circumstances of a power vacuum in which the assumption of 
de facto authority appears necessary.25 International humanitarian law applicable in non-
international armed conflict,26 as well as international criminal law, impose obligations also 
on non-State actors, including insurgent groups, without prejudice to their legal status. 
Troops mandated by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United 
Nations should take all measures to ensure that their operations do not affect civilian 
populations and their operational conduct is in compliance with the 1999 bulletin of the 
Secretary-General on the observance by United Nations forces of international 
humanitarian law.27 
</p>
<p>39. The prevailing climate of almost total impunity throughout Somalia has contributed 
to ongoing violence and abuse. Combating impunity and holding those responsible for 
violations committed accountable for their actions will be crucial in the endeavour to 
prevent further displacement, in particular in south and central Somalia. Activities to 
strengthen and ensure respect for the rule of law and to enhance access to justice for victims 
are needed to contribute to the creation of an environment that does not accept impunity as 
a reality. The capacity of the authorities should be built on and further strengthened, to 
enhance their capability to establish and maintain law and order and better protect the rights 
of the Somali displaced. Under article 9 of the Djibouti Agreement, the Transitional Federal 
Government is committed to addressing justice and reconciliation in relation to past 
atrocities, although this process, supported by UNPOS, is still in the very early stages and 
needs to be developed in a timely way that is appropriate to conditions in Somalia. At the 
same time, it is essential that the development of the security sector (police and military) 
includes as a central component measures aimed at building disciplinary, internal and 
external oversight mechanisms to address ongoing violations and prevent further abuse. 
Continuing United Nations support to building the justice sector is also essential, including 
strengthening responses to sexual and gender-based violence. 
</p>

is needed for a thorough establishment of early warning mechanisms and contingency

<p>planning to respond to new displacement. The Protection Monitoring Network as well as 
the Population Movement Tracking System led by UNHCR in partnership with a variety of 
actors are key in this regard, but impacted by restricted access due to security constraints in 
crucial areas, in particular in and around Mogadishu where much of the new displacement 
is triggered. Community mobilization activities are important for building resilience to 
displacement and for improving protection from secondary displacement. 
</p>
<p>41. Preventing displacement resulting from drought or flooding poses different 
challenges. While natural disasters cannot be prevented, their effects on individuals can be 
mitigated and the population&#8217;s vulnerabilities and exposure to disasters can be reduced and 
their resilience built upon. Such measures could include livelihood assistance projects for 
affected populations, and recovery and development efforts in disaster-affected areas, such 
as the introduction of drought-resistant crops or elements of mechanized farming. They 
would be particularly important to the extent that current and future natural disasters are 
linked to climate change. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Protection of displaced persons during displacement 
</b></p>
<p>42. Even if people manage to escape areas of acute insecurity, they remain exposed to 
other severe protection risks during flight and once they find refuge in settlements of IDPs 
in safer areas of Somalia. Displacement by its very nature strips people of their protective 
environment, lowers their resilience and heightens their vulnerability. In the context of 
Somalia, IDPs often lose their clan protection if they are forced to move to other, safer 
areas and are therefore even more exposed to protection risks. Women and children 
constitute the majority of the displaced, who often flee and settle in safer areas without 
male family members accompanying them, which increases their vulnerability in the local 
context. At the outset, the Representative wishes to emphasize that internally displaced 
persons retain the same rights and freedoms as other Somalis, including the right to seek 
safety in another part of the country or to seek asylum abroad, the right to physical safety 
and not to be sent back to dangerous areas, the right to an adequate standard of living, 
including shelter, the right to family unity, the rights to food and water and the rights to 
health and education, and protection from discrimination. 
</p>
<p>43. During flight, the displaced reportedly encounter serious protection risks. 
Testimonies indicate that these include the rape of women and girls, looting of transport 
vehicles, physical assaults and murder inflicted by militia groups and gangs. Other 
protection challenges relate to the hardship of the flight, which poses severe physical 
challenges, in particular if IDPs cannot afford transport and have to flee on foot. This is 
exacerbated by the lack of food and potable water that has even resulted in fatalities among 
children, as testimonies from newly arrived IDPs in Bossasso indicate. Risks to health and 
lack of access to health care are concerns in particular for pregnant women, especially if 
they give birth during flight. The Representative has further learnt that armed elements, 
who have set up illegal checkpoints, interfere with the right of all Somalis to seek safety in 
another part of the country, by, inter alia, asking for payment to pass, stripping the 
displaced of their last possessions, or committing even worse crimes. He recalls that 
governmental authorities are not only obliged to refrain from such acts, but also have the 
obligation to protect the displaced from such actions by private actors. 
</p>
<p>44. The security situation in south and central Somalia did not allow the Representative 
to get a first-hand impression of the situation of those displaced within these areas. 
Information made available to the Representative, as well as testimonies by IDPs coming 
from these areas, reveal grave levels of violence and appalling conditions, in particular in 
the Afgooye corridor, including severe overcrowding, a destitute shelter and sanitary 
situation, critical food situation, rapes and even mass rapes of women, recruitment of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10396 
</p>
<p>children into armed groups, and killings. This situation is further exacerbated by severe 
restrictions or even lack of access for humanitarian organizations, looting of compounds 
and other difficulties organizations face in delivering humanitarian aid to beneficiaries. 
This has resulted in pitifully insufficient quantities of humanitarian aid being distributed, 
given the overwhelming needs of the population. 
</p>
<p>45. The visit to Puntland and Somaliland enabled the Representative to see the situation 
at first-hand and gather information in settlements of IDPs in Galkayo, Bossasso and 
Hargeisa, where protracted displacement situations are exacerbated by the influx of new 
arrivals. The Representative acknowledges the hospitality provided to IDPs by the local 
populations under difficult circumstances. At the same time, he is concerned that the 
authorities view new arrivals with increasing suspicion, fearing infiltration by insurgents. 
While genuine security concerns need to be addressed, this must be done in a way that fully 
respects the rights of IDPs. 
</p>
<p>46. As regards Puntland, the Representative wishes to make specific reference to a letter 
dated 19 October 2009, addressed to him by the President of Puntland State on the 
repatriation of IDPs and economic migrants, expressing the position of the administration 
that IDPs from the central and southern regions of Somalia are regarded as economic 
migrants rather than persons seeking safety from danger. The Representative, while 
appreciating the efforts of the authorities to host large numbers of IDPs and aware of the 
burden these populations may pose, insists that IDPs do not have a choice but to flee from 
violence, violations of their human rights or &#8212; particularly in the case of IDPs from 
drought-affected areas &#8212; situations threatening survival. He calls on the Puntland 
authorities to recognize these vulnerabilities and refrain, in accordance with the Guiding 
Principles, from any attempts to return IDPs to any place where their life, safety, liberty 
and/or health would be at risk.28 
</p>
<p>47. In Somaliland, a primary challenge to the rights of IDPs from the central and 
southern regions of Somalia is the fact that they are treated as foreigners, i.e. refugees or 
even illegal migrants. As such, they cannot acquire property, participate in elections or 
access public employment. While noting that Somaliland also encounters mixed migration 
as well as the return of high numbers of Somaliland refugees, the Representative reiterates 
that those displaced from the central and southern regions of Somalia retain all their rights 
as internally displaced persons within the meaning of the Guiding Principles when they flee 
to Somaliland as they do not cross an internationally recognized state border.29 He therefore 
calls on the authorities to find pragmatic ways to ensure that these people can fully enjoy 
their rights as provided for by the Guiding Principles and the binding human rights 
provisions that underlie them. In particular, he seeks the commitment of Somaliland 
authorities to refrain from deporting persons displaced from the central and southern 
regions of Somalia. 
</p>
<p>48. In Puntland and Somaliland, the continuous inflow of IDPs is a burden on the 
reception and absorption capacities of local authorities and communities, but also for 
existing communities of IDPs. While some IDPs remain invisible in host communities, the 
majority are in IDP settlements, which have become a melting pot of IDPs, asylum-seekers, 
refugees, including returning Somali and Somaliland refugees, urban poor and migrants. 
Thus, the identification of beneficiaries remains a challenge. Nevertheless, the majority of 
IDPs in Puntland and Somaliland have lost their traditional support mechanisms and clan 
protection and are therefore vulnerable in ways not encountered by others. At the same 
time, given in particular the vulnerabilities of poor local communities, singling out the

<p>displaced may create or exacerbate tensions and hostilities with the local communities. 
Approaches based on a concept of &#8220;displacement affected communities&#8221; which address in a 
comprehensive way the needs of displaced communities, as well as host communities 
bearing the burden caused by the arrival of IDPs, might be more appropriate in such 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>49. Major protection concerns encountered in IDP settlements both in Puntland and 
Somaliland but reportedly also in the southern and central region include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Overcrowding, with the overwhelming majority of residents being women 
and children, who often live without adequate shelter and access to basic services, including 
health care, education, potable water and sanitation, or education. Specific support 
structures for persons with special needs, such as the disabled, traumatized persons or 
victims of sexual and gender-based violence, are virtually non-existent. Outbreaks of fire in 
the overcrowded settlements are another concern; 
</p>
<p> (b) Severe levels of malnourishment, which in Somalia have been found to be 
highest in IDP settlements and drought-affected areas;30 
</p>
<p> (c) Lack or inaccessibility of education programmes for internally displaced 
children and youth and lack of opportunities for vocational or skills training leaving them 
with no or little prospect for their future;  
</p>
<p> (d) Economic exploitation of children and, in particular in southern and central 
Somalia, also their recruitment into armed groups; 
</p>
<p> (e) Lack of physical security, rapes, gang rapes and other instances of sexual and 
gender-based violence in and around the settlements31 as well as domestic violence. This is 
exacerbated by a lack of medical and psychosocial care, legal counselling, access to justice, 
rehabilitation and livelihood support for victims. The subordinate socio-economic position 
of Somali women is one of the root causes of the sexual violence faced by internally 
displaced women and girls; 
</p>
<p> (f) Lack of public land where IDPs can settle with a certain security of tenure 
and without the risk of becoming forcibly evicted or having to pay exorbitant rents to 
private landlords.  
</p>
<p>50. The security situation in Puntland and Somaliland affects the provision of assistance 
and protection in terms of predictability and continuity. The bomb attacks of October 2008 
on the authorities, the Ethiopian mission and United Nations staff in Hargeisa and the 
authorities in Puntland had a dramatic impact on the international presence and operations. 
In Puntland, the kidnapping of humanitarian aid workers, even though they are isolated 
cases, has impacted on the delivery of goods and services. Access to IDPs is further 
impeded by dominant individuals or groups who install themselves as &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; 
between the humanitarian community and the displaced and in some cases control physical 
access to settlements and the distribution and use of goods. Given these restrictions and the 
limited funding available, the aid delivered does not meet the humanitarian needs of the 
displaced in Puntland and Somaliland. Within this limited operational space, the 
Representative has witnessed the high level of commitment and dedication of all actors to

<p>addressing the needs of the displaced. He strongly supports existing activities that aim to 
enhance the protection of and assistance to the displaced within the framework of the draft 
joint United Nations strategy for IDPs in Somalia. Such projects include projects to support 
livelihoods that also enhance protection, solar lighting projects in IDP settlements and 
community-based protection initiatives, including community policing, legal aid support 
services and prevention and response activities regarding sexual and gender-based violence. 
The Representative encourages the expansion of such projects and calls on the donor 
community to provide adequate funding support.  
</p>
<p>51. Lack of livelihood opportunities for the internally displaced is a primary concern. It 
exacerbates other problems IDPs face, such as exploitation by landlords or the lack of 
access to existing basic services, and lowers their coping capacities. It is also an obstacle to 
achieving durable solutions for those internally displaced to Somaliland and Puntland who 
seek local integration in the areas where they sought refuge so many years ago. Livelihoods 
are key, in particular for the long-term displaced in Somaliland and Puntland, and allow 
them to regain their independence. Empowering these IDPs by creating livelihoods, in 
particular agricultural or business activities, will enable them to cope better with the current 
situation and will therefore lessen the burden on local communities.  
</p>
<p>52. In order to address the displacement situation holistically, the provision of 
humanitarian assistance must be complemented by recovery and development efforts in 
areas of Somalia that are stable enough for such measures, in particular Puntland and 
Somaliland, but also the more stable regions of south and central Somalia. In protracted 
displacement situations, where IDPs have a high dependency on humanitarian assistance, it 
is important that recovery and development initiatives are started and implemented without 
delay. The linkages between emergency relief and early recovery, and longer term 
developmental efforts must be strengthened to ensure sustainability of programmes and 
facilitate the transition towards durable solutions for the displaced.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Protracted internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>53. IDPs in situations of protracted displacement can be found in all parts of Somalia. In 
the central and southern regions of Somalia, IDPs are living in protracted displacement, 
inter alia, in Mogadishu itself, where long-term IDPs have settled in public buildings, in the 
Afgooye corridor, and in areas with perceived relative stability. Finding durable solutions 
for these IDPs is extremely difficult given the volatile security situation and the fact that 
humanitarian or eventual recovery interventions would not be sustainable under the present 
conditions.  
</p>
<p>54. Many IDPs also sought refuge in Puntland and Somaliland over a decade ago and 
have since remained in displacement, living under very difficult conditions on the margins 
of society. The relative stability of these regions provides them with opportunities to 
improve their social and economic condition and thus strengthen their capacity to become 
self-reliant as full members of society, regardless of whether they want to return to their 
former homes once this becomes possible. For those wishing to remain where they are, 
local integration would help them find a durable solution to their displacement in 
accordance with the Guiding Principles.32 
</p>
<p>55. Assessments carried out in Puntland and Somaliland indicate that the vast majority 
of IDPs wish to seek local integration as a durable solution33 while others continue to return 
</p>
<p>

<p>to home areas once conditions allow. Integrating long-term IDPs into local society, instead 
of marginalizing and discriminating them, would help them to become self-sufficient. Joint 
programmes for displaced communities in Hargeisa, Bossasso and Galkayo were elaborated 
by respective line ministries and key United Nations partners with the United Nations 
Development Programme as the lead agency. They not only include projects aimed at 
improving the living standards of IDPs in temporary settlements through activities to better 
protect their human rights &#8212; in particular by protecting their physical integrity, improving 
access to basic services, upgrading temporary settlements and facilitating access to 
livelihood opportunities &#8212; but they also seek to identify and find durable solutions. The 
programmes thus combine the need for continued humanitarian efforts with recovery and 
development initiatives. 
</p>
<p>56. In Puntland, these joint programmes will not only be important to improve the 
situation of IDPs but also to contribute to the stability of the region. The Representative 
encourages authorities and humanitarian agencies to continue with the development and 
implementation of the joint programmes for Bossasso and Galkayo. He welcomes the 
interest expressed by the President of Puntland in holding a workshop with the authorities 
and humanitarian and development actors to identify current problems in basic 
infrastructure and services, as well as livelihoods, and define measures to address them.  
</p>
<p>57. In Hargeisa, implementation of the joint programme was stopped after the October 
2008 coordinated bomb attacks on the United Nations, Somaliland authorities and the 
Ethiopian mission. To restart implementation now should become a priority. The 
Representative welcomes the confirmation given to him by the Minister of Reconstruction, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement that he would restart this process together with the 
Ministry of Planning and the support of the United Nations agencies present in Hargeisa, 
and hopes that what was planned more than a year ago can be implemented now. 
</p>
<p>58. Durable solutions are also needed for those displaced by drought and other natural 
disasters. Many of these IDPs are pastoralists and nomads, who have lost all their livestock. 
Development interventions should aim to introduce supportive systems that would allow 
them a sustained living in rural areas, including those affected by drought or other natural 
disasters.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>59. <b>Internally displaced persons in Somalia face a very serious humanitarian crisis, 
accompanied by grave human rights concerns. Their plight is not adequately 
addressed by the Somali authorities and the international community. Further neglect 
by the international community will not only lead to a deterioration of this crisis, but 
in itself contribute to the destabilization of the country. The Somali situation, albeit 
difficult, can be improved, but a greater degree of international attention is needed. 
Strong and concerted efforts by all actors involved &#8212; the authorities, humanitarian 
and development actors, human rights organizations and the international community 
as a whole &#8212; are necessary. The Representative would like to stress, in particular, the 
urgent need for donors to provide more financial resources to match the high level of 
dedication and commitment of actors on the ground.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Preventing further displacement, in particular displacement that is considered 
arbitrary according to principle No. 6 of the Guiding Principles, is an urgent 
challenge. In this context, addressing impunity and enforcing accountability of 
perpetrators is indispensable. Stressing the obligation of all actors involved in armed 
hostilities to scrupulously abide by their obligations under international human rights 
and humanitarian law, the Representative recommends that: </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10396 
</p>
<p><b> (a) The United Nations, the African Union and other relevant stakeholders 
should take the necessary steps to enhance the protection of civilians and end 
impunity for atrocities committed. It is essential to put in place appropriate 
mechanisms to address impunity for international crimes, justice and reconciliation, 
including by considering &#8212; at an appropriate stage &#8212; the establishment of an 
independent commission of inquiry and/or referral of the situation to the 
International Criminal Court in order to establish whether such crimes have been 
committed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The parties to the Djibouti Agreement should work determinedly 
towards its full implementation as an essential step to bringing about peace and 
stability in Somalia; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The United Nations and its Member States should provide AMISOM 
troops with the resources and equipment necessary to carry out their mandate with 
full respect for the protection needs of the civilian population. AMISOM troops 
should be adequately trained and sensitized to the rules of international humanitarian 
law in accordance with the 1999 bulletin of the Secretary-General on the observance 
by United Nations forces of international humanitarian law (ST/SGB/1999/13); 
 (d) The authorities, humanitarian and development actors should 
implement programmes and projects, particularly in the areas of livelihoods and basic 
services, aimed at empowering people and strengthening their resilience and coping 
mechanisms as a means of preventing displacement, including in regions affected by 
drought. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Representative underlines the fact that a high level of humanitarian 
assistance remains indispensible in all parts of Somalia &#8212; including in more stable 
areas &#8212; to address, in particular, the immediate needs of newly arriving IDPs and the 
malnourishment in IDP settlements. Humanitarian access, in particular to critical 
areas in the central and southern regions of Somalia, is a major problem. The 
Representative recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Governmental authorities and other actors, including de facto 
authorities and armed groups with territorial control, should grant safe, timely, 
unconditional and unimpeded humanitarian access, including for delivering 
humanitarian goods to all the displaced, profiling, assessing and monitoring of the 
displacement situation, and collecting information on factors triggering displacement. 
They must ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel and respect their integrity, 
protect humanitarian transports and supplies, and refrain from diverting 
humanitarian goods. All actors should grant and facilitate the free passage of such 
humanitarian assistance and provide general tax and customs exemptions for 
humanitarian assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Humanitarian actors should substantially increase their humanitarian 
presence in Somalia. To the extent possible, the United Nations should shift operations 
from Nairobi to locations in Somalia, where adequate security can be ensured and 
from where the different parts of the country can be accessed. Agencies and 
organizations concerned should be provided with the staff and resources necessary to 
effectively work in a difficult and dangerous operational environment; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The United Nations Country Team should collect more precise figures on 
the displacement situation, in particular in the central and southern regions of 
Somalia, including by using satellite pictures, samples and spot checks to assess the 
magnitude of displacement.  </b></p>

<p>62. <b>The Representative is seriously concerned that IDPs encounter grave 
protection problems during their flight and in settlements of the displaced. In order to 
address the challenges in a comprehensive and cooperative way, the Representative 
recommends that the concerned authorities, working together with humanitarian and 
development actors: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Improve the living conditions and safety situation of IDPs in settlements 
by addressing the overcrowding of settlements, their haphazard layout, fragility of 
shelter, security of tenure and the high number of incidents of sexual and gender-
based violence;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Continue and expand existing protection initiatives, such as protection of 
livelihood projects, or prevention and response activities relating to sexual and 
gender-based violence;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen community mobilization and community-based protection 
initiatives, such as community policing and patrolling within settlements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Conclude agreements with private landowners on the allocation of land 
plots for IDPs, where they can settle with security of tenure and are protected from 
eviction and exploitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Strengthen and implement education and employment programmes for 
children and young adults, including skills and vocational training; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Strengthen the protection of women and girls from rape, domestic 
violence and other gender-based violence, including by providing protective shelter 
and better policing of high-risk areas. Women, in particular heads of households, 
should be empowered through programmes that support them to establish 
independent livelihoods. Victims of sexual and gender-based violence need to be 
provided with health care, psycho-social and rehabilitation support;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Strengthen the Somaliland Human Rights Commission as well as the 
legal aid project of the Hargeisa legal clinic and also consider establishing appropriate 
human rights protection mechanisms in Puntland. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Activities to protect and assist IDPs should be based on a participatory approach 
involving and benefiting IDPs as well as local communities. They should take into 
account persons with special needs, such as the disabled or traumatized, and the needs 
of children and young adults.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Representative stresses that internally displaced persons retain all their 
rights and freedoms and shall not be discriminated against, irrespective of where they 
come from. In particular, IDPs&#8217; right to seek safety in another part of the country and 
not be sent back to areas where their life and integrity could be at risk must be 
respected by all authorities. Somalis also retain their right to seek and enjoy asylum in 
other countries. Under the current circumstances there are generally no sufficiently 
safe internal flight alternatives within southern and central Somalia, Puntland or 
Somaliland, in particular bearing in mind the depth of the humanitarian crisis, the 
worsening security situation, clan dynamics and the overall lack of protection, 
especially for women and children. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Beyond humanitarian assistance and programmes addressing immediate 
protection needs, a more robust recovery and development impact is needed in areas 
that are sufficiently stable for relevant interventions. Recovery and development 
activities should focus on enhancing the reception and absorption capacities of host 
communities, strengthening and expanding basic infrastructure (in particular water 
and sanitation), basic services (in particular health and education), upgrading of </b></p>

<p><b>20</b> GE.10-10396 
</p>
<p><b>shelters, investment into education programmes and the generation of livelihood 
opportunities. Humanitarian and development actors should continue to pursue their 
activities in parallel.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Given the necessary support, some IDPs may be able to find durable solutions, 
particularly those in protracted displacement in Puntland and Somaliland who wish 
to integrate locally, and IDPs displaced by natural disasters. This would contribute to 
achieving stability and a sustainable peace in Somalia.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>With regard to recovery, development and durable solutions, the 
Representative recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The relevant authorities, humanitarian and development actors should 
undertake recovery and development interventions that establish basic services in 
areas where IDPs wish to integrate locally. They should prioritize programmes to 
provide shelter and housing, education, livelihood opportunities and elements of 
urban planning. The joint programmes for displaced communities in Hargeisa, 
Bossasso and Galkayo should be revived and implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The relevant authorities, working together with humanitarian and 
development actors, should address the situation of persons displaced by natural 
disasters, in particular pastoralists and nomads, with a view to finding durable 
solutions for them. Development interventions should aim to establish support systems 
allowing for sustainable living in disaster-affected rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Representative recalls that national authorities have the primary duty and 
responsibility to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons.</b>34<b> 
This applies to the Transitional Federal Government as well as to the authorities of 
Puntland and Somaliland. In order to support the authorities in assuming this 
responsibility, the Representative recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The United Nations Country Team should sensitize all authorities on the 
human rights of IDPs and build their capacity to better protect and assist the 
displaced through, inter alia, targeted training on the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Framework on Durable 
Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons;</b>35 
</p>
<p><b> (b) The United Nations Political Office for Somalia should include 
displacement issues in their capacity-building activities for the authorities at all levels, 
in particular the police, military and judicial authorities; 
 (c) The Transitional Federal Government should ratify the African Union 
Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in 
Africa. It should elaborate, with the support of the international community, a policy 
on IDPs based on this Convention, as well as on the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement, that takes into account the disparities between the different parts of 
Somalia; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council, in particular 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right 
to an adequate standard of living, together with the Special Rapporteur on the

<p><b>question of human rights and extreme poverty, should consider visiting Somalia in the 
near future.</b>36 
</p>
<p>68. <b>An urgent and greater degree of engagement by the international donor 
community is needed to provide substantial and sustained support to programmes to 
improve assistance and protection for the internally displaced, and proactively 
embark on bringing robust recovery development activities to areas of the country 
that are sufficiently stable for such measures, in order to prevent a further 
deterioration of the humanitarian and security situation and support durable 
solutions for IDPs in protracted situations. In particular, the Representative urges 
donors to support the activities outlined in the Consolidated Appeal for Somalia, as 
well as the joint programmes for displaced communities in Hargeisa, Bossasso and 
Galkayo. Continued humanitarian funding is necessary to ensure that critical 
activities, that are possible even under the present circumstances, are not stopped or 
can be resumed. The Representative underlines the conclusion of the Secretary-
General that a failure to do so could have serious implications for displacement and 
regional stability. He further supports the proposal to create a forum for dialogue 
between IDPs and the donor community to define concrete measures for how 
assistance can best be delivered to them.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Representative urges donors to continue funding urgently-needed 
humanitarian and development interventions in the central and southern regions of 
Somalia, including areas that are controlled by Al Shabaab. The Representative is 
concerned that those most in need remain without assistance. While noting the risk of 
aid being diverted by armed actors, he calls on donors not to attach unrealistic 
conditions to funding and to work closely with United Nations partners to adapt their 
funding modalities to the Somali context. Recalling the Principles and Good Practice 
of Humanitarian Donorship, he stresses that any politicization of humanitarian 
assistance must be avoided.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Representative underlines the crucial role of the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund to cover the critical gap in early recovery funding. He urges the 
Peacebuilding Support Office to increase its efforts to support projects that enhance 
the reception and absorption capacities for IDPs in Somaliland and Puntland. He 
further invites the Peacebuilding Commission to consider addressing the Somali 
situation.
