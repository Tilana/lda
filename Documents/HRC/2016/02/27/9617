Second session 
Agenda item 2 
</p>
<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Algeria (on behalf of the African Group):  draft decision 
2006/&#8230; Outcome of the second session of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council decides to adopt the following text: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Human Rights Council convened its second regular session from 
18 September to 6 October 2006 in Geneva primarily to consider the reports of its special 
procedures and to engage in interactive dialogue with mandate holders.  The Council also 
considered the reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
the various thematic human rights issues and heard the oral reports of the Open-Ended 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the issue of reviewing and, where necessary, 
improving and rationalizing all mandates, mechanisms, functions and responsibilities and 
of the Open-Ended Intergovernmental Working Group to develop the modalities of the 
universal periodic review mechanism describing progress made on their recent informal 
consultations regarding these two critical transitional issues. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Having devoted its complete attention to the three processes outlined above, 
the Council adopts the following decisions as a reflection of the outcome of its 
second session. 
</p>
<p>GE.06-14456  (E)    041006 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Bearing in mind its decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006 to extend all mandates, 
mechanisms, functions and responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights for one 
year, the Council underlines that the two resolutions adopted at its special sessions shall 
not be affected by the present decision.  In this regard, the Council reaffirms the primary 
importance of the implementation of the resolutions adopted at its two special sessions 
without any undue delays. 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;The Human Rights Council therefore decides: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(<i>a</i>) To take note of the open interactive dialogue between the Council and 
special procedures mandate holders on the various reports submitted to the Council.  The 
Council reaffirms its earlier undertaking to finalize the review and rationalization of all 
its special procedures and the establishment of the universal periodic review mechanism 
before 18 June 2007 in keeping with paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 
of 15 March 2006; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(<i>b</i>) Also to take note of the relevant reports submitted by the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Secretary-General; 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;(<i>c</i>) Further to take note of the oral reports presented by the Open-Ended 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the Review of Mandates and the Open-Ended 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism, and 
requests the Working Groups to take them into account in their deliberations at their 
respective forthcoming sessions.&#8221;
