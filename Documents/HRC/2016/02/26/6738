<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the particularity of Occupied East Jerusalem in its rich religious and cultural 
heritage and affirming the need to preserve its Christian and Islamic holy sites as part of 
preserving human religious and cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the responsibility of the international community to promote human rights and 
ensure respect for international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates 
that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without 
distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and that no distinction shall be made on 
the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which 
a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing, or under any other 
limitation of sovereignty, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>relevant Security Council resolutions on Occupied East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply</i> <i>concerned </i>at the vast ongoing digging and excavations by Israel, the occupying 
Power, beneath and around Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam&#8217;s third holiest shrine, which are 
blatant violations of the provisions of the instruments and resolutions referred to above and 
emphasizing their detrimental effects on this shrine of worldwide religious, cultural and 
historical significance, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply</i> <i>concerned also </i>at the Israeli policy of closures and the severe restrictions, 
including curfews and the permit regime, that continue to be imposed on the movement of 
Palestinians and their free access to their holy sites, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, cease immediately the ongoing 
digging and excavation activities of all kinds beneath and around Al-Aqsa Mosque compound 
and refrain from any acts or operations that may endanger the structure or foundations or change 
the nature of the holy sites, both Islamic and Christian, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Stresses </i>that all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to 
limit access of Palestinians to their holy sites, particularly in Occupied East Jerusalem, on the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>basis of national origin, religion, birth, sex or any other status are in violation of the 
provisions of the above-mentioned instruments and resolutions and, therefore, must cease 
immediately; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to respect the religious and cultural rights 
contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
