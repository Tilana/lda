SUMMING UP

Madam Assessor and Gentlemen Assessors.

1.      
It is now my duty to sum up this case to you. I will direct you on 
matters of Law which you must accept and act upon. On matters of fact however, which witnesses to accept as reliable, which version of the evidence to accept, these are matters for you to decide for yourselves. So if I express my opinion to you about the facts of the case, or if I appear to do so it is a matter for you whether you accept what I say, or form your own opinions. In other words you are the judges of fact. All matters of fact are for you to decide. It is for you to decide the credibility of the witnesses and what parts of their evidence you accept as true and what parts you reject.

2.      
You decide what facts are proved and what inferences you properly draw from those facts. You then apply the Law as I explain it to you and form your opinion as to whether the accused persons are guilty or not guilty.

3.      
The Counsels for the Prosecution and Defence made submissions to you about the facts of this case. That is their duty as State Counsel and Defence Counsel. But it is a matter for you to decide which version of the facts to accept, or reject.

4.      
You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions but merely your opinion themselves, and your opinions need not be unanimous but it would be desirable if you could agree on them. Your opinions are not binding on me but I can tell you that they will carry great weight with me when I deliver my judgment.

5.      
As a matter of law, I must direct you that the onus or burden of proof 
rests on the prosecution and it never shifts. There is no obligation on the three accused persons to prove their innocence. Under our criminal justice system an accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. 

6.      
The standard of proof in a criminal trial is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means you must be satisfied so that you are sure of each of the accused person's guilt before you can express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about his guilt then you must express an opinion that he is not guilty.

7.      
Your decisions must be solely and exclusively upon the evidence which you have heard in this court and upon nothing else. You must disregard anything you might have heard about this case, outside of this courtroom. You may have seen news items in news papers about this case before and during the trial. You must disregard them and your opinions should only be based on the evidence given in this court room. 

8.      
Your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence, apply the Law to 
those facts. 

9.      
The 1st and the 2nd accused persons in this trial are charged with two counts of murder in counts 1 and 2 in the information. In count No.1, it is alleged that on 19th December 2009 the 1st and 2nd accused persons murdered Ashok Chand. In count No. 2, it is alleged that on the 19th December 2009 the 1st and the 2nd accused persons murdered Mohini Lata.

10.     
The 1st and the 2nd accused persons are charged with two separate counts of murder in count no. 1 and 2 in the information. You must consider the evidence on each count separately and must not assume that if any of the accused persons are guilty on one count, that he must be guilty on the other as well. It is your duty to consider whether the prosecution has proven the accused person's guilt beyond reasonable doubt on each count separately.

11.     
The offence of murder has three elements which the prosecution 
must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt.

They are: 

1.      
That the accused did an unlawful act; 
2.      
That this unlawful act caused the death of the victim;
3.      
That the accused acted with malice aforethought. 

12.     
I will now explain these three elements to you. 

13.     
An unlawful act is something done by a person that is against the law. A very common example of unlawful act is where a person deliberately applies force to another person without legal justification. If a person intentionally strikes another person without legal justification then that is a criminal assault. In such circumstances a person who deliberately punches, kicks or hits another person without legal justification then that is a criminal assault. In this case it is for the prosecution to prove that the accused persons did an unlawful act. The prosecution alleges that the two deceased persons were stabbed to death and that the 1st and the 2nd accused persons committed the unlawful act, acting in joint enterprise. I will explain to you about the law on joint enterprise later. 

13.     
The second element of the offence of murder that must be proved is that the unlawful act caused the death of the victim. The law requires a link between the unlawful act and the death. Usually the unlawful act causes some specific injury to the victim and that particular injury causes the victims' death. Usually the unlawful act causes an injury which is the sole cause of death. But it is sufficient if it is an operating or substantial cause of death. In this case it is evident by the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist Dr. Goundar, that the cause of death of both the victims was Haemothorax due to multiple stab injuries to the chest.

14.     
The third element that must be proved for the crime of murder is that the person who caused the death of another by an unlawful act did so with "malice aforethought". This is a legal term which describes a particular intention or state of mind.

15.     
It is an intention to cause death or grievous harm to the victim or knowledge that death or grievous harm would probably be caused.

16.     
Grievous harm means any bodily hurt which seriously or permanently injures health or which is likely to seriously or permanently injure health.

17.     
Therefore the State must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the 1st and the 2nd accused persons committed an unlawful act causing the death of the victims and at that time they intended to cause serious or permanent injury to the deceased or they knew that serious or permanent injury would be likely to be caused to the victims.

18.     
You must not find the accused persons' guilty of murder unless you are sure that the accused persons, when they did the act, intended to kill or cause grievous harm to the deceased persons. In deciding whether they intended to kill or cause grievous harm you must take into account the evidence which was given in Court. 

19.     
You should consider all the proved facts and circumstances, and from them you are entitled to draw proper inferences as to the accused persons' conduct, knowledge and intentions.

20.     
A person's intentions are locked up in his mind. The intent cannot be physically observed. However this intent can be proved by what he said or told others including his statement to the police, or can be inferred from his conduct prior to, during and subsequent to the commission of the offence.

21.     
The other relevant factors when considering the intent to cause death or grievous harm may be the weapon used, the nature of the injuries inflicted and their number, where on the body the victim was struck. 

In this case the deceased Ashok Chand had 17 stab injuries and deceased Mohini Lata had 13 stab injuries according to the post mortem reports and the evidence of the Pathologist. According to the pathologist the weapon used was a sharp object. On these factors you may infer whether the accused persons intended to cause death or grievous harm on the deceased persons.

22.     
In count No. 3, the 4th accused Apenisa Lino is charged with the offence of accessory after the fact to murder under the section 388 of the Penal Code. Prosecution does not allege that he was a party to murder. The section 388 says that a person who assists another who is, to his knowledge, guilty of an offence, in order to enable him to escape punishment, is said to become an accessory after the fact to the offence.

23.     
The elements of the offence are

1.      
 The accused
2.      
Assisted another
3.      
Who to his knowledge had committed an offence
4.      
In order to enable him to escape punishment.

In this case the prosecution says that the accused Apenisa assisted Eparama by burning the blood stained clothes and by keeping the knife at his house. You must consider the evidence in relation to each element carefully. Corporal Taufa said in evidence that Eparama revealed about the knife and at the 4th accused's house Eparama showed them the knife. Sergeant Apimeleki in his evidence said that after seizing the knife the owner of the house led the police to the yard and had showed them the place where they burnt some blood stained clothes that were brought by Eparama. In his caution 

interview statement the 4th accused had said that the clothes were burnt accidentally. Further the 4th accused had said that Eparama brought the plastic bag containing a kitchen knife and clothes and that Eparama left the kitchen knife on the table and threw the plastic bag to the rubbish dump where it has been burnt. However, for the purpose of this offence, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the 4th accused gave active assistance to whom he knew had committed an offence before you can find him guilty on count No. 3.

The fourth count is against the accused persons including the 2nd accused for unlawful use of motor vehicle. The 2nd accused pleaded guilty to the said count and you need not concern about the 4th count. However merely because he pleaded guilty to the 4th count, you must not assume the he is guilty to counts No. 1 and 2 as well. Prosecution must prove each count separately beyond reasonable doubt to find the accused person guilty on each count. 

24.     
As a matter of law I must also direct you on the law of joint enterprise. When an offence is committed, the person who actually does the act which constitutes the offence is not the only person who is deemed to have committed the offence. Anyone who does an act for the purpose of helping another person to commit the offence is also deemed to be guilty of the offence. Therefore to give you an example, a person who stands at the door of a house which is broken into, to warn those who have gone in, of anyone who might disturb the burglars, is as guilty of burglary as those who broke in, even if the watchman remained outside, and never entered the house at all. He is guilty because he has aided and abetted the burglars.

25.     
The law also says that where two or more persons form a common intention, to do something unlawful together, and while doing something to further that purpose, an offence is committed of such a nature that its commission was a probable consequence of that purpose, each of those who had formed the common intention and had furthered that intention, is deemed to have committed the offence.

26.     
Let me give you an example. When several men decide to break into a house armed with dangerous weapons, and they are disturbed by a policeman who is killed because of the a man uses his weapon, each of the accused is guilty of the murder of the policeman even if only person used the weapon. This is because, when several people decide to commit burglary with dangerous weapons, the fact that the weapons might be used, and someone is killed as a result, is a probable consequence of the common intention to commit burglary with weapons. However, if the use of weapons was not contemplated by the others, and they did not know that the main offender was carrying a weapon, then there is no joint enterprise, and the secondary parties cannot be guilty of the murder.

27.     
The question of whether there was such a common intention in this case, shared by each of the accused, and whether the deaths of Ashok Chand and Mohini Lata were a probable consequence of that common intention, is a matter for you to decide, on the basis of the evidence in this case. In this case the 2nd accused giving evidence said that the 1st accused told him pick something as a weapon. As he couldn't find anything, 1st accused had given him an iron rod as a weapon. Further he admitted that he agreed to assist the 1st accused in the robbery as Apenisa who was expected to join the 1st accused Eparama did not come. There must be evidence either direct or circumstantial of common intention. Sometimes however, the common intention would occur on the spur of the moment.

28.     
In this case the prosecution says that the 2nd accused acted in joint enterprise with the 1st accused in committing the murders of the two deceased persons. There is no dispute that they had a common intention to commit robbery. Therefore you must consider whether the 2nd accused could have had the knowledge that a probable consequence of grievous hurt or death could result in carrying out their joint enterprise.

29.     
I will now direct you on accomplice evidence. The prosecution relies on the evidence, to some extent, of the witness Soroveli. Soroveli in his evidence said that he informed the others about the safe in Ashok's house. He also admitted in evidence that he was involved in planning of the robbery and that he was also there in the premises at the time the murder was committed. Soroveli is an accomplice in respect of the offences charged.

30.     
In law, the evidence of an accomplice is considered dangerous to rely upon, because accomplices may have an agenda or a reason to give evidence for the State, implicating the accused persons. In this case charges against Soroveli were dropped, or discontinued on the condition that he gives evidence for the State in this case. The letter of immunity by the Director of Public Prosecutions reads as follows:

"On the basis of your signed statement to the police dated 6th July 2010 which you have acknowledged as true and correct, and, in the 

interest of justice; I am prepared to grant you immunity from prosecution in respect of the offence of murder pursuant to Section 199 and 200 of the Penal Code Act 17.

The offer of immunity is made on the basis that you, Soroveli Vura Quataki if called by the state as a witness in the trial of Eperama Nume, Joveci Naika and Apenisa Lino, will give truthful evidence in accordance with the aforementioned statement. Failure to give evidence in accordance with your statement will invalidate this immunity."

31.     
The fact that Soroveli has been given immunity from prosecution means that he has nothing to gain from giving evidence which might exonerate himself from blame. Nevertheless there is still a danger in accepting his evidence because he may have given a false account to the police in order to save his own skin, and to get immunity. The letter given to him means that if he does not give evidence in accordance with the statement he has given the police, he may be prosecuted for the offences himself.

32.     
The giving of immunity from prosecution to give evidence in exchange is the reason why Mr. Soroveli has given evidence. On the ground that he is an accomplice and considering the fact that he has been granted immunity from prosecution to give evidence on condition that he gives evidence along the lines of his police statement, I must warn you that it is unsafe to convict the accused persons on Mr. Soroveli's evidence alone, and without corroboration from other sources. Before you consider whether there is corroboration of Soroveli's evidence, you must first ask yourselves whether his evidence is credible, that is, whether it is capable of belief, and then whether you believe the evidence that he gave is such that you can rely upon it, and accept as being the truth.

33.     
Corroboration is some independent evidence, which implicate the accused in the commission of the offence. In considering the evidence of Mr. Soroveli, you must look for corroboration of his evidence because it is unsafe to convict without such evidence. In the course of this summing up I will direct you as to what evidence is capable of corroborating Mr. Soroveli's evidence. It is matter for you to decide whether you accept the evidence as being corroboration in fact, and whether, you accept the evidence of Mr. Soroveli as being credible and reliable.

34.     
May I now direct you on circumstantial evidence. 

35.     
In circumstantial evidence you are asked to piece the story together from witnesses who did not actually see the crime committed, but give evidence of other circumstances and events that may bring you to a sufficiently certain conclusion regarding the commission of the alleged crime.

36.     
I cite the following situation as an example for circumstantial evidence. In a silent night you hear cries of a man from a neighboring house. You come out to see that a man named 'X' is running away from that house with an object in his hand. Out of curiosity you go inside the house to see what really had happened. You see your neighbor 'y' lying fallen with injuries. Here you didn't see 'x' committing any act on 'Y'. The two independent things you saw were the circumstances of the given situation. You can connect the two things that you saw and draw certain inferences. An inference you may draw would be, that 'X' caused the injury on 'Y'. In drawing that inference you must make sure that it is the only inference that could be drawn and no other inferences that could have been possibly drawn from the said circumstances. That should also be the inescapable inference that could be drawn against X in the circumstances. Further in evidence, one witness may prove one thing and another witness may prove another thing. None of those things separately alone may be sufficient to establish guilt but taken together may lead to the conclusion that the accused committed the crime. 

37.     
Therefore you must consider all direct evidence as well as circumstantial evidence. 

38.     
It must not be mere speculation guesswork. It is not sufficient that the proved circumstances are merely consistent with the Accused persons having committed the crime. To find him guilty you must be satisfied so as to feel sure that an inference of guilt is the only rational conclusion to be drawn from the combined effect of all the facts proved. It must be an inference that satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused persons committed the crime.

39.     
Before you can draw any reasonable inferences you must first be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence given by witnesses relating to the circumstances giving rise to the issues of fact to be proven, is credible and truthful.

40.     
I must also direct you on hearsay evidence. You may have heard witnesses referring to what they heard from other people who have not given evidence. Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person who is supposed to have said the words, has not come to court to verify those words. What other people hear or say they hear, cannot therefore be given much weight, because the person who said the words has not come to give evidence about it, and cannot be cross examined about it. 

41.     
The 2nd accused in his evidence said that when Mohini Lata came down from wooden stairs she was holding a kitchen knife and a piece of iron. Further he said that he saw Eparama trying to pull the piece of metal and kitchen knife from Mohini and by the time he came towards Eparama, he (Eparama) pulled out the kitchen knife from Mohini's hand.

42.     
On the above evidence I must direct you on the law of self-defence. You must first consider whether you believe or accept the truthfulness of the above piece of evidence of the 2nd accused. If you believe that the said evidence, then you must consider whether the 1st accused acted in self-defence.

43.     
As a matter of law I must direct you that when a man or woman acts in self-defence to protect himself or his family, he or she is not acting unlawfully. The law defines self-defence as a legal right to defend oneself and to do anything that is reasonably necessary to protect oneself from attack or injury. The law on self-defence is not a charter for revenge or retaliation. So you should think carefully about whether the deceased, Mohini Lata, attacked or tried to attack the accused, and whether in stabbing the deceased, the accused was doing what was necessary to protect himself or whether he was acting out of anger and retaliation. In considering whether the accused acted reasonably, you must ask yourselves what a reasonable man in the accused's shoes would have done to defend himself. You need to ask yourselves the following questions:

1.      
Did the deceased attack or assault the accused?

2.      
Did the accused believe that he was under attack?

3.      
Did the accused stab the deceased in order to defend himself?

4.      
Was his assault on the deceased reasonably necessary to defend himself? Was it proportionate to what the deceased was doing to him?

5.      
In considering whether the accused acted reasonably ask yourselves what a reasonable person in the accused's shoes would have done? Would he stab the deceased in the way that he did? Could he have removed himself from the situation instead of stabbing her?

You may also consider the number of stab injuries the deceased, Mohini Lata, had received.

44.     
However in considering self-defence, think of the deceased's conduct and the accused's conduct. Was the accused acting in retaliation? Compare also the gender of the accused and the deceased. Was it natural for the accused to fear the deceased's assault? These are the questions you must ask yourselves.

45.     
As a matter of law, once the accused raises the issue of self-defence as he has done in this case, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the accused was not acting in self-defence and you must be satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt. Because self-defence is a complete defence, if you believe that the accused stabbed the deceased in self-defence, or if you have a reasonable doubt about it you must give your opinions that the accused is not guilty of any offence.

46.     
As a matter of Law, I must tell you that a witness can give evidence on his observations like what he heard, what he saw, and what he perceived. Only on certain circumstances court would allow witnesses to give their opinions on the matter. These witnesses should be experts on that particular subject. For example you get experts in medical field. Forensic Pathologist Dr. Ramswamy Goundar, Dr. Elvin Ondbit and Dr. James Danford gave evidence, and their expertise as forensic Pathologist and medical doctors was not challenged and therefore their opinions are admissible 

47.     
On the basis of these legal principles that I have explained to you, you must consider the evidence in the case and decide what has been proved. As I said earlier it is your function to assess the credibility of witnesses. You decide who is truthful and to be believed.

The Evidence

48.     
Prosecution called 19 witnesses to give evidence.

49.     
The first witness was the brother of the deceased Ashok Chand. He has spoken to his brother Ashok Chand for the last time on 19/12/2009. Thereafter although he called Ashok on several occasions the phone was not answered, he said. The same day when he called at about 7.30 to 8.00pm the phone rang but no answer and it had got disconnected he said.

50.     
On 4/1/2010 he had gone to check at Ashok's factory to see whether it was closed. Then he had gone to Mohini Lata's mother's place to get a clue about Ashok and Mohini, they had no idea, he said. He reported the matter to the Police on the same day on the 4th January 2010. At about 5.00pm he went to the factory with two police officers, entered the compound and there was no sign of any break-in.

51.     
Police have confirmed from Immigration that Ashok and Mohini had not left the country.

52.     
The next day on the instructions of the police he went to the factory and a team of police officers had been already waiting for the forensic team. After the police had secured the scene of crime he went back to Valelevu Police Station. Next day he identified Ashok Chand's body at the CWM Hospital.

53.     
The next witness was WPC 4243 Maria Ratuvatu.

54.     
On 31/12/2009 she had been checking drivers for drunken driving from 8.00pm to 4.00am at Davuilevu.

55.     
Whilst on duty she had seen a vehicle heading towards Nausori and then after parking for some time, its lights had turned off. Then the vehicle had taken a U-turn and made its way towards Suva. The time then was around 2.00am. They chased the said vehicle and stopped at Koronivia Road.

56.     
The driver had no valid driving license. When asked for the name of the driver, he had said, Eparama.

57.     
They had seized the vehicle. The registration number of the vehicle had been Kura01, a Mitsubishi Pajero. There had been another 2 persons in the back seat of the said vehicle. The driver had not answered when asked for the vehicle owner, but a person who was sitting in the vehicle had said it belonged to his uncle.

58.     
They were advised to inform the owner of the vehicle to get the vehicle from LTA office.

59.     
At about 4.00am the same day she had seen them walking towards Suva at 10 miles.

60.     
Thereafter at Valelevu Police Station on 8/1/2010 she had identified two of the boys again, sitting under the mango tree.

61.     
She had then informed Sgt Mosese and then Sgt Apimeleki about the two boys, that they were in the said vehicle on 31/12/09.

62.     
She said that the driver who identified himself as Eparama was not in Court. However she identified the 2nd accused as one of the boys who was in the vehicle, Kura01.

63.     
The next witness was Nitesh Prasad.

64.     
Eparama the 1st Accused had been his neighbor at Wainibuku. Eparama was known as Mana. On 4/1/2010 Eparama had brought a laptop saying that he was going to his village and that there was no electricity in the village. Therefore he had wanted to exchange the laptop with a mobile phone.

65.     
Eparama also had told him that the laptop was sent to him by his sister from overseas. Later, after about one week police had come searching for the laptop and he handed over the laptop to the police. He identified the said laptop. His evidence was not challenged by the defence.

59.     
Prosecution called Soroveli Vura to give evidence next.

60.     
He had been given immunity in this case by the Director of Public Prosecutions. He had been working in the Kura Soap Factory. Owners of the factory were Ashok Chand and Mohini Lata. Joveci Naika and Apenisa were working there with him. Joveci was a schoolmate of the witness.

61.     
On the 19th December when he was working with Joveci, Joveci had phoned his cousin Eparama also known as Mana, and had asked him to come to the factory. Joveci entered the factory by climbing over the fence at the back of the factory. Ashok Chand had gone out to the New World Supermarket.

62.     
Both Joveci and Mana had come to the factory climbing the fence. After a while Ashok had come back. Mohini had been upstairs. He had gone to Ashok to tell him that Joveci was still working although he was sacked before. Then, Ashok had gone to the staff toilet in the ground floor.

63.     
Witness had seen a hand waving out of the toilet and he identified it as Mana's. Then Mana had grabbed Ashok Chand by the collar and had stabbed Ashok about 8 times on the stomach. This stabbing had taken place outside the toilet. At that time he had not seen Joveci. Ashok after being stabbed was breathing heavily and had been trying to take his breath he said. Ashok then had been lying down in a pool of blood.

64.     
Then he had seen Mohini Lata coming down the wooden stairs. Mana had asked Joveci to grab and hold Mohini Lata. Then Joveci had come out of the toilet and grabbed Mohini Lata from her side. The witness demonstrated to you how Joveci did that. Then he had made Mohini sit on the toilet pan. Mana had been standing there.

65.     
Joveci had been still inside the toilet. Then Mana had asked the witness whether he was okay. After that Mana had gone back to Joveci and had spoken to Joveci in Fijian. The witness said that he was standing there and could not do anything as he was afraid. Then Eparama had started to stab Mohini Lata. Joveci had been standing beside Eparama.

66.     
After stabbing Mohini Lata, Eparama had come to him and told him to show him the safe. He had gone upstairs with Joveci and Eparama to look for the safe where they worship. They could not find the safe. He said that he was afraid thinking that they would do the same thing to him what they did to his boss and he could not show them the safe. He had then come down to the bleach section, picked up his bag and through the fence had gone home.


67.     
He did not tell his father or his uncle who had been there about the incident. He had had a shower and gone to sleep. He had not gone to the Police Station thinking that he would be accused of the incident.

68.     
The following day evening Joveci had come and given him two bangles. He had given the two bangles to his grandmother in exchange of cigarettes. During the Christmas time in December Joveci had come and asked him to go with him to Valelevu to steal the vehicle from the kura factory. On that day they had not managed to get the vehicle.

69.     
He had again come back to the factory at about 8.00pm with Joveci and Ratu Josua Eseroma. They have taken the vehicle registration number Kura 01 which was parked on the road. Eseroma had been driving.

70.     
After seeing a checkpoint they had made an about turn where LTA and police officers had chased them and stopped them at Koronivia Road. They were taken to the Nausori Police Station where Ratu Josua was taken in. He had walked home with Joveci and Joveci had slept with him that night. 

71.     
He was then arrested by Police on a Friday morning and taken to Valelevu Police Station. When they were sitting outside, a woman police officer had identified Joveci. Joveci was taken for interview and after that witness had also been interviewed at the upstairs of Police Station in a room. He said he was in the Police Station for two days and was interviewed from morning to evening. He could not recall the day of the interview but was the same day of his arrest.

Madam and Gentlemen Assessors, at the end of the prosecution case you heard me explain several options to the accused persons. They have these options because they do not have to prove anything. The burden to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt remains on the prosecution at all times.

129.    
The 1st and the 4th accused persons opted to remain silent and that is their right to do so. You must now draw any adverse inferences from their choice to remain silent.

132.    
On 19/12/2009 Soro and the witness 2nd accused, had started work in the morning. Soro had told him to send a call back text to Eparama. Eparama had then called back. He had told Eparama that Soro had told him to tell Eparama to come with Apenisa because Ashok is about to go for delivery. Apenisa had not been available and therefore Eparama had come alone in a taxi. Joveci had been staying outside for Eparama as Eparama had not come to the factory before.

133.    
Then two of them had climbed over the fence and entered the factory premises. Eparama had told him that one of them should assist him in the robbery. He had agreed to go with Eparama. Eparama had entered inside the factory from the main door. 

134.

136.

139.    
Eparama had called him to call Soro from his mobile phone. Before calling Soro, he had told Soro not to do anything to Mohini. After calling Soroveli, he had opened the white door for Soroveli to come in. He had called Soroveli as he was the only person who knew the safe. He had gone upstairs with Soroveli and searched for the safe. They had not found any safe. After about 15 minutes Eparama had come upstairs. He had asked Eparama about Mohini and Eparama had said that Mohini was in the toilet. When asked, Eparama had said that Mohini was still alive. They had looked for the safe again but not found.

142.

He admitted that he agreed to assist Eparama in the robbery. He also admitted that he held the T shape iron rod which Eparama gave him. The iron rod he was holding had fallen making a noise.
 
144.

He admitted that he did not tell the Magistrates' Court that he was assaulted by police. He said that after he saw what happened to Ashok, he listened to music till 3.00pm in the bleach room.

146.    
Answering the questions by the Counsel for 1st accused Eparama, he said that when he saw the confrontation between Eparama and Mohini, he saw Mohini holding a kitchen knife and a piece of iron. He also had seen Eparama pulled out the kitchen knife from Mohini's hand and by that time he had got injured when Eparama swung the hand. He said the plan was to rob the factory to get the safe, but the plan went wrong leaving two people dead.

147. In re-examination he said that he did not escape when he went to open the white door to Soro, as he was scared of Eparama. He said that he did not report to the police as he was scared of his cousin, that he would do the same thing he did to Ashok to him.

That was the evidence for defence.

Madam and Gentlemen Assessors,

148.    
The caution interview statements of the accused persons were produced in evidence. Remember, whatever each accused had told in his cautioned interview statement, is evidence only against the accused who made it, and cannot be taken against other accused persons. In their caution interview statements 1st and the 2nd accused persons have given their versions on the sequence of events that took place. Both accused persons alleged assault and being threatened in police custody. Police officers denied any kind of assault or threat to accused persons. What weight you give to the caution interview statements of the accused persons is a matter for you. 

149.    
You may also consider whether the evidence of the accomplice Soroveli is corroborated by the caution interview statements of the 1st and the 2nd accused persons.

150.    
Police officers who visited the crime scene gave evidence as to what they observed, like the bodies of the deceased persons, blood stains, the items uplifted and how the place was ransacked. You may also consider whether those items of evidence corroborate the evidence of Soroveli, the accomplice.

151.    
The 2nd accused gave evidence giving his version of events. He gave evidence incriminating the 1st accused. You may consider that his evidence is admissible as any other witness's evidence in the case. However you need to consider his evidence with care and caution, because he may have an interest on his own purpose of saving himself.

152.    
You may also consider whether the evidence of the 2nd accused corroborate the evidence of the accomplice Soroveli.

153.    
The written agreed facts are before you. You may accept those facts as if they had been led from witnesses from the witness box.

154.    
Madam and Gentlemen assessors, you heard the evidence of many witnesses for several days on behalf of the prosecution and the defence. If I did not mention a particular witness or a particular piece of evidence, that does not mean it's unimportant. You should consider and evaluate all the evidence in coming to your decision.

155.    
You must decide which witnesses are reliable and which are not. You have to consider as to how the witnesses faced the examination-in-chief and how they answered the questions in cross examination. You must consider whether the witnesses were forthright in their answers, or whether they were evasive, when deciding on the reliability of witnesses and acceptability of their evidence.

156.    
You may have observed that when some witnesses gave evidence, there were some inconsistencies between the evidence before this court and the statement given to the police. What you should take into consideration is only the evidence given by the witness in court and not any other previous statement given by the witness. However you should also take into consideration the fact that such inconsistencies between the evidence before court and statement to police can affect the credibility of the witness.

157.    
You may use your commonsense when deciding on the facts.

158.    
Approach the evidence with detachment and objectivity. Do not get carried away by emotion.

159.    
I have explained the legal principles to you. You will have to evaluate all the evidence and apply the law as I explained to you when you consider the charges against the accused persons has been proved beyond reasonable doubt

160.    
Your possible opinions on each accused on each count are either 
Guilty, or Not Guilty.

161.    
Madam and Gentlemen assessors, this concludes my summing up on 
the law. Now you may retire and deliberate together and may form your individual opinions on the charges against the accused persons. You may peruse any of the exhibits you like to consider. When you have reached your separate opinions you will come back to court and you will be asked to state your separate opinion.

162.    
You may retire to consider your opinions.
