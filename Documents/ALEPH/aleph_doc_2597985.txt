The  Company  reports  below  on  whether  it  has  followed  each  of  the  recommendations  during  the 
2015/2016 financial year (Reporting Period).  The information in this statement is current at and was 
approved by a resolution of the Board on 29 August 2016.  
 
Principle 1 – Lay solid foundations for management and oversight 
 
Recommendation 1.1 
 
The Company has established the respective roles and responsibilities of its Board and management, 
and  those  matters  expressly  reserved  to  the  Board  and  those  delegated  to  management  and  has 
documented this in its Board Charter.
Recommendation 1.2
The  Company  undertakes  appropriate  checks  before  appointing  a  person,  or  putting  forward  to 
shareholders  a  candidate  for  election  as  a  director  and  provides  shareholders  with  all  material 
information in its possession relevant to a decision on whether or not to elect or re-elect a director.
The  checks  which  are  undertaken,  and  the  information  provided  to  shareholders  are  set  out  in  the 
Company’s Policy and Procedure for the Selection and (Re)Appointment of Directors.
Syndicated Metals Limited - Corporate Governance Statement
Recommendation 1.3
The Company has a written agreement with each director and senior executive setting out the terms of 
their  appointment.    The  material  terms  of  any  employment,  service  or  consultancy  agreement  the 
Company, or any of its child entities, has entered into with its Managing Director, any of its directors, 
and any other person or entity who is a related party of the Managing Director or any of its directors 
has  been  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ASX  Listing  Rule  3.16.4  (taking  into  consideration  the 
exclusions from disclosure outlined in that rule).
Recommendation 1.4
The Company Secretary is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do 
with the proper functioning of the Board as outlined in the Company’s Board Charter.  The Company 
Secretary’s role is also outlined in the employment agreement between the Company Secretary and 
the Company.
Recommendation 1.5
The Company has a Diversity Policy, pursuant to which the Board may set measurable objectives for 
achieving gender diversity that are appropriate for the Company, and if objectives are set, to assess 
annually both the objectives and the Company’s progress in achieving them. 
 
The Company’s Diversity Policy does not require the Board to set measurable objectives for achieving 
gender  diversity,  nor  has  the  Board  set  measurable  objectives  for  achieving  gender  diversity.    The 
Board  considers  that  it  is  not  practical  at  this  stage  of  the  Company’s  operations  to  establish 
measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity given the small number of employees.  However, 
the Board will review this position as its circumstances change.
The respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in senior executive positions and across 
the whole organisation are set out in the following table.  “Senior executive” for these purposes means 
those persons who have the opportunity to materially influence the integrity, strategy and operation of 
the Company and its financial performance.
Whole organisation 
Senior executive positions

The  Chair  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  performance  of  the  Board,  Board  committees  and 
individual  directors  in  accordance  with  the  process  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  Process  for 
Performance Evaluations.   
 
During the Reporting Period an evaluation of the Board, its committees and individual directors took 
place  in  accordance  with  the  process  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  Process  for  Performance 
Evaluations.   
 
Recommendation 1.7 
 
The  Managing  Director  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  performance  of  senior  executives  in 
accordance with the process disclosed in the Company’s Process for Performance Evaluations.   
 
During  the  Reporting  Period  an  evaluation  of  senior  executives  in  accordance  with  the  process 
disclosed  in  the  Company’s  Process  for  Performance  Evaluations  did  not  take  place  as  all  senior 
executive roles were terminated in November 2015.
Syndicated Metals Limited - Corporate Governance Statement
Principle 2 – Structure the board to add value 
 
Recommendation 2.1 
 
The  Board  has  not  established  a  separate  Nomination  Committee.    Given  the  current  size  and 
composition  of  the  Board,  the  Board  believes  that  there  would  be  no  efficiencies  gained  by 
establishing  a  separate  Nomination  Committee.    Accordingly,  the  Board  performs  the  role  of  the 
Nomination Committee.   
 
Although  the  Board  has  not  established  a  separate  Nomination  Committee,  it  has  adopted  a 
Nomination Committee Charter, which describes the role, composition, functions and responsibilities 
of  the  full  Board  in  its  capacity  as  the  Nomination  Committee.    When  the  Board  convenes  as  the 
Nomination  Committee  it  carries  out  those  functions  which  are  delegated  to  it  in  the  Company’s 
Nomination  Committee  Charter.    Items  that  are  usually  required  to  be  discussed  by  a  Nomination 
Committee are marked as separate agenda items at Board meetings when required.  The Board deals 
with  any  conflicts  of  interest  that  may  occur  when  convening  in  the  capacity  of  the  Nomination 
Committee  by  ensuring  that  the  director  with  conflicting  interests  is  not  party  to  the  relevant 
discussions.
The full Board did not convene as a Nomination Committee during the Reporting Period as there were 
no positions requiring Nomination Committee consideration.
The Company’s Nomination Committee Charter is disclosed on the Company’s website.
Recommendation 2.2
The  Company’s  objective  is  to  have  an  appropriate  mix  of  skills  and  diversity  on  its  Board  and 
Committees to enable it to effectively carry out its oversight and corporate governance responsibilities.  
 
The  Board  currently  has  the  following  mix  of  skills,  expertise,  qualifications  and  experience 
represented by its members:  
 
Expertise 
Strategy 
Governance and compliance 
Health and safety 
Risk management 
Executive management 
Commercial acumen 
Financial knowledge and experience 
 
Qualifications 
Geological qualifications 
Mining engineering qualifications 
Management qualifications. 
 
Experience 
Mining industry experience 
Technical experience 
Operational experience 
Project development skill and experience 
Business development skill and experience 
Equity and debt financing experience 
 
The Board is not currently looking to increase its size.  However, as the Company’s activities develop, 
the  Board  will  consider  the  appointment  of  a  further  independent  director,  ideally  with  financial 
qualifications, to support and strengthen the current Board and management team.
Syndicated Metals Limited - Corporate Governance Statement
Recommendation 2.3
The Board considers the independence of directors having regard to the relationships listed in Box 2.3 
of  the  Principles  &  Recommendations.    The  sole  independent  director  of  the  Company  is  Mr 
Langworthy.
The remaining directors are not independent for the following reasons:



Mr Munckton is the Company’s Managing Director.
Mr Morgan has within the last three years been employed in an executive capacity with the 
Company.
Mr Cooper is the Chief Executive Officer of CopperChem Limited, the Company’s largest 
shareholder (27.39%), and was appointed to the Board as CopperChem Limited’s nominee.
The  length  of  service  of  each  director  is  set  out  in  the  Directors’  Report  on  pages  3  and  4  of  the 
Company’s 2016 Annual Report.
Recommendation 2.4
The Board does not have a majority of directors who are independent.  The Board considers that its 
composition is suitable for the Company’s current size and operations, and includes an appropriate 
mix  of  skills  and  expertise  relevant  to  the  Company’s  business.    In  particular,  the  Board  includes 
members  with  disciplines  from  geology,  mine  engineering  and  business  development  such  that  the 
combined  expertise  and  judgment  means  that  the  Board  is  able  to  adequately  discharge  its 
responsibilities,  and  has  an  adequate  understanding  of  the  Company’s  current  and  emerging 
business.
Recommendation 2.5 
 
The independent Chair of the Board is Mr Langworthy, who is not also the Managing Director.
Recommendation 2.6 
 
The Company has an induction program that it uses when new directors join the Board and when new 
senior executives are appointed.  The goal of the program is to assist new directors to participate fully 
and  actively  in  Board  decision-making  at  the  earliest  opportunity  and  to  assist  senior  executives  to 
participate  fully  and  actively  in  management  decision-making  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    The 
Company’s Induction Program is disclosed on the Company’s website. 
 
The  Board  regularly  reviews  whether  the  directors  as  a  group  have  the  skills,  knowledge  and 
familiarity with the Company and its operating environment required to fulfil their role on the Board and 
the  Board  committees  effectively  using  a  Board  skills  matrix.    Where  any  gaps  are  identified,  the 
Board considers what training or development should be undertaken to fill those gaps.  In particular, 
the Board ensures that any director who does not have specialist accounting skills or knowledge has a 
sufficient  understanding  of  accounting  matters  to  fulfil  his  or  her  responsibilities  in  relation  to  the 
Company’s  financial  statements.    Directors  also  receive  ongoing  education  as  required  on 
developments in accounting standards that are relevant to the Company
Principle 3 – Act ethically and responsibly 
 
Recommendation 3.1 
 
The Company has established a Code of Conduct for its directors, senior executives and employees, 
a summary of which is disclosed on the Company’s website.
Syndicated Metals Limited - Corporate Governance Statement
Principle 4 – Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting 
 
Recommendation 4.1 
 
The  Board  has  not  established  a  separate  Audit  and  Risk  Committee.  Given  the  current  size  and 
composition  of  the  Board,  the  Board  believes  that  there  would  be  no  efficiencies  gained  by 
establishing a separate Audit and Risk Committee.  Accordingly, the Board performs the role of the 
Audit  and  Risk  Committee.    Although  the  Board  has  not  established  a  separate  Audit  and  Risk 
Committee,  it  has  adopted  an  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  Charter,  which  describes  the  role, 
composition,  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the  full  Board  in  its  capacity  as  the  Audit  and  Risk 
Committee.  Annual action points for the Audit and Risk Committee are set out in the Audit and Risk 
Committee Charter.  When the Board convenes as the Audit and Risk Committee it carries out those 
functions which are delegated to it in the Company’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter.  Items that 
are usually required to be discussed by an Audit and Risk Committee are marked as separate agenda 
items at Board meetings when required.  The Board deals with any conflicts of interest that may occur 
when convening in the capacity of the Audit and Risk Committee by ensuring that the director with 
conflicting interests is not party to the relevant discussions. 
 
The  Company  has  also  established  a  Procedure  for  the  Selection,  Appointment  and  Rotation  of  its 
External Auditor, which is disclosed on the Company’s website. The Board is responsible for the initial 
appointment of the external auditor and the appointment of a new external auditor when any vacancy 
arises. Candidates for the position of external auditor must demonstrate complete independence from 
the  Company  through  the engagement  period.  The Board  may  otherwise select  an  external  auditor 
based  on  criteria  relevant  to  the  Company's  business  and  circumstances.  The  performance  of  the 
external auditor is reviewed on an annual basis by the Board.
Details  of  director  attendance  at  meetings  of  the  full  Board,  in  its  capacity  as  the  Audit  and  Risk 
Committee, during the Reporting Period, are set out in a table in the Directors’ Report on page 20 of 
the Company’s 2016 Annual Report.
The Company’s Audit and Risk Committee Charter is disclosed on the Company’s website.
Recommendation 4.2 
 
Before the Board approved the Company financial statements for the half year ended 31 December 
2015,  the  full-year  ended  30  June  2016  and  each  of  the  quarters  ending  30  September  2015,  31 
December 2015, 31 March 2016 and 30 June 2016, it received from the Managing Director and the 
Chief Financial Officer a declaration that, in their opinion, the financial records of the Company for the 
relevant  financial  period  have  been  properly  maintained  and  that  the  financial  statements  for  the 
relevant  financial  period  comply  with  the  appropriate  accounting  standards  and  give  a  true  and  fair 
view of the financial position and performance of the Company and the Group and that the opinion has 
been  formed  on  the  basis  of  a  sound  system  of  risk  management  and  internal  control  which  is 
operating effectively.   
 
Recommendation 4.3 
 
Under  section  250RA  of  the  Corporations  Act,  the  Company’s  auditor  is  required  to  attend  the 
Company’s annual general meeting at which the audit report is considered, and must arrange to be 
represented by a person who is a suitably qualified member of the audit team that conducted the audit 
and  is  in  a  position  to  answer  questions  about  the  audit.    Each  year,  the  Company  writes  to  the 
Company’s  auditor  to  inform  them  of  the  date  of  the  Company’s  annual  general  meeting.    In 
accordance  with  section  250S  of  the  Corporations  Act,  at  the  Company’s  annual  general  meeting 
where the Company’s auditor or their representative is at the meeting, the Chair allows a reasonable 
opportunity  for  the  members  as  a  whole  at  the  meeting  to  ask  the  auditor  (or  its  representative) 
questions relevant to the conduct of the audit; the preparation and content of the auditor’s report; the 
accounting policies adopted by the Company in relation to the preparation of the financial statements; 
and the independence of the auditor in relation to the conduct of the audit. The Chair also allows a 
reasonable opportunity for the auditor (or their representative) to answer written questions submitted 
to the auditor under section 250PA of the Corporations Act.

Policy.

Company’s share registry website.
Principle 7 – Recognise and manage risk 
 
Recommendation 7.1 
 
The  Board  has  not  established  a  separate  Risk  Committee.  As  noted  above  in  relation  to

Recommendation 7.2 
 
The  Board  reviews  the  Company’s  risk  management  framework  annually  to  satisfy  itself  that  it

the Board.  The Board carried out this review during the Reporting Period.
Syndicated Metals Limited - Corporate Governance Statement
Recommendation 7.3 
 
The  Company  does  not  have  an  internal  audit  function.    To  evaluate  and  continually  improve  the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control processes, the Board relies on 
ongoing  reporting  and  discussion  of  the  management  of  material  business  risks  as  outlined  in  the 
Company’s Risk Management Policy. 
 
Recommendation 7.4 
 
The  Company  has  material  exposure  to  the  following  economic,  environmental  and/or  social 
sustainability risks: 
 
Risk description 
Equity Market-related risks 
Ability to source timely access to additional equity 
funding as required.
The  Group  maintains  close  financial  control  of 
expenditure  and  maintains  good  relationships 
with shareholders and equity market participants.

Ability  to  retain  exploration  tenure  and  meet 
tenement commitments.
Exploration efforts are unsuccessful in delivering 
new projects.
Environmental risks 
Non-compliance  with  environmental,  native  title, 
heritage and/or landholder requirements.
Health and safety risks 
Any  health  and  safety  incident  in  or  around  the 
Company’s  operations  has  the  potential  to  put 
employees or community members at risk.
Risk management approach
The Group continually monitors global commodity 
demand and price and is well positioned to adjust 
or curtail its exploration focus.
The  Group  utilises  dedicated  employees  and 
external  consultants  to  continually  monitor  its 
tenement  holding  and  tenement  management 
system.  The  Group  maintains  a 
tenement 
position  of  a  size  that  allows  it  to  be  able  to 
effectively  explore  and  meet 
tenement 
expenditure commitments. The Group continually 
assesses  its  tenement  holding  to  enable  it  to 
relinquish  ground  that  is  considered  to  be  not 
prospective.
its
The  Group 
follows  a  systematic  exploration 
approach and utilises technical experts and new 
technologies to assess its projects and the results 
of its exploration activities.
The  Group  has  agreements  in  place  with  all 
stakeholders,  regularly  undertakes  compliance 
activities  and  communicates  with  stakeholders. 
The  Group  undertakes  an  annual  audit  of 
compliance with these agreements.
The Group is committed to the health and safety 
of its employees, contractors and the community 
in  which  it  operates.  The  Group  has  an  OH&S 
policy  and  risk  management  system  in  place. 
OH&S performance is a standing agenda item at 
each Board Meeting. All site based staff receive 
training  required  to  perform  their  assigned  tasks 
safely  and  correctly.  The  OH&S  policy  and  risk 
management system is audited annually.
Syndicated Metals Limited - Corporate Governance Statement
In addition, the following risk management measures have been adopted by the Board to manage the 
Company's material business risks: 
 

the Board has established expenditure authority limits for management, which, if expected to be 
exceeded, require prior Board approval;


the Board has adopted a policy and procedure for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the 
Company's continuous disclosure obligations; and
the  Board  has  adopted  a  corporate  governance  manual  which  contains  other  policies  and 
procedures to assist the Company to establish and maintain its governance practices.
The Company has formalised its approach to risk management by documenting all material business 
risks in a risk register and allocating ownership for material business risks to the Managing Director 
and  management  of  individual  material  business  risks  to  senior  management  and  individuals  within 
the  organisation.  The  risk  register  is  reviewed  by  management  and  updated  six-monthly  and 
presented  to  the  Board.  All  risks  identified  in  the  risk  register  are  reviewed  and  assessed  by 
management and the Board at least annually.
Principle 8 – Remunerate fairly and responsibly 
 
Recommendation 8.1 
 
The  Board  has  established  a  Remuneration  Committee  comprising  two  non-executive  directors,  Mr 
Langworthy (independent) and Mr Morgan (not independent).  The composition of the Remuneration 
Committee  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  Recommendation  8.1  as  it  comprises  only  two 
members and does not comprise a majority of independent directors.  Given the composition of the 
Board, it is unable to establish a Remuneration Committee that meets the structural requirements of 
Recommendation  8.1.  However,  the  Board  considers  that  the  composition  of  the  Remuneration 
Committee is appropriate as it comprises only non-executive directors, noting the potential for conflict 
of interest if the Remuneration Committee includes executives, and an equal number of independent 
and non-independent directors.   
 
The  Board  has adopted a  Remuneration  Committee  Charter which describes  the role, composition, 
functions and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee.
Details  of  director  attendance  at  meetings  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  during  the  Reporting 
Period,  are  set  out  in  a  table  in  the  Directors’  Report  on  page  20  of  the  Company’s  2016  Annual 
Report.
Recommendation 8.2 
 
Details  of  remuneration,  including  the  Company’s  policy  on  remuneration,  are  contained  in  the 
“Remuneration Report” which forms part of the Directors’ Report and commences at page 22 of the 
Company’s  2016  Annual  Report.  This  disclosure  includes  a  summary  of  the  Company’s  policies 
regarding the deferral of performance-based remuneration and the reduction, cancellation or clawback 
of the performance-based remuneration in the event of serious misconduct or a material misstatement 
in the Company’s financial statements.  
 
Recommendation 8.3 
 
The Company's Remuneration Committee Charter includes a statement of the Company's policy on 
prohibiting participants in the Syndicated Metals Limited Performance Rights Plan (Plan) entering into 
transactions  (whether  through  the  use  of  derivatives  or  otherwise)  which  limit  the  economic  risk  of 
participating in the Plan.
