A.     Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration. 
 
The performance of the Company and consolidated entity depends upon the quality of its directors and 
executive  officers.  To  prosper,  the  consolidated  entity  must  attract,  motivate  and  retain  highly  skilled 
personnel. To this end, the consolidated entity:

is  responsible
The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee 
for  determining  and  reviewing 
compensation  arrangements  for  the  directors  and  the  executive  officers.  The  Remuneration  and 
Nomination Committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of emoluments of such 
officers  on  a  periodic  basis  by  reference  to  relevant  market  conditions  with  the  overall  objective  of 
ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of experienced and high quality directors and 
executive officers. Such officers are given the opportunity to receive their base emolument in a variety 
of forms including cash and superannuation salary sacrifice. The directors' emoluments are comparable 
to similar sized companies in the resources industry. 
 
Compensation linked to performance. 
 
At  the  date  of  this  report,  there  is  no  formal  link  between  the  Company’s  and  consolidated  entity's 
performance  and  the  directors’  emoluments  as  the  Company’s  and  consolidated  entity's  exploration 
operations represent no guarantee of the Company’s and consolidated entity's future value. 
 
Remuneration structure. 
 
In accordance with corporate governance principles and recommendations, the Company substantially 
complies with the guidelines for non-executive directors’ remuneration. 
 
Non-executive directors’ remuneration. 
 
On appointment, non-executive directors were advised of their directors’ duties and responsibilities and 
the remuneration and fee to be paid to directors in carrying out their duties. 
 
The  Company  and  consolidated  entity  aims  to  reward  its  non-executive  directors  with  a  level  of 
remuneration commensurate with their position and responsibilities within the consolidated entity so as 
to  reward  non-executive  directors  for  meeting  or  exceeding  targets  set  by  reference  to  appropriate 
benchmarks; align the interests of non-executive directors with those of shareholders'; and ensure that 
remuneration is competitive by market standards.  
 
It is the consolidated entity's policy that service agreements must be entered into with its non-executive 
directors, as detailed in section C below.

Corporate Information
Notes to the financial statements 
30 June 2016 
 
 
1. 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  were 
authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 19 August 2016. The Company 
is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in Bermuda whose shares are publicly traded. 
 
The  principal  activity  of  the  consolidated  entity  during  the  financial  year  was  mineral  exploration  in 
Australia.  There  was  no  significant  change  in  the  nature  of  the  consolidated  entity’s  principal  activity 
during the year. The consolidated entity holds mining tenements in the East Gippsland region of Victoria 
encompassing the historic Glen Wills and Sunnyside gold projects.   
 
 
2.  Significant accounting policies 
 
Basis of preparation 
 
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the 
revaluation  of  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  (including  derivative 
instruments) at fair value through profit or loss. The consolidated financial information is presented in 
Australian dollars. 
 
Statement of compliance  
The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements  which  have  been 
prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).  
 
Functional and presentational currency 
The  functional  and  presentational  currency  of  the  company  is  Australian  dollars.  The  consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which in the opinion of the directors is the most 
appropriate presentation currency as the operations are based in Australia. 
 
Critical accounting estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It 
also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the consolidated entity's 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 3. 
 
The  principal  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  are  set  out 
below.  These  policies  have  been  consistently  applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless  otherwise 
stated.  
 
New Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
None of the amendments to Standards or interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2015 had a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
 
Going concern 
The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates 
continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the 
ordinary course of business. The consolidated entity is a mineral exploration entity and as such does not 
currently generate operating revenue to support continued business activities. The consolidated entity is 
therefore dependent on maintaining cash reserves.  
 
The directors believe that they will be able to realise the consolidated entity’s assets and extinguish its 
liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in these financial statements. 
 
Principles of consolidation 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  all  subsidiaries  of  SML 
Corporation Limited ('consolidated entity') as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries for the 
year then ended. SML Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial
17
Notes to the financial statements 
30 June 2016 
 
statements as the 'consolidated entity'. 
 
The Parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.  All 
subsidiaries  have  a  reporting  date  of  30  June.  The  effects  of  substantive  potential  voting  rights  are 
considered when assessing whether control exists. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which  control  is  transferred  to  the  consolidated  entity.  They  are  de-consolidated  from  the  date  that 
control ceases. 
 
Intercompany  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  entities  in  the 
consolidated entity are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence  of  the  impairment  of  the  asset  transferred.  Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have  been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the consolidated entity. 
 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Refer to the 
'business combinations' accounting policy for further details. A change in ownership interest, without the 
loss  of  control,  is  accounted  for  as  an  equity  transaction,  where  the  difference  between  the 
consideration  transferred  and  the  book  value  of  the  share  of  the  non-controlling  interest  acquired  is 
recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent. 
 
Where  the  consolidated  entity  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognises  the  assets  including 
goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation 
differences recognised in equity. The consolidated entity recognises the fair value of the consideration 
received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss. 
 
Operating segments 
Operating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented 
is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). 
The  CODM  is  responsible  for  the  allocation  of  resources  to  operating  segments  and  assessing  their 
performance. 
 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the consolidated entity 
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. 
 
Interest 
Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method 
of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant 
period using the  effective interest rate,  which  is the rate that exactly discounts  estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
 
Income tax 
The  income  tax  expense  or  benefit  for  the  period  is  the  tax  payable  on  that  period's  taxable  income 
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets 
and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and unused tax losses and under and over provision 
in prior periods, where applicable. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to 
apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted 
or substantively enacted, except for: 
• 
When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
an  asset  or  liability  in  a  transaction  that  is  not  a  business  combination  and  that,  at  the  time  of  the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or 
 
• 
When  the  taxable  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries, 
associates  or  interests  in  joint  ventures,  and  the  timing  of  the  reversal  can  be  controlled  and  it  is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it
18
Notes to the financial statements 
30 June 2016 
 
is  probable  that  future  taxable  amounts  will  be  available  to  utilise  those  temporary  differences  and 
losses. 
 
The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed each reporting 
date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future 
taxable  profits  will  be  available  for  the  carrying  amount  to  be  recovered.  Previously  unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits 
available to recover the asset. 
 
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  only  where  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  offset 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; 
and  they  relate  to  the  same  taxable  authority  on  either  the  same  taxable  entity  or  different  taxable 
entity's which intend to settle simultaneously. 
 
The consolidated entity has not implemented the tax consolidation legislation. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other 
short-term,  highly  liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  that  are  readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment. They are usually 
settled within 30-90 days. 
 
An allowance account (provision for impairment of receivables) is used when there is objective evidence 
that the consolidated entity will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of 
the receivables. The amount of the impairment loss is expensed to profit or loss. When a receivable for 
which an impairment allowance had been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period, it 
is written off against the allowance account (bad debts written off). Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited to profit or loss. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
Plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment. 
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant 
and equipment over their expected useful lives as follows: 
 
 
 
 
The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
each reporting date. 
 
The cost of discrete mine assets under construction is periodically transferred from deferred exploration 
and  evaluation  expenditure  and  is  re-classified  as  property,  plant  and  equipment.  Assets  still  under 
construction are not depreciated. 
 
An  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  derecognised  upon  disposal  or  when  there  is  no  future 
economic  benefit  to  the  consolidated  entity.  Gains  and  losses  between  the  carrying  amount  and  the 
disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss. 
 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the 
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on 
the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
 
A distinction is made between finance leases, which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee 
substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased assets, and operating leases,

Mine assets
3-10 years 
20 years
19
Notes to the financial statements 
30 June 2016 
 
under which the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. 
 
Finance  leases  are  capitalised.  A  lease  asset  and  liability  are  established  at  the  present  value  of 
minimum lease payments. Lease payments are allocated between the principal component of the lease 
liability and the finance costs, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. 
 
Leased assets acquired under a finance lease are depreciated over the asset's useful life or over the 
shorter  of  the  asset’s  useful  life  and  the  lease  term  if  there  is  no  reasonable  certainty  that  the 
consolidated entity will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term. 
 
Operating lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to profit or loss 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
 
Deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure assets 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure in relation to separate areas of interest for which rights of tenure 
are current is carried forward as an asset in the statement of financial position where it is expected that 
the  expenditure  will  be  recovered  through  the  successful  development  and  exploitation  of  an  area  of 
interest, or by its sale; or exploration activities are continuing in an area and activities have not reached 
a stage which permits a reasonable estimate of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable 
reserves. Where a project or an area of interest has been abandoned, the expenditure incurred thereon 
is written off in the year in which the decision is made. 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation 
and  are  tested  annually  for  impairment,  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in  circumstances 
indicate that they might be impaired. Other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  An 
impairment  loss  is  recognised  for  the  amount  by  which  the  asset's  carrying  amount  exceeds  its 
recoverable amount. 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. The value-
in-use  is  the  present  value  of  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  relating  to  the  asset  using  a  pre-tax 
discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not 
have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit. 
 
Trade and other payables 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the consolidated entity prior to 
the end  of financial  year  and  which  are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature  they are measured  at 
amortised cost and not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 45 days of 
recognition. 
 
Finance costs 
Finance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the asset. All other finance costs 
are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the consolidated entity has a present (legal or constructive) obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable the consolidated entity will be required to settle the obligation, 
and  a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the  obligation.  The  amount  recognised  as  a 
provision  is  the  best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to  settle  the  present  obligation  at  the 
reporting  date,  taking  into  account  the  risks  and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation.  If  the  time 
value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate specific to the liability. 
The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation 
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is recognised when there is a present obligation as a result 
of exploration and development activities undertaken, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably. The 
estimated future obligations include the costs of removing facilities, abandoning sites and restoring the
20
Notes to the financial statements 
30 June 2016 
 
affected areas. The provision for future restoration costs is calculated by the Department of Economic 
Development,  Jobs,  Transport  and  Resources  (DEDJTR)  and  is  currently  the  best  estimate  of  the 
present value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date. Future 
restoration costs are reviewed annually  and any changes in the estimate are reflected in the present 
value of the restoration provision at reporting date; where the initial estimated cost is capitalised into the 
cost of the related asset and amortised on the same basis as the related asset. 
 
Contributed equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
 
Business combinations 
The  acquisition  method  of  accounting  is  used  to  account  for  business  combinations  regardless  of 
whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. 
 
The  consideration  transferred  is  the  sum  of  the  acquisition-date  fair  values  of  the  assets  transferred, 
equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the 
amount  of  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree.  For  each  business  combination,  the  non-
controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at either fair value or at the proportionate share of the 
acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred to profit or loss. 
 
On  the  acquisition  of  a  business,  the  consolidated  entity  assesses  the  financial  assets  acquired  and 
liabilities  assumed  for  appropriate  classification  and  designation  in  accordance  with  the  contractual 
terms,  economic  conditions,  the  consolidated  entity's  operating  or  accounting  policies  and  other 
pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date. 
 
Where  the  business  combination  is  achieved  in  stages,  the  consolidated  entity  remeasures  its 
previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  at  the  acquisition-date  fair  value  and  the  difference 
between the fair value and the previous carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  acquirer  is  recognised  at  the  acquisition-date  fair 
value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability 
is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
 
The difference between the acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair 
value  of  any  pre-existing  investment  in  the  acquiree  is  recognised  as  goodwill.  If  the  consideration 
transferred  and  the  pre-existing  fair  value  is  less  than  the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  net  assets 
acquired, being a  bargain  purchase to  the  acquirer, the difference is recognised as a gain  directly  in 
profit or loss by the acquirer on the acquisition-date, but only after a reassessment of the identification 
and  measurement  of  the  net  assets  acquired,  the  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree,  if  any,  the 
consideration transferred and the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquirer. 
 
Business  combinations  are  initially  accounted  for  on  a  provisional  basis.  The  acquirer  retrospectively 
adjusts the provisional amounts recognised and also recognises additional assets or liabilities during the 
measurement  period,  based  on  new  information  obtained  about  the  facts  and  circumstances  that 
existed at the acquisition-date. The measurement period ends on either the earlier of (i) 12 months from 
the date of the acquisition or (ii) when the acquirer receives all the information possible to determine fair 
value. 
 
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit  attributable  to  the  owners  of  SML 
Corporation Limited, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements 
in ordinary shares issued during the financial year. 
Diluted earnings per share
21
Notes to the financial statements 
30 June 2016 
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive 
potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for 
no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
 
Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST 
incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the 
acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. 
 
Receivables and  payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net 
amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  tax  authority  is  included  in  other  receivables  or 
other payables in the statement of financial position. 
 
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing 
or  financing  activities  which  are  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to  the  tax  authority,  are  presented  as 
operating cash flows. 
 
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable 
to, the tax authority. 
 
Rounding of amounts 
Amounts in this report have been rounded off to the nearest dollar. 
 
 
2. Application of new and revised Accounting Standards 
 
The adoption of all the new and revised Standards and Interpretations has not resulted in any changes 
to  the  consolidated  entity's  accounting  policies  and  has  no  effect  on  the  amounts  reported  for  the 
current  or  prior  periods.  The  new  and  revised  Standards  and  Interpretations  has  not  had  a  material 
impact  and  not  resulted  in  changes  to  the  consolidated  entity’s  presentation  of  or  disclosure  in  its 
financial statements. 
 
2.1 Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted 
 
At the date of authorisation of the financial statements, the Standards and Interpretations listed below 
were in issue but not yet effective. 
 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (2014) 
In July 2014, the IASB released IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (2014), representing the completion of its 
project  to  replace  IAS  39  ‘Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and  Measurement’.  The  new  standard 
introduces extensive changes to IAS 39’s guidance on the classification and measurement of financial 
assets and introduces a new ‘expected credit loss’ model for the impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 
also provides new guidance on the application of hedge accounting. 
 
The consolidated entity’s management have yet to assess the impact of IFRS 9 on these consolidated 
financial statements. The new standard is required to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018. 
 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
IFRS 15 presents new requirements for the recognition of revenue, replacing IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 
‘Construction Contracts’, and several revenue-related Interpretations. The new standard establishes a 
control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered 
in  detail  under  existing  IFRSs,  including  how  to  account  for  arrangements  with  multiple  performance 
obligations,  variable  pricing,  customer  refund  rights,  supplier  repurchase  options,  and  other  common 
complexities. 
 
IFRS 15 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The consolidated entity’s 
management have not yet assessed the impact of IFRS 15 on these consolidated financial statements.

2.1 Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted (continued) 
 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IFRS 16 a lessee recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is treated 
similarly to other non-financial assets and depreciated accordingly and the liability accrues interest. This 
will  typically  produce  a  front-loaded  expense  profile  (whereas  operating  leases  under IAS  17 would 
typically have had straight-line expenses) as an assumed linear depreciation of the right-of-use asset 
and the decreasing interest on the liability will lead to an overall decrease of expense over the reporting 
period. 
 
The  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  payments  payable  over  the 
lease  term,  discounted  at  the  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  if  that  can  be  readily  determined.  If  that  rate 
cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate.
As  with  IFRS  16’s  predecessor,  IAS  17,  lessors  classify  leases  as  operating  or  finance  in  nature.  A 
lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an underlying asset. Otherwise a lease is classified as an operating lease.
For  finance  leases  a  lessor  recognises  finance  income  over  the  lease  term,  based  on  a  pattern 
reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment. A lessor recognises operating lease 
payments as income on a straight-line basis or, if more representative of the pattern in which benefit 
from use of the underlying asset is diminished, another systematic basis.
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2019. The consolidated entity’s management have not yet assessed the impact of IFRS 16 on 
these consolidated financial statements.
Note 3.  Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions  
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  in  the  financial  statements.  Management  continually 
evaluates  its  judgements  and  estimates  in  relation  to  assets,  liabilities,  contingent  liabilities,  revenue 
and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience 
and  on  other  various  factors,  including  expectations  of  future  event,  management  believes  to  be 
reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom 
equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below. 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets 
The  consolidated  entity  assesses  impairment  of  non-financial  assets  other  than  goodwill  and  other 
indefinite  life  intangible  assets  at  each  reporting  date  by  evaluating  conditions  specific  to  the 
consolidated  entity  and  to  the  particular  asset  that  may  lead  to  impairment.  If  an  impairment  trigger 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. This involves fair value less costs to sell or 
value-in-use calculations, which incorporate a number of key estimates and assumptions. 
 
Recoverability of deferred exploration and evaluation expenditure 
The  consolidated  entity  assesses  the  recoverability  of  the  carrying  value  of  deferred  exploration  and 
evaluation  expenditure  at  each  reporting  date,  or  at  closer  intervals  should  the  need  arise.  The 
assessment includes a review of the consolidated entity’s exploration and development plans for each 
area of interest, the success or otherwise of activities undertaken in those areas in recent times, the 
likely success of future planned exploration activities and/or any potential plans for divestment of those 
areas.  The  carrying  value  of  the  deferred  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  then  adjusted,  if 
necessary.

Note 3.  Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued) 
 
Income tax 
The consolidated entity is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant 
judgement  is  required  in  determining  the  provision  for  income  tax.  There  are  many  transactions  and 
calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination 
is uncertain. The consolidated entity recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on the 
consolidated entity’s current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters 
is  different  from  the  carrying  amounts,  such  differences  will  impact  the  current  and  deferred  tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made. 
 
 
Note 4.  Operating segments 
 
Identification of reportable operating segments 
 
The Company operated predominately as an explorer for base precious metals, with the emphasis on 
gold, silver, zinc and lead mineralisation within Australia. 
 
IFRS  8  requires  operating  segments  to  be  identified  on  the  basis  of  internal  reports  about  the 
components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to 
allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. The board reviews the Company as a 
whole in the business segment of mineral exploration within Australia.

The  Company  surrendered  its  Exploration  Licences  3916  (Merrimac  Creek),  4744  (Granite  Flat)  and 
4717  (Omeo)  in  order  to  reduce  expenditure  and  maximise  shareholder  value.  All  exploration  costs 
incurred in relation to these Exploration Licences have been written off during the financial year. 
 
During  the  financial  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  assessed  impairment  on  remaining  exploration  and 
evaluation balance relating to MIN 4921 and identified areas that were least prospective and as result 
agreed to impair $2,304,924 at the reporting period.

Tax losses not recognised 
Unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised 
 
Potential tax benefit @ 30% 
 
 
The  above  potential  tax  benefit  for  tax  losses  has  not  been  recognised  in  the  statement  of  financial 
position. These tax losses can only be utilised in the future if the continuity of ownership test is passed, 
or failing that, the same business test is passed. 
 
At 30 June 2016, there is no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax liability (2015: $nil) for 
taxes  that  would  be  payable  on  the  unremitted  earnings  of  certain  of  the  consolidated  entity’s 
subsidiaries,  associates  or  joint  ventures,  as  the  consolidated  entity  has  no  liability  for  additional 
taxation should such amounts be remitted.  
 
At 30 June 2016 the consolidated entity had deferred tax liabilities on capitalised mineral exploration 
expenditure of $4,375,556 (2015: $6,507,601) that has been set off against the deferred tax losses.

The ultimate recoupment of the exploration and evaluation expenditure carried forward in each area of 
interest  is  dependent  upon  the  successful  exploration,  development  and  exploitation  of  the  mining 
tenements  on  acceptable  commercial  terms,  and/or  the  sale  of  the  mining  tenements  for  amounts 
greater than their carrying value. 
 
The consolidated entity holds granted Mining Licence 4921 in the East Gippsland region of Victoria.  
 
A royalty will be payable by Mt. Wills Gold Mines Pty Ltd ('Mt Wills') of $2 per tonne of ore treated in 
the production of gold and other precious metals, for ore sourced from tenements and/or applications 
held by Mt Wills (MIN 4921). For the first 500,000 tonnes of ore treated, the royalty will be payable in 
equal proportions to Mrs Karen Bidstrup as trustee for The Red Gum Court Trust and to Mr William 
Jay, after which time the whole $2 per tonne royalty will be payable to Mrs Karen Bidstrup as trustee 
for The Red Gum Court Trust.

Rehabilitation 
The provision of $65,000 (2015: $85,000) for rehabilitation is the net present value of the estimated 
cost of rehabilitating the Glen Wills and Sunnyside project site in compliance with future regulations 
and  practices  at  the  end  of  commercial  production.  The  consolidated  entity  carries  out  regular 
rehabilitation as part of its on-going exploration program.

Share options 
The Company has no quoted share options. For further details, see note 18. 
 
Capital risk management 
The Board of directors ('Board') manage the consolidated entity’s capital to ensure the consolidated 
entity continues as a going concern. The primary objectives of the Board are to actively explore and 
develop the consolidated entity’s mining assets so that they can maximise returns for shareholders; to 
minimise the cost of capital by maintaining the most efficient capital structure; and, to optimise the use 
of the consolidated entity’s human and financial resources. None of the consolidated entity’s entities 
are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The exploration activities are being funded by 
equity. 
 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the consolidated entity may adjust the amount of 
dividends  paid  to  shareholders,  return  capital  to  shareholders,  issue  new  shares  or  sell  assets  to 
reduce debt. The capital risk management policy remains unchanged.

Note 19.  Financial instruments 
 
Financial risk management objectives 
The consolidated entity's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, liquidity 
risk and fair value estimation. The consolidated entity's overall risk management program focuses on the 
unpredictability  of  financial  markets  and  seeks  to  minimise  potential  adverse  effects  on  the  financial 
performance  of  the  consolidated  entity.  The  consolidated  entity  uses  different  methods  to  measure 
different types of risk to which  it is  exposed. These  methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of 
interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks and ageing analysis for credit risk. 
 
The  Board  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  oversight  of  the  risk  management 
framework.  Risk  management  policies  are  established  to  identify  and  analyse  the  risks  faced  by  the 
consolidated  entity,  to  set  appropriate  risk  limits  and  controls,  and  to  monitor  risks  and  adherence  to 
limits.  Risk  management  policies  and  systems  are  reviewed  regularly  to  reflect  changes  in  market 
conditions  and  in  the  consolidated  entity’s  activities.  The  Board  monitors  compliance  with  risk 
management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in 
relation to the risks faced by the consolidated entity. 
 
Market risk 
Commodity price risk 
Although  the  consolidated  entity  is  not  in  commercial  production,  the  primary  risk  to  the  consolidated 
entity is the movement in the price of gold, base metals and the other target minerals, as measured in 
Australian dollars. An inferred gold mineral resource has been identified at the consolidated entity's Glen 
Wills and Sunnyside project on the mining tenements located in East Gippsland, Victoria. 
 
 
The  exploration  potential  for  gold  for  part  of  the  Glen  Wills  and  Sunnyside  project  has  also  been 
independently  assessed.  The  carrying  value  of  the  consolidated  entity's  projects  and  the  economic 
viability of future developments are subject to the risk of movements in commodity prices and the effect 
that  those  movements  may  have  on  the  economics  of  developing  mineral  projects  and  the  resulting 
financial returns to be derived in future years. 
 
Price risk 
Although  the  consolidated  entity  is  not  in  commercial  production,  the  primary  risk  to  the  consolidated 
entity is the movement in US dollar/Australian dollar foreign currency market price risk effecting the price 
of gold.

Note 19.  Financial instruments (continued) 
 
Market risk (continued) 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or the cash flows associated with the 
instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from fluctuations 
in interest bearing financial assets or liabilities that the consolidated entity may have. The consolidated 
entity’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the income that it earns 
from funds on deposit. The consolidated entity’s policy  is to invest surplus funds with only recognised, 
creditworthy third parties and to settle trade payables within the credit terms allowed by suppliers so as 
not to incur interest on overdue balances. 
 
As at the reporting date, the consolidated entity had the following variable rate balances:

Net exposure to cashflow interest rate risk 
 
 
 
An  official  increase/decrease  in  interest  rates  of  one  (2015:  one)  percentage  point  would  have 
favourable/adverse  effect  on  profit  before  tax  of  $45,586  (2015:  $43,920)  per  annum.  The  percentage 
change is based on the expected volatility of interest rates using market data and analysts’ forecasts. 
 
Credit risk 
The  consolidated  entity  is  not  in  commercial  production  and  therefore  has  no  significant  sales 
transactions.  With  respect  to  the  credit  risk  arising  from  the  other  financial  assets  of  the  consolidated 
entity, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the consolidated entity’s exposure to credit risk arises 
from  the  possible  default  of  a  counterparty,  with  the  maximum  exposure  being  equal  to  the  carrying 
amount  of  these  assets,  less  any  recoveries  which  may  be  achieved  in  the  event  of  a  default  by  that 
counterparty.  The  consolidated  entity  trades  with  only  recognised,  creditworthy  third  parties  and 
accordingly the consolidated entity's exposure to possible losses is not significant. Other than the cash 
funds  held  in  interest-bearing  accounts  with  an  Australian  first  class  bank,  there  are  no  significant 
concentrations of credit risk within the consolidated entity. 
 
At 30 June 2016, none of the consolidated entity's receivables are past due or impaired (2015: nil). 
 
Liquidity risk 
The consolidated entity’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility 
through the use of new equity raisings and other finance facilities. At 30 June 2016 there were no bank 
facilities in place. The liquidity of the consolidated entity is monitored via regular cash flow budgets which 
highlight the need for capital raising when required. 
 
Remaining contractual maturities 
The  following  tables  detail  the  consolidated  entity's  remaining  contractual  maturity  for  its  financial 
instrument liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial 
liabilities based on the earliest date on which the financial liabilities are required to be paid. The tables 
include both interest and principal cash flows disclosed as remaining contractual maturities and therefore 
these totals may differ from their carrying amount in the statement of financial position.

Fair value of financial instruments 
Unless otherwise stated, the carrying amounts of financial instruments reflect their fair value. The carrying 
amounts  of  trade  receivables  and  trade  payables  are  assumed  to  approximate  their  fair  values  due  to 
their  short-term  nature.  The  fair  value  of  financial  liabilities  is  estimated  by  discounting  the  remaining 
contractual maturities at the current market interest rate that is available for similar financial instruments.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of SML Corporation Limited
We have audited the accompanying financial report of SML Corporation Limited (the 
“Company”), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 
2016, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income,  consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes 
comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information 
to the financial report and the statement by the Directors of the consolidated entity 
comprising the Company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time 
during the financial year.
Responsibility of the Directors for the financial report
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of 
the financial report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board. This responsibility includes such internal 
controls as the Directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
report to be free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards which require us to 
comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free from 
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial report.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
report, whether due to fraud or error.
Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd ACN 130 913 594 
a subsidiary or related entity of Grant Thornton Australia Ltd ABN 41 127 556 389 
  
 
‘Grant Thornton’ refers to the brand under which the Grant Thornton member firms provide assurance, tax and advisory services to their clients and/or refers to one or more member firms, as the 
context requires. Grant Thornton Australia Ltd is a member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd (GTIL). GTIL and the member firms are not a worldwide partnership. GTIL and each member firm 
is a separate legal entity. Services are delivered by the member firms. GTIL does not provide services to clients. GTIL and its member firms are not agents of, and do not obligate one another and 
are not liable for one another’s acts or omissions. In the Australian context only, the use of the term ‘Grant Thornton’ may refer to Grant Thornton Australia Limited ABN 41 127 556 389 and its 
Australian subsidiaries and related entities. GTIL is not an Australian related entity to Grant Thornton Australia Limited. 
 
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation. Liability is limited in those States where a current 
scheme applies.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.  An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the applicable independence requirements 
of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board.
Auditor’s Opinion
In our opinion, the financial report gives a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
consolidated entity as at 30 June 2016, and its financial performance and cash flows for the 
year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board.
