</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, 
including the International Covenant  on Civil and Political Rights, and that all States are 
bound to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and 65/281 of 17

</p>
<p> <i>Deploring</i> the refusal of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to implement 
fully Human Rights Council resolutions S-16/1 and S-17/1 and its continued non-
cooperation with the independent commission of inquiry, in particular the continued lack of 
access to the country afforded to the commission,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> by all ongoing grave violations of human rights by the Syrian 
authorities against their population, including civil and political rights, as well as economic, 
social and cultural rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> again the importance of ensuring accountability and the need to end 
impunity and to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations, including 
those violations that may amount to crimes against humanity,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the initiatives, efforts and measures of the League of Arab States to 
address all aspects of the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, and the steps taken by the 
League to ensure the implementation of its Plan of Action of 2 November 2011, including 
those steps aimed at ending all human rights violations and all acts of violence,

Republic made by the League on 16 October and on 2, 12, 16, 24 and 27 November 2011, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that all States Members of the United Nations should refrain in their 
international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of 
the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>1<i>. Welcomes </i>the report of the commission of inquiry2 established pursuant to
