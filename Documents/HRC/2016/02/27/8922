<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 21-28 June 2009, the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations 
related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, conducted an 
official mission to Egypt, aiming to assess the way in which Egypt is implementing its human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. During the mission, she 
met with numerous interlocutors including the Assistant Foreign Minister for International 
Organizations, the Deputy Foreign Minister for the Environment and Sustainable Development, 
the Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for Human Rights and International Humanitarian and 
Social Affairs, the Assistant Minister for Primary Care, Preventive Medicine and Family 
Planning, the Chairman of the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, and numerous 
representatives of the water and wastewater sector. She also met with the National Council for 
Human Rights as well as other stakeholders, including civil society, development cooperation 
partners and United Nations actors. She visited Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Qena, and Wardan. 
The independent expert expresses her gratitude to everyone who agreed to meet with her in an 
effort to assist her in better understanding the situation of human rights, drinking water and 
sanitation in Egypt. She thanks the Egyptian Government for the cooperation they extended in 
organizing and facilitating the visit. She also expresses her appreciation to the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Development Programme for their support in 
organizing the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. This preliminary note is intended to present some initial observations and 
recommendations about the situation of human rights, water and sanitation in Egypt. The 
independent expert will present a full report on her mission to Egypt when she next reports to the 
Council in 2010. 
</p>
<p>3. Overall, Egypt has made remarkable progress in extending the water and, to a lesser extent, 
sanitation networks to reach virtually all cities and villages in the country. However, challenges 
remain from a human rights perspective, in particular with regard to the quality of drinking 
water, extending access to sanitation, some aspects of affordability, disparities in access to water 
and sanitation, as well as the reality of water scarcity in Egypt. 
</p>
<p>4. The human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation require 
that they are available, accessible, affordable, acceptable and of good quality. These obligations 
must be guaranteed in a non-discriminatory manner, and people must have access to information 
to claim their rights. Where access to safe drinking water and sanitation is not guaranteed in a 
manner consistent with human rights, affected people should have recourse to effective judicial 
or other appropriate remedies. Moreover, ensuring access to safe drinking water and to sanitation 
is closely related to the enjoyment of other human rights, including the rights to food, housing, 
health, education, freedom from violence, and is an important tool for the empowerment of 
women. 
</p>
<p>5. This preliminary note will review the achievements of the Government, elaborate on the 
outstanding challenges, and conclude with preliminary recommendations. </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/24/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>II.  ACHIEVEMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the macro level, the Government of Egypt has demonstrated a vision and a strategy with 
the objective of providing access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all. This has been 
accompanied by significant political will, at the highest levels, and significant resources invested 
in drinking water and sanitation. Between 2002 and 2007, about 36.7 billion Egyptian pounds 
(around US$ 7.3 billion ) were invested in the water and wastewater sectors, and plans for 
investment up to 2012 will reportedly exceed the total of investments since 1992. The budget for 
drinking water and sanitation has not been cut in Egypt during this financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert is pleased to note that, in meetings with government officials, they 
consistently referred to drinking water and sanitation as human rights. The independent expert 
was informed that the draft water law, which was recently sent to the Cabinet, also contains 
language recognizing drinking water and sanitation as human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Egypt has made important progress in extending its water network for personal and 
domestic use to its population. According to the Government, access to water has been extended 
to 100 per cent of the population, and the Joint Monitoring Programme of UNICEF and the 
World Health Organization places access to an improved water source at 98 per cent in Egypt. It 
is clear that Egypt will easily meet the Millennium Development Goal target of halving the 
proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. 
</p>
<p>9. In 2004, Egypt established the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, and began 
the process of converting the public utilities at the Governorate level into subsidiaries of this 
central Holding Company. This change in the institutional framework has been credited, by the 
Government and by donor partners working in the country, with increasing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the sector. Some are concerned that the establishment of the Holding Company 
represents a first step towards privatizing water service provision, a step which they felt would 
lead to increased prices and lack of attention to the poorest and most vulnerable. However, the 
Government of Egypt has repeatedly emphasized that it has no intention to privatize the 
provision of water services, as such privatization might have an adverse effect on social and 
economic stability. The independent expert emphasizes that human rights do not prohibit 
privatization of the delivery of services, but the Government remains obliged to ensure that an 
adequate regulatory system is in place to protect beneficiaries from violations of their human 
rights that may result from the actions of private or semi-private entities. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CHALLENGES 
</b></p>
<p>10. The independent expert considers that the progress that Egypt has made puts it in a good 
position to now tackle outstanding challenges, which particularly relate to water quality, 
extending access to sanitation, some issues related to affordability, and disparities in access to 
drinking water and sanitation between rural and urban areas, as well as between formal and 
informal habitations, particularly based on tenure status. Water scarcity in Egypt also presents 
particular challenges for the authorities. The independent expert notes that some good practices 
are already in place to address some of these challenges, and expresses her hope that these will 
be scaled up and implemented more broadly across the country, with a special focus on 
disadvantaged groups. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/24/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>A.  Water quality 
</b></p>
<p>11. Concerning water quality, the independent expert met with people who have complained 
that the drinking water quality is poor in some areas of Egypt, especially in places at the 
extremities of the water network and in less affluent areas. According to the most recent report of 
the National Council for Human Rights, 19 per cent of inhabitants still lack access to pure 
drinking water. This situation could be attributed to old and decaying pipes, to inadequate 
storage of water, and/or to contamination of water sources with wastewater, salt or other 
pollutants. Some people also complained about the lack of a continuous water supply in their 
homes, a situation which leads them to pump (shallow) groundwater. Because these wells are not 
sunk deep enough, they draw groundwater which is allegedly poor in quality. In addition, these 
pumps are put in without authorization, and sometimes even connected illegally to the official 
water pipes. The lack of official permission for these pumps means that the water quality is not 
monitored by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>12. The independent expert visited two water treatment plants, in Cairo and in Qena, where the 
labs were actively engaged in testing water quality. She also learned that the Holding Company 
has 164 mobile labs for testing water quality and that 98 per cent of the over 1 million water 
samples collected in 2007 and 2008 from areas served by the Holding Company met water 
quality standards. While the water quality appears to be tested regularly - although allegedly not 
in all parts of the country - some obstacles were reported in obtaining the results of these tests. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Government acknowledges that access to improved sanitation facilities is lagging 
behind drinking water, and that the country needs &#8220;more intensive programs and policies&#8221; in the 
rural areas.<b>1</b> The United Nations estimates that access to improved sanitation facilities is only 
66 per cent, with 85 per cent access in urban areas, and 52 per cent access in rural areas. 
According to the National Council for Human Rights, the figure is even lower. Inadequate septic 
tanks or the common use of septic tanks in densely populated areas, especially in informal 
settlements, are leading to contamination of the groundwater, causing health problems for the 
surrounding population. Additionally, when septic tanks are emptied and dumped into canals, 
rivers and streams, water quality and public health are further threatened. Indeed, it is impossible 
to achieve access to safe drinking water without simultaneous attention to ensuring sanitation. 
In this regard, the independent expert welcomes the rural sanitation strategy which calls 
for 20 billion Egyptian pounds (approximately US$ 4 billion) to be invested in rural sanitation. 
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert wishes particularly to draw attention to the government policy of 
reusing treated wastewater for irrigation, as well as growing trees for biofuel production, an 
important step in reducing the amount of water used for agricultural purposes and addressing 
water scarcity.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>15. The price of water and the direct and indirect costs and charges to secure drinking water 
must not compromise or threaten the realization of other human rights. The independent expert 
recognizes that the tariff for drinking water in Egypt is considered one of the lowest in the world, 
with over 92 per cent of households spending less than 1 per cent of their household budget on 
water and sanitation.<b>2</b> Nevertheless, the extremely poor, who make up 3.8 per cent of the 
population, or 3 million people, cannot even afford this small amount. In addition, the cost of 
extending a water connection to the household from the main water line in the area is beyond the 
means of many people. In this respect, one good practice of the Government and other actors, 
including especially UNICEF, is the establishment of revolving funds which provide loans to 
poor people to connect them to water, and also to sanitation, and allow them to pay back the loan 
in instalments. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Disparities 
</b></p>
<p>16. There are 15.7 million people living in informal settlements, representing 24 per cent of 
the total population of Egypt and 40 per cent of the total urban population, in addition to 
8 million people living in rural areas.<b>3</b> There are important disparities in access to safe drinking 
water and sanitation, which follow divides based on urban vs. rural areas and formal vs. informal 
dwellings. These disparities are particularly present with respect to the challenges of water 
quality, access to sanitation and affordability, as mentioned above. Notably, these disparities also 
exist with regard to access to drinking water, an area where Egypt has achieved a lot. For 
example, although the overall reported figures on access to an improved source of drinking water 
are approaching 100 per cent, in 2008 the Government reported that in the Matrouh Governorate, 
access to an improved water source is only 73.6 per cent, and in the North Sinai Governorate, it 
is only 80.7 per cent.<b>4</b> Since last year, however, the Government reports that water services 
coverage now reaches the entire population, with the completion of several water and wastewater 
projects. In general, it is those living in rural areas, and those living in informal settlements, who 
tend to be the poorest, who are disproportionately affected. From a human rights perspective, 
policies and programmes should prioritize the situation of these disadvantaged groups. The 
Government reports that it is taking steps to construct water and sanitation facilities within 
informal settlements.

</p>
<p><b>E.  Water scarcity 
</b></p>
<p>17. Egypt is a country of water scarcity. More and more, the country will face water stress, 
particularly in the context of climate change and the rapidly growing population, threatening the 
progress that has been made. The Government must address excessive water consumption, 
particularly in urban areas. In addition, solutions are needed for the high rate of physical water 
losses, due to leaking pipes and other technical problems. 
</p>
<p>18. The independent expert notes that the authorities have invested in special technology to 
detect leaks and fix them, but as Egypt faces increasing water scarcity, these losses will threaten 
the availability of water for human consumption, which must be accorded priority over all other 
uses. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>The commitment of the Government to implement its human rights obligations 
related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation is commendable, and the 
independent expert is confident that going forward, the Government will dedicate the same 
level of energy and efforts to address the remaining challenges. In this regard, she offers 
the following preliminary recommendations, pending the submission of her final report: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government should consecrate water and sanitation as human rights 
explicitly in their legislation, including in the draft water law currently under 
consideration. Furthermore, the Government should use the international human rights 
framework as a guide for the content of legislation and policies related to water and 
sanitation, in particular including aspects relating to quality, accessibility, affordability, 
availability, acceptability, non-discrimination, the right to information and participation, 
and accountability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Government should consistently address water and sanitation in an 
integrated manner. In particular, the Government should prioritize the extension of access 
to water and sanitation to the household level. The Government should provide financial 
assistance for connecting households where people are unable to pay. The revolving fund 
currently utilized in Qena is a good practice which should be replicated in other parts of 
the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Government should pay particular attention and prioritize access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation for those living in rural areas, those living in informal 
settlements, and the poor. The Government must respect, protect and fulfil the human 
rights concerning water and sanitation for these people. The independent expert further 
urges United Nations agencies to become active on these issues, and particularly 
recommends that UNICEF, in cooperation with the Government, expands its activities to 
informal settlements. Furthermore, targeted programmes and policies should be developed 
to ensure that the poor are able to enjoy access to drinking water and sanitation that is 
affordable; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government must devote attention to upgrading old networks to ensure 
that drinking water is not contaminated and enforce laws against polluting water sources; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/12/24/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b> (e) The independent expert encourages the authorities to extend regular and 
comprehensive water quality tests across the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The authorities must also ensure that independent complaint mechanisms are 
accessible and available to all persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The authorities should make public and easily accessible information regarding 
the water and wastewater sectors. In particular, all results of analyses of water quality 
carried out should be made available to the public; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The authorities should also ensure that affected communities are able to 
participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of water and sanitation services 
in a meaningful and active way. 
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>In designing new pricing policies, or in considering the granting of concessions to 
private companies, the independent expert reminds the Government that is obliged to 
establish regulations to ensure that private or semi-private entities do not infringe human 
rights. In this regard, the independent expert emphasizes the importance of an independent 
regulatory body to oversee the actions of all actors in the water and wastewater sectors.
