Review of Operations 
 
Resolute has achieved a number of crucial milestones in 2016 on our journey to establishing a long life, low 
cost  future  for  our  business.  Operations  performed  strongly,  and  continue  to  do  so,  and  this  is  providing  a 
platform  to  strengthen  the  Company’s  balance  sheet.  This  impressive  and  important  turnaround  in  the 
Company’s position and performance in 2016 allows us to develop key organic growth projects with funding 
confidence.    Our  decision  to  immediately  commence  underground  development  at  Syama,  based  on  the 
successful Syama Underground Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”), will secure our production and cash flow 
generating base for more than a decade. The recommencement of open pit mining at Ravenswood in FY17 will 
assist in maintaining continuity of production as we develop a mine life beyond Mt. Wright.  FY17 will continue 
to be exciting for shareholders as we develop the flagship Syama underground mine, deliver the Ravenswood 
Extension Project study, and continue to work towards a production future for Bibiani.

Directors’ Report  
Review of Operations 
 
Exploration and Development
Detailed  information  about  Resolute’s  exploration  and  development  highlights  is  available  on  the 
Company’s website.
  During the June 2016 quarter the Company completed the Syama Underground Definitive Feasibility 
Study which confirmed a positive outcome. The Syama Underground will be a long life and low cost 
mine that will deliver a strong operating margin over the next decade. On 30 June 2016 the Resolute 
Board of Directors approved the immediate development of Syama Underground with excavation of 
the decline due to commence in the September 2016 quarter following the mobilisation of a mining 
contractor  to  site.  The  first  development  ore  is  expected  to  be  delivered  in  December  2016,  with 
stoping commencing in December 2017. During this period there will be continuous production from 
Syama  through  current  stockpiled  sulphide  material  and  ongoing  satellite  open  pit  deposits.    Key 
details of the DFS are as follows:
sheet and future operating cash flows;
initial operating life of more than 12 years; 
total Syama Gold Mine production will grow to 250,000 ounces per annum;
o  Life of Mine All-in-Sustaining-Costs of US$881 per ounce and strong Life of Mine margins; 
o 
o 
o  pre-production  capital  of  US$95  million  which  will  be  fully  funded  from  the  current  balance 
o  processing innovation will continue to enhance project economics; 
o  underground development to commence immediately with first ore expected to be delivered to 
the  mill  in  December  2016  which  allows  for  continuous  production  from  Syama  to  be 
maintained; 
o  Resolute’s successful Mt Wright underground experience to deliver efficiency and productivity 
o  substantial upside with opportunities to extend mine life, increase mining recovery and further
gains at Syama underground mine; and,
reduce All-In-Sustaining Costs.
  Also at Syama, high grade intercepts returned from the ongoing deep drilling program have identified 
a  major  extension  to  the  Syama  orebody.    The  infill  results  extend  the  mineralised  footprint  and 
provide  confidence  that  the  Syama  underground  reserve  estimate  can  be  enhanced  in  the  upper 
levels  of  the  proposed  development.    The  results  confirm  the  consistency  and  continuity  of 
mineralisation  below  the  current  Syama  Underground  Reserve  and  emphasise  the  possibility  of 
future expansion and extension to the Syama Gold Mine.  The deep extension drilling program is 
planned to continue throughout 2016 and is expected to enhance  the existing resource model and 
deliver further mine life extension opportunities beyond the current 12-year mine life of the Syama 
Underground Project. 
In June 2016, Resolute completed a positive Feasibility Study (“Study”) for its 90% owned Bibiani 
project.  The  Study  was  lodged  with  the  Government  of  Ghana,  which  owns  a  10%  free  carried 
interest  in  Bibiani.  Delivery  of  the  Study  to  the  Ghanaian  Minerals  Commission  was  a  key 
commitment made by Resolute as part of the government’s approval of the Company’s acquisition of 
the asset in 2014.  Key highlights of the Study include:

initial operating life of 5 years with production of approximately 100,000 ounces per annum;
Initial Ore Reserve of 5.4 million tonnes @ 3.7 grams per tonne containing 640,000 ounces of 
gold;
o 
o  mine plan to produce up to 1.2 million tonnes per annum of underground ore;  
o 
o  start-up capital of US$72M including US$29M of underground mining equipment;  
o  short  timeline  to  production  expected  with  only  a  9-month  development  and  refurbishment 
period;  
o 
life of Mine All-in-Sustaining-Costs of US$858/oz;  
o 
the location and characteristics of Bibiani are well matched to the technical capabilities of the 
Company; and, 
o  substantial upside remains with ongoing work scheduled to focus on upgrading and expanding
the orebody to extend mine life and reduce operating costs.

Review of Operations 
 
Exploration and Development (continued)
  During the year the Company continued to refine the Ravenswood Expansion Project (“REP”) with the 
Resolute  Board  of  Directors  approving  the  development  of  the  Nolans  East  deposit.    Work  continued 
during  the  June  quarter  on  finalising  the  Environmental  Application  (EA)  amendment  for  the  Sarsfield 
Expansion  Project.  The  EA  amendment  is  scheduled  to  be  submitted  in  the  September  2016  quarter.  
The  decision  to  commence  production  from  Nolans  East  has  allowed  the  Company  to  implement  a 
disciplined hedging program to manage gold price risk during the transition from underground to large 
scale open pit operations. Resolute has sold forward 36,000oz of gold at an average price of A$1,800/oz. 
These forward gold sales of 3,000oz per month cover the period from November 2016 to October 2017 
to match approximately 50% of the production from Nolans East.
Likely Developments and Expected Results
  Gold production for FY17 forecast to be a minimum of 300,000oz at All-In-Sustaining-Costs of A$1,280/oz
(US$934/oz).
gold in circuit inventory.
  Gold sales forecast to be 325,000oz as increased processing efficiency continues to allow a reduction of 
o  At Syama, sulphide stockpiles are being managed to provide a consistent feed to the sulphide plant 
until the underground is developed and reaches full production. A key project underway over the first 
half of FY17 is to increase throughput in the sulphide circuit to an annualised 2.2Mtpa rate with work 
to achieve this having commenced. Mobilisation of the underground mining contractor will be largely 
completed during the September 2016 quarter. 
o  At  Ravenswood,  preparation  is  well  underway  for  the  re-commencement  of  open  pit  mining 
operations at the Nolans East open pit. Initial mining will be from the Nolans East cutback following 
the mobilisation of a mining contractor to site. The Nolans process plant will be upgraded to 2.8Mtpa 
capacity by the addition of tertiary crushing and various minor changes in the milling circuit. Mining is 
expected to commence during the first quarter of FY17 with the process plant upgrade completed 
during the second quarter of FY17.
  Capital  expenditure  for  major  growth  projects  is  expected  to  be  A$170M  (US$124M),  fully  funded  from
existing cash reserves and operating cash flows.
  Exploration budget increased to A$19M (US$14M) focused on resource and reserve expansion at Syama,
Ravenswood and Bibiani.

executives.  To achieve its financial and operating objectives, the Company must attract, motivate and retain 
highly skilled directors and executives. 
 
The Company embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework:
•  Provides competitive rewards to attract high calibre executives; 
•  structures  remuneration  at  a  level  that  reflects  the  executive’s  duties  and  accountabilities  and  is
competitive within Australia;
•  benchmarks remuneration against appropriate groups; and, 
•  aligns executive incentive rewards with the creation of value for shareholders.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee 
 
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is responsible for determining and reviewing the compensation 
arrangements for the directors themselves, the Chief Executive Officer and the executive team. 
 
Executive remuneration is reviewed annually having regard to individual and business performance, relevant 
comparative information and internal and independent external information. 
 
In accordance with best practice governance the Remuneration and Nomination Committee is comprised solely 
of non-executive directors.  
 
Remuneration Structure 
 
In  accordance  with  best  practice  governance,  the  structure  of  non-executive  director  and  senior  executive 
remuneration is separate and distinct.

Directors’ Report  
 
Remuneration Report (continued) 
 
Non-Executive Director Remuneration  
 
Objective 
The  Board  seeks  to  set  aggregate  remuneration  at  a  level  which  provides  the  Company  with  the  ability  to 
attract and retain directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is acceptable to shareholders. 
 
Structure 
The  Company’s  constitution  and  the  ASX  Listing  Rules  specify  that  the  aggregate  remuneration  of  non-
executive directors shall be determined from time to time by a general meeting.   An amount not exceeding the 
amount  determined  is  then  divided  between  the  directors  as  agreed.    The  latest  determination  was  at  the 
Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  30  November  2010  when  the  shareholders  approved  an  aggregate 
remuneration of $600,000 per year.
The amount of aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the manner in which it is 
apportioned amongst directors is reviewed annually.  The board considers fees paid to non-executive directors 
of comparable companies when undertaking the annual review process. Each non-executive director receives 
a  fee  for  being  a  director  of  the  Company  and  for  sitting  on  relevant  board  committees.  The  fee  size  is 
commensurate with the workload and responsibilities undertaken.
Chief Executive Officer and Executive Remuneration 
 
Objective 
The  Company  aims  to  reward  executives  with  a  level  and  mix  of  remuneration  commensurate  with  their 
position  and  responsibilities  within  the  Company  and  so  as  to  ensure  total  remuneration  is  competitive  by 
market standards. 
 
Structure 
In determining the level and make up of executive remuneration, the Remuneration and Nomination Committee 
uses an external consultant’s Remuneration Report to determine market levels of remuneration for comparable 
executive  roles  in  the  mining  industry.  An  external  advisor  has  been  used  to  assist  in  the  design  and 
implementation of a Remuneration Framework that is in line with industry practice. 
 
It is the Remuneration and Nomination Committee’s policy that employment contracts are entered into with the 
Chief Executive Officer and the executive employees.  Details of these contracts are outlined later in this report. 
 
Remuneration consists of the following key elements: 
 
• Fixed remuneration 
• Variable remuneration
o 
o
Short term incentives (STI); and, 
Long term incentives (LTI).
The proportion of fixed remuneration and variable remuneration (potential short term and long term incentives) 
is established for each executive by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and for the year ended 30 
June 2016 was as follows:
Directors’ Report  
 
Remuneration Report (continued)
Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016
Fixed Remuneration 
 
Objective 
The level of fixed remuneration is set so as to provide a base level of remuneration which is both appropriate to 
the position and is competitive in the market. 
 
Fixed  remuneration  is  reviewed  annually  by  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee.    The  process 
consists of a review of individual performance, relevant experience, and relevant comparable remuneration in 
the mining industry. 
 
Structure 
Executives are given the opportunity to receive their fixed remuneration in a variety of forms including cash and 
fringe benefits such as motor vehicles and expense payment plans.  It is intended that the manner of payment 
chosen will be optimal for the recipient without creating undue cost to the Company. 
 
Variable Remuneration – Short Term Incentive (“STI”) 
 
Objective 
 
The objective of the STI is to provide a greater alignment between performance and remuneration levels. 
 
Structure 
 
The STI is an annual “at risk” component of remuneration for executives.  It is payable based on performance 
against key performance indicators (KPIs) set at the beginning of the financial year.  STI’s are structured to 
remunerate  executives  for  achieving  annual  Company  targets  and  their  own  individual  performance  targets.  
The net amount of any STI after allowing for applicable taxation, is payable in cash. 
 
KPIs require the achievement of strategic, operational or financial measures and in most cases are linked to 
the  drivers  of  business  performance.    For  each  KPI  there  are  defined  “threshold”,  “target”  and  “stretch” 
measures  which  are  capable  of  objective  assessment.  For  the  executives,  a  below  “threshold”  performance 
delivers a nil STI, a “threshold” performance delivers a STI equal to 12.5% of fixed remuneration, a “target” 
performance  delivers  a  STI  equal  to  50%  of  fixed  remuneration,  and  a  “stretch”  performance  delivers  a  STI 
equal to 65% of fixed remuneration.  Pro-rata vesting applies on a straight line basis between “threshold” and 
“target” and from “target” to “stretch” Performance. 
 
Target  performance  represents  challenging  but  achievable  levels  of  performance.    Stretch  performance 
requires significant performance above and beyond normal expectations and if achieved is anticipated to result 
in a substantial improvement in key strategic outcomes, operational or financial results, and/or the business 
performance of the Company. 
 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board KPIs for each executive and then 
later assessing the extent to which the KPIs of the executive have been achieved, and the amount to be paid to 
each  executive.  To  assist  in  making  this  assessment,  the  Committee  receives  detailed  reports  and 
presentations  on  the  performance  of  the  business  from  the  CEO,  Company  Secretary  and  independent 
remuneration consultants as required.

Improved safety performance – measured by:
in comparison to prior years; and
o  a lag indicator in the form of a specified reduction in the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate 
o  specified  lead  indicators  designed  to  be  proactive  and  influence  future  events  with  measures 
being  put  in  place  to  prevent  incidents  and  injury.  As  part  of  this  process,  a  Safety  Action 
Performance list is prepared each year outlining a set of actions and deliverables.
  The achievement of defined targets relative to budget relating to:
o  operating cash flow; 
o  gold production; and, 
o  cost per tonne milled.

  A personal performance metric. 
 
These  measures  have  been  selected  as  they  can  be  reliably  measured,  are  key  drivers  of  value  for 
shareholders and encourage behaviours in line with the Company’s core values. 
 
Changes to the STI Plan from 1 July 2016 
 
A recently conducted independent review of the Company’s incentive plans has led to some changes that will 
be implemented from 1 July 2016. The intention of the proposed changes to the STI and LTI plans is to support 
current strategies and business objectives and to ensure both programs are correctly aligned with the creation 
of shareholder value. 
 
With effect from 1 July 2016, amendments have been made to:
the threshold, target, and stretch performance levels to make them more difficult to achieve. This has been 
balanced  by  increasing  the  reward  for  executive  for  a  stretch  performance  to  75%  (from  65%)  of  fixed 
remuneration; and 
introduce Board discretion, on Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer recommendation, to modify 
the payment to an individual or to group participants based on performance factors, safety factors, or to 
recognise  extraordinary  occurrences  which  have  had  a  positive  or  negative  impact  on  results  and 
shareholder value
The individual performance measures vary according to the individual executive’s position, and reflect value 
accretive and/or risk mitigation achievements for the benefit of the Company within each executive’s respective 
areas of responsibility.  They also include a discretionary factor determined by the Board designed to take into 
account unexpected events and achievements during the year. 
 
The aggregate of annual STI payments available for executives across the Company is subject to the approval 
of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.  Payments are delivered as a cash bonus and/or in the form 
of superannuation. 
 
Performance in the 2015/16 Year 
 
The STI payments to executives during the year under review were on average just below the target level. Gold 
production, operating cash flow and cost per tonne milled performance were all around the target level, but an 
increase in the Total Reportable Injury Frequency Rate during the year resulted in a below threshold outcome 
on the safety metric. It is important to note that corrective actions have been taken to improve overall safety 
performance.

Variable Remuneration – Long Term Incentive (“LTI”) 
 
Objective 
 
The objective of the LTI plan is to reward executives in a manner, which aligns this element of remuneration 
with the creation of shareholder wealth. 
 
As such LTIs are provided to executives who are able to influence the generation of shareholder wealth and 
thus have an impact on the Company’s performance against the relevant long-term performance hurdles.   
 
Overview of the Company’s approach to Long Term Incentives
a)  Selecting the right plan vehicle
To  provide  an  effective  tool  to  reward,  retain  and  motivate  executives,  following  receipt  of  advice  from  a 
remuneration consultant in 2012, the Board decided that the most appropriate LTI plan is a Performance Rights 
Plan.    Under  a  Performance  Rights  Plan,  executives  are  granted  a  right  to  be  issued  a  share  in  the  future 
subject to performance based vesting conditions being met. 
 
In June 2016, the Remuneration & Nomination Committee approved the engagement of Egan Associates Pty 
Ltd  to  provide  the  Company  with  CEO  Remuneration  benchmarking  data  and  to  conduct  a  review  of  the 
Company’s Incentive Plan.  The engagement was directly instigated by the Committee Chairman and reports 
provided by Egan Associates Pty Ltd were submitted to the Chairman to ensure KMP with a vested interest 
were removed from this process. 
 
The Committee is satisfied the advice received from Egan Associates Pty Ltd is free from undue influence from 
the KMP to whom the remuneration information applies.  The recommendations and background information 
provided  on  the Company’s incentive plans were  provided to  Resolute as an input into the decision making 
only.    The  Committee  considered  the  recommendations,  along  with  other  factors,  in  making  remuneration 
decisions. 
 
The  fees  paid  to  Egan  Associates  Pty  Ltd  for  their  report  on  CEO  remuneration  benchmarking  and 
recommendations for the structuring of the Company’s incentive plans were $21,000. 
 
b) Grant Frequency and LTI quantum 
 
Executives receive a new grant of performance rights every year and the LTI forms a key component of the 
executive’s Total Annual Remuneration. 
 
The  LTI  dollar  value  that  executives  are  entitled  to  receive  is  set  at  a  fixed  percentage  of  their  fixed 
remuneration and has equated to 75% of fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 50% of fixed 
remuneration for the other executives.  This level of LTI is in line with current market practice. 
 
The  number  of  performance  rights  granted  up  until  30  June  2016  has  been  determined  by  dividing  the  LTI 
dollar value of the award by the fair value of a Performance Right on the grant date.  
 
c) Performance Conditions 
 
Performance  conditions  have  been  selected  that  reward  executives  for  creating  shareholder  value  as 
determined  via  the  change  in  the  Company’s  share  price  and  via  reserves/resources  growth  over  a  3  year 
period.

d) Changes to the LTI Plan from 1 July 2016 
 
Following the receipt of feedback from a remuneration consultant and subject to shareholder approval where 
relevant, the following key changes have been made to the LTI plan with effect from 1 July 2016: 
 
• A cap equal to 1% of Resolute shares on issue has been placed on annual performance rights grants. The 
total number of performance rights on issue at any point in time is capped at 5% of Resolute shares on issue.   
•  An  increase  in  the  threshold  for  the  Total  Shareholder  Return  (“TSR”)  metric  from  P50  to  P60  to  make  it 
harder for participants to meet the minimum requirement for vesting.  
• The methodology of valuing performance rights by reference to the fair value has been changed and future 
performance rights to be granted will be valued at their face value for the purposes of calculating how many 
performance rights are to be granted. 
• Inclusion in the terms of the LTI Plan the ability to adjust the number of performance rights at vesting to allow 
for any capital returns and dividends during the vesting period. 
• Inclusion  in  the  terms  of  the  LTI  Plan  a  clause  to  allow  the  tax  beneficial  deferral  of  exercise  of  Rights 
following vesting conditions being met. This change is a result of tax law changes in 2015 and has been made 
to  encourage  participants  to  retain  shares  received  upon  vesting  of  performance  rights  as  opposed  to 
immediately selling shares to meet tax liabilities. 
• An  increase  in  participation  rates  which  will  see  the  CEO’s  LTI  opportunity  increased  from  75%  of  fixed 
remuneration to 100% of fixed remuneration and the Executives’ LTI opportunity increased from 50% to 65%. 
This is designed to provide stronger alignment of executive behaviour and the creation of enduring shareholder 
value.
The LTI performance is structured as follows: 
 
Performance Rights will vest subject to meeting service and performance conditions as defined below:
  75%  of  the  Rights  will  be  performance  tested  against  the  relative  total  shareholder  return  (“TSR”)
measure over a 3 year period; and,
  25% of the Rights will be performance tested against the reserve/resource growth over a 3 year period.
Reflecting on market practice the Board has decided that the most appropriate performance measure to track 
share price performance is via a relative TSR measure. 
 
The Company’s TSR is updated each year and is measured against a customised peer group comprising the 
following companies:
  Alacer Gold Corporation 
  Beadell Resources Ltd  
  Endeavour Mining Corporation 
  Evolution Mining Ltd 
  Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd 
  Medusa Mining Ltd 
  Northern Star Resources Limited 
  OceanaGold Corporation
  Perseus Mining Ltd 
  Ramelius Resources Ltd 
  Regis Resources Ltd 
  Saracen Mining Ltd 
  Silver Lake Resources Ltd 
  St Barbara Ltd 
  Teranga Gold Corporation 
  Troy Resources Limited
No performance rights (relating to TSR) will vest unless the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR for the 
relevant  performance  year,  as  compared  to  the  TSR’s  for  the  peer  group  companies  for  that  year,  is  at  or 
above the 50th percentile (which has increased to the 60th percentile for grants made after 30 June 2016).
Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016
Directors’ Report 
 
Remuneration Report (continued) 
 
The following table sets out the vesting outcome based on the company’s relative TSR performance for the 
year ended 30 June 2016: 
Relative TSR performance 
Less than 50th percentile 
At the 50th percentile 
Between 50th and 75th percentile 
 
At or above 75th percentile
Performance Vesting Outcomes 
0% vesting 
50% vesting 
For each percentile over the 50th, an additional 
2% of the performance rights will vest 
 
100% vesting
The second performance condition is reserve/resource growth net of depletion over a 3 year period.  Broadly, 
the quantum of the increase in reserves/resources will determine the number of performance rights to vest. 
 
The  following  table  sets  out  the  vesting  outcome  based  on  the  company’s  reserve/resource  growth 
performance: 
Reserves and Resource Growth Performance  Performance Vesting Outcomes 
R&R depleted 
R&R maintained 
R&R grown by up to 30% 
 
R&R grown by 30% or more
0% vesting 
50% vesting 
For each 1% growth in R&R, an additional 1.67% 
of the performance rights will vest  
100% vesting
e) Performance period
Grants under the LTI need to serve a number of different purposes: 
i) Act as a key retention tool; and, 
ii) focus on future shareholder value generation. 
 
Therefore, the awards under the LTI relate to a 3 year period and provide a structure that is focused on long 
term sustainable shareholder value generation. 
 
f) LTI Vesting Outcomes for the 3 Years Ended 30 June 2016
On 1 July 2013, 3,585,228 performance rights were granted to Level 1 employees (Executives and Operations 
General  Managers).    Up  until  30  June  2016,  431,632  performance  rights  had  lapsed  leaving  3,153,596 
performance rights on issue. These performance rights related to the 3 year period ended 30 June 2016, and 
have recently been performance tested. Resolute’s TSR performance over the 3 years ended 30 June 2016 
was at the 60th percentile of its peer group, resulting in a vesting outcome of 70% of the performance rights 
under this metric (which accounts for 75% of the performance rights issued). Resolute’s R&R growth (which 
accounts for 25% of the performance rights issued) over the 3 years ended 30 June 2016 was less than 0%, 
resulting  in  a  nil  vesting  outcome  for  this  metric.  As  a  result  of  the  above  test  results,  1,655,638  of  the 
performance rights met the performance measures and vested whilst 1,929,590 of the performance rights did 
not meet the performance measures and lapsed. This equates to a vesting rate of 46% and a lapsing rate of 
54%.

g) Change of Control Provisions
On the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, the Board will determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, 
the manner in which all unvested and vested Awards will be dealt with. 
 
Up until January 2012, LTI grants to executives were delivered in the form of employee share options.  These 
options were previously issued with an exercise price at a 10% premium to the RML ordinary share price at the 
date the Remuneration and Nomination Committee decided to invite the eligible persons to apply for the option.  
These employee share options vest over a 30 month period. This option plan has been replaced by the new 
Performance  Rights  Plan.  All  existing  options  issued  under  the  employee  share  option  plan  will  continue  to 
vest, however it is the current intention that no further options will be issued in the future.  
 
Options granted in prior periods are vested in accordance with the Resolute Mining Limited Employee Share 
Option  Plan  following  a  review  by  the  relevant  supervisor  of  the  executive’s  performance.    If  a  satisfactory 
performance  level  is  achieved,  the  relevant  portions  of  the  options  vests  to  the  executive.    In  order  for  the 
executive’s options to vest, the executive must successfully meet the deliverables set out in their employment 
contract  specific  to  their  role.    The  assessment  of  whether  the  executive’s  role  has  been  successfully 
performed  (therefore  allowing  the  options  to  vest)  is  done  by  way  of  a  formal  annual  appraisal  of  the 
executive’s  individual  performance.    Assessments  of  performance  generally  exclude  factors  external  to  the 
Company. 
 
The performance of the Chief Executive Officer is assessed by the Chairman, and the performance of the other 
executives  is  assessed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.    The  annual  performance  appraisal  assesses  each 
executive’s  performance  against  the  previously  identified  key  performance  indicators  and  also  assesses 
progress on their development priorities and actions. 
 
The  Company  prohibits  directors  or  executives  from  entering  into  arrangements  to  protect  the  value  of 
unvested  Resolute  Mining  Limited  shares,  options  or  performance  rights  that  the  director  or  executive  may 
become  entitled  to  as  part  of  his/her  remuneration  package.    This  includes  entering  into  contracts  to  hedge 
their exposure to RML rights, options or shares that may vest to him/her in the future.

(i)
Performance Rights lapsed during the current year include two components: a pro-rata portion of Mr Venn's Performance Rights that had not 
accrued at the date of his redundancy.  His remaining Performance Rights will be performance tested at the normal vesting dates;  
and the portion of the Performance Rights issued in December 2012 that lapsed due to the performance hurdles not being met.
(ii)  Performance rights vest in accordance with the Resolute Mining Limited Remuneration Policy and Equity Incentive Plan which outline the key 
performance indicators that need to be satisfied. The percentage of performance rights granted during the financial year that also vested during 
the financial year is nil. No performance rights were forfeited during the financial year.

Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016
About this Report  
The financial report of Resolute Mining Limited and its controlled entities (“Resolute”, “consolidated entity” or 
the “Group”) for the year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Directors on 25 August 2016.   
 
Resolute  Mining  Limited  (the  parent  entity)  is  a  for  profit  company  limited  by  shares  incorporated  and 
domiciled in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The nature 
of  the  operations  and  principal  activities  of  the  Group  are  described  in  the  directors’  report  and  in  the 
segment  information  in  Note  A.1.  There  has  been  no  significant  change  in  the  nature  of  those  activities 
during the year. 
 
Statement of Compliance 
 
This  general  purpose  financial  report  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian  Accounting 
Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Board and the Corporations Act 
2001.  The  financial  report  complies  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  as  issued  by  the  Australian 
Accounting  Standards  Board  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the 
International Accounting Standards Board. The accounting policies are consistent with those disclosed in 
the  30  June  2015  Financial  Report,  except  for  the  impact  of  all  new  or  amended  Standards  and 
Interpretations. The adoption of these Standards and Interpretations did not result in any significant changes 
to the Group’s accounting policies. 
 
The financial report includes financial information for Resolute Mining Limited (“RML”) as an individual entity 
and  the  consolidated  entity  consisting  of  RML  and  its  subsidiaries.    Where  appropriate,  comparative 
information has been reclassified. 
 
Basis of Preparation 
 
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the  historical  cost  convention,  as  modified  by  the 
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through 
profit and loss. 
 
The financial report comprises the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 30 June each 
year. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease 
to be consolidated from the date at which control is transferred out of the Group. Profit or loss and each 
component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the 
Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit 
balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in 
full  on  consolidation.  Interests  in  associates  are  equity  accounted  and  are  not  part  of  the  consolidated 
Group. 
 
Rounding of Amounts 
 
The  financial  report  has  been  prepared  in  Australian  dollars  and  all  values  are  rounded  to  the  nearest 
thousand dollars ($’000) unless otherwise stated.
Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016
About this Report 
Currency 
 
Items in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured in their respective functional 
currencies. Resolute Mining Limited’s functional and presentation currency is Australian dollars.  
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  at  the 
reporting  date  are  translated  at  the  rates  of  exchange  ruling  at  that  date.  Exchange  differences  in  the 
consolidated  financial  statements  are  taken  to  the  income  statement,  except  when  deferred  in  equity  as 
qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. 
 
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are 
reported  as  part  of  the  fair  value  gain  or  loss.  Translation  differences  on  non-monetary  items,  such  as 
equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, are included in the fair value reserve in equity. 
 
The  results  and  financial  position  of  all  the  Group  entities  (none  of  which  has  the  currency  of  a 
hyperinflationary  economy)  that  have  a  functional  currency  different  from  the  presentation  currency  are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:

  Assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at
the closing rate at the date of that consolidated statement of financial position; 
income and expenses for each consolidated statement of comprehensive income are translated at 
average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the 
rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the 
dates of the transactions); and,
  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, 
and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to 
shareholders’ equity. When a foreign operation is sold or borrowings repaid, a proportionate share of such 
exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the 
gain or loss on sale. 
 
Financial and Capital Risk Management 
 
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including gold price risk, diesel 
fuel  price  risk,  currency  risk  and  interest  rate  risk),  credit  risk  and  liquidity  risk.    The  Group's  overall  risk 
management  program  focuses  on  the  unpredictability  of  financial  markets  and  seeks,  where  considered 
appropriate, to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.  The Group 
may  use  derivative  financial  instruments  to  manage  certain  risk  exposures.    Derivatives  have  been  used 
exclusively for managing financial risks, and not as trading or other speculative instruments. 
 
Risk  management  is  carried  out  by  the  Group's  Financial  Risk  Management  Committee  under  policies 
approved by the Board of Directors. The Financial Risk Management Committee identifies, evaluates and 
manages financial risks as deemed appropriate.  The Board provides guidance for overall risk management, 
including guidance on specific areas, such as mitigating commodity price, foreign exchange, interest rate 
and credit risks, and derivative financial instrument risk. 
 
Foreign exchange risk management 
 
The Group receives multiple currency proceeds on the sale of its gold production and significant costs for the 
Syama Gold Project and the Bibiani Project are denominated in AUD, USD and the local currencies of those 
projects, and as such movements within these currencies expose the Group to exchange rate risk.
Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016
About this Report 
Financial and Capital Risk Management (continued) 
 
Foreign exchange risk management (continued) 
 
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.  The risk can be measured by performing 
a sensitivity analysis that quantifies the impact of different assumed exchange rates on the Group’s forecast 
cash flows. 
 
The Group's Financial Risk Management Committee continues to manage and monitor foreign exchange 
currency risk.  At present, the Group does not specifically hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate 
movements. 
 
Diesel price risk management 
 
The Group is exposed to movements in the diesel fuel price.  The costs incurred purchasing diesel fuel for use 
by the Group’s operations is significant.  The Group's Financial Risk Management Committee continues to 
manage and monitor diesel fuel price risk.  At present, the Group does not specifically hedge its exposure to 
diesel fuel price movements. 
 
The below risks arise in the normal course of the Group’s business. Risk information can be found in the 
following sections:

Notes to the Financial Statements A: Earnings for the Year 
 
In this section 
 
Results and the performance of the Group, with segmental information highlighting the core areas of the Group’s 
operations. It also includes details about the Group’s tax position. 
 
A.1 Segment revenues and expenses 
 
Operating segment information 
 
The Group has identified three operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by 
the chief executive officer and his executive team (the chief operating decision maker) in assessing performance 
and in determining the allocation of resources.  
 
Operating segments are identified by management as being operating mine sites and are managed separately 
and operate in different regulatory and economic environments. 
 
Performance is measured based on gold sold and cost of production per ounce. The accounting policies used 
by the Group in reporting segments are the same as those used in the preparation of financial statements. 
 
Inter-entity gold sales are recognised based on the prevailing spot price. The price is aimed to reflect what the 
segment would have achieved if it sold its gold to external parties at arm’s length. 
 
Income tax expense is calculated based on the segment operating net profit using a notional charge of the 
respective tax jurisdiction. No effect is given for taxable or deductible temporary differences. 
 
The following items and associated assets and liabilities are not allocated to operating segments as they are not 
considered part of the core operations of any segment:
•  Realised and unrealised treasury transactions, including derivative contract transactions; 
•  Finance costs - including adjustments on provisions due to discounting; and, 
•  Net gains/losses on disposal of available-for-sale investments.
Recognition and measurement 
 
Revenue from gold and other sales 
 
Revenue is recognised when the risk and reward of ownership has passed from the Group to an external party 
and the selling price can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Sales revenue represents gross proceeds 
receivable from the customer.  
 
Revenue from the sale of by-products such as silver is included in sales revenue. 
 
Interest 
 
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. 
 
Borrowing costs 
 
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that 
is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed 
and are included in profit or loss as part of borrowing costs. 
 
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised is the weighted 
average interest rate applicable to the entity's outstanding borrowings during the period.

Measurement 
 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated as net profit attributable to members, adjusted to exclude costs 
of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends, divided by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element. 
 
Diluted EPS is calculated as the net profit attributable to members, adjusted for:
costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and; 
the  after  tax  effect  of  dividends  and  interest  associated  with  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares  that 
have been recognised as expenses; and, 
other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the 
dilution of potential ordinary shares
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted 
for any bonus element. 
 
i)   Dilutive instruments have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2015
• 
•
•
because the result for the year was a loss.
ii)  Between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements there have been the
following transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares: 
a)  130,000  fully  paid  ordinary  shares  were  issued  to  Level  2  employees  as  a  result  of  two  employee 
option holders exercising their options by paying $1.18 per share.

Recognition and measurement 
 
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income 
based on the national income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, and by unused tax losses (if appropriate).  
 
The Group records its best estimate of these items based upon the latest information available and 
management’s interpretation of enacted tax laws. Whilst the Group believes it has adequately provided for the 
outcome of these matters, future results may include favourable or unfavourable adjustments as assessments 
are made, or resolved. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
for deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits only if it is probable that 
sufficient future taxable income will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Financial Report
for the year ended 30 June 2016
Notes to the Financial Statements A: Earnings for the Year 
 
A.4 Taxes (continued) 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable profit 
or loss; or the accounting profit or loss arising from taxable differences related to investment in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures to the extent that:
• the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference; and 
• the temporary difference is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in 
which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if 
certain criteria are met. Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity. 
 
Tax consolidation  
 
RML and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of 1 
July 2002 and the entities in the tax consolidated group entered into a tax sharing agreement, which limits the 
joint  and  several  liability  of  the  wholly  owned  entities  in  the  case  of  a  default  by  the  head  entity,  Resolute 
Mining Limited. The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly owned 
entities fully compensate Resolute Mining Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated 
by Resolute Mining Limited for any current tax receivable.
Key estimates and judgements 
 
The recognition basis of deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses in the form of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and de-recognised and to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be 
recovered. 
 
Pursuant to the Establishment Convention between the State of Mali and Societe des Mines de Syama 
S.A. (owner of the Syama gold mine), there is an income tax holiday for 5 years post the declaration of 
“first commercial production” at Syama, which commenced on 1 January 2012. 
 
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised for these amounts at reporting date as realisation 
of the benefit is not regarded as probable.  The future benefit will only be obtained if: 
 
(i)   future assessable income is derived of a nature and an amount sufficient to enable the benefit to be 
realised; 
(ii)  the conditions for deductibility imposed by tax legislation have been continued to be complied with; 
and, 
(iii) no changes in tax legislation adversely affect the consolidated entity in realising the benefit.  
 
Unrecognised temporary differences 
 
As at 30 June 2016, aggregate unrecognised temporary differences of $4.460m (2015: $16.883m) are in 
respect  of  investments  in  foreign  controlled  entities  for  which  no  deferred  tax  assets  have  been 
recognised for amounts which arise upon translation of their financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements B: Production and Growth Assets 
 
In this section 
 
Included in this section is relevant information about recognition, measurement, depreciation, amortisation and 
impairment considerations of the core producing and growth (exploration and evaluation) assets of Resolute. 
 
B.1 Mine properties and property, plant and equipment 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Stripping activity asset 
 
The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) in the creation of improved access and mining 
flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future. The costs are capitalised as a stripping activity asset, 
where certain criteria are met. Once the Group has identified its production stripping for each surface mining 
operation, it identifies the separate components for the ore bodies in each of its mining operations. An 
identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping 
activity. The costs of each component are amortised on a units of production basis in applying a stripping ratio.  
 
Development expenditure 
 
(i) 
Costs incurred in preparing mines for production including the required plant infrastructure.  
 
(ii) 
Represent the accumulation of all acquired exploration, evaluation and development expenditure in which 
economic mining of a mineral reserve has commenced. Amortisation of costs is provided on the unit-of-
production method.  
 
Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment 
losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises:

Key estimates and judgements 
 
Stripping activity assets 
 
Judgement is required to identify a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production 
stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The Group 
considers that the ratio of the expected volume of waste to be stripped for an expected volume of ore to 
be mined for a specific component of the ore body, to be the most suitable production measure. 
An identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the 
stripping activity.  
 
Judgement is also required to identify and define these components, and also to determine the expected 
volumes (e.g. tonnes) of waste to be stripped and ore to be mined in each of these components. These 
assessments are based on the information available in the mine plan which will vary between mines for 
a number of reasons, including, , the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location 
and/or financial considerations. 
 
Stripping ratio 
 
The Group has adopted a policy of deferring production stage stripping costs and amortising them on a 
units-of-production basis.  Significant judgement is required in determining the contained ore units for 
each mine.  Factors that are considered include:
Any proposed changes in the design of the mine; 
estimates of the quantities of ore reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high 
degree of confidence of economic extraction; 
future production levels; 
future commodity prices; and, 
future cash costs of production and capital expenditure.
Determining the beginning of production 
 
The Group ceases capitalising pre-production costs and begins depreciation and amortisation of mine 
assets at the point commercial production commences. This is based on the specific circumstances of 
the project, and considers when the mine’s plant becomes ‘available for use’ as intended by 
management which includes consideration of the following factors:
the level of redevelopment expenditure compared to project cost estimates; 
completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment;
• 
• 
•  mineral recoveries, availability and throughput levels at or near expected/feasibility study levels;  
•
the ability to produce gold into a saleable form (where more than an insignificant amount is 
produced); and, 
the achievement of continuous production.
• 
•
• 
• 
•
•

Recognition and measurement 
 
Exploration expenditure is expensed to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as and when it is 
incurred and included as part of cash flows from operating activities.  Exploration costs are only capitalised to 
the consolidated statement of financial position if they result from an acquisition. 
 
Evaluation expenditure is capitalised to the consolidated statement of financial position. Evaluation is deemed to 
be activities undertaken from the beginning of the pre-feasibility study conducted to assess the technical and 
commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource before moving into the Development phase. The criteria for 
carrying forward the costs are:
42,665
20,142
(1,365)
(33,389)
5,898
33,951
•  Such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of
interest, or alternatively by its sale; or
•  Evaluation activities in the area of interest which has not yet reached a state which permits a reasonable
assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant 
operations in, or in relation to, the area are continuing.
Costs carried forward in respect of an area of interest which is abandoned are written off in the year in which the 
abandonment decision is made. 
 
Exploration commitments 
 
It is difficult to accurately forecast the nature or amount of future expenditure, although it will be necessary to 
incur expenditure in order to retain present interests in mineral tenements.  Expenditure commitments on 
mineral tenure can be reduced by selective relinquishment of exploration tenure or by the renegotiation of 
expenditure commitments.  The approximate level of exploration expenditure expected in the year ending 30 
June 2017 for the consolidated entity is approximately $18.720m (2016: $11.825m). This includes the minimum 
amounts required to retain tenure. There are no material exploration commitments further out than one year.

B.3 Impairment of non-current assets 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Impairment testing 
 
The carrying values of non-current assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment exist or 
changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value  may  not  be  recoverable.  At  a  minimum  the  Group 
performs its impairment testing twice annually at 30 June and 31 December.  
 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs and where the carrying values exceed the estimated 
recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
 
Recognised Impairment 
 
No  impairment  was  recognised  in  2016.  Furthermore,  the  assessment  carried  out  for  30  June  2016  also 
concluded that a reversal of prior period impairment charges would be inappropriate.  
 
In  2015,  the  Group  carried  out  recoverable  amount  assessments  for  all  of  its  cash  generating  units 
(“CGUs”), and this resulted in impairment charges for Syama, Bibiani and the Nyakafuru tenement (the latter 
which had been included in the Corporate/Other segment).  Included in the events which triggered a review 
were a lower USD gold price, significant revision of the life-of-mine plan at the Syama Gold Mine, and the 
sustained  difference  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  net  assets  of  the  group  and  its  quoted  market 
capitalisation. 
 
The key change to the life-of-mine plan at Syama over the 2014/2015 year was the cessation of the Stage 2 
cutback  and  the  decision  to  exploit  the  ore  reserves  beneath  the  Stage  1  open  cut  pit  by  way  of  an 
underground  mining  operation.  After  reflecting  the  write-down  of  certain  assets  arising  from  the  Group’s 
revised operating plans, the Group conducted carrying value analysis and non-current asset impairments of 
$561 million, as summarised in the table below:

Key estimates and judgements 
 
Determination of mineral resources and ore reserves 
 
The  determination  of  reserves  impacts  the  accounting  for  asset  carrying  values,  depreciation  and 
amortisation  rates,  deferred  stripping  costs  and  provisions  for  decommissioning  and  restoration.    The 
information in this report as it relates to ore reserves, mineral resources or mineralisation is reported in 
accordance  with  the  Aus.IMM  “Australian  Code  for  reporting  of  Identified  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore 
Reserves”.    The  information  has  been  prepared  by  or  under  supervision  of  competent  persons  as 
identified by the Code.

Key estimates and judgements 
 
Determination of mineral resources and ore reserves 
 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and ore reserves and 
assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation which may change significantly when new 
information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, 
production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, 
result in the reserves being restated. The reserves and resources for each project and area of interest is 
set out in the Annual Report. 
 
Impairment of mine properties, plant and equipment 
 
The future recoverability of capitalised mine properties and plant and equipment is dependent on a 
number of key factors including; gold price, discount rates used in determining the estimated discounted 
cash flows of CGUs, foreign exchange rates, the level of proved and probable reserves and measured, 
indicated and inferred mineral resources, the estimated value of unmined inferred mineral properties 
included in the determination of fair value less cost to dispose (“fair value”), future technological changes 
which could impact the cost of mining, and future legal changes (including changes to environmental 
restoration obligations). The costs to dispose have been estimated by management based on prevailing 
market conditions.  
 
Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market based commodity price and 
exchange assumptions, estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, production levels, operating costs
and capital requirements, based on CGU life‐of‐mine (LOM) plans. Consideration is also given to
analysts’ valuations, and the market value of the Company’s securities. The fair value methodology 
adopted is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. When LOM plans do not fully utilise existing 
mineral properties for a CGU, and options exist for the future extraction and processing of all or part of 
those resources, an estimate of the value of mineral properties is included in the determination of fair 
value. The Group considers this valuation approach to be consistent with the approach taken by market 
participants. 
 
The Group has estimated its unmined resource values based on a dollar value per gold equivalent 
ounce basis individually for each CGU, taking into account a range of factors although principally the 
current market rate for similar resources. However, where the value per ounce from the other 
reserves/resources included in the CGU’s discounted cash flow model (if applicable) is less than this 
market rate determination, the lower value per ounce from the CGU's discounted cash flow model is 
used when calculating that CGU’s value of unmined ounces.  The value per ounce is also discounted 
accordingly for any future costs which would be required to exploit the insitu resources.  
 
In determining the fair value of CGUs, future cash flows were discounted using rates based on the 
Group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital. When it is considered appropriate to do so, an 
additional premium is applied with regard to the geographic location and nature of the CGU. Life-of-mine 
operating and capital cost assumptions are based on the Group’s latest budget and LOM plans. 
Operating cost assumptions reflect the expectation that costs will, over the long term, have a degree of 
positive correlation to the prevailing commodity price and exchange rate assumptions.

B.3 Impairment of non-current assets (continued) 
Key estimates and judgements 
 
Key Assumptions: 
 
The table below summarises the key assumptions used in the year end carrying value assessments: 
 
Gold price (US$ 
per ounce):
2016: $1,050 - 
$1,280 
(2015: $1,070 - 
$1,310) 
2016: 10% - 16% 
(2015: 10% - 
13%)
2016: $68 - $83 
(2015: $0 - $43)
Commodity price and foreign exchange rates are estimated with 
reference to external market forecasts, and updated at least twice 
annually. The rates applied to the valuation have regard to 
observable market data. 
In determining the fair value of CGUs, the future cash flows were 
discounted using rates based on the Group’s estimated real weighted 
average cost of capital, with an additional premium applied having 
regard to the geographic location of the CGU. 
Of the individual CGUs that recognised impairments, Syama applied 
a discount rate in a range of 10%-13%, whilst Bibiani and 
Nyakafuru‘s recoverable amount was determined in the prior year 
using the estimated value of unmined resources.
Life-of-mine operating and capital cost assumptions are based on the Group’s latest 
budget and life-of-mine plans. Operating cost assumptions reflect the expectation that 
costs will, over the long term, have a degree of positive correlation to the prevailing 
commodity price and exchange rate assumptions.

Sensitivity analysis 
 
Any variation in the key assumptions used to determine fair value would result in a change of the assessed fair 
value. It is estimated that changes in the key assumptions would have the following approximate impact on the 
fair value of each CGU that has been subject to impairment in the accounts:
Change of: 
 
2.5% - gold price 
1.0% - discount rate 
2.5% - value of unmined 
resources

Recognition and measurement 
 
All  loans  and  borrowings  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  less  transaction  costs  and  subsequently  at 
amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds received and the redemption amount is recognised in 
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
 
The component of convertible notes that exhibit characteristics of a liability are recognised as a liability net 
of  transaction  costs.  On  issuance  of  the  convertible  notes,  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  component  is 
determined using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond and that amount is carried as a long-
term liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption. The accretion of the 
liability due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. The remainder of the proceeds received 
from the issue of the convertible notes are allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included 
in  shareholders'  equity,  net  of  transaction  costs.  The  carrying  amount  of  the  conversion  option  is  not  re-
measured in subsequent periods. 
 
Interest  on  the  liability  component  of  the  instruments  is  recognised  as  an  expense  in  the  consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income except for when the borrowing costs are associated with a qualifying 
asset, in which case the borrowing costs are capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the qualifying 
asset. 
 
Finance leases, which effectively transfer to the consolidated entity all of the risks and benefits incidental to 
ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the present value of the minimum lease payments, disclosed 
as leased property, plant and equipment, and amortised over the period the consolidated entity is expected 
to benefit from the use of the leased assets. Lease payments are allocated between interest expense and 
reduction in the lease liability. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction 
of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.  
 
The Group’s interest bearing liabilities have a fair value of $26.816m (2015: $118.302m) compared to the 
carrying value of $26.678m (2015: $113.716m). The differences between the fair value and carrying amount 
are capitalised borrowing costs. 
 
The total assets of the entities over which security exists amounts to $481.143m. $61.395m of these assets 
relate to property plant and equipment.  
 
The Group held nil interest bearing liabilities at 30 June 2016 (2015: A$65 million) in currencies other than 
Australian dollars or a different currency to that of the functional currency of the company which holds the 
item.  The  2015  exposure  was  entirely  US  dollars.  Average  interest  rates  charged  on  interest  bearing 
liabilities at period end was 8.0% (2015: 6.1%).

C3.4 Convertible Notes 
 
On 15 December 2014, the Group issued 15,000,000 unsecured convertible notes which had a coupon rate 
of 10% p.a., payable quarterly in arrears, raising $15m (less costs). The notes were convertible into ordinary 
shares, one for one, at the option of the holder and were not due to be repaid until their expiry in December 
2017. 
 
In April 2016, a decision was made to approach note holders to allow for early redemption of the notes. An 
Amendment Deed to the Notes Trust Deed was authorised by a special resolution passed by Holders of at 
least 75% of the Notes and, following the consent received from the Company’s secured credit providers, 
was executed. On the 23 June 2016, 14,050,000 note holders chose to convert into ordinary shares with the 
balance  redeeming  for  $1.06  per  Note,  which  was  comprised  of  the  principal  component  and  early 
redemption fee.

Issued and paid up capital is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received by the Company. 
Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  issue  of  new  shares  or  options  are  shown  in  equity  as  a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
 
Terms and conditions of contributed equity 
 
Ordinary  shares  have  the  right  to  receive  dividends  as  declared  and  in  the  event  of  winding  up  the 
Company, to participate in the proceeds from the sale of all surplus assets in proportion to the number of 
and amounts paid up on shares held.  Ordinary shares entitle their holder to one vote, either in person or by 
proxy, at a meeting of the Company. 
 
Rights of employee share based payment recipients 
 
Refer  to  E.10  for  details  of  the  employee  share  based  payment  plans  which  includes  option  and 
performance rights plans.  Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share.  The names of all persons 
who currently hold employee share options or performance rights, granted at any time, are entered into the 
register kept by the Company, pursuant to Section 215 of the Corporations Act 2001.  Persons entitled to

Notes to the Financial Statements C: Cash, Debt and Capital 
 
Key financial and capital risks in this section 
 
Liquidity risk management 
 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, or having 
the availability of funding through an adequate amount of undrawn committed credit facilities.  
 
Interest rate risk management 
 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.  The Group constantly 
analyses its interest rate exposure. Within this analysis consideration is given to the potential renewals of 
existing  positions,  alternative  financing,  alternative  hedging  positions  and  the  mix  of  fixed  and  variable 
interest rates.  There is no intention at this stage to enter into any interest rate swaps. 
 
Capital risk management 
 
The  Group’s  and  the  parent  entity’s  objectives  when  managing  capital  are  to  safeguard  their  ability  to 
continue as a going concern, so that they can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for 
other  stakeholders  and  to  maintain  a  capital  structure  that  is  appropriate  for  the  Group’s  current  and/or 
projected financial position. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
amount of dividends paid to shareholders (if any), return capital to shareholders, buy back its shares, issue 
new shares, borrow from financiers or sell assets to reduce debt. 
 
The Group monitors the adequacy of capital by analysing cash flow forecasts over the term of the Life of 
Mine for each of its projects.  To a lesser extent, gearing ratios are also used to monitor capital.  Appropriate 
capital levels are maintained to ensure that all approved expenditure programs are adequately funded.  This 
funding is derived from an appropriate combination of debt and equity. The gearing ratio at 30 June 2016 is 
0% (2015: 36%). The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
 
The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is defined as interest bearing 
liabilities  less  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  market  value  of  bullion  on  hand.  Total  capital  is  calculated  as
‘equity’ as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (including non‐controlling interest) plus
net debt.  
 
The following table summarises the post-tax effect of the sensitivity of the Group’s debt, cash and capital 
items on profit and equity at reporting date to movements that are reasonably possible in relation to interest 
rate risk and foreign exchange currency risk.

counterparties where difficulty in recovering these debts in the past has been experienced. 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less a provision 
for any uncollectible debts. Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 30 days from the date of 
recognition.   
 
Fair value and foreign exchange risk 
 
The carrying amount of receivables approximates their fair value. 
 
The Group held nil receivables at 30 June 2016 (2015: A$1.7 million) in currencies other than Australian 
dollars or in a different currency to that of the functional currency of the company which holds the item. In 
2015, the exposure was predominantly Tanzanian shillings (2016: nil; 2015: A$1 million equivalent).

Recognition and measurement 
 
Finished goods (bullion), gold in circuit and stockpiles of unprocessed ore are stated at the lower of cost and 
estimated net realisable value.  Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion 
of  variable  and  fixed  overhead  expenditure,  the  latter  being  allocated  on  the  basis  of  normal  operating 
capacity. Costs are assigned to ore stockpiles and gold in circuit items of inventory on the basis of weighted 
average  costs.    Net  realisable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business 
(excluding derivatives) less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make 
the sale. Consumables have been valued at cost less an appropriate provision for obsolescence.  Cost is 
determined on a first-in-first-out basis.

Gold forward sales are deliverable at an average price of A$1,800 an ounce for a total of 36,000 ounces 
between November 2016 and October 2017 at the rate of 3,000 ounces per month. 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
 
Available  for  sale  financial  assets  consist  of  investments  in  ordinary  shares.  Comprising  principally  of 
marketable equity securities, they are classified as non-current assets unless management intends to dispose 
of the investment within 12 months of the consolidated statement of financial position date. Investments are 
initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in 
the fair value of classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity in the available-for-sale investments 
revaluation reserve. A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security results in the impairment 
charge being removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
The  fair  value  of  the  listed  securities  are  based  on  quoted  market  prices  and  accordingly  is  a  level  1 
measurement basis on the fair value hierarchy. 
 
Restricted cash 
 
The environmental bond represents a receivable carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
The  Ghanaian  Environmental  Protection  Authority  holds  $3.699m  (AUD  equivalent)  of  restricted  cash  as 
security for the rehabilitation and restoration provision of Mensin Gold Bibiani Limited’s Bibiani project. There 
is no external credit rating basis for the Ghanaian Environmental Protection Authority. The average interest 
rate earned on the environmental bond during the period was 0.0% (2015: 0.4%). 
 
Use of derivative instruments to assist in managing gold price risk 
 
As part of the Group’s risk management practices, selected financial instruments (such as gold forward sales 
contracts,  gold  call  options  and  gold  put  options)  may  be  used  from  time  to  time  to  reduce  the  impact  a 
declining gold price has on project life revenue streams.  Within this context, the programs undertaken are 
project specific and structured with the objective of retaining as much upside to the gold price as possible, 
and in any event, limiting derivative commitments to no more than 50% of the Group’s gold reserves.  The 
value of these financial instruments at any given point in time, will in times of volatile market conditions, show 
substantial variation over the short term.  The hedging facilities provided by the Group's counterparties do not 
contain margin calls.  The Group does not hedge account for these instruments. 
 
No gold was delivered into forward sales contracts during the year or in the prior year.  Movements in fair 
value are accounted for through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Liabilities for trade creditors and other amounts are carried at amortised cost which is the amount initially 
recognised, minus repayments whether or not billed to the consolidated entity. 
 
Payables to  related  parties are carried at the principal amount.  Interest, when charged by the lender, is 
recognised as an expense on an accruals basis. Payables are non-interest bearing and generally settled on 
30-90  day  terms.    Due  to  the  short  term  nature  of  these  payables,  their  carrying  value  is  assumed  to 
approximate their fair value.

In  October  2013,  Resolute  drew  down  on  a  US$20  million  extension  on  an  existing  secured  loan  facility 
jointly provided by Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) and Investec Bank Plc (“Investec”). The loan was repaid 
in  gold  ounces  in  24  equal  instalments  of  660  ounces  per  month  between  November  2013  and  October 
2015 inclusive. 
 
The secured loan was classified as unearned revenue on the Statement of Financial Position as Barclays 
and Investec prepaid Resolute for a fixed quantity of gold ounces. Resolute had a legal obligation to deliver 
gold ounces, and recognised revenue as and when it made the repayments in gold ounces.

¹  Resolute  Mining’s  80%  owned  subsidiary  Societe  des  Mines  de  Syama  SA  (“SOMISY”)  received 
notifications from the Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale (“INPS”) alleging SOMISY owed contributions to the 
INPS department on salaries paid by SOMISY to its expatriate employees between January 2005 and July 
2013. Malian Legislation requires the remittance of 24% of an employee’s gross salary and a mandatory 
health  insurance  levy  to  the  INPS  department  and  is  a  form  of  social  tax.  In  accordance  with  the 
Establishment Convention between SOMISY and the State of Mali, SOMISY is exempt from paying INPS 
contributions  and  the  mandatory  health  insurance  levy  on  expatriate  employees  during  the  Syama  Mine 
Development  Period.  In  accordance  with  the  Establishment  Convention,  SOMISY  did  not  remit  INPS  on 
expatriate salaries during the Mine Development Period, and then commenced remitting INPS on expatriate 
salaries  after  the  cessation  of  the  Mine  Development  Period.  SOMISY  has  acted  in  accordance  with  the 
Establishment  Convention  at  all  times.  The  INPS  department’s  claims  are  for  the  period  during  the  Mine 
Development Period only, so SOMISY has no additional or ongoing exposures related to this matter.  
 
SOMISY unsuccessfully appealed against this INPS assessment, with a  Malian Court of Appeal ruling in 
favour of the INPS department on the basis that it was not a government department and hence not a party 
to the Establishment Convention, so it was not obliged to follow its terms and conditions.  As a result of the 
Court  ruling  and  subsequent  failed  attempts  to  negotiate  an  immediate  settlement,  the  Resolute  group 
recorded a A$15m current liability in its June 2015 Financial Statements.  Recent attempts by the INPS to 
collect the assessed amounts triggered further negotiations between the INPS and SOMISY and in June 
2016, a Settlement Agreement was executed by the parties to record an agreed instalment plan that will see 
SOMISY fully discharge this disputed liability by paying A$11.7m to INPS in quarterly instalments between 1 
July 2016 and 30 June 2018.  The instalments payable are A$4.9m in the September 2016 quarter, A$1.5m 
in  the  December  2016  quarter  followed  by  6  quarterly  instalments  of  A$0.9m  each.    The  Settlement 
Agreement incorporated the waiving of some penalties included in the assessments and has reduced the 
quantum  of  the  liability  recorded  in  the  Resolute  group’s  accounts  as  at  30  June  2016  by  approximately 
A$3.3m to A$11.7m. 
 
Resolute continues to strongly dispute the validity of the INPS assessments and negotiations with the State 
of Mali are ongoing to recover the INPS contributions paid or to be paid to ensure the State of Mali does not 
breach the terms of the Establishment Convention.  Up to 30 June 2016, CFA 1.947b (A$4.357m) has been 
paid to the INPS department (paid in the year ended 30 June 2013) and successful negotiations will see the 
monies paid to date returned to SOMISY.

D.6 Provisions (continued) 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and  a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material,  provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the  expected  future  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  rate  that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to 
the  liability.  Where  discounting  is  used,  the  increase  in  the  provision  due  to  the  passage  of  time  is 
recognised as a borrowing cost. 
 
Employee benefits 
 
Provision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the 
end  of  the  reporting  period.  These  benefits  include  wages,  salaries,  termination  gratuity  and  relocation 
costs, annual leave and long service leave.  
 
Restoration obligations 
 
The  Group  records  the  present  value  of  the  estimated  cost  of  obligations,  such  as  those  under  the 
consolidated  entity’s  Environmental  Policy,  to  restore  operating  locations  in  the  period  in  which  the 
obligation  is  incurred.    The  nature  of  restoration  activities  includes  dismantling  and  removing  structures, 
rehabilitating  mines,  dismantling  operating  facilities,  closure  of  plant  and  waste  sites  and  restoration, 
reclamation and revegetation of affected areas.

Key estimates and judgements 
 
Restoration 
 
In determining an appropriate level of provision consideration is given to the expected future costs to be 
incurred, the timing of these expected future costs (largely dependent on the life of the mine), and the 
estimated future level of inflation. The discount rate used in the calculation of these provisions is consistent 
with the risk free rate. The ultimate cost of decommissioning and restoration is uncertain and costs can 
vary in response to many factors including changes to the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of 
new restoration techniques or experience at other mine-sites.  The expected timing of expenditure can also 
change, for example in response to changes in reserves or to production rates. Changes to any of the 
estimates could result in significant changes to the level of provisioning required, which would in turn 
impact future financial results.

Refer to About the Report and Section C for details of how these risks are managed. 
 
Credit risk management 
 
The  Group’s  exposure  to  credit  risk  arises  from  potential  default  of  the  counterparty,  with  a  maximum 
exposure equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets. 
  
Credit  risk  is  managed  on  a  Group  basis.    Credit  risk  predominately  arises  from  cash,  cash  equivalents 
(refer to C1), gold bullion held in metal accounts, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and 
financial  institutions  and  receivables  from  statutory  authorities.  For  derivative  financial  instruments, 
management mitigates some credit risk by using a number of different hedging counterparties. Credit risk 
further arises in relation to financial guarantees given to certain parties.  Such guarantees are only provided 
in exceptional circumstances and are subject to Financial Risk Management Committee approval.  With the 
exception  of  those  items  disclosed  in  C3  and  a  Resolute  Mining  parent  company  guarantee  provided  to 
Macquarie Bank Limited relating to their provision of a hedging facility, no guarantees have been provided to 
third  parties  as  at  the  reporting  date.  The  credit  quality  of  financial  assets  that  are  neither  past  due  nor 
impaired  can  be  assessed  by  reference  to  external  credit  ratings  (if  available)  or  to  historical  information 
about counterparty default rates. 
 
The following table summarises the post-tax effect of the sensitivity of the Group’s other asset and liability 
items  not  previously  reported  on  profit  and  equity  at  reporting  date  to  movements  that  are  reasonably

E.1 Contingent liabilities 
 
Contingent liabilities 
 
Amounts Potentially Payable to historical Bibiani Creditors 
 
In June 2014, Mensin Gold Bibiani Limited, Drilling and Mining Services Limited and Noble Mining Ghana 
Limited (collectively referred to as the “Companies”) entered into court approved Schemes of Arrangement 
(“Scheme”) with their creditors and employees (“Scheme Creditors”).  The Scheme outlines the timing and 
amounts of payments to be made by the Companies to a Scheme Fund and a Future Fund who in turn are 
responsible for making payments to the Scheme Creditors.  The Scheme Creditors arise from transactions 
that  occurred  prior  to  the  Companies  becoming  part  of  the  Resolute  group.    The  Scheme  Fund  and  the 
Future Fund are administered by Ferrier Hodgson.   
 
The implementation of the Scheme has had the effect of removing from the Companies’ balance sheets all 
historical liabilities relating to amounts payable to Scheme Creditors and replacing this with an obligation to 
fund the Scheme Fund and Future Fund as and when necessary.  The unconditional obligations to make 
payments  to  the  Scheme  Fund  have  been  paid  prior  to  30  June  2016.    In  addition  to  those  recorded 
payments  and  liabilities,  the  following  contingent  liabilities  to  provide  funding  to  the  Scheme  Fund  and 
Future Fund exist at year end: 
 
•
•
Potential payment to the Scheme Fund of US$3.600m ($4.854m) if, following receipt of the Feasibility 
Study,  the  board  of  Resolute,  in  its  absolute  discretion,  makes  a  decision  to  proceed  with  the 
development of Bibiani; and  
Potential payment to a Future Fund of up to US$7.800m ($10.516m) conditional upon the generation of 
Free Cashflow from Bibiani mine operations for the period of 5 years from the date that Commercial 
Production is declared.  Free Cashflow means 25% of the sum of Project Revenue for that period less 
Permitted Payments for that period, which includes:  
-  operational expenses and capital costs paid in connection with the mining operations; and,  
-
repayment of principal and interest relating to funds advanced by Resolute up to the commencement 
of mining operations.

E.6 Discontinued operations 
 
On 12 December 2014, the formal handover of the Golden Pride site and all remaining infrastructure to the 
Madini Institute to set up a mining institute of learning was completed, as agreed with the Government of 
Tanzania. This ended Resolute’s presence on site at Golden Pride after 15 years and production of over 2.2 
million  ounces  of  gold.  This  arm  of  the  business,  previously  represented  as  the  Golden  Pride  operating 
segment, has been classified as a discontinued operation and is no longer presented as a segment. 
 
In  October  2015,  Resolute  completed  the  divestment  of  Resolute  Pty  Ltd,  the  company  holding  all  of 
Resolute’s  subsidiaries,  assets,  liabilities,  contingent  liabilities,  and  mineral  rights  in  Tanzania  (the  “RPL 
group”). Resolute entered into an agreement with Cienega S.A.R.L. whereby Cienega S.A.R.L. acquired the 
RPL  group  for  nominal  initial  consideration,  with  a  potential  deferred  consideration  equal  to  50%  of  the 
proceeds of the sale of any mineral rights, related physical assets, and other specific legal actions.

Key estimates and judgements 
 
Share based payments 
The Group measures the cost of equity settled share based payment transactions with reference to the fair 
value at the grant date using a Black Scholes formula or Monte Carlo simulation. The valuations take into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted such as the exercise price, the 
term of the option or performance right, the vesting and performance criteria, the impact of dilution, the 
non-tradeable nature of the option or performance right, the share price at grant date and expected price 
volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of 
the option or performance right.
Employee share option plan 
 
The maximum number of options that can be issued under the Employee Share Option Plan is capped at 
5% of the ordinary shares on issue. The options do not provide any dividend or voting rights.  The options 
are not quoted on the ASX.  One third of the options issued pursuant to the Plan are able to be exercised 6 
months after issue, a further one third 18 months after issue and the remaining one third 30 months after 
issue.  
 
Employees  will  only  be  able  to  exercise  the  options  allocated  to  them  if  they  meet  certain  performance 
criteria.

E.11 Other accounting policies 
 
Derivatives 
 
Derivatives  are  categorised  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  Assets  in  this 
category are classified as current assets or liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be 
realised within 12 months of the consolidated statement of financial position date. Items of this nature are 
recorded at their fair values through profit or loss. 
 
Investments in associates 
 
The  Group’s  investment  in  associates  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting  in  the 
consolidated financial statements. An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence 
and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements. 
 
When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including 
any unsecured long-term receivables and loans, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

E.11 Other accounting policies 
 
New and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective 
 
A number of new Standards, amendment of Standards and interpretations have recently been issued but 
are  not  yet  effective  and  have  not  been  adopted  by  the  Group  as  at  the  financial  reporting  date.  The 
potential effect of these Standards is yet to be fully determined. However, it is not expected that the new or 
amended  Standards  will  significantly  affect  the  Group’s  accounting  policies,  financial  position  or 
performance, except for the following:

for  acquisitions  of  interests  in  joint  operations  in  which  the  activity

measures right-of-use assets similarly to other non-financial assets and 
lease liabilities similarly to other financial liabilities. Assets and liabilities 
arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The 
measurement

inflation-linked  payments),  and  also  includes  payments  to  be  made  in 
optional periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option 
to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Resolute Mining Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Resolute Mining Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow
statement for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In the notes to the financial
report, the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of
Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
