2016 ANNUAL REPORT CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Graham Ascough
CHAIRMAN
On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my 
pleasure to present the 2016 Annual Report for 
Avalon Minerals Limited (‘Avalon’ or ‘Company’)
projects with a 3,000m drilling programme at 
Kietyönmäki, progressing the ESIA at Viscaria and 
for ongoing operating costs and working capital.
Despite the continuing challenging times in the 
resources sector and the unpredictable equity 
markets in Australia and overseas, 2015/2016 saw 
Avalon make significant progress towards its goal 
of becoming a long-term copper producer with 
its flagship Viscaria Copper Project. The Company 
achieved excellent drilling results, completed a new 
Mineral Resource Estimate for the D Zone copper 
deposit at Viscaria, published the re-focussed 
copper only Scoping Study and commenced 
the Environmental Impact Assessment.
During the year Avalon also signed two agreements 
to secure new interests over known lithium 
properties in Finland and Sweden. All exploration 
areas within the Scandinavian portfolio are 
supported by high quality infrastructure. Good 
quality open file data exists and compilation and 
interpretation of this data has commenced.
Low sovereign risk in Finland and Sweden, and 
Avalon’s operating base from Kiruna in northern 
Sweden, together with local partnerships, support 
this initiative. Securing an advanced, drill ready 
lithium deposit at Kietyönmäki, and documented 
lithium–bearing pegmatites in all other areas held 
and under application, allows for rapid advancement 
towards definition of a maiden resource and potential 
initiation of a lithium project scoping study in 2017.
The Company continues to receive strong support 
from its shareholders, and in July 2016, Avalon 
completed a successful fundraising to new, 
professional investors as well as to existing large 
shareholders with a placement at market price, 
to raise approximately $2M. The proceeds raised 
are to be utilised to progress Avalon’s lithium
Further funds will be required to support the 
Company’s strategy of progressing the Viscaria 
Copper Project through feasibility and permitting 
stages, in readiness for mine development. Several 
suitable capital raising options to ensure the 
Company is well funded to move forward to its next 
stage of development are under consideration.
The Company has built a team in the junior 
resource sector that we believe is second to none. 
Along with this team we also have funding and 
shareholder support, combined with the resource 
upside potential to give us great confidence 
that the Viscaria project will be developed.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my 
thanks to Avalon’s staff, management and my fellow 
directors for their dedication and work during the 
past 12 months. We are committed to progressing 
the Company, its flagship Viscaria Copper Project in 
Sweden, and the new lithium projects in Scandinavia 
for the benefit of all Avalon shareholders.
Yours sincerely
Graham Ascough  
Chairman

2016 ANNUAL REPORT OPERATING REVIEW
Avalon’s vision is to become a significant
European focussed copper and lithium company.
Avalon Minerals Ltd (“Avalon” or “the Company”) 
is an exploration and mineral development 
company, focussed on creating value for 
shareholders from the Viscaria Copper Project, 
the Kietyönmäki Lithium Project, and prospective 
lithium and gold projects in Scandinavia.
Value for shareholders will be created by:
1.  demonstrating that the scale of the Viscaria
Copper Project can be sustainably increased, 
is financially viable and is permitted 
for development and production;
2.  delivering a maiden mineral resource 
estimate at the Kietyönmäki Lithium 
Project and demonstrating a viable 
development scenario; and
3.  exploration success at Avalon’s other
lithium projects in Finland and Sweden, 
exploration success at the Satulinmäki 
and Riukka Gold prospects, and the 
discovery of new copper deposits within 
the Kiruna region of northern Sweden.
Avalon has a strong technical and operational 
team, which has significantly enhanced the quality 
and financial viability of its Projects. The quality 
of Avalon’s technical and operational team is 
one of the key strengths of the company.
Avalon’s vision is to become a significant European 
focussed copper and lithium company. The Viscaria 
Copper Project is currently moving through studies 
and permitting with a decision to mine anticipated 
in 2018, while the lithium projects are at an earlier 
stage of exploration with a view to defining a 
maiden resource at the Kietyönmäki lithium 
pegmatite deposit within the next 12 months.
Avalon Minerals is in the business of maximising 
shareholder return through the discovery and 
development of safe, efficient and environmentally 
responsible mining projects in secure tenure, 
low sovereign risk jurisdictions that offer a 
clear, short–term path forward to development. 
We will outperform our peers through ready 
access to existing infrastructure, low utility 
costs and recognised commodity exposure.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT LITHIUM PORTFOLIO
LITHIUM PORTFOLIO
SCANDINAVIAN LITHIUM PROJECTS
During the year Avalon entered into two 
agreements to secure interests over known 
lithium properties in Finland and Sweden.
In Finland, Avalon, through subsidiary Scandian 
Metals Pty Ltd (“Scandian”), finalised an earn-
in agreement with Canadian company Nortec 
Minerals Corp over the Tammela (Somero) Project, 
which incorporates the Kietyönmäki lithium 
occurrence in southern Finland. The terms of that 
agreement were announced on 19 May 2016.
Avalon, through Scandian, has also lodged 
Applications for Exploration Reservations in the 
Tammela, Kaustinen and Seinäjoki areas which 
are still being processed by the Finnish Safety 
and Chemicals Agency (Tukes; the government 
department responsible for administering mining 
tenure in Finland). Some of the areas under 
application have competing applications, but 
these do not compromise Avalon’s exploration 
and proposed resource definition drilling 
program at the Kietyönmäki deposit.
In Sweden Avalon, through Scandian, has 
entered into a Heads of Agreement with private 
Australian interests to explore two approved 
Exploration Concessions and an application for 
an Exploration Concession in Vasternorrlands, 
referred to as the Ladum Project.
The Australian interests include a private company 
held by well-known and highly respected 
geologist and analyst David Ransom, with a 20% 
equity position in Scandian, and the issuance 
of 5 million shares in Avalon being granted to 
the private Australian interests in exchange 
for vending these prospects into Scandian.
Avalon, through Scandian Metals, assumes 
responsibility for a 1% net smelter royalty 
payable to the original Swedish claim owner.
Avalon will fund exploration on the Scandian portfolio 
of lithium projects and standard dilution clauses 
apply once expenditure thresholds are exceeded.
8
All exploration areas within the Scandinavian 
portfolio are supported by high quality infrastructure. 
Good quality open file data exists and compilation 
and interpretation of this data has commenced.
Low sovereign risk in Finland and Sweden, and 
Avalon’s operating base from Kiruna in northern 
Sweden, together with local partnerships, support 
this initiative. Securing an advanced, drill ready 
lithium deposit at Kietyönmäki, and documented 
lithium-bearing pegmatites in all other areas held

2016 ANNUAL REPORT LITHIUM PORTFOLIO
SOMERO LITHIUM PROJECT
Lithium mineralisation at Kietyönmäki is hosted in 
a spodumene–bearing pegmatite dyke swarm. The 
Kietyönmäki lithium pegmatite deposit was drilled 
during the period 1987 and 1988 by GTK. Seventeen 
shallow diamond drill holes were completed to test 
down to 70m below surface across two traverses, and 
one traverse of very shallow holes to identify bedrock.
Assays from drill holes drilled by the Geological 
Survey of Finland (GTK), and confirmed by Nortec, 
include 9m at 2.2% Li2O within a broader zone 
of 24m at 1.3% Li2O within drill hole R310.
The Kietyönmäki lithium deposit is held under 
approved claims and field work has commenced 
in July with drilling expected to commence 
in late August 2016. Avalon has also lodged 
further Exploration Reservation applications 
in the Somero district in southern Finland.
Avalon has estimated an Exploration Target of 8–15Mt 
at 1.4%– 1.8% Li2O (refer to ASX announcement
dated 14 June 2016). The potential quantity and 
grade is conceptual in nature. There has to date 
been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral 
Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration 
will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. 
The Corporate Presentation released on 14 June 
2016 provides further background on this target.
The Exploration Target is comprised of:
•
•
•
•
4–6Mt at the Main dyke drilled to a depth 
of 300m below surface. Existing drilling has 
tested the dyke to 65m below surface
2–5Mt from outcropping and lithium 
bearing pegmatite dykes immediately 
south–west of the Main Dyke, where 
there has not been previous drilling
2–5Mt from lithium pegmatite dykes, partially 
drill tested, to the north–east of the Main Dyke
2–3Mt from mapped dykes within a 1km radius, 
and primarily along strike, of the Main Dyke, 
where there has not been previous drilling
Figure 2: Areas of Exploration Reservation Applications by Avalon, and claims held 
through the Nortec Agreement. The Hirvikallio lithium prospect is surrounded by Natura 
2000 environmental areas and hence is excluded from the current claim areas.

The Nortec Agreement also 
includes two defined gold 
opportunities (Satulinmäki and 
Riukka) held within the claim 
areas and further exploration will 
be undertaken to assess these 
areas. All historical drilling is 
shallow and has only tested to 
~70m below surface. Historical 
assays by GTK included 22m 
@ 3.6g/t from 50 metres 
(hole 391) at Satulinmäki.
In the Kaustinen district in central 
Finland Avalon, through Scandian, 
has lodged an Exploration 
Reservation application and 
2 smaller Exploration Permit 
applications directly adjacent 
to defined lithium deposits 
within the Central Ostrobothnia 
district, home to several known 
lithium pegmatites some of 
which are at an advanced stage 
of PFS and held by private 
Finnish company Keliber Oy.
One Exploration Reservation 
application has been lodged over 
an area of 207km2 covering a 
documented lithium pegmatite 
occurrence, and at the southern 
end of the regional geological 
province that includes the 
Kaustinen district in the north.
Reconnaissance exploration will 
commence upon approval of 
the Exploration Reservation.

LADUM  
LITHIUM PROJECT
In Sweden Avalon, through 
Scandian, has entered into a 
Heads of Agreement with private 
Australian interests to explore 
two approved Exploration 
Concessions and an application 
for an Exploration Concession 
in Vasternorrlands, referred 
to as the Ladum Project.
The Ladum Project covers areas 
within a regional pegmatite 
district that has seen minor 
historical exploration primarily 
for tin. Most of this exploration 
was undertaken by LKAB in 
the 1980’s. The exploration 
included geophysics, till–
sampling, and general geological 
mapping and investigations.
This work resulted in a number 
of tin, niobium, tantalum and 
lithium bearing pegmatites being 
defined. After this initial program 
LKAB ceased all exploration 
and focussed its business 
on iron ore developments in 
northern Sweden near Kiruna.
The main prospect secured under 
approved Exploration Concession 
consists of a NE–trending lithium–
bearing pegmatite dyke swarm, 
and is located within forested 
terrain with easy access through 
logging roads. Main roads, power 
lines and local towns such as 
Sollefteå are all nearby. Ports 
are located approximately 75km 
to the south–east. The climate 
in the area is relatively mild due 
to proximity to the Baltic Sea.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT VISCARIA COPPER PROJECT
VISCARIA COPPER PROJECT
Avalon’s flagship asset is the Viscaria Copper 
Project located in northern Sweden, 1,200km 
north of Stockholm, where the Company has 
estimated a global resource of 52.4 million 
tonnes of copper mineralisation at 1.2% Cu, 
containing 608,900 tonnes of copper.
The Viscaria Copper Project area is located 
approximately 5 km west of the mining town 
of Kiruna. It is close to major infrastructure, 
including the E10 highway, the Luleå-Kiruna-Narvik 
railway, and the established hydro-power grid.
Historically, the A Zone deposit at the Viscaria 
Copper Project produced 12.5Mt of ore at 2.3% 
copper. Avalon’s development plans envisage 
open pit development of the A and B Zone 
deposits, and open pit and underground 
development of the D Zone deposit.
Kiruna is home to the world’s largest 
underground iron ore mine called Kiirunavaara 
that is operated by LKAB (owned by the 
Swedish Government).  Kiirunavaara has been 
in production since 1899 and has produced 
more than a billion tons of magnetite ore.

Two approved Exploitation Concessions (K3 and 
K4) are in place over the main mineralised zones at 
Viscaria and are valid to 2037. Subsequent to the end 
of the financial year, the approved, but under appeal, 
K7 Exploitation Concession at Viscaria was returned 
to the Swedish Mines Inspectorate for further review 
as part of an industry wide examination of appealed 
exploitation concessions in Sweden. Approved 
Exploitation Concessions K3 and K4, which cover the 
main areas of Viscaria copper mineralisation, remain 
in force and are not affected by this development.
The granting of an Exploitation Concession is 
a precursor to consideration by the regulator 
of the Environmental Impact Assessment 
and development permits required prior 
to the commencement of mining.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT VISCARIA COPPER PROJECT
SCOPING STUDY
The findings of the Viscaria Copper Project 
Scoping Study were presented in an ASX 
announcement dated 14 December 2015.
The Scoping Study, and subsequent Updated 
Scoping Study considered a Base Case and 
Target Case development propositions involving 
standard industry technology partnered with 
infrastructure opportunities and local equipment 
manufacturer support not seen by any competitor. 
The Studies have determined that the Viscaria 
Copper Project demonstrates robust project 
fundamentals with low technical risk.
It is envisaged that project execution time will be 
minimal due to the project’s proximity to well–
established infrastructure. For example, no power 
station, camp, airstrip or significant site access 
road will be required. The Project contemplates the 
concurrent development of three open pit mining 
operations at A Zone, B Zone and D Zone and an 
underground operation at D Zone all located within 
one kilometre of a central ore processing facility
On 5 April 2016, the Company announced that it 
had progressed work on a 2.0Mtpa Target Case for 
the Project. The results of this work demonstrated 
that a 2.0Mtpa project delivering greater than 
20,000t copper in concentrate per annum is a viable 
development scenario. (refer to Tables 2 and 3– The 
Company confirms that it is not aware of any new 
information that materially affects the information 
provided in the previous announcements and all 
material assumptions underpinning the estimates 
continue to apply and have not materially changed).
Increased mining inventory has come from an 
expanded open pit and an increased degree of 
confidence in exploration potential from holes drilled 
at D Zone at the end of 2015, yet to be included in 
the mineral resource estimate. Detailed reappraisal 
of all drilling data has identified opportunities 
for improved project metrics, such as additional 
copper mineralised zones in the footwall and 
hanging wall of A and B Zone orebodies, and 
improved understanding of the structural model 
and geometry for the Viscaria orebodies.
PERMITTING
The Environment and Social Impact Assessment 
(ESIA) activities are continuing, premised on the 
re–opening of a former working mine to extract 
copper from extensions to known ore bodies, 
and provide critical input into the environmental 
permitting required to allow for development.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT VISCARIA COPPER PROJECT
EVALUATION PROGRAMME
D ZONE
The objectives of the drilling program over the 
2015–2016 year were to define thicker and higher 
grade zones of copper mineralisation at depth, 
and outside of the historical area of mineral 
resources at D Zone. These objectives were met, 
with drilling by Avalon being extremely successful 
and defining two southwest plunging lenses 
of improving grade and thickness at depth.
Assay results from eleven diamond drill holes were 
received during the 2015–2016 year and significant 
intersections are included in the table to the right 
(refer to ASX announcements dated 2 July 2015, 
15 July 2015, 11 August 2015, 2 September 2015, 21 
September 2015, 20 October 2015, 30 November 
2015, 8 December 2015 and 18 December 2015. The 
Company confirms that it is not aware of any new 
information that materially affects the information 
provided in the previous announcements):
VDD0186 is the first hole to be drilled by Avalon 
from the south–east towards the north–west, 
and provided a complete view of the interpreted 
stratigraphic hangingwall to D Zone. The hole 
was drilled between holes VDD 183 and 185 and 
has intersected a 35m thick ironstone sequence 
(downhole thickness) with visible chalcopyrite 
across multiple intervals. This sequence has 
returned mineralised intervals not previously 
identified. Two narrow intervals of very high grade 
copper also returned anomalous gold assays.
Drill holes VDD 187 and 188 were targeted to 
define shallower high grade copper zones and 
potentially identifying zones that could link 
other isolated high grade zones as development 
plans are advanced. VDD 187 results support the 
interpretation that the higher grade intersections 
in VDD 159 and VDD 156 can be linked through a 
south plunging zone of higher grade mineralisation.
Lower grade hangingwall and footwall zones were 
also recorded in VDD 187 and 188 and these will 
be further investigated to establish if they develop 
into target horizons elsewhere at D Zone.
VDD 189, 190, 192 and 193 (VDD 191 was abandoned 
at 56.6m due to deviation away from the target 
zone), were targeted to deliver significant vertical 
extension to the higher grade, and thicker 
portion of D Zone copper mineralisation.
VDD186
149.45m at 0.38% Cu from 392m including 
13.3m at 1.68% Cu from 506.7, including

A ZONE AND B ZONE
During the year further geological and mine 
modelling studies on A and B Zone were 
undertaken that have enabled delineation of a 
larger open pit over a combined A and B Zone, 
primarily in the southern portion of the deposits. 
This has captured more Mineral Resource 
into Mining Inventory and supports the target 
case of a 2.0Mtpa mining operation. (refer to 
ASX announcement dated 5 April 2016).
This work indicated that there is more copper 
within the combined and expanded open pit than 
the historical resource estimate suggests. This is 
confirmed by Avalon drilling from 2014 (VDD 182) 
and detailed reviews of historical drill holes.
There is potentially significant upside between A and 
B Zones which has been sparsely drilled but contains 
copper. An Exploration Target for A and B Zone open 
pit has been defined at 10–15 million tonnes at 0.7–
1.3% Cu, with multiple mineralised horizons defined.
2016 ANNUAL REPORT VISCARIA COPPER PROJECT
Drill hole VDD 193 intersected a strongly copper 
mineralised interval with visible chalcopyrite.
Drill hole VDD 194, located 100m south of VDD 
193 and at the same level (RL), intersected a 
narrow copper mineralised ironstone interval 
and may define the southern margin of the 
steep shoot intersected in VDD 193.
On 30 November 2015, the Company released 
an updated Mineral Resource estimate for D 
Zone of 11.14 Mt at 1.23% Cu for 137,200 tonnes of 
contained copper. High confidence levels surround 
these numbers, with 93% of the Mineral Resource 
estimate in the Indicated classification. The updated 
Mineral Resource estimate incorporated cut–off 
grades that are consistent with the requirement 
for reasonable expectation of development as 
either open pit or underground mining, and the 
work underpinned the Viscaria copper–only 
Scoping Study released in December 2015.
The updated Mineral Resource estimate did not 
include the final two drill holes for the 2015–2016 year.
VDD 195 was targeted to deliver significant vertical 
extension to the higher grade, and thicker portion 
of D Zone copper mineralisation outside of the 
current new D Zone Mineral Resource estimate.
These results strengthen the interpretations of 
geometry and demonstrate significant vertical 
extent to the D Zone high grade shoots. This is 
also the best intersection of copper within the 
tuffaceous unit host immediately adjacent to the 
main ironstone lode. This once again broadens the 
target style for additional mineralisation at D Zone.
The intersection in VDD 195 is open to 
the north, south and at depth.
Drill hole VDD 196 is the first hole of the 2015 drill 
program to assess the potential southern shoot at 
D Zone. VDD 196 intersected a copper mineralised 
ironstone and altered sequence over a down hole 
interval of approximately 45m. The concept of a 
southern high grade shoot is supported by these 
results and will be the target of future drilling.
These results further enhance the D Zone 
orebody by defining high grade mineralisation 
outside of the resource area and delivers 
additional tonnes to support the next phase 
of assessment at a development scale of 2 
million tonnes per annum throughput.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT VISCARIA EXPLORATION
VISCARIA EXPLORATION
BAHPAGOBBA
Several exploration prospects exist within 15km of 
the Mineral Resources that compose the Viscaria 
Copper Project. The most prospective are interpreted 
to be: West Nukutus, Nihka, Bahpagobba, and 
D Zone Extensions to the North and South.
WEST NUKUTUS
The West Nukutus Prospect is defined by a 
magnetic anomaly of similar magnitude and scale 
to D Zone. The West Nukutus target comprises a 
north–south trending complex magnetic anomaly 
with a strike extent of at least 1200m. Little historic 
exploration appears to have been completed in 
this area. The closest historic drill hole (150m to 
the east) intersected up to 0.3% Cu and 0.5g/t 
Au but did not intersect the magnetic body.
An ASX announcement was made on 10 September 
2015 advising that drilling at West Nukutus had 
identified an iron–oxide and shear related copper 
mineralised system that requires further exploration.
The Bahpagobba target is defined by an 
electromagnetic (‘EM’) anomaly and complex 
magnetic anomalies adjacent to the northern end 
of the A Zone orebody. Bahpagobba has returned 
anomalous copper from historic geochemical 
sampling and drilling results including D2094: 7m @ 
1% Cu from 123m; D2470:1.5m @ 1.8% Cu from 60.5m.
D ZONE SOUTH
The D Zone South target is defined by an 
extension of the magnetic anomalism at the 
main D Zone deposit and historic drilling results 
including VRC0079: 4m @ 0.6% Cu from 49m.
D ZONE NORTH
The magnetic anomaly that defines D Zone 
can also be traced to the north. One line of 
historical drill holes traversed this anomaly 
and intersections including 1m @ 2.4% Cu, 1m 
@ 1.6% Cu, and 1m @ 1% Cu were recorded.
NIHKA
OTHER PROSPECTS
The Nihka target is defined by an 1100m x 500m 
magnetic anomaly located approximately 2 km 
south of A Zone. The anomaly displays similarities 
to the magnetic response of the Viscaria D Zone 
copper–magnetite deposit, but is significantly larger.
Several other exploration prospects within 15 
kilometres of the Viscaria Copper Project have 
been identified from historic data and regional 
exploration datasets. Avalon is currently progressing 
plans to advance some of these prospects.
Diamond drill hole NDD001 was drilled to a depth 
of 326.5m and intersected a sequence of altered 
and brecciated basaltic rocks consistent with an iron 
oxide copper system (IOC system). The alteration 
assemblage included magnetite–epidote–albite–
biotite–chlorite–carbonate–sulphide domains, with 
sulphide veinlets containing trace chalcopyrite. Local 
hydrothermal breccias have been identified which 
again are consistent with an IOC system. Significant 
intervals of high iron (Fe) values were intersected and 
comprised primarily magnetite alteration, with some 
hematite alteration. The interval 90m to 202m averaged 
11.5% Fe, and within this were intervals of up to 20% 
Fe. These intervals were coincident with modelled 
magnetic bodies from the ground magnetics survey.
The intensity of altered rock, together with the 
degree of brecciation and shearing suggests that 
the host rocks have undergone modification from 
a hydrothermal system. Avalon interprets these 
observations to support comparison to other 
magnetite–copper deposits in the district. Therefore, 
further exploration is warranted. The area has no rock 
outcrop and is completely covered by glacial gravels.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT REGIONAL EXPLORATION
REGIONAL EXPLORATION
TJÄRRO
The Tjärro prospect is defined by historic copper and 
gold geochemical sampling and drilling results over 
a 7 kilometre strike length, including: D2808: 15m @ 
1.34% Cu from 80m, including 8m of 1.71% Cu from 
87m; DHLL96–4: 34.5m @ 0.63% Cu from 85.2 m, 
including 3.6m @ 1.63% Cu and 1.3 g/t Au from 90.4m 
and 4.05m @ 1.32% Cu and 0.86g/t Au from 115.45m; 
and DH 78004: 7m of 29.7% Fe, 0.4% Cu from 87m.
Drilling by Avalon of this target in 2012 intersected: 
2.9m @ 0.7% Cu and 0.5g/t Au, within a larger 
mineralisation zone of 11.5m @ 0.4% Cu and 0.2g/t 
Au. This intersection was located 200 metres along 
strike to the south of the anomalous historic drilling 
results listed above, indicating that the prospect 
has good exploration potential along strike.
TJÄVELK
The Tjävelk prospect has returned historical rock 
chip results of up to 12% Zn and 2% Cu. Some 
interesting historic drilling results include: DH 
69102: 34m @ 39.4% Fe, 0.2% Cu from 50m; and 
DH 69103: 39m @ 38.4% Fe, and 0.12% Cu.
Avalon also holds a 100% interest in over 300km2 
of regional exploration tenements in the Kiruna 
district. These tenements are prospective 
for a range of deposit styles containing 
copper, gold, silver, zinc and iron ore.
A prospectivity analysis of these tenements 
was completed and priority prospects 
were identified for further assessment.
VAZASVARRI
The Vazasvarri area is located 25km north of 
Viscaria on the northern extension of the Viscaria 
mafic volcanic belt. Historical exploration by other 
companies had identified anomalous copper in 
peat bog samples and Avalon’s program was to 
follow–up on those results within the context of EM 
anomalies defined from the airborne EM survey.
Historical exploration to the north of the main area 
of interest did include diamond drilling by LKAB 
and Outokumpu. A total of 10 holes were drilled and 
elevated copper was identified, together with trace 
visible chalcopyrite, in various host rocks including 
magnetite–graphite–chert–tuff sequences and diorite.
Peat bog sampling by Avalon has returned 0.52% 
copper from a sample adjacent to a prominent 
EM anomaly– a geometry similar to the A Zone 
horizon at Viscaria. To the east of the anomalous 
peat bog sample historical drilling identified 
up to 0.3% copper over a 1m interval within a 
magnetite–graphite–chert–tuff sequence.

2016 ANNUAL REPORT VISCARIA MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE
VISCARIA MINERAL RESOURCE
The Viscaria Copper Project is divided into three 
deposits: A Zone, B Zone and D Zone. A Zone is 
a copper deposit that was mined by Outokumpu 
OYJ between 1983 and 1997. Development 
consisted of underground mining utilising sub–
level stoping methods. A total of 12.5Mt of ore 
with an average diluted grade of 2.3% copper 
was produced during this time. The A Zone 
mineralisation has been interpreted as being a 
Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) style deposit.
B Zone is interpreted to be a second lens of the 
A Zone mineralisation. Some material was mined
from one level of B Zone during the Outokumpu 
period with access via a development drive 
from the A Zone underground development.
D Zone is a copper and iron deposit and although 
directly adjacent to A Zone and B Zone, has a 
different mineralisation style. It has previously 
been interpreted as an IOCG style deposit, or 
a VMS deposit. D Zone has not been mined.
The established JORC 2012 compliant 
Mineral Resource Estimates for the Viscaria 
Project are shown in Table 4 below.

Directors’ Report
Financial Performance
During the year ended 30 June 2016 the Group incurred a loss of $3,226,121 (2015: loss of $1,950,610).  The loss 
for this financial year is largely due to:
•
The Company has written off further capitalised costs relating to areas of relinquished tenements in 
Sweden. This resulted in a total impairment expense including that described below of $1,659,947;
•  Corporate costs incurred to fund the progression of the Scoping Study on the Viscaria Copper
•
Project; and 
The Heads of Agreement for the acquisition of the Discovery Zone tenements not being extended. 
This resulted in the initial $1million payment under this agreement being refundable from Hannans 
Limited (“Hannans”). The Group has not received any payment from Hannans and has recognised  a 
provision for doubtful debts for the amount owing from Hannans including invoices for share of costs 
due to be refunded by Hannans and has written off its remaining capitalised costs in relation to 
Discovery Zone.
Financial Position
The Company’s non-current assets increased from $36,950,955 at 30 June 2015 to $39,830,230 at 30 June 2016

Directors’ Report
Likely developments and expected results 
The Group will continue exploration and development activities. The Group assesses commercial opportunities 
for corporate growth, including the acquisition of interests in projects, as they arise.  Due to the unpredictable 
nature of these opportunities, developments could occur at short notice.
Environmental regulation 
The Group is subject to the environmental laws and regulations imposed under the Environmental Codes in the 
jurisdictions in which it operates.  The Group is currently engaged in exploration activities which are governed 
by  conditions  or  recommendations  imposed  through  the  granting  of  a  licence  or  permit  to  explore.  
Compliance with these laws and regulations is regarded as a minimum standard for the Group to achieve.  
There were no known breaches of any environmental laws or regulations during the year.

A 
The Group’s executive reward framework is designed to reward performance for the results delivered.  The 
framework  aligns  executive  reward  with  achievement  of  strategic  objectives  and  the  creation  of  value  for 
shareholders, and seeks to conform to market best practice for delivery of rewards.  The Board considers the 
following key criteria for good reward governance practices in determining executive rewards:
competitiveness and reasonableness 
acceptability to shareholders 
performance linkage/alignment of executive compensation 
transparency 
capital management.
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
The  Group  has  structured  an  executive  remuneration  framework  that  aims  to  be  market  competitive  and 
complimentary to the reward strategy of the organisation.
Alignment to shareholders’ interests:
focuses  on  exploration  success  and  project  development  as  the  creation  of  shareholder  value  and 
returns 
attracts and retains high calibre executives.
•
•
Alignment to program participants’ interests:
rewards capability and experience  
reflects competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth 
provides a clear structure for earning rewards 
provides recognition for contribution.
• 
• 
• 
•
The framework currently consists of fixed remuneration and variable remuneration.
Director and executive remuneration consists of both long term and short term performance incentives.  The 
Board  feels  that  the  expiry  date,  exercise  price  and,  where  applicable,  vesting  performance  conditions  of 
option and performance rights issues to the Directors and executives is appropriate to align the goals of the 
Directors and executives with those of the shareholders to maximise shareholder wealth. The Board will continue 
to monitor this policy to ensure that it is appropriate for the Company in future years.
As  part  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  employment,  the  Company  prohibits  executives  from  entering  into 
arrangements to protect the value of unvested long term incentive awards. This includes entering into contracts 
to hedge their exposure to options or shares granted as part of their remuneration package.  Entering into such 
arrangements has been prohibited by law since 1 July 2011.

The overall level of executive reward takes into account the performance of the Group. The Group is involved 
in mineral exploration and did not derive a profit and therefore growth in earnings is not considered relevant.  
Shareholder wealth is dependent upon exploration success and has fluctuated accordingly.

The 2015 performance rights plan links employees’ remuneration to the share price of the Company as the 
performance conditions include ASX trading price hurdles.  No market based performance rights vested this 
year due to the decline in the share price.
Non-executive Directors
Fees and payments to non-executive Directors are structured to reflect the demands which are made on, and 
the responsibilities of, the Directors.  Non-executive Directors’ fees and payments are reviewed annually by the 
Board.   The Chairman’s fees are determined independently to the fees of non-executive Directors based on 
comparative  roles  in  the  external  market.    The  Chairman  is  not  present  at  any  discussions  relating  to  the 
determination of his own remuneration.
Directors’ fees
The current base remuneration was reviewed by the Board on 21 June 2016, and was deemed appropriate for 
the size and activities of the Company.  Directors’ remuneration is inclusive of committee fees. During the year, 
Non-Executive  Directors  elected  to  voluntarily  defer  their  fees  from  1  January  2016  until  such  time  as  the 
Company can raise sufficient funds to progress exploration and evaluation activities.
Non-executive Directors’ fees are determined within an aggregate Directors’ fee pool limit, which is periodically 
recommended for approval by shareholders.  The total maximum currently stands at $300,000.
Retirement allowances for Directors
Directors  are  permitted  to  nominate  a  superannuation  fund  of  their  choice  to  receive  superannuation 
contributions.

Executive pay
The executive pay and reward framework has two components:
Fixed remuneration (base salary, superannuation & other non-monetary benefits) 
Variable remuneration (long-term incentives through participation in the performance rights plan and 
short-term incentives through cash bonuses)
• 
•
The combination of these components comprises the executive’s total remuneration.   
 
Fixed Remuneration
•
Base salary
Base salary is structured as a total employment cost package which may be delivered as a combination 
of cash and prescribed non-financial benefits at the executives’ discretion.
Executives are offered a competitive base pay that comprises the fixed component of pay and rewards. 
Base pay for senior executives is reviewed annually to assess if the executive’s pay is competitive with 
the market.
There are no guaranteed base pay increases included in any senior executives’ contracts.
Non-monetary benefits
Executives may receive benefits including car allowances, car parking and reasonable entertainment.
Post-employment benefits
Executives are permitted to nominate a superannuation fund of their choice to receive contributions.
Long-term benefits
Long-term benefits include long service leave entitlements.
•
•
•
Variable Remuneration
•
Performance Rights Plan
At the discretion of the Board, employees can be invited to participate in the Company’s performance 
rights plan.  The issue of performance rights is designed to reward key employees for performance and 
align  their  performance  with  the  Company  growth  and  strategic  objectives.  Options  may  also  be 
granted, at the discretion of the Board, to employees upon commencement of employment with the 
Company. Options and performance rights issued to Directors are subject to shareholder approval.
•
Cash bonuses
The  Board  may  exercise  its  discretion  to  award  cash  bonuses  to  executives  based  upon  individual 
performance.  No cash bonus was issued to any executives during the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015:  
nil).

During the period the Company paid a premium to insure the Directors and officers of the Company.  Under the terms 
of the policy the Company cannot publish amounts paid for premiums or the extent of the liabilities insured.
Proceedings on behalf of the Company 
No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings on 
behalf of the Company, or to intervene in any proceedings to which the Company is a party, for the purpose of taking 
responsibility on behalf of the Company for all or part of those proceedings.

Auditors’ Independence Declaration
A copy of the auditors’ independence declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set 
out on page 54.
Audit and Non-Audit Services
During the year BDO Audit Pty Ltd, or its related entities, has performed certain other services in addition to the statutory 
audit.
The Board has considered the non-audit services provided during the year and is satisfied that the provision of those 
non-audit  services  during  the  year  is  compatible  with,  and  did  not  compromise,  the  auditor  independence 
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reason:
The non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out 
in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not result in the auditor reviewing or auditing the 
auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate for 
the Group or jointly sharing risks and rewards.
Details of the amounts paid to the auditor of the Group, currently BDO Audit Pty Ltd, and their related practices for 
audit and non-audit services provided during the year are set out below:

Independent Directors 
When  determining  whether  or  not  a  Non-Executive  Director  is  independent,  the  Director  must  not  fail  any  of  the 
following materiality thresholds:
•
•
•
more  than  5%  of  Company  shares  are  held  by  the  Director  and  any  entity  or  individual  directly  or  indirectly 
associated with the Director; 
no sales are made to, or purchases made from, any entity or individual directly or indirectly associated with the 
Director; and  
none of the Directors’ income or the income of an individual or entity directly or indirectly associated with the 
Director, is derived from a contract with any member of the Group other than income as derived as a Director 
of the entity.
At the date of this report, the board consists of one independent Non-Executive Chairman, one Executive Director and 
two independent, Non-Executive Directors.  Independent Directors have shareholdings less than 5% of the total shares 
on issue.  The board is considered to be appropriate for the size of the Company and the nature of its activities. It is a 
cost effective structure for managing the Company and there is no justification for appointing additional independent 
directors.  
 
Board Composition 
When the need for a new director is identified, selection is based on the skills and experience of prospective directors, 
having regard to the present and future needs of the Company. Any director so appointed must then stand for election 
at the next meeting of shareholders of the Company.

more than three calendar years or beyond the third annual general meeting following his or her election, whichever is 
longer, without submitting for re-election. One third of the directors must retire each year and are eligible for re-election.

since their appointment or last election.

Corporate Governance Statement
The Audit and Financial Risk Committee has met twice during the financial year. The CEO & Managing Director and 
the Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary are invited to attend the Committee meetings.
Where  appropriate,  the  Board  and  the  Audit  and  Financial  Risk  Committee  engage  independent  experts  or 
professional advisors to assist with the identification and/or management of any key risk areas identified.
To ensure that risks, and also opportunities, are identified on a timely basis and that activities are aligned with the risks 
and opportunities identified, the Board has also adopted a Risk Management Policy to:
• 
• 
•
• 
• 
•
ensure the Company’s risk management policies and procedures are adequate; 
monitor compliance with the Company’s risk management policies and procedures; 
keep itself appraised of the latest developments, policies, trends in relation to financial matters, rules, regulations, 
to the extent that they may affect the Company or the markets in which the Company operates; 
review the Company’s internal financial control mechanisms and risk management policies; 
compile a risk profile of the material risks facing the Company; 
review major non-financial regulatory matters covering areas of exposure including the environment, safety and 
health,  asset  protection  (including  insurance),  discrimination  and  harassment,  conflict  of  interest  and  ethical 
standards.
This financial year the CEO & Managing Director and the Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary provided a 
statement to the Board in writing in respect to the integrity of the financial statements, that they are founded on a 
sound  system  of  risk  management  and  internal  compliance  and  control  systems  are  operating  efficiently  and 
effectively in all material respects.  
 
Remuneration/Nomination and Performance 
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee with all directors being members of the Committee. Given the 
size of the Company and the nature of its activities, it is considered that all directors participate in matters relating to 
remuneration  and  director  nomination.  It  is  a  cost  effective  structure  and  there  is  no  justification  for  appointing 
additional independent directors.
The Committee members are:
Mr Don Hyma, (Chairman), Mr Graham Ascough, Mr Malcolm Norris and Mr Crispin Henderson
The Committee deals with matters of remuneration and nomination. The nomination of new Directors and the setting, 
or  review,  of  remuneration  levels  of  Directors  and  senior  executives,  is  performed  by  the  Committee  and 
recommendations made to the Board as a whole for approval by resolution (with abstentions from relevant directors 
where there is a conflict of interest). Where the Committee or the Board considers that particular expertise or information 
is required, which is not available from within the Board, appropriate external advice may be taken prior to a final 
decision.
The Committee also deals with the remuneration of Directors and key executives of the Company. The Company’s 
policy is to remunerate non-executive Directors at market rates for time, commitment and responsibilities. The Board 
determines  payments  to  the  non-executive  Directors  and  reviews  their  remuneration  annually,  based  on  market 
practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought where required. The maximum aggregate 
amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive Directors is subject to approval by shareholders.  
 
Code of Conduct 
The board has adopted a Code of Conduct to guide Directors, officers, employees and contractors in carrying out 
their  duties  and  responsibilities.  This  Code  of  Conduct  set  out  the  principles  and  standards  which  the  Board, 
management, employees and contractors of the Company are encouraged to strive towards when dealing with each 
other, shareholders and the community as a whole.

Corporate Governance Statement
Conflict of interest 
The Directors must keep the Company informed on an ongoing basis, of any interest that could potentially conflict with 
those of the Company. Where the Board believes a significant conflict exists, the director concerned does not receive 
the relevant Board papers and is not present at the meeting whilst the item is considered.
Independent Professional Advice 
Each Director has the right of access to all relevant Company information and to the Company’s executives. Directors 
have the right, in connection to their duties and responsibilities as Directors, to seek independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense.  For independent legal advice in excess of a cost of $15,000, prior approval of the Chairman 
is required, which will not be unreasonably withheld, before any expense is incurred on behalf of the Company.
Share Trading Policy 
Directors and employees are not permitted to trade shares whist in the possession of price sensitive information. Directors 
and employees are prohibited from trading in securities whilst in possession of any inside information in accordance 
with the Corporations Act 2001.
Communication to market and shareholders 
The Board Charter, Code of Conduct and Share Trading Policy all recognise legal and other obligations and support 
the legitimate interests of all stakeholders. Directors aim to ensure that the shareholders, on behalf of whom they act 
are informed of all information necessary to assess the performance of the Directors and the Company. Information is 
communicated to shareholders and the market through:
• 
•
• 
• 
• 
•
the Annual Report, which is available to all shareholders: 
other  periodic  reports,  such  as  Quarterly  Reports,  which  are  lodged  with  ASX  and  available  for  shareholder 
scrutiny; 
other announcements made in accordance with ASX Listing Rules; 
special purpose information memoranda issued to shareholders as appropriate; 
the Annual General Meeting and other meetings called to obtain approval for Board action as appropriate; and  
the Company’s website.
The continuous disclosure policy adopted by the Board ensures procedures are in place so that the market is properly 
informed of matters which may have a material impact on the price at which securities are traded.
Diversity Policy 
The Company does not at present have a Diversity Policy in place due to the size and stage of development of the 
Company.  Staff changes implemented have resulted in reduced staffing levels and the Company currently has a 
female communications officer based in Sweden.
External Auditors 
The external auditor is BDO Audit Pty Ltd. The external auditor attends the Annual General Meeting and part of the 
agenda  is  the  tabling  of  the  financial  statements  and  inviting  shareholders  to  ask  the  Directors  or  the  auditor  any 
questions with regard to the financial statements and the audit report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 June 2016
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below.  These 
policies have been consistently applied for the financial year to 30 June 2016, unless otherwise stated.
Corporate information 
The consolidated financial report of Avalon Minerals Limited for the year ended 30 June 2016  was authorised 
for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 15 August 2016.
Avalon  Minerals  Limited  is  a  company  limited  by  shares  incorporated  in  Australia  whose  shares  are  publicly 
traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.  Its registered office and principal place of business is 9 Gardner 
Close, Milton QLD 4064.
The Group is a for-profit entity.  A description of the nature of the Consolidated Entity’s operations and its principal 
activities is included in the Directors’ report.
Through the use of the internet, the Company seeks to ensure that our corporate reporting is timely, complete 
and available globally at minimum cost to the Group.  All financial reports, Company announcements and other 
information are available on the Company’s website:   www.avalonminerals.com.au
Basis of preparation
(a) 
The financial report is a general purpose financial report, which has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  other  authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board.
The presentation currency is Australian dollars.
The report has been prepared on the basis of the going concern an d historical cost conventions.
Going concern 
The Group incurred a net loss of $3,226,121 for the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: $1,950,610 loss).  As at 30 June 
2016 the Group has net cash reserves of $631,059 (2015: $3,208,654) and a net current asset surplus of $400,329 
(2015: $2,887,174).
The  Group  has  a  receivable  of  $1,086,757 from  Hannans  Ltd ,  in  relation  to  the  acquisition  of  Rakkurijarvi 
Exploration  Permit  and  the  Discovery  Zone  Exploitation  Concession.  Due  to  uncertainty  surrounding  this 
receivable a provision for doubtful debts has been recorded.
The Company has filed proceedings in the WA Supreme Court seeking to recover all sums due under the Heads 
of Agreement with Hannans. Hannans have filed a defence and counterclaim. Hannans has also applied for 
summary judgment.
Avalon will pursue its claim and vigorously defend the counterclaim. 
In February 2016, Innovation Australia found that the Company’s R&D activities for the years ended 30 June 2013 
and  30  June  2014  were  deemed  to  not  be  core  or  supporting  activities  under  the  Industry  Research  and 
Development Act 1986 (“the Act”). The Company requested a review of this decision under Division 5 of the Act 
in March 2016, and hosted representatives of Innovation Australia to further discuss Avalon’s R&D activities.
As at the date of this report the final results of this review are yet to be received from Innovation Australia, and 
the Company is still of the opinion that the activities undertaken are valid R&D activities as per the Act. These 
events result in  the Company recognising a contingent liability for the repayment of R&D claims received of 
$2,765,114 (net of fees).
65
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
The  ability  of  the  Group  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  is  principally  dependent  upon  one  or  more  of  the 
following:
the ability of the company to raise additional capital in the future;  
the successful exploration and subsequent exploitation of the Group’s tenements; and
• 
• 
•  A successful appeal to the Innovation Australia decision in relation to the Company’s 2012/13 and 2013/14
R&D claims.
These conditions give rise to material uncertainty over the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors believe that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate due to the following reasons:
•
• 
•
•
To date the Group has funded its activities through issuance of equity securities and it is expected that the 
Group will be able to fund its future activities through further issuances of equity securities;  
Subsequent to balance date the Company has arranged a placement to raise approximately $1.9 million;  
The directors believe there is sufficient cash available for the Group to continue operating until it can raise 
sufficient further capital to fund its ongoing activities; and 
Management as well as third party advisors believe that the Company’s R&D activities are valid and an 
appeal against the Innovation Australia decision in relation to the Company’s 2012/13 and 2013/14 R&D 
claims will be successful.
Should the Group be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be required to realise its assets and extinguish 
its liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business, and at amounts that differ from those stated in the 
financial statements.
Statement of compliance
This financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded 
asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities and appropriate disclosures that may be necessary 
should the Group be unable to continue as a going concern. 
(b) 
The  financial  report  complies  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.  
(c) 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Avalon Minerals 
Limited (“Company”, “Avalon” or “Parent Entity”) as at 30 June 2016 and the results of all the subsidiaries for the 
financial period then ended. The Company and its subsidiaries together are referred to in this financial report as 
the Group or Consolidated Entity.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all those entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The group has 
control over an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity and has the ability to use its controlling power to affect those returns.
Subsidiaries  are  fully  consolidated  from  the  date  on  which  control  is  transferred  to  the  Group.    They  are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  Group  companies  are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of 
the  asset  transferred.    Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  have  been  changed  where  necessary  to  ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(d)  Operating segments 
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components 
of the same entity), whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker 
to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which 
discrete  financial  information  is  available.    This  includes  start-up  operations  which  are  yet  to  earn  revenues.  
Management will also consider other factors in determining operating segments such as the existence of a line 
manager and the level of segment information presented to the Board of Directors.
Operating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision 
makers, being the Board of Directors.
The Group aggregates two or more operating segments when they have similar economic characteristics, and 
the segments are similar in each of the following respects:
• 
• 
•
Nature of the products and production process; 
Type or class of customer for the products; and 
Methods used to distribute the products
Operating  segments  that  meet  the  quantitative  criteria  as  prescribed  by  AASB  8  are  reported  separately.  
However, an operating segment that does not meet the quantitative criteria is still reported separately where 
information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements.
Information about other business activities and operating segments that are below the quantitative criteria are 
combined and disclosed in a separate category for ‘all other segments’. 
(e) 
Interest income
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method.  This is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective 
interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of 
the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Government grants
Revenue  received  from  government  grants,  such  as  Research  and  Development  rebates,  are recognised  in 
profit or loss on a systematic basis over the period(s) in which the entity recognises, as expenses, the costs for 
which the grant was intended to compensate. If the offset relates to items that have been capitalised (e.g. 
exploration assets, development assets, etc.), the offset income must be deferred by deducting the offset from 
the carrying amount of the asset for which the offset/grant was intended to compensate.  
(f) 
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income 
based on the income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, 
and to unused tax losses.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply 
when  the  assets  are  recovered  or  liabilities  are  settled,  based  on  those  tax  rates  which  are  enacted  or 
substantively enacted for each jurisdiction.  The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of 
deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability.  An exception is 
made for certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability.  No deferred 
tax asset or liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences if they arose in a transaction, other 
than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable 
profit or loss.
Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  deductible  temporary  differences  and  unused  tax  losses  only  if  it  is 
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Leases
Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised 
directly in equity. 
(g) 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified 
as operating leases.  Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 
charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease (refer to Note 18).    
(h) 
Business  combinations  are  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition  method.    The  consideration  transferred  in  a 
business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition-
date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners 
of the acquiree and the equity issued by the acquirer, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree.  For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.  Acquisition related 
costs are expensed as incurred.
Business combinations
When  the  Group  acquires  a  business,  it  assesses  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  for  appropriate 
classification  and  designation  in  accordance  with  the  contractual  terms,  economic  conditions,  the  Group’s 
operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.  This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held 
equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at fair value as at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Impairment of assets
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date.  Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or 
liability will be recognised in accordance with AASB 139 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income. 
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be remeasured.  
(i) 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate 
of the asset’s recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of 
disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset's value in use 
cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value.  In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the 
cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
68
AVALON MINERALS | ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Page 67
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or 
cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. Impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in profit or loss.
An  assessment  is  also  made  at  each  reporting  date  as  to  whether  there  is  any  indication  that  previously 
recognised  impairment  losses  may  no  longer  exist  or  may  have  decreased.    If  such  indication  exists,  the 
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was 
recognised.  If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.  That 
increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.  
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
(j) 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  includes  cash  on  hand,  deposits  held  at  call  with  financial  institutions,  other 
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, and bank overdrafts.  
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position. 
(k) 
Trade  receivables  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost,  less 
provision for doubtful debts.  Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 120 days from the date of 
recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Trade receivables
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectible 
are written off.  A provision for doubtful receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.  The amount of 
the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.  The amount of the provision is recognised in profit or loss. 
(l) 
Financial assets are classified in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and receivables, held to maturity investments or available for sale investments, as appropriate.  The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.  Management determines the classification 
of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date.
Investments and other financial assets
Loans and receivables
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  that  are  not 
quoted in an active market.  They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor 
with no intention of selling the receivable.  They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 
greater than 12 months after the reporting date which are classified as non-current assets.  Loans and receivables 
are included in receivables in the Statement of Financial Position.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(m)  Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation.  Historical cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.  All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during 
the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts, net of their 
residual values, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-
Exploration equipment 
Mine infrastructure 
Motor vehicles 
Office furniture, fittings and equipment 
Computer and electronic equipment 
Leasehold improvements
3-5 years 
50 years 
3-5 years 
3-5 years 
3-5 years 
3-5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Trade and other payables
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.  These are 
included in the profit or loss. 
(n) 
Trade payables are carried at amortised cost.  These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided 
to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged 
to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.  The amounts are unsecured 
and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. 
(o) 
Provisions  are  recognised  when:  the  Group  has  a  present  legal  or  constructive  obligation  as  a  result  of  past 
events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated.  Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.  A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of 
an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(p) 
(i)
Employee benefits 
Wages, salaries and annual leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled in 
full  within  12  months  after  the  end  of  the  reporting  date  are  recognised  for  employees'  services  up  to  the 
reporting date and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
(ii)
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group contributes to various defined contribution superannuation funds for its employees.
Contributions to the funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable.
(iii)
Share-based payments
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Director/employee share option plan 
and the performance rights plan.
The fair value of options and performance rights granted under these plans is recognised as an employee 
benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  Where applicable the fair value is measured at grant 
date  and  recognised  over  the  period  during  which  the  Directors  or  employees  become  unconditionally 
entitled to the options or performance rights.  Where applicable the fair value at grant date is independently 
valued using a Binomial pricing model.
The cumulative expense recognised between grant date and vesting date is adjusted to reflect the Directors’ 
best  estimate  of  the  number  of  options  or  performance  rights  that  will  ultimately  vest  because  of  internal 
conditions of the options or performance rights, such as the employee having to remain with the Company 
until vesting date, or such that employees are required to meet internal targets.  No expense is recognised for 
options/performance rights that do not ultimately vest because internal conditions are not met.  An expense is 
still recognised for options/performance rights that do not ultimately vest because a market condition was not 
met.
(q)  Contributed equity 
Ordinary  shares  are  classified  as  equity.  Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  issue  of  new  shares  or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
(r) 
(i)
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit  or  loss  attributable  to  equity  holders  of  the 
Consolidated  Entity,  excluding  any  costs  of  servicing  equity  other  than  ordinary  shares,  by  the  weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares 
issued during the year.
(ii)
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into 
account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration 
in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
(s) 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Group is accumulated separately for 
each  area  of  interest.    Such  expenditure  comprises  net  direct  costs  and  an  appropriate  portion  of  related 
overhead  expenditure,  but  does  not  include  general  overheads  or  administrative  expenditure  not  having  a 
specific focus with a particular area of interest.
Each area of interest is limited to a size related to a known or probable mineral resource capable of supporting 
a mining operation. Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest is carried forward as an 
asset provided that the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current and one of the following conditions is 
met:
•
•
such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area 
of interest or, alternatively, by its sale; or 
exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits 
a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active 
and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Expenditure which fails to meet the conditions outlined above is written off, furthermore, the Directors regularly 
review the carrying value of exploration and evaluation expenditure and make write downs if the values are not 
expected to be recoverable.
When an area of interest is abandoned, any expenditure carried forward in respect of that area is written off. All 
capitalised exploration assets are not being depreciated. 
(t)  Goods and services tax (GST) / Value added Tax (VAT) 
GST  is  applicable  to  Australia  and  reported  through  the  Australian  Taxation  Office  whilst  VAT  is  applicable  in 
Sweden and reported through the Swedish Skatteverket Office. GST and VAT are the same tax instrument.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST/VAT, unless the GST/VAT 
incurred is not recoverable from the respective taxation offices. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST/VAT receivable or payable.  The net amount 
of GST/VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the respective taxation offices is included with other receivables or 
payables in the Statement of Financial Position.
Cash  flows  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis.    The  GST/VAT  components  of  cash  flows  arising  from  investing  or 
financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the respective taxation offices, are presented as 
operating cash flows.

Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(u) 
(i)
Foreign currency transactions and balances  
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency of each of the Group’s entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates.  The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian 
dollars  which  is  the  Company’s  functional  and  presentation  currency.    The  functional  currency  of  the 
Consolidated Entity’s foreign subsidiaries is the Swedish Krona.
(ii)
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the date of the transaction.  Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the period end exchange rate. 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss.
(iii)  Group companies
The  results  and  the  financial  position  of  all  the  Group  entities  (none  of  which  has  a  currency  of  a 
hyperinflationary  economy)  that  have  a  functional  currency  different  from  the  presentation  currency  are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• 
• 
•
Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date; 
Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period; and 
Retained profits are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group’s 
foreign currency translation reserve in the Statement of Financial Position.  These differences are recognised in 
the profit or loss in the period in which the operation is disposed.
(v)  Application of new and revised Accounting Standards  
New and revised AASBs affecting amounts reported and/or disclosures in the financial statements
In  the  current  year,  the  Group  has  applied  a  number  of  new  and  revised  AASBs  issued  by  the  Australian 
Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or 
after 1 July 2015.
The amendments did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
(w)  New Accounting Standards issued but not yet effective 
There are no accounting standards that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material impact 
on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Note 2.   Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and 
foreign currency risk.
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.
Risk management is carried out by the Board of Directors under policies approved by the Board.
The Board identifies and evaluates financial risks and provides written principles for overall risk management.
(i)
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposures to credit risk at the reporting date in relation to each class of recognised 
financial asset is the carrying amount of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position.
Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and trade 
and other receivables.
The Group trades only with recognised, credit worthy third parties.  As the Group holds the majority of the 
Group’s  cash  balances  with  one  institution,  the  credit  risk  is  concentrated  in  one  area. Risk  is  considered 
minimal as the institution is Australian and AA rated.
The Group’s primary banker is National Australia Bank Limited.  At balance sheet date all operating accounts 
are with this bank, except for funds transferred to Sweden to meet the working capital needs of the subsidiary 
companies.  The cash needs of the subsidiary operations are monitored by the Company and funds are 
advanced to the Swedish operations on an as needs basis.  The Directors believe this is the most efficient 
method of balancing the monitoring and mitigation of potential credit risks arising out of holding cash assets 
in overseas jurisdictions, and the funding mechanisms required by the Group.
The  Group  recognised  a  provision  for  doubtful  debts  for  $1,086,757  during  the  financial  year  relating  to 
receivables owed by Hannans Ltd (refer to note 9). No other impairment of the Group’s financial assets was 
recognised during the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: $Nil).
(ii)
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash to meet commitments as and when 
they fall due.
It is the Group’s policy to review the Group’s liquidity position including cash flow forecasts to determine the 
forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.
The remaining contractual maturities of the Group’s liquid financial assets and financial liabilities are:
Liquid financial assets
Three months or less
Greater than three months
Liquid financial liabilities
Three months or less

Note 2.   Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
Fair values
All financial assets and liabilities recognised on the Statement of Financial Position, whether they are carried 
at cost or at fair value, are recognised at amounts that represent a reasonable approximation of fair value 
unless otherwise stated in the applicable notes.
(iii)
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rates primarily relates to its cash and cash equivalents.
At balance date, the Group had the following exposure to variable interest rate risk.

2016
$

The following sensitivity analysis is based on the interest rate risk exposure in existence at the reporting date.  
The 1% sensitivity (2015: 1%) is based on reasonably possible changes over a financial year, using the observed 
range of actual historical rates for the preceding five year period.
At 30 June 2016, if interest rates had moved, as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax loss would have been affected as follows:
Post tax gain/(loss)
+1.0% (100 basis points)
-1.0% (100 basis points)
2016
$
2015
$
6,311
(6,311)
32,087
(32,087)
The average interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2016 was 1.30% (2015: 2.10%).
The Group deals with financial institutions that have an AA rating or better.
Foreign currency risk
(iv)
As a result of significant investment in Sweden, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected significantly by 
movements in the Swedish Krona/Australian Dollar exchange rates.  The Group does not consider there to be 
a significant exposure to the Swedish Krona as it represents the functional currency of a controlled entity.
The Group does not hold any financial assets or liabilities at 30 June 2016 which create a material exposure to 
changes in foreign exchange rates.

Note 3.   Accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The resulting accounting estimates will, by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results.  The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual 
reporting period are:
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group has carrying balances for exploration and evaluation assets.  Exploration and evaluation assets have 
been capitalised on the basis that the Group will commence commercial production in the future from which 
the costs will be amortised in proportion to the depletion of the mineral resources. A regular review is undertaken 
of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that 
area of interest. The carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets at 30 June 2016 is $39,685,644 (2015: 
$36,773,345)
Note 4.   Segment reporting
The Group has determined its operating segment based upon reports reviewed by the Board (Chief Operating 
Decision Makers) for making strategic decisions.  The Board has identified a single operating segment being 
exploration for and evaluation of copper and lithium projects in Scandinavia.
The reportable segment is based on aggregated operating segments determined by the geographical similarity 
of the Group’s areas of interest and the economic environments in which the Group operates.
The  Group  continues  to  review  and  assess  other  resource  projects  both  within  Australia  and  overseas  as 
opportunities arise.
Accounting policies and inter-segment transactions
The  accounting  policies  used  by  the  Group  in  reporting  segments  internally  are  the  same  as  those  used  in 
preparing the annual report. 
Geographical areas
Revenue from external sources, mainly derived from interest, and non-current assets by geographical location is 
detailed below.

cash equivalents represent fair value.
Restricted  cash  balances  totalling  $15,225  (2015:  $47,987)  representing  term  deposits  securing  various 
performance guarantees have been disclosed under trade and other receivables (refer Note 9).

Other debtors consist of invoices for recovery of costs as per contract terms, GST and VAT receivables from the 
taxation  authorities  and  other  minor  amounts.    All  receivables  are  carried  at  amortised  cost  which 
approximates their fair value.
As announced on 9 October 2015, the Heads of Agreement (‘HoA’) for the acquisition of the Discovery Zone 
copper-iron  deposit  has  not  been  extended.  Since  the  exploitation  concession  application  had  not  been 
granted by 8 October 2015 (being two years from the initial payment), the initial A$1 million payment made by 
Avalon was refundable by Hannans Ltd (‘Hannans’), and a Refund Notice was issued.
The 90 day period for Hannans to make the refund payment expired on 7 January 2016. Hannans did not pay 
that amount or any other amount after receiving that Notice.
Avalon has filed proceedings in the WA Supreme Court seeking to recover all sums due under the HoA.
Hannans  have  filed  a  defence  and  counterclaim  in  the  sum  of  A$9  million.  Hannans  has  also  applied  for 
summary judgment.
Avalon will pursue its claim and vigorously defend the counterclaim.
No allowance has been made for impairment of any other receivables as it is highly probable that they will be 
recovered. All other receivables excluding deposits are non-interest bearing and balances are current.

The recovery of the Group’s interest in exploration assets is dependent upon:
• 
• 
•
the continuance of the Company’s rights to tenure of the areas of interest; 
the results of future exploration; and 
the  recoupment  of  costs  through  successful  development  and  exploitation  of  the  areas  of  interest,  or 
alternatively, by their sale.
The accumulated costs incurred on Discovery Zone have either been transferred to other debtors as they are 
refundable from Hannans, or have been written off, in addition to the accumulated costs incurred on other 
tenements that have been relinquished.

Note 14.  Contributed equity (continued)
(c)  Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the 
Company in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held.  On a show of hands 
every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is entitled to one vote, and 
upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote.
(d)
Employee and Director’s Option Plan / Performance Right’s Plan
Information relating to the Employee share option plan and performance right’s plan, including details of 
instruments issued, exercised and lapsed during the financial year are set out in Note 19.
(e)  Options/Performance Rights
At  the  end  of  the  2016  financial  year  there  were  17,604,000  performance  rights/options  over  ordinary 
shares on issue (see Note 19).
(f)
Capital management
The  objective  is  to  ensure  the  entity  continues  as  a  going  concern  as  well  as  to  maintain  an  optimal 
structure to reduce the cost of capital. Avalon is a junior exploration company and it is dependent from 
time to time on its ability to raise capital from the issue of new shares and its ability to realise value from its 
exploration and evaluation assets.  The Board is responsible for capital management.  This involves the use 
of cash flow forecasts to determine future capital requirements. Capital management is undertaken to 
ensure a secure, cost-effective and flexible supply of funds is available to meet the Group’s operating and 
capital expenditure requirements.  The Company does not have any debt facilities and is not subject to 
any external capital requirements.  Surplus funds are invested in a cash management account and are 
available as required.  Financial liabilities of the Group at balance date are trade and other payables. 
Trade and other payables are unsecured and usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
The  ability  to  raise  equity  in  the  future  to  fund  the  Group’s  operations,  investigations  and  exploration 
activities is a risk that could influence the activities of the Company.  The Group has historically raised 
sufficient capital to fund its operations, however, it recognises that it is at risk of financial markets which 
dictate its ability to fund operations beyond exhaustion of the current cash funds.

Note 17.   Contingent liabilities
In February 2016, Innovation Australia found that the Company’s R&D activities for the years ended 30 June 
2013 and 30 June 2014 were deemed to not be core or supporting activities under the Industry Research and 
Development Act 1986 (“the Act”). The Company requested a review of this decision under Division 5 of the 
Act in March 2016, and hosted representatives of Innovation Australia to further discuss Avalon’s R&D activities.
As at the date of this report the final results of this review are yet to be received from Innovation Australia, and 
the Company is still of the opinion that the activities undertaken are valid R&D activities as per the Act. This 
event results in the Company recognising a contingent liability for the repayment of R&D claims received of 
$2,765,114 (net of fees).
Avalon has filed proceedings in the WA Supreme Court seeking to recover all sums due under the Heads of 
Agreement with Hannans Limited. Hannans have filed a defence and counterclaim in the sum of A$9 million. 
Hannans has also applied for summary judgment. Refer to Note 9 for further details.
Avalon will pursue its claim and vigorously defend the counterclaim.
The Company is not aware of any other material contingent liabilities at 30 June 2016 not otherwise disclosed in 
the Financial Statements.

Exploration  tenement  fees  are  required  to  keep  licenses  in  good  standing.    The  Group  is  committed  to  this 
expenditure on the current tenements.  In order to maintain current rights to tenure of its mineral tenement leases, 
the  Group  will  be  required  to  pay  exploration  tenement  fees  to  Bergsstaten  (Swedish  Mines  Inspectorate)  in 
addition to prove reasonable exploration activities have been undertaken.  These obligations may be varied 
from time to time, or subject to approval, and are expected to be fulfilled in the normal course of operations of 
the Group.
New Tenements
During the financial year the Company entered into agreements to secure interests over known lithium properties 
in  Finland  and  Sweden.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Heads  of  Agreement  with  Nortec  Minerals  Corp  and  their 
subsidiary Tammela Minerals Oy, Avalon (via its 80% owned subsidiary Scandian Metals Pty Ltd) may earn an 80% 
interest in the Tammela tenements by funding exploration in two stages.
To earn a 51% interest Avalon must spend EUR500,000 over a two year period (Stage One). Following the Stage 
One earn-in, Avalon may elect to earn a further 29% by paying Nortec EUR200,000 in either cash or Avalon shares 
and by spending a further EUR1,000,000 within a further two years.

The  fair  values  of  the  options  and  performance  rights  have  been  determined  by  an  external  party  using  a 
Trinomial  Lattice  model  for  options  which  defines  the  conditions  under  which  employees  are  expected  to 
exercise their options after vesting in terms of the share price reaching a specified multiple of the exercise price, 
and a Monte Carlo simulation for performance rights.
Share price volatility has a powerful influence on the estimation of the fair value of an option and performance 
right, much of the value of which is derived from its potential appreciation. The more volatile the share price, the 
more valuable the option. Volatility for the fair value of the options has been determined by the external party 
performing the valuation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Directors of Avalon Minerals Limited
Report on the Financial Report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Avalon Minerals Limited, which comprises the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the 
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the 
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from 
time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. In Note 1(b), the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 
Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s 
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which 
has been given to the directors of Avalon Minerals Limited, would be in the same terms if given to the 
directors as at the time of this auditor’s report.

Opinion
In our opinion:
(a)  the financial report of Avalon Minerals Limited is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,
including:
(i)  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016
and of its performance for the year ended on that date; and
(ii)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001; and
(b)  the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as disclosed in
Note 1(b).
Emphasis of matter
Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1(a) in the financial report, which indicates 
that the ability of the consolidated entity to continue as a going concern is principally dependent upon 
the future successful raising of necessary funding through equity, successful exploration and 
subsequent exploitation of the consolidated entity’s tenements, and a successful appeal to the 
Innovation Australia decision in relation to the Company’s 2012/13 and 2013/14 R&D claims. These 
conditions, along with other matters as set out in Note 1(a), indicate the existence of a material 
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be unable to realise its assets and discharge 
its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Report on the Remuneration Report
We have audited the Remuneration Report included on pages 43 to 51 of the directors’ report for the 
year ended 30 June 2016. The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and 
presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 
2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit 
conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Avalon Minerals Limited for the year ended 30 June 2016 
complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.
