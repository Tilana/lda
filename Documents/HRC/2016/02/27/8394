<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 15/5, the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to submit a report on the obligation of States to investigate serious 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in accordance with their 
international legal commitments in terms of identifying victims of such violations, 
including through the use of forensic genetics, which a view to considering further the 
possibility of drafting a manual that may serve as a guide for the most effective application 
of forensic genetics, including, where appropriate, the voluntary creation and operation of 
genetic banks, with the proper safeguards. The present report is submitted pursuant to this 
request. It sets out the international and regional laws in respect of the obligation of States 
to investigate gross violations of human rights law and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. It then draws on the contributions received from States in response to a 
note verbale transmitted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR),1 as well as those received from the Argentine Forensic Anthropology 
Team (EAAF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International 
Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), to present State law and practice regarding the use 
of forensic genetics in the context of the obligation to investigate, and some developments 
pertaining to the creation of a manual for the application of forensic genetics and the 
creation and operation of genetics banks.  
</p>
<p>2. This is the second report prepared by OHCHR regarding issues pertaining to 
forensic genetics and human rights.2 The report considered by the Human Rights Council at 
its fifteenth session concluded, inter alia, that the use of forensic experts and, in particular, 
the use of forensic genetics and the voluntary creation of genetic databanks have a crucial 
role to play in identifying victims of gross violations of human rights law and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law (A/HRC/15/26, paras. 63 and 64).  
</p>
<p><b> II. Obligation to investigate gross violations of human rights law 
and serious violations of international humanitarian law  
</b></p>
<p>3. Article 2, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
requires States parties to ensure to all individuals within their territories and subject to their 
jurisdiction the rights recognized in the Covenant. In general comment No. 31, the Human 
Rights Committee noted that, in accordance with this provision, States parties must refrain 
from violating the rights recognized by the Covenant, and take positive steps to ensure that 
they are promoted and protected.3 In that regard, States parties must adopt laws and other 
measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights.4     
</p>
<p>  
 1 Responses were received from the Governments of Argentina, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
</p>
<p>Canada, Colombia, Finland, Guatemala, Japan, Madagascar, Norway, Paraguay, Slovakia, Switzerland 
and Ukraine. 
</p>
<p> 2 For the relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, see in particular resolutions 9/11 (18 September 
2008), 10/26 (27 March 2009) and 15/5 (29 September 2010). 
</p>
<p> 3 Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31, paras. 5-7. Other international human rights 
conventions also require States to provide effective protection of rights, see Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 2(c). 
</p>
<p> 4 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 2, para. 2; also Human Rights Committee, 
general comment No. 31, paras. 13 and 14. </p>


<p>4. Furthermore, the right to an effective remedy as established by article 2, paragraph 
3, of the Covenant has been interpreted to include the obligation to investigate.5 The 
Human Rights Committee noted with regard to article 2, paragraph 3, that &#8220;administrative 
mechanisms are particularly required to give effect to the general obligation to investigate 
allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly and effectively through impartial bodies. A 
failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of itself give rise 
to a separate breach of the Covenant.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>5. In its jurisprudence, the Human Rights Committee has repeatedly evoked the 
obligation of States parties to the Covenant to investigate violations of human rights. In 
particular, they must investigate violations recognized as criminal and bring to justice those 
who are responsible.7 It has stated that this obligation arises notably in respect of violations 
recognized as criminal under either domestic or international law, such as torture and 
similar cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (art. 7),8 summary and arbitrary killing (art. 
6) and enforced disappearances (arts. 7 and 9, and frequently, art. 6).9 In this regard, failure 
to properly investigate alleged human rights violations has led the Human Rights 
Committee to find violations of articles 6,10 7,11 and 9,12 read in conjunction with article 2, 
paragraph 3, of the Covenant.  
</p>
<p>6. The obligation to investigate is also provided for in other international human rights 
instruments. According to article 3 of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, States parties shall take appropriate measures to 
investigate acts constituting enforced disappearance, and bring those responsible to 
justice.13 The Convention contains detailed provisions pertaining to the exercise of this 
obligation. For example, article 12 requires States parties to promptly and impartially 
examine and, where necessary, undertake a thorough and impartial investigation of any 
complaint or allegation of enforced disappearance where a formal complaint has been made 
or where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has been subjected to 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Other international human rights conventions also provide for the right to an effective remedy; see 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 8; International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, art. 6.

complaints of maltreatment prohibited by article 7 must be investigated promptly and impartially by 
competent authorities so as to make the remedy effective.

 13 See also art. 11, which incorporates the general principle of <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i> (to extradite or 
</p>
<p>prosecute), and art. 24, which provides for the victim&#8217;s right to know, and places an obligation on 
State parties to take appropriate measures in this regard; Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, General assembly resolution 47/133, arts. 3, 9, 13; E/CN.4/1996/38. </p>


<p>enforced disappearance.14 Article 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment also expressly obliges States parties to 
investigate all allegations of torture, in stipulating that they ensure that their competent 
authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable 
ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its 
jurisdiction.15  
</p>
<p>7. With regard to serious violations of international humanitarian law, article 1 of the 
four Geneva Conventions of 1949 requires the High Contracting Parties to respect and 
ensure respect for the Geneva Conventions in all circumstances. Furthermore, the Geneva 
Conventions all contain a provision obliging the High Contracting Parties to search for 
persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave 
breaches, and to bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts.16 
Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions (1977) extends the same obligation to the 
acts defined in article 85 thereof. Article IV of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide requires that persons charged with genocide be tried 
by a competent tribunal. These provisions are understood to include the obligations to both 
investigate and prosecute violations of international humanitarian law,17 and illustrate the 
close link between both obligations.18 Furthermore, in its study on customary international 
humanitarian law, the ICRC found that there is sufficient practice to establish the obligation 
on States to investigate war crimes, other than those that qualify as grave breaches, 
including those allegedly committed in non-international armed conflicts.19 
</p>
<p>8. The obligation on States to investigate gross violations of human rights law and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law has also been reinforced by the General 
Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on 
the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International 
Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law define the 
scope of the obligation to respect, ensure respect for and implement international human 
rights and international humanitarian law as including the duty to investigate violations

report, but is found in the principle <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>, as well as provisions of the treaties and 
conventions mentioned herein. 
</p>
<p> 19 ICRC, Customary IHL Database, rule 158, available at http://www.icrc.org/customary-
ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule158#Fn2. There are also provisions for the obligation to search for missing 
persons in Third Geneva Convention, art. 122; Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 136; First Geneva 
Convention, arts. 16 and 17; Second Geneva Convention, art. 19 referring to the information bureaux 
established in accordance with art. 122 of the Third Geneva Convention. See also Additional Protocol 
I, arts. 32, 33; ICRC, Customary IHL Database, rule 117, available at  
http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule117, which states that each party to 
international or non-international armed conflict must take all feasible measures to account for 
persons reported as missing as a result of the armed conflict and must provide their family members 
with any information it has on their fate.   </p>


<p>effectively, promptly, thoroughly and impartially and, where appropriate, take action 
against those allegedly responsible in accordance with domestic and international law.20 
</p>
<p>9. According to the Updated Set of principles for the protection and promotion of 
human rights through action to combat impunity, impunity arises, inter alia, from a failure 
by States to meet their obligations to investigate violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law.21 Principle 19 provides for States to undertake prompt, 
thorough, independent and impartial investigations of such violations.22 
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, the preamble to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
affirms the responsibility of all States to ensure justice for the most serious crimes of 
concern to the international community, whether committed on their territory or against 
their nationals, stating that their effective prosecution must be ensured by measures at the 
national level and through international cooperation. It recalls that it is the duty of every 
State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. In 
this regard, article 17 of the Rome Statute, providing for the principle of complementarity, 
further reinforces the primary duty of States to investigate and prosecute international 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>11. Regional human rights instruments, including the American Convention on Human 
Rights (American Convention), the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention), and the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (African Charter)23 provide for the obligation of States to 
investigate violations of human rights law. The obligation has also been repeatedly 
reaffirmed in the jurisprudence of the regional human rights bodies.  
</p>
<p>12. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights found, in the <i>Vel&#225;squez Rodr&#237;guez </i>case, 
that the obligation under article 1.1 of the American Convention to ensure the full 
enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized by the Convention creates a positive legal 
duty on States to, inter alia, &#8220;use all means at its disposal to carry out a serious investigation 
of violations committed within its jurisdiction.&#8221;24 The Court has also held that the legal 
duty exists as a procedural requirement of substantive rights contained in the American 
Convention, such as the right to life and the right to humane treatment.25 
</p>
<p>13. The European Court of Human Rights found, in the case of <i>Aksoy v. Turkey,</i> that the 
requirement for States to ensure an &#8220;effective remedy,&#8221; as provided for in article 13 of the 
European Convention, entails a &#8220;thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to 
the identification and punishment of those responsible [for the human rights violation], and 
</p>
<p>  
 20 General Assembly resolution 60/147, para. 3(b); see also para. 4, which provides as follows: &#8220;States 
</p>
<p>have the duty to investigate and, if there is sufficient evidence, the duty to submit to prosecution the 
person allegedly responsible for the violations and, if found guilty, the duty to punish him or her.&#8221;

Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons , arts. 1 and 3.

<p> 24 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, case of <i>Vel&#225;squez Rodr&#237;guez</i>, judgment of July 29 1988, 
paras. 174-177. The Court has affirmed the findings in this case in multiple instances, including in the 
case of <i>God&#237;nez-Cruz v. Honduras</i>, judgment of January 20 1989, paras. 184-188; case of <i>Gonz&#225;lez et 
al. v. Mexico</i>, judgment of November 16 2009, paras. 245-247, 287-291. 
</p>
<p> 25 See for example, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, case of <i>Gonz&#225;lez et al. v. Mexico</i>, para. 
292; case of <i>Kawas-Fern&#225;ndez v. Honduras</i>, judgment of April 3 2009, paras. 75-77, 100-102, 107, 
139; case of <i>Cantoral-Huaman&#237; and Garc&#237;a-Santa Cruz v. Peru</i>, judgment of July 10 2007, paras. 
100-102, 124, 140; case of the<i> Pueblo Bello Massacre v. Colombia</i>, judgment of January 31 2006, 
paras. 120, 142-143, 145, 148.  </p>


<p>including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure&#8221;.26 
Furthermore, the Court has repeatedly recognized that the obligation to investigate exists as 
a result of the general duty of States, under article 1 of the Convention, to &#8220;secure&#8221; the 
rights and freedoms contained in the Convention, read in conjunction with the substantive 
right in question.27 In relation to articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention, the Court has 
also held that the procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation under these 
articles has evolved into a separate autonomous duty.28 
</p>
<p>14. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights considers that it is the duty 
of States to investigate violations as part of their general obligations under article 1 of the 
African Charter, which requires them to undertake to adopt legislative or other measures to 
give effect to the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined therein. In fact, in a decision 
concerning Zimbabwe, the Commission cited with approval the Inter-American Court&#8217;s 
finding in the <i>Vel&#225;squez Rodr&#237;guez </i>case that the State must, inter alia, &#8220;take reasonable 
steps to prevent human rights violations and use the means at its disposal to carry out a 
serious investigation of violations committed within its jurisdiction&#8221; and held that it 
represented an authoritative interpretation of an international standard on State duty. The 
Commission considered that the opinion of the Inter-American Court could also be applied, 
by extension, to article 1 of the African Charter.29 Furthermore, the Commission found that 
the established standard of due diligence in the <i>Vel&#225;squez Rodriguez </i>case provided a way to 
measure whether a State has acted with sufficient effort and political will to fulfil its human 
rights obligations. Under this obligation, States must prevent, investigate and punish acts 
which impair any of the rights recognized under international human rights law.30

<p>15. In conclusion, international and regional instruments and jurisprudence establish the 
duty of States to investigate gross violations of human rights law and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law. In addition to being inextricably associated with the 
obligation to prosecute, the obligation to investigate is also linked to the right to the truth, 
which includes the right to know about the circumstances of, and the reasons for, gross 
human rights violations, the progress and results of the investigation carried out into the 
violations, the identity of the perpetrators and, in cases of enforced disappearances, the fate 
and whereabouts of the victims.31 
</p>
<p><b> III. Practice of States pertaining to the use of forensic genetics in 
the context of the obligation to investigate 
</b></p>
<p>16. This section brings together information contained in the contributions of States in 
response to a note verbale transmitted by OHCHR. It presents State law and practice 
pertaining to the use of forensic genetics in investigations of gross violations of human 
rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including through the 
creation of genetic databanks, as well as the role of this field of science in other contexts, 
such as criminal justice systems. In addition to State contributions, it also includes related 
information provided by the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Commission on 
Missing Persons (ICMP), which have particular experience and expertise in the use of 
forensic genetics to address gross violations of human rights law and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government of Argentina provided a comprehensive account of the law 
pertaining to the duty of States to investigate gross violations of human rights law and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law, including in the context of the right to 
the truth. In particular, it noted existing international standards and jurisprudence pertaining 
to investigations and related legal proceedings, such as the requirement to carry out an 
investigation, basic procedures to be followed in conducting the investigation, access to 
information about victims&#8217; remains, recording of information about the remains, and  
custody and treatment of the remains.32 It further noted that the Inter-American Court has 
ordered States to establish databases containing the personal information of missing 
persons, including DNA and tissue samples, for the purpose of locating a disappeared 
person, and has placed a duty on States to protect at all times the personal information 
contained in these databases.33

<p>18. Argentina referred to two primary instances where the use of forensic genetics 
contributes to the fulfilment of the obligation on the part of States to investigate violations, 
namely identification of victims, in cases where the victims have been killed or have 
disappeared, and restitution of the identity of victims. Argentina further indicated that as the 
sponsor of the Human Rights Council resolutions on forensic genetics and human rights, it

<p> 31 E/CN.4/2006/91, paras. 42, 45, 56-57 and 59; Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, General comment on the right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances, 
para. 1; also paras. 3-5. 
</p>
<p> 32 In this regard, Argentina cited the United Nations Manual on the effective prevention and 
investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions (E/ST/CSDHA/.12) (1991), and case 
of <i>Gonz&#225;lez et al. v. Mexico, </i>supra note 28<i>,</i> paras. 295, 300-301, 305, 310, 315-316, 318, 331-332. 
</p>
<p> 33 See for example, case of <i>Gonz&#225;lez et al. v. Mexico</i>, paras. 511-512; also General Assembly resolution 
61/155, paras. 5 and 6; 2010 OHCHR report, para. 63. </p>


<p>had constituted a working group composed, among others, of geneticists, forensic 
anthropologists and experts in bioethics, with the support and technical assistance of the 
ICRC. The working group developed a draft manual for the application of forensic genetics 
and the creation and management of genetic databases in the context of investigations of 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. In this context, Argentina 
organized a meeting with forensic genetics experts within the framework of the second 
Latin American Congress on Human Genetics, held in Costa Rica in May 2011, at which 
the opinions of the participants were sought on the relevance, usefulness and quality of the 
draft manual. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government of Bahrain stated that there had not been any cases of unidentified 
dead reported during the recent incidents in Bahrain, and that all the bodies had been 
identified and returned to the families. As such, no genetic analysis was required, although 
Bahrain does have a facility to carry out genetic identification and analysis. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina noted that the Code of Criminal 
Procedure provides the legal framework for conducting DNA analysis. The Clinical Centre 
of the University of Sarajevo has been conducting forensic genetics analyses in respect of 
serious crimes since mid-1999, primarily on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor. In 
addition, the Institute for Forensic Medicine at the University of Sarajevo uses DNA 
analysis to identify victims of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. The 
experience of the Institute indicates that the taking of DNA samples, their transportation to 
the place of analysis, the reporting of results, and access to genetic databases must be 
regulated. Furthermore, the Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology has been 
trying to help the Government to establish a genetic database. This Institute expressed the 
view that human rights must be taken into account when creating a genetic database, 
primarily those rights relevant to the entering of DNA profiles into the database and the 
preservation of biological traces. In this regard, it noted that there is a database for the 
identification of the victims of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that the data 
stored therein should not be used in criminal forensic analysis. Finally, the Missing Persons 
Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed support for the development of a manual for 
the effective application of forensic genetics. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government of Canada noted that there is no legislation in Canada enabling the 
use of DNA analysis for the identification of missing persons. However, the Forensic 
Science and Identification Services, a unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), 
provides assistance in the identification of missing persons following conflicts and 
disasters, which typically involves the use of DNA analysis and fingerprinting, as well as 
other RCMP forensic science and investigative expertise. The RCMP was informed by the 
Department of Justice that there are no legal impediments to it providing such assistance, 
although legislation prevents the use of Canada&#8217;s National DNA Data Bank (NDDB) and 
cross-referencing of its indices (Convicted Offender Index and Crime Scene Index) for 
humanitarian or missing person identification purposes. The statutory use of DNA 
information contained in the NDDB is for criminal investigation, and DNA profiles and 
genetic information must be removed if it is discovered that they are from a victim. Canada 
noted that it had one of the strongest provisions &#8220;in legislation and intent&#8221; for the protection 
of security and personal information, particularly regarding the use of DNA information 
and the principles and processes of its retention.  
</p>
<p>22. With regard to the development of a manual on the application of forensic genetics, 
Canada noted that several manuals regarding mass disaster victim identification already 
existed, and that a new manual on the application of forensic genetics would essentially 
contain the same information. However, it suggested that a clear legal definition of serious 
human rights violations, such as enforced disappearances, and how this is integrated with 
other United Nations programmes relating to the exploitation of persons and transborder </p>


<p>smuggling would be beneficial. Furthermore, Canada referred to the G8 Lyon Roma DNA 
Search Request Working Group, which was tasked with identifying barriers for forensic 
DNA information exchange and developing a more effective sharing process. In addition, 
Canada is currently chairing Justice Rapid Response, an intergovernmental entity that is 
able to rapidly deploy to active duty criminal justice experts, many of whom are forensic 
scientists, and which offers a training programme for forensic scientists.   
</p>
<p>23. The Government of Colombia explained that, in 2009, the National Council on 
Economic and Social Policy approved a document on the consolidation of mechanisms for 
the search and identification of disappeared persons in Colombia, and the return of victims&#8217; 
remains to their families, which provides for short-, medium- and long-term interventions 
to be taken by the State. Obstacles hindering the determination of the fate of disappeared 
persons and clarification of cases of disappeared persons will be addressed through these 
interventions. In 2010, legislation to create a centralized genetic databank for genetic 
profiles obtained from the remains of disappeared persons and biological reference samples 
obtained from families of disappeared persons came into force. Biological reference 
samples must be provided voluntarily by the family member and on the basis of informed 
consent. Any genetic material obtained must be managed in accordance with international 
standards. An inter-institutional working group, established through the work of the 
Commission for the Search for Disappeared Persons, has developed a proposal for the 
implementation of this legislation. 
</p>
<p>24. Furthermore, Colombia referred to the work of the National Institute of Legal, 
Medical and Forensic Science, which investigates deaths relating to gross violations of 
human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including 
through exhumations and identification of victims. It also noted the Plan for Research on 
the Crime of Forced Disappearance (March 2011), developed by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
the Commission for the Search for Disappeared Persons, the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime, OHCHR and the British Embassy in Colombia. The Plan contains 
international best practice and is intended as a guide that will improve criminal 
investigations of enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government of Finland noted that it has been at the forefront of developing the 
application of forensic genetics to the identification of victims in post-conflict situations, 
and it continues to support the objectives of Human Rights Council resolution 15/5. In 
Finland, the Act on Inquest into the Cause of Death (459/1973) and the Act on the Medical 
Use of Human Organs and Tissues (101/2001) pertain to the use of forensic genetics. In 
accordance with this legislation, tissue samples are collected when establishing cause of 
death and are stored by forensic doctors working with the National Institute for Health and 
Welfare and departments of forensic science in universities. A bill on the establishment of 
genetic databanks is before Parliament. If approved, genetic databanks will be established 
for medical research purposes. As such, they will not be used for identifying victims. 
However, the bill also proposes amendments to the Act on the Medical Use of Human 
Organs and Tissues to allow for the use of collected samples for identification purposes in 
situations of, for example, major natural disasters.  
</p>
<p>26. The Government of Guatemala noted that one of the recommendations of the 
Commission for Historical Clarification (CEH) in its 1999 report, &#8220;Memory of Silence,&#8221; 
was the development of a policy for exhumations of the remains of victims of the armed 
conflict, particularly from clandestine and hidden cemeteries, noting that exhumation is an 
act of justice and reparation, and an important step towards reconciliation. It described 
various entities that have been created to implement the recommendations of CEH and the 
peace agreements, namely the National Compensation Programme (PNR), National 
Institute of Forensic Science (INACIF), and the unit for special cases from the armed 
conflict in the Public Ministry. INACIF was created in 2006 to carry out forensic research </p>


<p>and expert forensic analysis in accordance with international standards. In 2010, INACIF 
entered into an agreement with the Peace Secretariat and PNR to identify the victims of 
forced disappearances. It has created a genetic databank and has exclusive use of the 
information contained in the databank. These initiatives respond to the order of the Inter-
American Court in the<i> Molina-Theissen v. Guatemala </i>case, in which the State was ordered 
to find and deliver to the next of kin the mortal remains of the victim, and to adopt 
legislative, administrative and other measures as may be necessary to establish a genetic 
information system. 
</p>
<p>27. Guatemala further detailed initiatives undertaken by government entities, including 
with civil society, regarding investigations of violations of human rights, the use of forensic 
analysis, as well as the work of the World Congress on Psychosocial Work in Exhumation 
Processes, Forced Disappearance, Justice and Truth, held in Bogota in 2010. The current 
situation of exhumation processes worldwide was analysed at the congress and a document 
was produced that includes best practices for forensic genetics concerning, inter alia, 
conservation and security of remains, timely identification of victims, compliance with 
international protocols and recommendations, custodial chains and protection of evidence, 
and international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government of Japan noted that, in accordance with its international human 
rights commitments, it has used forensic genetics to identify victims of human rights 
violations, in particular in the context of the abduction issue between Japan and the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Japan expressed the view that Japanese nationals 
abducted by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea were victims of enforced 
disappearance and human rights violations, and the use of forensic genetics has played an 
important role in identifying them. Furthermore, forensic genetics can support and enhance 
efforts by all relevant stakeholders to identify similar victims, thereby further enabling them 
to execute their international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in this regard. 
Japan described the cases of three abductees in which it used forensic analysis to determine 
the identity of remains provided by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In two of 
the cases, it found that the remains also contained DNA belonging to another person, while 
in the third case, the analysis positively identified the victim of the abduction. 
</p>
<p>29. The Government of the Republic of Madagascar noted that the Ministry of Public 
Health does not have the means to perform forensic DNA analysis. In the rare cases that 
such expertise has been required, it has been carried out externally. 
</p>
<p>30. The Government of Norway explained that regarding the use of genetics and cross-
border investigations, the National Authority for Prosecution of Organized and Other 
Serious Crime has overall responsibility for handling organized, high-tech and international 
crime cases. The Prosecution Instructions Act 1995 governs the national DNA register, 
including when and how information in it can be used and how long the genetic material 
can be stored. This register is located at the National Bureau of Crime Investigation and 
comprises the Identity Register (DNA profiles from persons convicted of certain crimes), 
the Investigation Register (DNA profiles from persons who are suspected, with just cause, 
of any act punishable by custodial sentence), and the Tracing Register (DNA profiles from 
unknown persons where there is reason to believe that the person was involved in a crime). 
</p>
<p>31. Norway also noted that it is bound by the European Union (EU) Data Protection 
Directive of 1995, the rules of which have been incorporated in the Norwegian Personal 
Data Act of 2000. Currently, the definition of &#8220;personal data&#8221; in the Directive does not 
include DNA material, nor is the processing of personal data in the areas of police and 
judicial cooperation covered by the Directive. However, in November 2010, the EU 
published a strategy aimed at strengthening its data protection rules, which includes 
revising the rules in these areas to ensure that personal data is protected. Under the revision, 
data retained for law enforcement purposes should be covered by a new legislative </p>


<p>framework. The EU is also reviewing the provisions on &#8220;sensitive data&#8221; and intends to 
examine whether genetic data should be included in this category.  
</p>
<p>32. The Government of Paraguay described a series of initiatives relating to the 
exhumation and identification of disappeared persons and those killed extrajudicially in 
Paraguay during the period 1954-1989. In particular, the work of the Office of the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s General Directorate of Truth, Justice and Reparation (DGVJR) was detailed, 
including that undertaken in conjunction with EAAF. DGVJR was mandated to, inter alia, 
search for disappeared persons and victims of politically motivated extrajudicial killings 
between 1954 and 1989, in partnership with other State institutions, and to establish a 
genetic database for this task. In this regard, DGVJR entered into agreements with the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of the Interior, with the support of EAAF, 
with the aim of obtaining the genetic profiles of the Paraguayan population so as to 
facilitate identification of the remains of disappeared persons, and to support the search, 
exhumation and identification of victims of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial 
killings. Three full genetic profiles were obtained from human remains found in a common 
grave in July and December 2009, setting an important precedent in Paraguay for the 
identification of disappeared persons. Paraguay also described a number of cases of 
enforced disappearance and torture brought to the attention of the Public Prosecutor, in 
which forensic genetics have played a role in determining the identity of the victims.  
</p>
<p>33. Furthermore, Paraguay provided information regarding DGVJR participation in the 
Mercosur Permanent Commission of Memory, Truth and Justice. DGVJR is to incorporate 
all resolutions adopted by the Permanent Commission. In one resolution, the Permanent 
Commission called on States to use forensic genetics in conformity with international 
standards to contribute to the identification of human remains of the victims of gross human 
rights violations and those who were separated from their families. It has also called for the 
creation, in the context of the Human Rights Council, of a new non-binding international 
instrument on the right to the truth that will advance the systemization of the content and 
scope of the right, as well as the development of good practices to ensure its effective 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>34. In Slovakia, the DNA Analysis Act of 2002 establishes the conditions for the use of 
DNA analysis for the identification of persons and the competence required to perform such 
analysis. Under this Act, DNA analysis may only be performed by the Ministry of Interior 
or another legal or natural person authorized to perform expert activities. Furthermore, a 
national DNA database, maintained and administered by the police, was established under 
the Act. The database contains DNA profiles of samples taken in the context of criminal 
proceedings and from biological parents, children and other relatives in connection with the 
search for missing persons. Data from the database is destroyed once the case is 
discontinued or the person is acquitted or the proceedings against a convicted person are 
found inadmissible. With regard to tracing persons, Slovakia stated that any natural person 
may apply to the police and the Slovak Red Cross for assistance. Any personal data 
provided to the Red Cross is protected by legislation. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government of Switzerland noted that it has only been required to practise 
forensic medicine in the context of massive human rights violations on rare occasions, such 
as the Katyn massacre. However, it regularly sends experts to participate in the Justice 
Rapid Response, where forensic anthropological techniques are always used. Regarding 
relevant bilateral activities, Switzerland explained that it consults institutions that follow 
best practices, for example, EAAF, the Forensic Anthropology Foundation of Guatemala, 
and ICMP, thereby promoting exchanges on best practices and assisting governments in the 
adoption of norms and standards so that exhumations, particularly in cases involving 
missing persons or the existence of mass graves, can be conducted according to established 
standards. Regarding multilateral activities, Switzerland is cooperating with Argentina to </p>


<p>strengthen the principles on combating impunity, particularly those relating to the right to 
know and the responsibility of States to guarantee access to information. In this regard, it 
recommends that the proposed document maintain a link between forensic anthropology 
practices and each of the pillars of the principles for combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>36. The Government of Ukraine provided detailed information on various State 
activities undertaken to continue to further the fulfilment of its international human rights 
obligations and the implementation of mechanisms for monitoring conduct by State 
agencies, with particular reference to activities in the criminal justice area.  
</p>
<p>37. EAAF stated that in 1998 it had commenced building a genetic databank of relatives 
of disappeared people in Argentina. In 2007, it began collaboration with national 
institutions on the databank, and entered into an agreement with the Ministry of Health and 
the National Memory Archive of the National Secretary of Human Rights which created the 
Archive of blood samples from relatives of victims of forced disappearance between 1974 
and 1983, established standard operational procedures, including technical and bioethical 
guidelines, for the collection, shipment and storage of blood samples and traceability, and 
created a tripartite coordination commission for the  purpose of implementing the 
agreement.  
</p>
<p>38. EAAF noted that forensic genetics has a vital role to play in identifying the remains 
of victims of human rights violations or persons missing as a result of conflict. Creating 
genetic databanks is crucial to conducting large-scale identification projects. EAAF 
welcomed the initiative of the Government of Argentina in support of the use of forensic 
genetics for the identification of victims of human rights and international humanitarian law 
violations. However, it noted that in light of the &#8220;complexity, controversies and by-
products&#8221; that may arise in the establishment of genetics databanks, it strongly supports the 
holding of an international symposium to discuss best practices and the adoption of a 
protocol or guidelines for the establishment of such databanks. In this regard, EAAF 
provided a number of considerations for a symposium, which are fully reflected in the 2010 
OHCHR report. 
</p>
<p>39. Referring to the Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocol I, and the Convention on 
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the ICRC noted that the 
obligation to investigate crimes under international law is found in a number of treaties that 
apply to acts committed in both international and non-international armed conflicts. It also 
noted that international humanitarian law contains treaty and customary law provisions 
dealing with various aspects related to the dead, and that the obligation to identify the dead 
is an obligation of means, such that parties to a conflict must use their best efforts and all 
means at their disposal. Current practice suggests that exhumation combined with the 
application of forensic methods, including DNA testing, may be an appropriate method of 
identifying the dead after burial. In this regard, the ICRC continues to actively promote the 
development, dissemination and implementation of best practices in forensic sciences, 
including forensic genetics, applied to the identification of human remains. 34  
</p>
<p>40. The ICMP noted that States are not currently obliged under international law to use 
forensic genetics when investigating gross violations of human rights law and serious 
</p>
<p>  
 34 In this regard, ICRC noted the recommendations from the International Conference of Governmental 
</p>
<p>and Non-Governmental Experts on the Missing and Their Families (2003); see also ICRC, Missing 
people, DNA analysis and identification of human remains: A guide to best practice in armed 
conflicts and other situations of armed conflict (2009); Guiding principles/Model law on the missing, 
Principles for legislating the situation of persons missing as a result of armed conflict or internal 
violence: Measures to prevent persons from going missing and to protect the rights and interests of 
the missing and their families (2009). </p>


<p>violations of international humanitarian law. However, a report of the National Research 
Council entitled, &#8220;Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A path forward&#8221; 
(2009), which underlines that DNA analysis is the only forensic method capable of 
consistently linking evidence to specific individuals and with a high degree of certainty, 
would suggest that the obligation to investigate includes making use of forensic genetics 
where necessary. Regarding the development of a manual, ICMP reaffirms the position that 
it had expressed in its contribution to the 2010 OHCHR report, and which is reflected in 
that report. It further stated that forensic genetics stands as the most rigorously established 
scientific basis for victim identification. Accordingly, the international community should 
seek mechanisms by which this tool can be used to maximum benefit. Taking steps that 
would create an obligation on States to use forensic genetics to investigate violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law would be a desirable outcome. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The obligation to investigate gross violations of human rights law and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law is clearly established in international 
human rights and humanitarian law, and regional human rights instruments and 
jurisprudence. Linked to the duty to prosecute, it is also an aspect of the right to the 
truth.  
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>Forensic genetics, including the creation and operation of genetic databanks, 
plays a central role in the investigation of gross violations of human rights law and 
serious violations of humanitarian law, in the identification of victims, where the 
victim has been killed or has disappeared, and in the restitution of the identity of 
victims. As a tool, it becomes ever more relevant and important in light of the 
technological advances made in the field in recent years, enabling large-scale 
identification to take place.
