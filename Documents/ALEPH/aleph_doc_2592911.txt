Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of World Point Terminals, LP
(Dollars in thousands, except per unit amounts)
(Unaudited)
1)BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization
World Point Terminals, LP (the “Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership that was
formed on April 19, 2013 by World Point Terminals, Inc. (our “Parent”) and WPT GP, LLC
(the “General Partner”). The Partnership, through its wholly owned subsidiary Center
Point Terminal Company, LLC (“Center Point”), owns, operates, develops and acquires
liquid bulk storage terminals and related assets primarily for the storage of petroleum
based products, including light refined products, heavy refined products and crude oil.
We operate fee-based facilities located along the East Coast, Gulf Coast and Midwest
regions of the United States.
Basis of Presentation
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared
under the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“GAAP”) for interim financial statements. Accordingly, these financial statements
do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP and should be read along with the
Partnership’s 2015 audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
Partnership’s financial statements as of June 30, 2016, and for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited and have been prepared on the same basis
as the annual consolidated financial statements. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying financial
statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
In management’s opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals necessary for
the fair presentation of the results of operations for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015. Information for interim periods may not be indicative of the
Partnership’s operating results for the entire year.
2)EARNINGS PER UNIT AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
Earnings per unit applicable to limited partners (including subordinated unitholders) is
computed by dividing limited partners’ interest in net income, after deducting amounts
due pursuant to Incentive Distribution Rights (“IDRs”) by the weighted-average number of
outstanding common and subordinated units. Our net income is allocated to the limited
partners in accordance with their respective ownership interests, after giving effect to
priority income allocations, including incentive distributions, if any, to the holders of IDRs,
pursuant to our partnership agreement. Earnings in excess of distributions are allocated
to the limited partners based on their respective ownership interests. Payments made to
our unitholders are determined in relation to actual distributions declared and are not
based on the net income allocations used in the calculation of earnings per unit. The
weighted-average number of units outstanding was as follows:

   16,485,507
7
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of World Point Terminals, LP
(Dollars in thousands, except per unit amounts)
(Unaudited)
In addition to the common and subordinated units, we have also identified the IDRs as
participating securities and use the two-class method when calculating the earnings per
unit applicable to limited partners, which is based on the weighted-average number of
common and subordinated units outstanding during the period. Basic and diluted
earnings per unit applicable to limited partners are the same because we do not have any
potentially dilutive units outstanding.
The calculation of earnings per unit is as follows:

Cash Distributions
Our partnership agreement generally provides that we will make our distributions, if any,
each quarter in the following manner:
first, to all unitholders, pro rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.345  per unit for that
·
quarter (the “first target distribution”);
second, 85.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 15.0% to the holders of the IDRs, pro rata, until
·
each unitholder receives a total of $0.375 per unit for that quarter (the “second target
distribution”);
third, 75.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 25.0% to the holders of the IDRs, pro rata, until each
·
unitholder receives a total of $0.45 per unit for that quarter (the “third target distribution”); and
·thereafter, 50.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 50.0% to the holders of the IDRs, pro rata.
In each case, the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any
distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of
the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth above assume that
we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.

3)FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Partnership’s financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term investments, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities.
The Partnership has exposure to counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk,
and other price risk with its financial assets and liabilities. The Partnership’s risk
management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Partnership’s
financial performance and ultimately shareholder value. The Partnership manages its risks
and risk exposures through a combination of sound business practices, derivative
instruments and a system of internal controls.
Credit Risk — Credit risk arises from cash held with banks, credit exposure to customers
(including outstanding accounts receivable), and counterparty risk associated with certain
of the Partnership’s short-term investments.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances. Credit risk associated with cash is
minimized by ensuring that these financial assets are held at high quality financial
institutions.
9
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of World Point Terminals, LP
(Dollars in thousands, except per unit amounts)
(Unaudited)
Accounts receivable consists primarily of trade accounts receivable from storage related
revenues. The Partnership’s credit risk arises from the possibility that a counterparty
which owes the Partnership money is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts with the Partnership, which
would result in a financial loss for the Partnership. Credit risk associated with accounts
receivable is minimized by the business model and collection policies of the Partnership.
Most of the Partnership’s customers prepay their obligations at the beginning of each
month and/or the Partnership has custody of customer assets at its facilities. The assets
held by the Partnership belonging to its customers generally carry a market value well in
excess of the accounts receivable balances due. The Partnership conducts business with
a relatively few number of customers, including one affiliated customer that comprised
approximately 42% and 38% of the Partnership’s first six months 2016 and 2015 revenues,
respectively, and another customer that comprised approximately 11% of the
Partnership’s first six months 2016 and 2015 revenues, under both short-term and long-
term contracts. A large portion of the Partnership’s annual expenses are fixed and,
accordingly, the Partnership’s ability to meet its ongoing obligations is dependent upon
its ability to retain existing customers and/or attract new ones.
The carrying amounts of accounts receivable are reduced through the use of an
allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
consolidated statements of income. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by
specific customer balance analysis. When a receivable balance is considered
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance for accounts receivable. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously written off reduce expenses in the consolidated
statements of income. Historically trade credit losses have been minimal.
The Partnership has equity investments in marketable securities, including certain
preferred and trust preferred stocks and debt securities. The Partnership seeks to mitigate
risk of a financial loss by investing in what it considers to be high-quality instruments with
quality counterparties.
4)FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Partnership adopted the amendments to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for the consolidated financial
statements. The amendments require the use of a fair value hierarchy in order to classify
the fair value disclosures related to the Partnership’s financial assets and financial
liabilities that are recognized in the balance sheets at fair value.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1 — Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Values based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model based
valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3 — Values are generated from model based techniques that use significant
assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques could include use of
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. The
Partnership does not currently have any instruments with fair value determined using
Level 3 inputs.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized
in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement in its entirety.

For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, the total
fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held
without consideration of transaction costs. The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:
Cash Equivalents — The carrying value of cash equivalents represents fair value as it is
based on active market quotes available for these assets and is classified as Level 1.
Short-Term Investments— The short-term investments consist of investments in listed
exchange traded debt securities, preferred stocks and trust preferred securities. The
securities are valued using quoted prices from the various public markets. The securities
trade on public exchanges, both domestic and foreign, and can be accurately described
as active markets. The observable valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted prices that
represent active market trades and are classified as Level 1.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Liability – The long-term incentive plan liability is the estimated
value of unit appreciation rights granted to our employees, as calculated by the Black-
Scholes model. The liability is valued using significant assumptions that are observable in
the market including an expected risk-free rate, distribution yield, volatility rate, and life to
maturity. The liability is classified as Level 2.

On January 1, 2015, the Partnership acquired a terminal facility in Greensboro, North
Carolina which has a total shell capacity of 684,000 barrels for the storage of gasoline,
distillate, ethanol and jet fuel. The terminal is served by truck and connection to the
Colonial Pipeline. The Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with Apex Oil
Company, Inc. and one of its subsidiaries, whereby the Partnership issued 1,550,000
common units to Apex in exchange for the terminal. Based on the closing price of the
Partnership’s common units on December 31, 2014, the value of the units issued
represented approximately $31,186 in total consideration. The acquisition of the
Greensboro terminal qualifies as a business under the Business Combinations topic of
the ASC. The allocation of the contribution consideration to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction were recorded at their estimated
acquisition date fair values, while transaction costs associated with the acquisition were
expensed as incurred, other than $48 in closing costs which were recorded as property,
plant and equipment.
The Partnership has allocated the contribution consideration to the assets acquired as

On August 14, 2013, Center Point entered into a $200,000 senior secured revolving credit
facility with The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as administrative agent, and a
syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Facility”), which has an initial maturity date of August 14,
2018. The Credit Facility is available, subject to certain conditions, for working capital,
capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and general partnership purposes, including
distributions and unit repurchases. In addition, the Credit Facility includes a sublimit of up
to $20,000 for swing line loans and permits the Partnership to enter into a pari passu credit
facility for the provision of letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
$20,000 at any time. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting
increases in the commitments under the Credit Facility by an aggregate amount up to
$100,000. Substantially all of the Partnership’s assets are pledged as collateral under the
Credit Facility, and the Partnership and its other subsidiaries entered into guarantees of
payment on behalf of Center Point for amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Center Point incurred costs of $910 associated with the Credit Facility which will be
amortized over the five year term of the facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The terms of the Credit Facility contain certain
covenants and conditions including an interest coverage ratio and a total leverage ratio.
Center Point was in compliance with such covenants as of June 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. In addition to interest associated with the borrowings, Center Point is obligated
to pay a commitment fee calculated on the balance of the unused portion of the Credit
Facility. There have not been any borrowings on the credit facility. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, Center Point had future estimated minimum loan commitment fees of
$1,290 and $1,593, respectively. Center Point incurred commitment fees, which have been
recorded as interest expense, for the periods indicated as follows:

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The Partnership has recorded a liability for the estimated costs of removing its terminal
assets from those terminals located on leased land where the landowners have the right to
require the Partnership to remove the assets. The recorded liability was $677 and $658 at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which represents the present value of
the estimated costs of removal. The maximum undiscounted liability is estimated to be
$10,135. This amount was discounted utilizing the Partnership’s estimated, credit adjusted
risk-free rate and further adjusted by probability factors based on management’s
assessment of the likelihood of being required to demolish certain assets. Should the
landowners exercise their rights to require the Partnership to remove the terminal assets,
the cash outflows required to settle these obligations will occur on or around lease
expiration dates ranging from July 13, 2034 to February 1, 2061.

SEGMENT REPORTING
The Partnership derives revenues from operating its eighteen liquid bulk storage and
terminal facilities. The eighteen operating segments have been aggregated into one
reportable segment because the facilities have similar long-term economic characteristics,
products and types of customers.

CONTINGENCIES
The Partnership is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which it operates. Additionally, the Partnership has contingent liabilities
with respect to other lawsuits and other potential matters arising in the ordinary course of
business. In management’s opinion, the ultimate outcome of these contingencies will not
have a material impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the
Partnership. As a result, the Partnership has not accrued for any loss contingencies in
2016 and 2015.
18)
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
The Partnership has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) for providing long-term
incentives to our employees, directors and consultants who provide services to us.  The
plan is administered by the board of directors of our General Partner (the “Board of
Directors”).  The Board of Directors has authority to: (i) designate participants; (ii)
determine types of awards; (iii) determine number of units covered by the award; (iv)
determine terms and conditions of awards; (v) determine how and when awards might be
settled; and (vi) interpret and administer the plan and take other such actions as might be
necessary for the proper administration of the plan.  The LTIP provides for the issuance of
an aggregate of up to 3,000,000 Common Units to be granted either as options, restricted
units, phantom units, distribution equivalent rights, unit appreciation rights (“UARs”), unit
awards, profits interest units or other unit-based award granted under the plan.  As of
June 30, 2016, we have granted awards totaling 340,000 restricted units and 25,000 UARs.
The restricted units vest over three years subject to customary forfeiture provisions.
Restricted units are included in the number of common units outstanding as presented on
our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are entitled to cash
distributions, which are nonforfeitable, on the same basis as the Common Units. The
Partnership recorded non-cash compensation expense related to the restricted units as
follows:

The UARs vest over five years subject to customary forfeiture provisions, and are not
included in the number of common units outstanding as presented on our unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets or entitled to cash distributions. Non-cash
compensation expense related to the UARs has been estimated using the Black Scholes
model. Because the UARs may be settled in units or cash at the option of the participant,
they have been recorded utilizing the liability method. Non-cash compensation expense
relating to the UARs was $2 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and $1 for the six
months ended June 30, 2016. The exercise price of the UARs is the fair market value of a
unit on the grant date.
The following table summarizes awards granted pursuant to the LTIP through June 30,
2016. There were no forfeitures through June 30, 2016.

Overview of Business
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed to own, operate,
develop and acquire terminals and other assets relating to the storage of light refined
products, heavy refined products and crude oil. Our storage terminals are strategically
located in the East Coast, Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States and, as of
June 30, 2016, had a combined available storage capacity of 15.5 million barrels. On
January 1, 2015, we acquired a terminal in Greensboro, North Carolina (0.7 million barrels),
increasing our storage capacity 5%. On September 14, 2015, we acquired a terminal in
Salisbury, Maryland (0.2 million barrels), increasing our storage capacity an additional 1%.
Most of our terminal facilities are strategically located on major waterways, providing ship
or barge access for the movement of petroleum products, and have truck racks with
efficient loading logistics. Several of our terminal facilities also have rail or pipeline access.
The following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and
should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, as well as historical condensed consolidated financial statements and
notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.
Recent Developments
We have recently completed construction of two tanks totaling 178,000 barrels of capacity
at our North Little Rock terminal and expect to place the tanks in service during the third
quarter of 2016.
On September 14, 2015, we acquired a terminal in Salisbury, Maryland with a storage
capacity of 177,000 barrels for the storage of gasoline, ultra-low-sulfur-diesel, heating oil
and ethanol. The terminal was purchased for $1.0 million and is served by truck and barge.
Approximately 83% of the terminal capacity is under contract with Apex Oil Company, Inc.
(“Apex”) through at least September 30, 2018.
On January 1, 2015, we acquired a terminal in Greensboro, North Carolina with a storage
capacity of 684,000 barrels for the storage of gasoline, distillate, biodiesel and jet fuel. The
terminal is served by truck and the Colonial Pipeline. We entered into a contribution
agreement with Apex and one of its subsidiaries whereby we issued 1,550,000 common
units to Apex in exchange for the terminal. Based on the closing price of our common
units on December 31, 2014, the value of the units issued represented approximately $31.2
million in total consideration.
How We Generate Revenues
We operate in a single reportable segment consisting primarily of the fee-based storage
and terminaling services we perform under contracts with our customers. We generally do
not take title to the products we store or handle on behalf of our customers. For each of
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 84% and 83%,
respectively, of our revenue from storage services fees. Of our revenue for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 83% and 81%, respectively, consisted of
base storage services fees, which are fixed monthly fees paid at the beginning of each
month to reserve dedicated tanks or storage space and to compensate us for handling up
to a base amount of product volume at our terminals. Our customers are required to pay
these base storage services fees to us regardless of the actual storage capacity they use
or the volume of products that we receive. Our customers also pay us excess storage fees
for volumes handled in excess of the amount attributable to their base storage services
fees. The remainder of our revenues were generated from (1) ancillary fees for services
such as heating, mixing and blending products, transferring products between tanks, rail
car loading and dock operations and (2) fees for injecting additives, some of which are
mandated by federal, state and local regulations.
19
Refiners typically use our terminals because they prefer to subcontract terminaling and
storage services or their facilities do not have adequate storage capacity, dock
infrastructure or do not meet specialized handling requirements for a particular product.
We also provide storage services to distributors, marketers and traders that require
access to large, strategically located storage capacity in close proximity to demand
markets, export markets, transportation infrastructure and refineries. Our combination of
geographic location, efficient and well maintained storage assets and access to multiple
modes of transportation gives us the flexibility to meet the evolving demands of our
existing customers, as well as the demands of prospective customers seeking terminaling
and storage services throughout our areas of operation.
As of June 30, 2016, approximately 92% of our total available storage capacity was under
contract. During the five years ended December 31, 2015, more than 91% of our available
storage capacity has been under contract, on average. While many of our contracts
provide for a termination right after the expiration of the initial contract period, our long-
standing relationships with our customers, including major integrated oil companies, have
provided stable revenue. Our top ten customers including Apex, which represent
approximately 82% of our revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016, have used our
services for an average of more than ten years.
Factors That Impact Our Business
The revenues generated by our storage business are generally driven by our aggregate
storage capacity under contract, the commercial utilization of our terminal facilities in
relation to their capacity and the prices we receive for our services, which in turn are
driven by the demand for the products being shipped through or stored in our facilities.
Though substantially all of our terminal service agreements require a customer to pay for
tank capacity regardless of use, our revenues can be affected by (1) the length of the
underlying service contracts and pricing changes and shifts in the products handled
when the underlying storage capacity is recontracted, (2) fluctuations in product volumes
to the extent revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored
or transported, (3) changes in demand for additive services, (4) inflation adjustments in
storage services contracts and (5) changes in the demand for ancillary services such as
product heating, mixing or blending, transferring our customers’ products between our
tanks, rail car loading and dock operations.
We believe key factors that influence our business are (1) the long-term demand for and
supply of refined products and crude oil, (2) the indirect impact that changes in refined
product and crude oil pricing has on terminal and storage demand and supply, (3) the
needs of our customers together with the competitiveness of our service offerings with
respect to location, price, reliability and flexibility and (4) our ability and the ability of our
competitors to capitalize on growth opportunities and changing market dynamics.
Supply and Demand for Refined Products and Crude Oil
Our results of operations are dependent upon the volumes of refined products and crude
oil we have contracted to handle and store and, to a lesser extent, on the actual volumes
of refined products and crude oil we handle and store for our customers. An important
factor in such contracting is the amount of production and demand for refined products
and crude oil. The production of and demand for refined products and crude oil are driven
by many factors, including the price for crude oil and general economic conditions. To the
extent practicable and economically feasible, we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of
reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with minimum payments based on
available capacity and with multi-year terms. However, an increase or decrease in the
demand for refined products and crude oil in the areas served by our terminals will have a
corresponding effect on (1) the volumes we actually terminal and store and (2) the
volumes we contract to terminal and store if we are not able to extend or replace our
existing customer contracts.
20
Refined Product and Crude Oil Prices
Because we generally do not own the refined products or crude oil that we handle and do
not engage in the trading of refined products or crude oil, we have minimal direct
exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. In addition, extended
periods of depressed or elevated refined product and crude oil prices can lead producers
to increase or decrease production of refined products and crude oil, which can impact
supply and demand dynamics.
Effective January 1, 2016 we entered into a profit sharing agreement with Apex at one of
our terminals. In addition to the base storage services fees, we receive a percentage of the
profit Apex realizes on the stored product. The profit sharing revenues received under this
arrangement could be affected by changes in the commodity price as well as other market
factors such as demand for the commodity. Profit sharing revenues of $0.2 million were
generated during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
If the future prices of refined products and crude oil are substantially higher than the then-
current prices, also called market contango, our customers’ demand for excess storage
generally increases. If the future prices of refined products and crude oil are lower than the
then-current prices, also called market backwardation, our customers’ demand for excess
storage capacity generally decreases. We seek to mitigate the impact of near-term
commodity market price dynamics by generally entering into long-term agreements with
our customers that have significant base storage services fee components. However, the
market has experienced long periods of contango and backwardation that can impact the
demand for and supply of refined product and crude oil terminaling and storage services.
Customers and Competition
We provide storage and terminaling services for a broad mix of customers, including
major integrated oil companies, marketers, distributors and chemical and petrochemical
companies. In general, the mix of services we provide to our customers varies depending
on market conditions, expectations for future market conditions and the overall
competitiveness of our service offerings. The terminaling and storage markets in which we
operate are very competitive, and we compete with operators of other terminaling facilities
on the basis of rates, terms of service, types of service, supply and market access and
flexibility and reliability of service. In addition, we also compete with major integrated oil
companies, many of whom are also our customers, that own terminals. We continuously
monitor the competitive environment, the evolving needs of our customers, current and
forecasted market conditions and the competitiveness of our service offerings in order to
maintain the proper balance between optimizing near-term earnings and cash flow and
positioning the business for sustainable long-term growth. Because of the significant
investments we have made in maintaining high quality assets and because terminaling
and storage are our core business, we believe that we can be more flexible and responsive
to the needs of our customers than many of our competitors.
Organic Growth Opportunities
Regional refined products and crude oil supply and demand dynamics shift over time,
which can lead to rapid and significant increases in demand for terminaling and storage
services. At such times, we believe the terminaling companies that have positioned
themselves for organic growth will be at a competitive advantage in capitalizing on the
shifting market dynamics. Where feasible, we have designed the infrastructure at our
terminals to facilitate future expansion, which we expect to both reduce our overall capital
costs per additional barrel of storage capacity and shorten the duration and enhance the
predictability of development timelines. Some of the specific infrastructure investments we
have made that will facilitate incremental expansion include dock capacity capable of
handling various products and easily expandable piping and manifolds to handle
additional storage capacity. Our Galveston terminal has over fifty acres of available land
that will allow us to greatly increase our storage capacity should market conditions
warrant. Accordingly, we believe that we are well positioned to grow organically in
response to changing market conditions.
21
We have recently completed construction of two tanks totaling 178,000 barrels of capacity
at our North Little Rock terminal and expect to place the tanks in service during the third
quarter of 2016.
Factors Impacting the Comparability of Our Financial Results
Our future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of
operations for the following reasons:
In June 2014 when we acquired the Chickasaw terminal all of the acquired tankage was not
·
available for use. Some additional tankage has been made available for service and additional
tankage is expected to be made available in future reporting periods.
In June 2014 when we acquired the Blakeley Island terminal all of the acquired tankage was not
available for use. The Blakeley Island terminal had no customers when it was acquired and had
·
no revenue in 2014. Beginning in January 2015, a portion of the tankage was placed under
contract and additional tankage is expected to be available for service in future reporting
periods.
We acquired the Salisbury terminal September 14, 2015, and did not have any customers until
·
October 1, 2015, and therefore we received no revenue from that facility prior to the fourth quarter
of 2015.
Overview of Our Results of Operations
Our management uses a variety of financial measurements to analyze our performance,
including the following key measures:
revenues derived from (i) storage services fees, including excess storage services fees, (ii)
·
ancillary services and (iii) additive services; and
·our operating and selling, general and administrative expenses.
We do not utilize depreciation and amortization expense in our key measures because we
focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long
useful lives. In our period to period comparisons of our revenues and expenses set forth
below, we analyze the following revenue and expense components:
Revenues
We characterize our revenues into three different types, as follows:
Storage Services Fees. Our customers pay base storage services fees, which are fixed
monthly fees paid at the beginning of each month to reserve storage capacity in our tanks
and to compensate us for receiving up to a base product volume on their behalf. Our
customers are required to pay these base storage services fees to us regardless of the
actual storage capacity they use or the amount of product that we receive. Our customers
also pay us additional fees when we handle product volume on their behalf that exceeds
the volume contemplated in their monthly base storage services fee.
Ancillary Services Fees. We charge ancillary services fees to our customers for providing
services such as (i) heating, mixing and blending our customers’ products that are stored
in our tanks, (ii) transferring our customers’ products between our tanks, (iii) at our Granite
City terminal, adding polymer to liquid asphalt and (iv) rail car loading and dock
operations. The revenues we generate from ancillary services fees vary based upon the
activity levels of our customers.
Additive Services Fees. We generate revenue from fees for injecting generic gasoline,
proprietary gasoline, lubricity, red dye and cold flow additives to our customers’ products.
Certain of these additives are mandated by applicable federal, state and local regulations
for all light refined products, and other additives, such as cold flow additive, are required
to meet customer specifications. The revenues we generate from additive services fees
vary based upon the activity levels of our customers.
22
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses, utility costs,
insurance premiums, repairs and maintenance expenses, environmental compliance and
property taxes. A large portion of these operating expenses are fixed, but can fluctuate
from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and
the timing of these expenses. We seek to manage our maintenance expenses by
scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance
expenses and minimize their impact on our cash flow.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs not directly attributable to the
operations of our facilities and include costs such as professional services, compensation
of non-operating personnel and expenses of the overall administration of the Partnership.
We incur additional personnel and related costs and incremental external general and
administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly traded partnership, including costs
associated with SEC reporting requirements, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and
distribution, registered independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, Sarbanes-
Oxley Act compliance, stock exchange listing, registrar and transfer agent fees,
incremental director and officer liability insurance and director compensation.

months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Base storage services fees. Base storage services fees for the three months ended June 30,
2016 increased $1.1 million, or 6%, from the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily as a
result of the addition of new customers at the Blakeley Island terminal and Galveston terminals,
·
increased terminaling activity at the Glenmont terminal and the addition of the Salisbury terminal
in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by reduced base storage fees at the St. Louis
terminal.
Excess storage services fees. Excess storage services fees for the three months ended June 30,
·
2016 decreased slightly compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Ancillary and Additive Services Fees. Ancillary and additive services for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased $0.4 million, or 10%, compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2015, primarily as a result of reduced polymer processing activity at the Granite
City terminal caused by a disruption in the Keystone Pipeline.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016
increased $0.3 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. This
increase was primarily attributable to a (i) $0.4 million increase in other expense due to
environmental compliance costs incurred at the Newark terminal, and (ii) $0.1 million
increase in property taxes and utilities, offset by a (i) $0.1 million decrease in insurance
expense and (ii) $0.1 million decrease in repairs and maintenance primarily due to periodic
tank cleaning and repairs completed in the second quarter of 2015.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative
expenses, including reimbursements to affiliates, for the three months ended June 30,
2016 increased $0.1 million, or 4%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015
primarily as a result of higher audit and tax preparation fees in 2016.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $0.3 million, or 5%, compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to terminal assets that
became fully depreciated in December of 2015 and January of 2016 at the Baltimore and
Newark terminals.
25
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased
slightly compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 decreased slightly compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. This
decrease was attributable to lower amounts of short-term investments held during the
second quarter of 2016.
Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other—Net. Gain (loss) on investments for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 increased $0.3 million compared to the three months ended

increased $0.9 million, or 2%, from the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily as a result of
additional tanks at the Blakeley Island terminal that were placed under contract during the first
·
half of 2016, increased terminaling activity at the Glenmont terminal, and the addition of the
Salisbury terminal in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by reduced base storage fees at
the St. Louis terminal.
Excess storage services fees. Excess storage services fees decreased $0.2 million, or 40%, for
·
the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Ancillary and Additive Services Fees. Ancillary and additive services for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased $0.6 million, or 7%, compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015, primarily as a result of reduced polymer processing activity at the Granite
City terminal caused by a disruption in the Keystone Pipeline, reduced barge loading fees
at the Newark terminal and reduced heating fees at the Pine Bluff terminal.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016
decreased $0.2 million, or 1%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. This
decrease was primarily attributable to a (i) $0.4 million decrease in repairs and
maintenance primarily due to periodic tank cleaning and repairs completed in the first half
of 2015, (ii) $0.1 million decrease in labor costs, and (iii) $0.2 million decrease in insurance
expense, offset by a (i) $0.3 million increase in other expense due to $0.4 million in

Average Daily Terminal Throughput. Average daily terminal throughput for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased 36 mbbls or, 19%, compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015 primarily as a result of decreased throughput at the Galveston, Newark and
Weirton terminals.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure. In addition to the GAAP results provided in this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q, we provide a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA. A
reconciliation from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-
GAAP measurement is provided below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss)
before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense
and equity based compensation expense as further adjusted to remove gain or loss on
investments and on the disposition of assets and non-recurring items.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and
external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts,
investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:
our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream
·
energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;
·the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;
·our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment
·
in various opportunities.
27
We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to
investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP
measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash
provided by operating activities. Our non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA
should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by
operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool
because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income. You should not consider
Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported
under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in
our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures for each of the periods indicated:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, fund capital
expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, and to service our debt. Our
sources of liquidity include cash generated by our operations, borrowings under our
revolving credit facility and issuances of equity and debt securities. We believe that cash
generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital
requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements.
Revolving Credit Facility
On August 14, 2013, we entered into a $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
The revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital and to finance acquisitions
and other capital expenditures. Our obligations under the revolving credit facility are
secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets. Borrowings under our
revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
LIBOR and the applicable margin are defined in our revolving credit facility. The unused
portion of the revolving credit facility is subject to an annual commitment fee.
The revolving credit facility contains covenants and conditions that, among other things,
limit our ability to make cash distributions, incur indebtedness, create liens, make
investments and enter into a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. We are also
subject to certain financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio and an
interest coverage ratio, and customary events of default under the revolving credit facility.
We were in compliance with such covenants as of June 30, 2016.
Capital Expenditures
The terminaling and storage business is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment
for the maintenance of existing assets and the acquisition or development of new systems
and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:
maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the
construction or development of new capital assets or the replacement, improvement or
·
expansion of existing capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating capacity or
operating income; or
expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital
·
improvements that we expect will increase our operating capacity or operating income over the
long term.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our capital expenditures were $11.5 million. Our
capital spending program is focused on expanding our existing terminals where sufficient
demand exists for our services and maintaining our facilities. Capital expenditure plans
are generally evaluated based on regulatory requirements, return on investment and
estimated incremental cash flow. We develop annual capital spending plans based on
historical trends for maintenance capital, plus identified projects for expansion,
technology and revenue-generating capital. In addition to the annually recurring capital
expenditures, potential acquisition opportunities are evaluated based on their anticipated
return on invested capital, accretive impact to operating results, and strategic fit.

Of the $7.7 million of expansion capital expenditures during the first six months of 2016,
$1.0 million was used to modify terminal assets in order to have the ability to accept
additional products from customers and $6.7 million was used to add additional capacity
at our terminals, including $4.7 million used to bring additional tanks into service at the
Chickasaw and Blakeley Island terminals and $2.0 million used to construct additional
tanks at the North Little Rock terminal. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016 all capital
expenditures were funded from operations.
We anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will continue to be funded primarily
with cash from operations. We expect that we will utilize external financing sources,
including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and
equity securities, in addition to cash from operations to fund some of our future expansion
capital expenditures.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Net cash flows from operating activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 increased $2.6 million, compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a (i) $1.7 million increase in cash
generated from working capital, (ii) $1.2 million increase in the change in long-term
deferred revenue and other liabilities and (iii) $0.9 million increase in net income, offset by
a (i) $0.6 million decrease in depreciation, (ii) $0.2 million decrease in income from joint
venture, (iii) $0.2 million decrease in the loss on investments, and (iv) $0.2 million decrease
in the change in prepaid insurance
Cash Flows From Investing Activities. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 increased $0.9 million, or 10%, compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a (i) $1.8 million decrease
in cash proceeds for the sale of short-term investments and (ii) $0.4 million increase in
capital expenditures, offset by a (i) $1.2 million distribution received from the CENEX joint
venture and (ii) decrease in purchase of short-term investments of $0.1 million.
30
Cash Flows From Financing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities consist of
distributions paid to our unitholders totaling $20.9 million for each of the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.
Contractual Obligations

Future Trends and Outlook
We expect that certain trends and economic or industry-wide factors will continue to affect
our business, both in the short and long term. We have based our expectations described
below on assumptions made by us and on the basis of information currently available to
us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretation of available
information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected
results. Please read “Risk Factors” for additional information about the risks associated
with purchasing our common units.
Existing Base Storage Contracts
Some of our terminal services agreements currently in effect are operating in the
automatic renewal phase of the contract that begins upon the expiration of the primary
contract term. While a significant portion of our tankage may only be subject to a one year
commitment, historically these customers have continued to renew or expand their
business. Our top ten customers have used our services for an average of more than ten
years.
During 2015, some customers did not renew their contracts. As a result, approximately
580,000 barrels of tankage was placed under “spot” (month-to-month) contracts at the
Galveston terminal. During the second quarter of 2016, some spot contracts were
terminated. As of June 30, 2016, 203,000 barrels of tankage remain under spot contracts,
and 421,000 barrels of tankage are unutilized at the Galveston terminal. There is no
certainty that we will be able to keep the remaining tanks under contract throughout 2016.
In addition, there is no certainty that contracts expiring in 2016 will be extended or that any
extension or recontracting will result in the same level of revenue to the Partnership.
The following table details the base storage services fees expected to be generated over
the next five years ending December 31, 2020 based on remaining contract terms at June
30, 2016 excluding any consumer price index adjustments.

Supply of Storage Capacity
An important factor in determining the value of storage capacity and therefore the rates we
are able to charge for new contracts or contract renewals is whether a surplus or shortfall
of storage capacity exists relative to the overall demand for storage services in a given
market area. We monitor local developments around each of our facilities closely. We
believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the refined product and crude oil
terminaling and storage business. These barriers include significant costs and execution
risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, shortage of personnel with the requisite
expertise and the finite number of sites that are suitable for development.
Entry of Competitors into the Markets in Which We Operate
The competitiveness of our service offerings could be significantly impacted by the entry
of new competitors into the markets in which our terminals operate. We believe that
significant barriers to entry exist in the refined products and crude oil terminaling and
storage business, particularly for marine terminals. These barriers include significant
costs and execution risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, such as
environmental permitting, financing challenges, shortage of personnel with the requisite
expertise and the finite number of sites with comparable connectivity suitable for
development. Despite these barriers, there has been significant new construction of
residual fuel storage facilities along the Gulf Coast in recent years, which we believe may
account for the need to utilize spot storage at the Galveston terminal.
Economic Conditions
The condition of credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity. In the recent past, world
financial markets experienced a severe reduction in the availability of credit. Although we
were not substantially impacted by this situation because of the long-term nature of our
customer contracts, possible negative impacts in the future could include a decrease in
the availability of credit. In addition, we could experience a tightening of trade credit from
our suppliers and our customers’ businesses may be affected by their access to credit.
Growth Opportunities
We expect to expand the storage capacity at our current terminal facilities over the near
and medium term. In addition, we will selectively pursue strategic asset acquisitions from
Apex and third parties that complement our existing asset base or provide attractive
potential returns in new areas within our geographic footprint. Our long-term strategy
includes operating fee-based, qualifying income producing infrastructure assets
throughout North America. Recent evidence of this strategy includes the January 2015
acquisition of the Greensboro, North Carolina terminal from Apex, as well as the
September 2015 acquisition of the Salisbury, Maryland terminal and the construction of
additional tanks at our North Little Rock terminal. We believe that we will be well positioned
to acquire assets from third parties should such opportunities arise, and identifying and
executing acquisitions will be a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make
acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and it is
possible that any acquisitions we do make will reduce, rather than increase, our cash
available for distribution per unit.
Demand for Refined Products and Crude Oil
In the near-term, we expect demand for refined products and crude oil to remain stable.
Even if demand for refined products and crude oil decreases sharply, however, our
historical experience during recessionary periods has been that our results of operations
are not materially impacted in the near term. We believe this is because of several factors,
including: (i) we mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts
with minimum payments based on available capacity and with multi-year terms; as more of
our contracts convert to annual agreements, some of that mitigation is lost, and (ii) sharp
decreases in demand for refined products and crude oil generally increase the short and
medium-term need for storage of those products, as customers search for buyers at
appropriate prices. While the recent decline in the prices of crude oil and petroleum prices
may affect demand for those products and related demand for storage capacity, we
believe it is too soon to draw any conclusions as to what effect there may be on our
business.
32
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any off-
balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
As of June 30, 2016, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting
policies and estimates disclosed in the Partnership’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We
do not take title to the crude oil, refined petroleum products and other products we handle
and store, and therefore, we do not have direct exposure to risks associated with
fluctuating commodity prices. In addition, our terminal services agreements with our
storage customers are generally indexed to inflation and may contain fuel surcharge
provisions designed to substantially mitigate our exposure to increases in fuel prices and
the cost of other supplies used in our business.
At June 30, 2016, we did not have any borrowing under our revolving credit facility, which
carries a variable rate. We may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure
to variable interest rates in the future, but we do not currently have in place any risk
management contracts.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of management of our general partner,
including the general partner’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an
evaluation of the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)), was conducted as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on this evaluation, management of our general partner concluded that the
Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the period covered by this report
were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal
quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
PART II
OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
We are not a party to, nor is any of our property subject to, any material pending legal
proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. However,
from time to time, we may be a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations, and
proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual
property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and
employment matters, which we expect to be handled and defended in the ordinary course
of business. While we are unable to predict the outcome of any matters currently pending,
we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a
material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash
flows.
