<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, undertook a mission to Timor-Leste from 
13 to 18 November 2011. The Special Rapporteur collected first-hand information on the 
human rights situation of people living in extreme poverty and on policies relating to 
poverty alleviation, development and social protection, and the allocation of resources by 
the Government of Timor-Leste to these areas. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur recognizes the difficult task faced by Timor-Leste in 
tackling the challenge of State-building and development only 10 years after independence. 
However, despite rapid economic growth in recent years, the situation of the poorest 
segments of society remains grave and there are significant and growing inequalities in 
terms of income, opportunities and access to services. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
that the country&#8217;s human rights obligations to progressively realize the economic, social 
and cultural rights of all its population, without discrimination, apply even during times of 
development and post-crisis rebuilding.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, 
Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, documents the findings of her mission to Timor-Leste 
from 13 to 18 November 2011. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur collected first-hand 
information that provided an overview of the human rights situation of people living in 
extreme poverty in order to conduct a human rights-based analysis of key public policies 
relating to poverty alleviation, development and social protection.   
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with various Government authorities, including then 
President Jos&#233; Manuel Ramos-Horta; Deputy Prime Minister Jos&#233; Luis Guterres; the 
Minister of Economy and Development Jo&#227;o Gon&#231;alves; the Minister of Justice, L&#250;cia 
Maria Brand&#227;o Freitas Lobato; the Minister of Social Solidarity, Maria Domingas Alves; 
and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alberto Carlos. She also met with the 
following: the National Investigation Department (Vulnerable Persons Unit) of the Pol&#237;cia 
Nacional de Timor-Leste, the National Commissioner for the Rights of the Child, the 
Secretary of State for the Promotion of Equality, the Secretary of State for Social 
Assistance, the Director of Social Reinsertion, the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice, 
the Anti-Corruption Commissioner and the President of the Petroleum Fund Consultative 
Council.   
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also held meetings with representatives of international 
organizations, donor agencies and civil society organizations. She visited and met with 
residents in the communities of Suai Loro, Galitas, Raimea and Zumalai in Covalima 
District; Maliana in Bobonaro District; and Dili.   
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to the Government of Timor-Leste 
for its full cooperation during her mission. She also extends her thanks to the United 
Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), in particular to the Human Rights 
and Transitional Justice Section, and to the United Nations Country Team. Lastly, she 
expresses her gratitude to all those who met with her, in particular those who shared their 
personal experiences of living in extreme poverty in Timor-Leste.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p>5. More than a decade ago Timor-Leste emerged from a period of conflict and 
instability, and embarked upon a process of State-building and development. After restoring 
the country&#8217;s independence in May 2002, the Government of Timor-Leste faced the task of 
consolidating peace and security, and rebuilding their country: restoring the physical 
infrastructure, 70 per cent of which had been destroyed; constructing the political and 
institutional architecture; and reconciling its people. Timor-Leste has dedicated significant 
efforts towards achieving these objectives, necessitating the investment of a large part of 
the country&#8217;s financial and human resources, which remain limited.  
</p>
<p>6. In recent years, Timor-Leste has experienced rapid economic growth, due primarily 
to the country&#8217;s considerable oil and gas reserves, and as a result has come to be 
</p>
<p>categorized as a lower middle-income country. Despite these advances, most Timorese 
people continue to experience poverty, deprivation and insecure employment. Ten years of 
rapid population growth, a devastating political and security crisis in 2006, which had a 
serious impact on economic and social conditions, and recent global economic turmoil have 
restricted progress on achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and Timor-Leste </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>remains among the least developed economies in the region, ranking 147th out of 187 
countries in the United Nations Human Development Index.1 The intergenerational 
transmission of poverty continues; according to the World Bank&#8217;s 2009 projections, at least 
</p>
<p>41 per cent of the population live below the poverty line,2 roughly the same percentage as 
in 2001.3  
</p>
<p>7. The extent and depth of poverty in Timor-Leste is even more severe than the income 
poverty statistics suggest. According to the Multidimensional Poverty Index, which 
identifies multiple deprivations in households with respect to education, health and standard 
of living, 68 per cent of the population in Timor-Leste suffer from multiple deprivations, 
and an additional 18 per cent are vulnerable.4 Food insecurity affects up to 70 per cent of 
households during the &#8213;lean season&#8214; from December to February,5 exacerbating the poor 
nutritional status of women and, in particular, children, 58 per cent of whom suffer from 
chronic malnutrition.6 
</p>
<p>8. Access to adequate water and sanitation facilities remains poor, particularly in rural 
areas, where approximately 43 per cent of households do not have access to clean water and 
74 per cent of households do not have access to improved sanitation.7 While the 
Government reports that about two thirds of the population has access to drinking water,8 
the Special Rapporteur received information that poor water quality implies that only a very 
small percentage of Timorese have access to safe drinkable water, and many must walk 
considerable distances to obtain it. The lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities 
contributes to illnesses among children, including diarrhoea, one of the leading causes of 
death of children under 5 years old.9 
</p>
<p>9. Income inequality has risen significantly. Disaggregated data reveals that the 75 per 
cent of Timorese people who live in rural areas suffer disproportionately from poverty and 
disadvantage. The disparities between those who live in Dili, 71 per cent of whom fall 
within the highest wealth quintile in Timor-Leste, and those who live in rural areas, are 
stark: rural populations experience far higher rates of chronic income poverty and food 
insecurity, and far lower health and education outcomes. Insufficient infrastructure impedes 
travel, communication and access to information, and the concentration of decision-making

<p>processes in Dili severely impedes the delivery of basic services at the district, <i>suco</i> 
(village) and <i>aldeia</i> (sub-village) levels. The overwhelming majority of people living in 
rural areas suffer from underemployment and employment insecurity. Although the great 
majority of the rural population depends on subsistence agriculture, investment in the 
agriculture sector has been inadequate. Fiscal policies have failed to achieve a diversified 
economy, and growth in Timor-Leste depends heavily on the country&#8217;s finite petroleum 
reserves. This raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the country&#8217;s economic 
framework, which has been strongly criticized by some Timorese actors, including civil 
society organizations.10  
</p>
<p>10. Despite these challenges, the country has achieved some impressive gains over the 
past 10 years, making considerable progress in terms of stability and security, and 
experiencing rapid economic growth. The Government of Timor-Leste is progressively 
increasing its capacity to provide its population with basic social services, such as primary 
health care and education. In the Strategic Development Plan 2011&#8211;2030, the Government 
reiterated its commitment to alleviating extreme poverty, building human capacity and 
making basic social services accessible to all Timorese. The country has successfully 
established the Petroleum Fund, and an accompanying legal framework for oil production, 
taxation and revenue management. 
</p>
<p>11. The challenge of constructing the country has, in many ways, been tackled with 
significant success by the State, which has demonstrated a strong commitment to 
democracy and determination to improve the lives and livelihoods of all Timorese. The 
Special Rapporteur acknowledges the well-intentioned steps taken by the Government to 
confront this daunting task. The obstacles that Timor-Leste has faced in striving for 
accelerated development while at the same time addressing social divisions in a post-
conflict context have been considerable, though not insurmountable. The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to congratulate Timor-Leste on its advances thus far, and calls on the 
Government to redouble its efforts to reduce poverty, achieve inclusive growth and 
development, and build sustainable industries and a strong economy that will benefit the 
poorest and most vulnerable in Timorese society. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Timor-Leste has shown commitment to the protection and promotion of human 
rights, as evidenced by steps taken to ratify most of the core international human rights 
instruments, to improve their domestic implementation, and to engage with various United 
Nations human rights mechanisms.11 The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s 
positive attitude towards ratification of additional human rights instruments, as recently 
expressed in the course of its examination under the universal periodic review 
(A/HRC/19/17, para. 77).  
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution of Timor-Leste (2002) guarantees a range of rights, including the 
rights to life (sect. 29), personal freedom, security and integrity (sect. 30), freedom of 
speech and information (sect. 40), freedom of conscience, religion and worship (sect. 45), 
the equality of all citizens before the law (sect. 16, para. 1), and non-discrimination (sect. 
16, para. 2). It protects and promotes economic, social and cultural rights and duties

<p>(Part II, Title III), including the rights to work (sect. 50), social security and assistance 
(sect. 56), health (sect. 57), housing (sect. 58), education and culture (sect. 59) and a 
healthy, humane and ecologically balanced environment (sect. 61). The Constitution 
reaffirms access to courts for all (sect. 26) and the independence of the judiciary (sect. 119). 
</p>
<p>14. Timor-Leste has also made progress in adopting key legislation protecting human 
rights (including the Law against Domestic Violence, the Law on the Protection of 
Witnesses, the Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Code) and has established several 
mechanisms to monitor human rights violations, namely the Office of the Provedor for 
Human Rights and Justice, the National Commission for the Rights of the Child and the 
Anti-Corruption Commission. The Special Rapporteur particularly welcomes the 
establishment of child protection officers in each district, an important step towards 
improving the protection and promotion of the human rights of children and youth. 
However, she is concerned that the capacity and effectiveness of some these institutions are 
limited by a lack of funds and enforcement powers.  
</p>
<p>15. While the Special Rapporteur commends Timor-Leste on adopting a strong 
legislative framework for the protection and promotion of human rights, she notes that this 
is not sufficient to ensure the full enjoyment of rights, in particular by the poorest segments 
of society. The Special Rapporteur was told that most Timorese, including officials of the 
State, are often unaware of what laws and legal measures exist and are available to them. 
She found that those responsible for implementing laws and programmes are hampered by 
insufficient resources, inadequate capacity, a lack of accountability, and the concentration 
of decision-making processes in Dili.  
</p>
<p>16. There also seems to be a lack of understanding of the indivisibility and 
interdependency of all human rights. In order to ensure that human rights, including 
economic, social and cultural rights, are enforceable and enjoyed by the poorest groups in 
society, they must be at the heart of the design, implementation and evaluation of public 
policies. Meaningful and effective participatory mechanisms must be put in place, those 
responsible for implementing social policies must be fully accountable, and the principle of 
equality and non-discrimination must underpin all development policies.  
</p>
<p>17. The indivisibility of rights also means that ending impunity is an essential 
prerequisite to ensuring stability, peace and sustainability. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the State to take measures to ensure that post-conflict justice and reconciliation 
is prioritized and that a legal framework is put in place to ensure that those responsible for 
serious crimes during the conflict are called to account for their deeds, and the victims of 
those crimes are able to access reparations (see A/HRC/19/58/Add.1). She also reminds the 
Government of Indonesia, the United Nations and the international community of the role 
they must play in ensuring that the perpetrators of crimes during the Indonesian occupation 
are brought to justice.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Achieving equitable and sustainable poverty alleviation: 
human rights-based growth and development 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that Timor-Leste is a young country still in the 
early stages of development. Nevertheless, the situation of poverty and deprivation in the 
country is severe, and economic growth and development have not translated into sustained 
improvements in living conditions or job creation for the great majority of Timorese 
people. Development has been uneven and inequitable, its benefits not reaching the poorest 
sectors of society, particularly rural populations. 
</p>
<p>19. The human rights framework imposes an obligation on States to ensure that they 
devote the maximum available resources to the progressive realization of economic, social </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>and cultural rights. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the 
prioritization of public expenditures in Timor-Leste. She notes that even as the State budget 
has increased in recent years, there has been a gradual decline in the percentage allocated to 
social services, including health and education services, as well as to agriculture.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the increases in allocation to these areas in the 
2012 budget, which occurred immediately following her visit. Nevertheless, while 53 per 
cent of the $1.67 billion budget is earmarked for physical infrastructure, only 7.1 per cent 
will be allocated to education, 3.3 per cent to health and about 1.5 per cent to agriculture.12 
Although she recognizes that physical infrastructure is important for ensuring the physical 
accessibility of social services, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to reassess 
the allocation of its resources, to ensure that social services are sufficiently financed to 
facilitate the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights for all Timorese 
in a sustainable manner. 
</p>
<p>21. The concept of progressive realization recognizes the challenges faced by small, 
developing countries such as Timor-Leste in meeting their obligations with respect to 
economic, social and cultural rights. Yet it also requires that core minimum obligations be 
met by the State to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. The obligation to achieve these 
minimum essential levels cannot be dispensed with even when resources are limited, or 
when a country is in the earliest stages of development.  
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, compliance with the maximum available resources requirement implies 
an obligation to ensure sufficient resources are generated. The Special Rapporteur received 
information that the management of the Petroleum Fund has been effected with efficiency 
and transparency.13 However, some concerns have been raised that the Government is 
consistently withdrawing more from the Fund than the estimated sustainable income level, 
and that projections from Government spending plans have Timor-Leste exhausting its 
petroleum resources by 2024, and the Petroleum Fund even sooner.14  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that its fiscal choices will have 
ramifications for its ability to ensure the realization of economic, social and cultural rights 
for the population. As the Government is aware, Timor-Leste cannot achieve sustainable 
and equitable development by relying solely on the revenue from its limited oil and gas 
resources. Inclusive poverty reduction and the creation of decent work necessitate measures 
to increase the capacity of the non-petroleum sectors of the economy, particularly 
agriculture, in order to ensure a diverse revenue stream with long-term stability. The 
Special Rapporteur also calls on the Government of Timor-Leste to assess whether its 
corporate taxation rates, among the lowest in the world, should be revised in order to 
expand the resources available to address poverty and reduce inequality.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. Development should be a &#8213;bottom up&#8214; process in which the population can 
meaningfully and effectively participate in the establishment of national priorities. 
Consultation alone is not enough; those who are affected by State policies and programmes 
must have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. To this end, the Special Rapporteur 
commends the consultation process led by the Prime Minister as part of the formulation of

<p>the Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, but emphasizes that further active measures 
must be taken to enable the meaningful participation of those living in remote rural areas. 
Policies should include mechanisms to ensure that all barriers to participation, including 
linguistic, economic or geographical obstacles, are overcome.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the recent Sensus Fo Fila Fali initiative to 
disseminate the 2010 Census results relevant to each of the 442 sucos. This constitutes a 
good example of how information can be disseminated at the local level in an accessible 
way, enabling communities and individuals to monitor and audit progress made by 
Government policies in their own communities.15   
</p>
<p>26. Importantly, the Government of Timor-Leste must also take steps to confront the 
growing urban-rural divide. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s 
commitment in principle to the decentralization process,16 and the recent scaling-up of the 
local development programme for the country&#8217;s 13 districts.17 The Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government to continue the process of decentralization by devolving appropriate 
decision-making powers to local authorities and ensuring that service delivery can be 
tailored to local needs and overseen by locally based officials.18 The Government should 
take the necessary steps to finalize and approve the subsidiary legislation for 
decentralization; ensure coherence between the subsidiary legislation and the national local 
government legislation; raise public awareness regarding the decentralization process; and 
enable and encourage participation in the decentralization reforms through broad civic 
education campaigns. The Special Rapporteur also calls on development partners and 
agencies to assist the Timor-Leste authorities in the process of capacity-building for its civil 
servants, particularly at the municipal level.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Groups particularly vulnerable to poverty 
</b></p>
<p>27. Although in Timor-Leste poverty is widespread, several groups are particularly 
vulnerable. In the following section, the Special Rapporteur will focus on the enjoyment of 
human rights by two of those groups&#8212;women, and children and youth. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women  
</b></p>
<p>28. Timorese women face pervasive structural discrimination and negative gender 
stereotypes, which dramatically impede their ability to participate in and benefit from 
education, employment, health services and political representation. A life of poverty and 
discrimination is the reality for many women in Timor-Leste, particularly women living in 
mountainous and highland areas, female heads of household, widows and older women.19 
Although Timor-Leste ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women in 2002, and has incorporated guarantees of gender equality 
and non-discrimination into its Constitution,20 men continue to be more likely to be

<p>educated than women at all educational levels except primary,21 and have higher rates of 
literacy.22 A total of 45 per cent of women aged 15 years and over have not had any 
education at all.23 As the Government recognizes, widespread female illiteracy is one of the 
primary obstacles to achieving substantive gender equality, combating domestic and 
gender-based violence, and reducing maternal mortality rates.  
</p>
<p>29. In its review of Timor-Leste in 2009, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women expressed concern at the prevalence of a patriarchal 
ideology in Timor-Leste, with firmly entrenched adverse stereotypes and cultural norms 
(CEDAW/C/TLS/CO/1, para. 27). It noted that domestic and gender-based violence is an 
acute problem facing the country, a conclusion also reached by the Special Rapporteur 
during her visit and consultations. Studies reveal that almost half of all Timorese women 
feel unsafe in their relationship with their partner,24 and 38 per cent have experienced 
physical violence which, three times out of four, is inflicted by a current husband or 
partner.25 Despite the prevalence of domestic violence, victims fear being stigmatized or 
further punished if they report it; less than a quarter of women who experience violence 
seek help (with women living in poverty the least likely to do so), and of these only one in 
20 turn to the police or non-governmental organizations for assistance, the rest turning to 
family, friends and neighbours.26 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur applauds the work of non-governmental organizations that 
are implementing initiatives to provide victims of domestic and gender-based violence with 
counselling, access to shelters, legal aid and court support,27 some in partnership with the 
Government. However, the important work of these organizations should not be seen as 
relieving the Government of its responsibility to provide such services. The response of the 
Government to domestic and gender-based violence has fallen short in many respects, and 
the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to increase resource allocation to initiatives 
that support victims of domestic and gender-based violence; encourage the relevant judicial 
and police officials to prioritize the prosecution of gender-related crimes; ensure such cases 
are dealt with efficiently; remove language barriers and other obstacles which prevent 
victims of gender-based crimes from accessing the formal justice system; and guarantee the 
protection of victims. The handling of domestic violence cases through customary or 
traditional justice mechanisms that do not comply with international human rights norms 
and standards should be actively combated. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that Timor-Leste has taken some important 
steps to combat this serious problem, including finally adopting the Law against Domestic 
Violence (2010), and designating domestic violence as a public crime in the 2009 Penal 
Code. However, the Special Rapporteur received information that these laws are not being 
widely implemented. She calls on the Government to put in place the appropriate measures 
to ensure that relevant officials are trained on the proper operation of the laws and that the 
public is informed of their existence and importance. Further efforts are also required to

</p>
<p><b> B. Children and youth  
</b></p>
<p>32. Owing to elevated mortality rates during the Indonesian occupation and high birth 
rates since independence,29 the population of Timor-Leste is overwhelmingly young; 40 per 
cent of Timorese are under 14 years of age,30 and in rural areas more than half of the 
population is under 19 years old. As such, the future prosperity of Timor-Leste will depend 
largely on the investments it makes to develop the human capital of its youth. Today, 
children in poor households make up more than half of all people living in poverty in 
Timor-Leste.31  
</p>
<p>33. As children depend on their families, communities and the State for their survival 
and development, they are affected by the lack of or inadequate access to basic services. In 
particular, malnutrition poses a threat to the survival and development of more than half of 
Timorese children under 5. Chronic malnutrition is the result not only of a lack of food, but 
also of insufficient access to health-care facilities, poor feeding practices and lack of access 
to safe drinking water.  
</p>
<p>34. Half of all children in Timor-Leste are not formally registered,32 a factor which 
seriously undermines the State&#8217;s ability to design and implement policies that respond to 
</p>
<p>the needs of children. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue to 
pursue innovative efforts to raise awareness of the issue, such as the 2011 National Birth 
Registration Campaign. It must also improve the legislative and institutional framework for 
birth registration in compliance with its obligation under the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child (art. 7). 
</p>
<p>35. Efforts must also be made to improve the situation of Timorese youth, among whom 
widespread poverty, low literacy levels, limited life opportunities and high rates of 
unemployment are still translating into disenfranchisement and frustration.33 Much of the 
social unrest leading to the 2006 crisis was driven by youth who, lacking the means to 
constructively channel their dissatisfaction, turned to violence. 
</p>
<p>36. The primary vehicle to address these frustrations, reduce child poverty and improve 
the status of children and youth in Timor-Leste is education. Education is both a human 
right in itself, and an indispensable means of realizing other human rights.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur commends Timor-Leste for guaranteeing the right of every 
citizen to education in its Constitution and making provision for free and compulsory 
education from grades one to nine. The National Education Policy 2007&#8211;2012 recognizes 
the importance of preschool education, and the Government has committed to ensuring that 
at least half of Timorese children are enrolled in and receiving quality preschool education

<p><b>A/HRC/20/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>by 2015.34 In 2008, the adoption of the Organic Law of the Ministry of Education, the 
Education Policy and the Basic Law on Education provided the foundation for the 
establishment of a new education system.  
</p>
<p>38. Notwithstanding this solid legal framework, and despite the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to improving education enrolment and outcomes, Timor-Leste faces serious 
challenges in developing its education system and improving the availability and quality of 
education for all of its children. Although recent years have seen an increase in net 
enrolment rates in primary education, less than 50 per cent of children who reach school 
age enrol in grade one35 and less than a third of those children remain enrolled until grade 
nine.36  
</p>
<p>39. In addition, most recent assessments indicate that education outcomes across Timor-
Leste are very poor,37 schools are crowded and in poor physical condition, and the 
necessary supplies and materials are unavailable.38 A lack of adequate sanitation facilities 
discourages girls&#8217; attendance,39 and limited means of transportation to schools affects both 
boys and girls living in remote rural areas.40 Children with disabilities, who represent 1 in 
every 100 primary school students, face even greater obstacles in having their educational 
needs addressed.41  
</p>
<p>40. Children&#8217;s education is also hampered by their poor health and nutritional status.42 In 
the poorest and most vulnerable households, the opportunity cost of a child attending 
school may be too high, particularly in the context of limited employment opportunities, the 
poor quality of education received, and the perceived irrelevance of education.43  
</p>
<p>41. Throughout her mission and in all of her consultations, the Special Rapporteur was 
repeatedly informed of the serious problems relating to language that undermine the impact 
and accessibility of the education system. Timor-Leste is a linguistically diverse State: the 
Constitution designates Tetum and Portuguese as official languages, and recognizes that 
&#8213;other national languages shall be valued and developed by the State&#8214; (sect. 13, para. 2). 
English and Bahasa Indonesia are considered working languages, and many indigenous 
languages are also spoken, such as Fataluku and Baiqueno.  
</p>
<p>42. Although Timor-Leste should be proud of its linguistic diversity, it creates great 
challenges for the education system.44 Despite being spoken by less than half of Timorese 
</p>
<p>  
 34 According to the Government, today only 11 per cent of Timorese children from 3 to 6 years old 
</p>
<p>attend preschool. The quality of preschool education is low, with no standard basic curriculum and 
variable teaching standards (Strategic Development Plan, p. 18).

<p>people,45 Portuguese is the official medium of instruction in all primary and secondary 
schools. However, textbooks in Portuguese are scarce, and many teachers do not speak it 
fluently. While Tetum is taught in primary schools, difficulties arise in terms of the lack of 
written materials and dealing with different dialects.  
</p>
<p>43. Given these factors, it is unsurprising that Timor-Leste has poor education 
outcomes, low retention and high repetition rates.46 Empirical data shows that children learn 
better in their mother tongue in the formative stages and early childhood education47 and 
children are less likely to attend school if they are unable to understand their teachers or 
their materials. In order to respect the richness of linguistic and cultural diversity, 
international human rights principles hold that wherever possible, education policies should 
provide children with opportunities to have instruction in their mother tongue.48 Linguistic 
difficulties in the education system, and particularly the inability of children to access 
education in their mother tongue or native language, also often results in exclusion from 
information and access to services (A/HRC/17/29 and Corr.1, para. 63). 
</p>
<p>44. Acknowledging the particular challenges that Timor-Leste faces, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to confront the challenges of language and education. 
The Special Rapporteur recognizes the investment by the Government in the eradication of 
illiteracy. Literacy programmes have been implemented in all 13 districts, yet benefit only 
approximately 10 per cent of the population.49 She notes that a draft Mother Tongue-Based 
Multilingual Education policy and pilot programme are under consideration, and that 
differing opinions have been expressed on the matter.  
</p>
<p>45. A further issue which greatly affects youth is unemployment. The International 
Monetary Fund has estimated that about 15,000 to 16,000 young people enter the labour 
market each year; only 9,500 jobs are estimated to have been created during 2008 and 2009, 
despite increases in public spending and economic growth.50 Studies show that the school-
to-work transition of young Timorese is hampered greatly by the lack of linkages between 
the training and education system and the commercial sector. In the absence of a 
comprehensive social security system, most youth in Timor-Leste have no choice but to 
enter the informal economy and subsistence farming, where earnings are low and 
unstable.51  
</p>
<p>46. In recent years, the Government has initiated several programmes to address the 
concerns of the youth population, particularly unemployment. A national youth policy has 
been adopted and a national youth fund is to be created to finance initiatives for youth 
groups and associations.52 The Special Rapporteur welcomes these policies, as well as the 
Government and Parliament&#8217;s commitment to youth training and integration into the work 
</p>
<p>market, as expressed by the recent approval of the Timor-Leste National Training 
</p>
<p>  
 45 Only 39.3 per cent of the population aged 15-24 are literate in Portuguese, and 77.8 per cent are 
</p>
<p>literate in Tetum. With respect to the entire population over 15, 25.2 per cent are literate in 
Portuguese and 56.1 per cent in Tetum. See 2010 Census (note 7 above).

efforts to diversify the economy to ensure that those seeking employment will have access

</p>
<p><b> VI. Challenges to the realization of rights by those living in 
extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>47. Since independence, Timor-Leste has faced the immense challenge of building a 
judicial framework and community of legal practitioners. With the assistance of the 
international community, some progress has been made to create the system of laws, 
establish justice mechanisms, bolster the numbers of judicial personnel, improve justice 
facilities in rural areas, and establish an integrated case management system linking all 
justice institutions.  
</p>
<p>48. However, significant advances and reforms to the legal framework are still required 
to raise the quality of and access to the formal justice system, particularly in rural areas. 
Some institutions provided for in the Constitution, such as the Supreme Court of Justice 
and the Audit Court, are yet to be established. Legal awareness and literacy among the 
population remains low; laws and regulations are published in Portuguese, and only some 
are translated into Tetum or other local languages. This prevents a large proportion of 
Timorese from knowing and claiming their rights.  
</p>
<p>49. The centralization of the Timorese justice system presents a considerable obstacle to 
accessing justice for those living in poverty, particularly in rural areas. While regional 
registries and branch offices of the National Directorate for Land and Property have now 
been set up in each of the 13 districts, district judicial offices or courts have yet to be 
established in many of the districts.54 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s 
initiative to operate a mobile court service in the Baucau and Suai regions and recommends 
that this be expanded to all districts, pending the establishment of permanent district courts, 
in order to bring justice closer to the people, improve awareness of the formal justice 
system, and disseminate legal information to the communities, especially in isolated areas. 
She welcomes the Government&#8217;s recognition that the justice system remains inaccessible to 
</p>
<p>substantial parts of the population, and urges the Government to fulfil its commitment to 
strengthening the capacity and accessibility of the formal justice system.55 
</p>
<p>50. Timorese cultural practices often reflect a preference for the resolution of legal 
issues at the community level, and the use of traditional justice mechanisms remains 
widespread.56 At times these mechanisms fall short of meeting international human rights 
norms and standards. In order to encourage the people to resolve disputes and claim their 
rights through the formal justice system, the Government needs to concentrate on building 
the capacity of the system to dispense justice quickly and efficiently at the district levels. It 
is also crucial that Timor-Leste adopt a clear regulatory framework to articulate a cohesive 
and coordinated integration of the formal justice system and traditional justice mechanisms.

</b></p>
<p>51. Ensuring affordable access to competent legal representation is an essential element 
of improving access to the formal justice system, particularly by people living in poverty. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent progress on the Law on Access 
to Courts (2011), which stipulates broad legal aid coverage at all stages of criminal, civil 
and administrative matters, including the payment of related expenses. The Special 
Rapporteur commends the Government on facilitating broad participation of civil society 
organizations in the drafting process, which has produced a law that is a significant step 
towards ensuring access to justice for those living in poverty.  
</p>
<p>52. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the positive impact of the Law 
will be undermined by pre-existing legislation. The Law on the Juridical Regime Governing 
the Private Legal Profession and Lawyers Training (Law No. 11/2008 of 30 July 2008) 
requires that all legal practitioners in Timor-Leste successfully complete a 15-month full-
time training course at the Legal Training Centre and 9 months of practice by 2012. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that if the legislation remains in force, Timor-Leste will 
have a serious shortfall in its stock of qualified legal practitioners, having received 
information that by July 2012 no more than seven legal practitioners will have completed 
the course and will therefore be licensed to practice in Timor-Leste, alongside the 16 public 
defenders. There is already a severe shortage of trained lawyers and judges in the country, a 
factor which has exacerbated the lengthy backlog of cases and undermined confidence in 
the judiciary.57 Although it is important to put in place measures to improve the quality of 
legal services in Timor-Leste, this must be balanced against the urgent need to ensure that 
legal practitioners are sufficient in number to meet the needs of the population. Following 
her mission the Special Rapporteur was informed that an amendment to this legislation, 
extending the transitional regime allowing lawyers who have not yet completed the training 
course to practice for two more years, was introduced by the Ministry of Justice and 
submitted to Parliament. She calls on Parliament to favourably consider this amendment.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur also calls on the Government to improve access to justice 
for children and youth. There are no separate children&#8217;s courts or specially trained juvenile 
judges in Timor-Leste, nor legislative protection for children as victims, witnesses and 
alleged offenders. In the light of the State&#8217;s obligation under international human rights law 
to prioritize the best interests of the child in all such processes, this situation must be 
rectified with the passage of the draft Juvenile Justice Law and the draft Law on Special 
Criminal Procedures (for those between 16 and 21 years old), which have been under 
discussion for several years.58 The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that the 
establishment of a family and children&#8217;s court, as proposed in the draft Juvenile Justice 
Law, must provide for the establishment and regulation of separate children&#8217;s detention 
</p>
<p>centres and address the specific needs of girls and children with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p>54. Over the past decade, Timor-Leste has made notable progress in increasing access to 
and improving the quality of basic health care services, the success of which is evidenced 
by dramatically improved health indicators: immunization coverage for children aged 12 to 
23 months has nearly tripled from 18 per cent in 2003 to 53 per cent in 2009,59 almost 80 
per cent of children are treated for basic illnesses, and 86 per cent of mothers receive some 
degree of antenatal care. Timor-Leste has achieved Millennium Development Goal 4, on

<p>reducing by two thirds the under-5 mortality rate,60 and progress in maternal health has 
resulted in reductions in the fertility rate from 7.8 to 5.7 births per woman.61 
</p>
<p>55. At the same time, Timor-Leste continues to experience one of the highest rates of 
chronic child undernutrition in the world; almost 60 per cent of children under 5 years of 
age are stunted; 33 per cent are severely stunted; and 45 per cent are underweight.62 There 
has been a slight deterioration in these outcomes over the last 10 years.63 Malnutrition 
among women is also a serious concern; a third of Timorese women are underweight.64 
These health outcomes are attributable not only to widespread poverty, but also to food 
insecurity, vulnerability to recent food price spikes, and the low productivity of the 
Timorese agricultural sector, which primarily revolves around subsistence farming. 
</p>
<p>56. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative of the Government to 
implement a nutrition campaign, information and education must be complemented by 
strengthening measures to address the complex issue of malnutrition, including measures to 
improve agricultural production, monitor food insecurity, and support food assistance 
programmes.  
</p>
<p>57. While the Constitution enshrines the right to free universal health care, in practice 
people living in poverty, particularly those in rural areas, are far from realizing this right. 
Many barriers remain that prevent people from accessing health care; for example, remote 
communities face long distances and difficult and costly travel to access health care 
facilities, which are often poorly equipped and staffed.65 Particularly concerning is the 
access to maternal health, generally insufficient in the whole country, but considerably 
worse outside Dili.66  
</p>
<p>58. The incidence of maternal mortality in Timor-Leste is one of the highest in the 
world. More than 40 per cent of Timorese women who die between the ages of 15 and 49 
die from pregnancy-related complications.67 This is an unacceptable and preventable 
reality, and illustrates the urgent need for the Government to identify maternal mortality as 
a priority area for attention and resource allocation. High rates of maternal mortality are 
suggestive not only of failures in the health-care system and in the provision of other public 
services, but of structural discrimination and a lack of political will to prioritize the rights 
of women.68  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to increase expenditure and adopt 
policies that strengthen health systems, giving priority to maternal health.69 These policies 
must be accompanied by access to information, including on sexual and reproductive 
health, regardless of marital status or age; access to voluntary family planning and legal and

</p>
<p>60. Acknowledging the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure accessible health care for even 
the most remote communities, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the implementation of the 
Integrated Community Health Services (SISCA) programme at the local level. However, 
she notes that SISCA requires additional support in terms of staffing, training, and 
transportation in order to increase its effectiveness, widen the scope of its coverage and 
scale up nutrition interventions. The Government&#8217;s commitment to establish primary health 
</p>
<p>care facilities in every suco by 2015 is to be commended.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that health-care services 
adequately accommodate and respond to the needs of persons with disabilities, who 
comprise around 5 per cent of the population.70 Of particular concern are the documented 
cases of persons with mental illnesses held in permanent or long-term restraints by families 
or community members, as no State-run facility exists for the long-term care of persons 
with mental illnesses.71 While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of a National 
Mental Health Policy and a Community-Based Rehabilitation Strategy, the Government 
must ensure that sufficient human and financial resources are dedicated to its 
implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to housing and access to land 
</b></p>
<p>62. The extensive destruction and violence committed by the Indonesian military and 
pro-Indonesian militias following the referendum in 1999 seriously affected the housing 
stock and infrastructure in the country.72 Taking power at the time of independence in 2002, 
the new Government committed to prioritizing measures to address the severe backlog in 
available housing. The National Development Plan, issued at the inception of the new 
Government, prominently incorporated the goal of &#8213;adequate shelter for all&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>63. Ten years on, adequate housing is still out of reach for many Timorese. It is 
estimated that 58 per cent of communities live in poor housing conditions,73 with the 
majority having no access to clean water and sanitation. Yet the political will to address the 
serious lack of adequate housing appears to have weakened; for example, there is no 
explicit mention of the right to adequate housing in the Strategic Development Plan 2011-
</p><p>2030.  
</p>
<p>64. Progress on implementing the Millennium Development Goals Suco Program, 
adopted by the Government in early 2011, has been limited. Under this programme, five 
houses would be built in each of the 2,228 aldeias annually, resulting in more than 55,000 
houses being built by 2015.74 From a human rights perspective, this project raises a number 
of serious concerns, including with respect to the lack of objective eligibility criteria and 
complaint mechanisms; the absence of meaningful and effective participation of 
community members; the cultural adequacy and sustainability of importing prefabricated

<p>houses; and the gender dimensions of accessing the benefits.75 Without these criteria in 
place, the programme will be seen as charity, not an entitlement of the beneficiaries, and 
will be open to abuse and manipulation.   
</p>
<p>65. A serious impediment to the realization of the right to adequate housing in Timor-
Leste is the complex situation of land titling. The violence following the 1999 referendum 
resulted in the destruction, inter alia, of many valuable records and files, including land and 
property titles. Land claims are complicated by historical land confiscations, population 
displacement and the multiplication of legal regimes, which include Portuguese, Indonesian 
and local land regimes and transactions.76 A 2012 report of the World Bank and the 
International Finance Corporation ranked Timor-Leste 183rd out of 183 countries in terms 
of ease of registering property.77 Of the estimated 200,000 land parcels in Timor-Leste, less 
than 25 per cent have ever been formally registered. Few recorded deeds still exist, the 
majority having been destroyed during the violence of 1999.78 A large number of families 
dwell on land to which they do not hold a legal title, or which is claimed by several parties 
or the State.  
</p>
<p>66. Throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur received information concerning forced 
eviction practices in the country. Meeting with families temporarily living in Aitarak Laran 
after having been evicted from their homes in ex-Brimob in Bairo-Pite, she witnessed the 
detrimental impacts of these evictions. In some cases families had been living on plots for 
many years before being evicted without proper notice. While the majority of evicted 
families had received some financial compensation, many claimed that it was insufficient to 
purchase new land and rebuild new homes. Their new living conditions do not provide 
adequate shelter to withstand the rainy season, nor access to adequate sanitation facilities.  
</p>
<p>67. While the Special Rapporteur is confident that the Government is aware of the 
complex situation of land ownership in Timor-Leste, the use of such eviction practices is in 
clear violation of its human rights obligations. The struggles of nation-building and 
development cannot be an excuse to displace and destroy the homes of people living in 
poverty, who are entitled to protection against forced evictions and arbitrary interference in 
their home and privacy. Where justifiable in the most exceptional circumstances, evictions 
must meet the strict requirements set down in the basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement.79  
</p>
<p>68. Three land laws have been under long and extensive discussion in Parliament, and 
were adopted after the completion of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the identification of land-regime reform as a priority, and acknowledges that both 
Government and Parliament have taken steps to provide a clear and stable legal framework. 
However, a preliminary review of the recently adopted laws raises concerns about the 
compliance of several aspects of the laws with international human rights standards and 
obligations, including with respect to the participation of civil society in the discussions. 
With these reservations in mind, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent decision by 
the former President to veto the laws and send them back to Parliament for additional 
appraisal, and she calls on the Government to invite the Special Rapporteur on adequate

non-discrimination in this context, to assess the draft laws and their subsequent 
implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Social security and social protection 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Government of Timor-Leste has shown a clear commitment to investing in 
social protection programmes. However, the size and adequacy of the individual social 
protection programmes vary significantly; the veterans&#8217; payment (Pensions for Combatants 
and Martyrs of the Struggle for National Liberation) is the most generous programme and 
represents 69 per cent of the total social protection budget, while the conditional cash 
transfer programme targeted primarily at female-headed households (Bolsa da M&#227;e) 
receives only 2 per cent of the total budget and distributes the smallest benefits.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its efforts to expand and 
implement social protection programmes, and notes the importance of a strong legal and 
institutional framework in ensuring that the programmes will outlast the political cycle and 
not be manipulated for political purposes. Nonetheless, she has some concerns about the 
lack of assessment of the human rights impact of some components of the programmes.  
</p>
<p>71. From a human rights perspective, universal social protection schemes are the best 
way for States to meet their human rights obligations to ensure that there is no 
discrimination in the selection of beneficiaries. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
commends the Government for the universal approach it has taken with respect to the 
pension for older persons and the disability pension.80 However, she is concerned about the 
high incidence of exclusion errors in the delivery of social protection. According to a 2011 
survey, for example, 86 per cent of persons with disabilities do not receive the disability 
pension.81 Social protection programmes should prioritize reaching the poorest of the poor, 
before moving to progressively wider coverage; in Timor-Leste only half of the transfers go 
to the poorest segment of society and about 25 per cent of transfers go to the richest 
households.82 
</p>
<p>72. In most of the programmes, eligible households are invited to receive benefits by the 
<i>Chefe do Suco</i> (village chief). This targeting method raises serious human rights concerns 
that must be addressed by the Ministry of Social Solidarity. While community leaders may 
have better knowledge about who is experiencing poverty in their community, this mode of 
targeting has the potential to reinforce power structures, patron-client relations and local 
gender norms, creating tensions and further stigmatizing some groups in the community. 
Including community leaders in the targeting process also creates opportunities for bribery 
and the abuse of power. Considering that women are less able to influence decision-making 
processes, they run the risk of being excluded.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that social programmes 
avoid perpetuating asymmetries of power in the communities and actively seek to enable 
the most disadvantaged and excluded members of the community to benefit from the 
programme. Special attention must be given to ensuring that all aspects of the programme 
are gender sensitive. Doing so requires the active participation of women, and policymakers

</p>
<p>must ensure that the participatory process does not perpetuate the existing male-dominated 
power structures. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Ministry of Social Solidarity assess the 
possibility of implementing a categorical targeting of non-universal programmes, benefiting 
everyone in the most deprived communities first. The assessment of which communities are 
the most deprived must be objective and independent. The Government must ensure that 
the selection of beneficiaries is made on the basis of reasonable and objective criteria and 
that people have access to a complaint mechanism to review any possible unfair exclusion 
from the programmes. Such a mechanism must be impartial and anonymous, and have the 
competence to provide effective redress.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the geographical accessibility of the 
programmes, the cultural adaptability of the dissemination methods, and the imposition of 
requirements that may discourage eligible beneficiaries to apply. The poorest and most 
marginalized populations often experience real difficulties meeting the administrative 
requirements of social protection programmes. A survey shows that more than 70 per cent 
of beneficiaries across all programmes cited obtaining required documentation as the most 
significant difficulty when applying.83  
</p>
<p>76. In Timor-Leste the populations most in need of social protection are those removed 
from urban centres. Therefore, additional efforts must be made to ensure that physical and 
practical obstacles such as long distances, difficult geographical terrain, and high 
transportation and opportunity costs are not preventing people from accessing the 
programmes. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the 
implementation of the pension programme for the elderly: almost one third of the 
beneficiaries must travel 90 minutes or more to receive the benefit.84 The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Ministry of Social Solidarity to continue to assess the best way 
of delivering the benefits, in full recognition of the potential discriminatory effect of 
particular modes of disbursement.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur has particular concerns about the Bolsa da M&#227;e programme. 
Initially, the design of the programme raised serious human rights concerns with respect to 
the reasonableness, objectivity and transparency of the qualifying conditions for the 
scheme. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the flexibility displayed by the Ministry of 
Social Solidarity in making improvements, which have included revising the eligibility 
criteria. Following the completion of her mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed of 
the adoption of a Decree-Law on the Bolsa da M&#227;e programme, which enshrines the new 
framework in law. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the changes to the programmes as 
reflected in the new Law, including the establishment of a monitoring system to oversee the 
implementation of the programme. Of great importance is the inclusion in the new Law of 
provisions which ensure the continuous implementation and funding for the programme. 
However, the Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned about the imposition of 
conditionalities in the programme.  
</p>
<p>78. While evidence from some countries suggests that conditional cash transfer 
programmes are successful in achieving health and education outcomes, policies from very 
different contexts may not translate well to Timor-Leste in this case. Because of the specific 
vulnerabilities of people living in poverty in Timor-Leste, including the limited access to 
education and poor infrastructure, the imposition of conditionalities could undermine the 
enjoyment of human rights. Furthermore, it involves additional monitoring and 
</p>
<p>

 84 Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>administration costs, as well as private costs to the beneficiaries in complying with 
conditionalities. Resources may be better spent on extending the scope of the programme or 
the level of benefits, than on the administrative costs associated with monitoring 
conditionalities.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to continue to expand the capacity of 
the Bolsa da M&#227;e programme such that universal provision is ultimately achieved. In this 
regard, and considering the scarcity of resources, the Special Rapporteur suggests Timor-
Leste re-evaluate whether the resources expended on the veterans&#8217; pension could be more 
efficiently allocated. Supporting veterans is an important part of the national cultural and 
social fabric in Timor-Leste, and the country should be proud of the strong framework it 
has put in place to address the needs of its veterans. However, the programme receives a 
large percentage of the social protection budget, despite delivering benefits to only a small 
fragment of the Timorese population. Furthermore, the programme has encountered 
difficulties with regard to the identification of beneficiaries, despite various efforts by the 
Government to verify data and eligibility.85 The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government undertake an evaluation of the effectiveness and scale of the programme.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and final recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Special Rapporteur recognizes the advances made by Timor-Leste and the 
ongoing challenges it faces in order to consolidate peace and security and achieve 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable development. However, she is concerned that poverty persists despite 
</b></p>
<p><b>notable efforts and several successful programmes, and that economic growth and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development have not benefited all Timorese equally. The Government must 
</b></p>
<p><b>concentrate its efforts on social and economic policies which ensure inclusive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>equitable growth and development for all the population. To this end it must 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen efforts to diversify the non-oil economy, build sustainable industries, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the preservation of its natural resources for future generations. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Although the report includes detailed recommendations in each of its sections, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to urge Timor-Leste to take the following steps as a
