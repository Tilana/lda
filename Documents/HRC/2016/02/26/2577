<p><b>  </b>22/&#8230;<b> Prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as 
</p>
<p>well as other relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the Human Rights Council resolution 7/25 on the prevention of genocide, 
</p>
<p>adopted on 28 March 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and succeeded by the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next day, provides an 
</p>
<p>important opportunity for the international community to draw the attention of all States to 
</p>
<p>the significance of the Convention and to invite them to redouble their efforts in the 
</p>
<p>prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the crime of genocide is recognized in the Convention as an 
</p>
<p>odious scourge that has inflicted great losses on humanity, and that further international 
</p>
<p>cooperation is required to facilitate the timely prevention and punishment of the crime of 
</p>
<p>genocide, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, recognized as 
</p>
<p>such by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in the 1948 
</p>
<p>Convention, and bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and international humanitarian law might result in genocide,  
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p> <i>Taking into consideration </i>that States parties to the Convention on the Non-
</p>
<p>Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 
</p>
<p>November 1968 have agreed that no statutory limitation shall apply to such crimes, 
</p>
<p>including the crime of genocide, irrespective of the date of their commission, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that impunity for the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity encourages their occurrence and is a fundamental obstacle to the furtherance of 
</p>
<p>cooperation among peoples and the promotion of international peace and security, and that 
</p>
<p>fighting impunity for such crimes is an important factor in their prevention, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community in the 
</p>
<p>past 65 years, including within the United Nations system, in developing relevant 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and practices to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, thereby 
</p>
<p>contributing to the effective implementation of the Convention, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly declared genocide a crime under international law, and all subsequent resolutions 
</p>
<p>within the United Nations system that have contributed to the establishment and 
</p>
<p>development of the process of prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p>including Assembly resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> <i>with appreciation</i> that genocide is defined among the most serious 
</p>
<p>crimes of concern to the international community as a whole in the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, and also acknowledging the role of the Court and other 
</p>
<p>relevant international criminal tribunals in helping to increase accountability for the crime 
</p>
<p>of genocide,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the importance of the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees 
</p>
<p>of non-recurrence to the prevention of genocide, and also stressing that perpetrators of this 
</p>
<p>crime should be held criminally accountable on the national or international level,  
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights on the right to the truth,1  and encouraging States to cooperate with the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-
</p>
<p>recurrence,  
</p>
<p> <i>Encouraging</i> States to promote the ascertainment of the truth by appropriate means 
</p>
<p>as an important element in combating impunity promoting accountability as part of the 
</p>
<p>prevention of genocide and comprehensive reconciliation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that an important factor for the prevention of genocide is the 
</p>
<p>identification of the root causes of genocide, as well as early warning signs,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Human Rights Council was mandated by the General Assembly to 
</p>
<p>address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, 
</p>
<p>and to make recommendations thereon, and that it should also promote the effective 
</p>
<p>coordination and mainstreaming of human rights in the United Nations system,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the important contribution of the United Nations human rights system 
</p>
<p>to efforts towards preventing situations in which the crime of genocide could be committed, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the work of the joint office established by the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>institutionalize collaboration between the complementary mandates of the Special Adviser 
</p>
<p>on the Prevention of Genocide and the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the analysis framework developed by the Office of the Special 
</p>
<p>Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide as one of the tools to assess the risk of genocide in 
</p>
<p>any situation, and encouraging Member States and regional and subregional organizations 
</p>
<p>to use relevant frameworks, as appropriate, for guidance in their prevention work, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the presentation of the reports of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General submitted to the Human Rights Council on the implementation of the Five-Point 
</p>
<p>Action Plan2 and the activities of the Special Adviser,<footnote name="3">A/HRC/7/37 and A/HRC/10/30. 
</footnote> as well as of the convening of three 
</p>
<p>interactive dialogues with the Special Adviser at the third, seventh and tenth sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document,4 especially paragraphs 138 
</p>
<p>and 139 thereof, in which all Heads of States and Governments affirmed the primary 
</p>
<p>responsibility of each individual State to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, 
</p>
<p>ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which is part of the responsibility to protect 
</p>
<p>and which entails, inter alia, the prevention of such crimes,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 63/308 of 14 September 2009, in 
</p>
<p>which the Assembly decided to continue its consideration of the responsibility to protect, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the seminar organized on January 2009, pursuant to Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 7/25, commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and bringing together States, relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations entities and other international and regional organizations, civil society, and 
</p>
<p>academic and research bodies to discuss existing preventive strategies, initiatives and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms within the United Nations human rights system, and the role of Member 
</p>
<p>States, regional bodies and other entities in the prevention of genocide, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the important role played by regional and subregional arrangements 
</p>
<p>in the prevention of genocide and response to mass atrocities that may lead to genocide, and 
</p>
<p>welcoming in this respect the establishment of the Regional Committee for the Prevention 
</p>
<p>and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity and All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and 
</p>
<p>the establishment of respective national committees by the member States of the 
</p>
<p>Conference, the Latin American Network for Genocide and Mass Atrocity Prevention, the 
</p>
<p>Genocide Network of the European Union, and also the Global Network of National Focal 
</p>
<p>Points on the responsibility to protect, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> <i>also</i> the decision by the Secretary-General declaring 2012 the Year 
</p>
<p>of Prevention, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> <i>further</i> the successful outcomes of the Regional Forums on the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Genocide, the fourth of which was held in Phnom Penh, from 28 February to 
</p>
<p>1 March 2013, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the significance of the Convention on the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as an effective international instrument for the 
</p>
<p>prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reiterates</i> the responsibility of each individual State to protect its population 
</p>
<p>from genocide, which entails the prevention of such a crime, including incitement to it, 
</p>
<p>through appropriate and necessary means; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>and taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,<footnote name="5">A/63/677. </footnote> to continue the consideration of the 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect, including by building consensus among Member States on its 
</p>
<p>implementation; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> Member States to build their capacity to prevent and respond to

</p>
<p>on prevention and responses; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States to consider the appointment of focal points on prevention

</p>
<p>Prevention of Genocide, relevant United Nations bodies and with regional and subregional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its appreciation</i> to all States that have ratified or acceded to the
