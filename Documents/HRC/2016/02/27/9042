<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> During 2008, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited Colombia, Italy, 
Mauritania and Ukraine at the invitation of the Governments of these countries. The reports on 
these visits are contained in the addenda to the present document (A/HRC/10/21/Add.2-5). 
</p>
<p> During the period from 1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008, the Working Group 
adopted 46 Opinions concerning 183 persons in 22 countries. These Opinions are contained in 
the first addendum to the present document (A/HRC/10/21/Add.1). 
</p>
<p> Also during this period, the Group transmitted a total of 130 urgent appeals concerning 
1,256 individuals, including 57 women, 4 boys and 3 girls, to 44 Governments. Governments 
informed the Working Group that they had taken measures to remedy the situation of the 
detainees: in some cases, the detainees were released; in other cases, the Working Group was 
assured that the detainees concerned would enjoy fair trial guarantees. 
 The Working Group has continued to develop its follow-up procedure and has sought to 
engage in a continuous dialogue with those countries visited by the Working Group, in respect of 
which it had recommended changes to domestic legislation governing detention or to adopt other 
measures. Information about the implementation of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations was 
received from the Governments of Belarus, Canada, China, Ecuador and Turkey, countries 
visited by the Working Group in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. 
</p>
<p> The present report includes several issues which have given rise to concern during 2008. 
In particular, the Working Group denounces the fact that an important proportion of the 
9 million persons deprived of their liberty worldwide are unable to benefit from legal resources 
and guarantees that they are entitled to for the conduct of their defence. Most do not have the 
economic means to afford expensive and complex legal procedures. They not only have 
difficulties in verifying the lawfulness of their detention, but also find themselves subject to lack 
of an effective control of their other rights. Therefore, the Working Group proposes to the 
Human Rights Council an extension of its mandate to include the monitoring of State 
compliance with their obligations concerning all human rights of detained and imprisoned 
persons. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group includes in its report a list of principles that it has elaborated 
concerning deprivation of liberty of persons accused of acts of terrorism. It also proposes to hold 
a special forum on the respect of the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty in the 
counter-terrorism context, giving special consideration to the methods and framework applied by 
the States in emergency situations. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes that the corruption it has observed in some countries makes the 
whole system of guarantees devoid of any content and reduces the credibility of the entire 
administration of justice system. It calls upon States to become a party to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption, which recently entered into force. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Working Group reiterates that immigrants in irregular situations should not be 
qualified or treated as criminals nor viewed only from the perspective of national security. 
Detention should be of the last resort, permissible only for the shortest period of time. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the former Commission on 
Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42 and entrusted with the investigation of instances of 
alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty, according to the standards set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments accepted by the States 
concerned. The mandate of the Working Group was clarified and extended by the Commission in 
its resolution 1997/50 to cover the issue of administrative custody of asylum-seekers and 
immigrants. At its sixth session the Human Rights Council assessed the mandate of the Working 
Group and adopted resolution 6/4, in which it confirmed the scope of its mandate and extended 
this for a further three-year period. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period 1 January to 30 April 2008, Ms. Soledad Villagra de Biedermann 
(Paraguay), Ms. Le&#239;la Zerrougui (Algeria) and Mr. Tam&#225;s B&#225;n (Hungary) were members of the 
Working Group and Ms. Zerrougui was also its Chairperson-Rapporteur. They were replaced on 
1 May 2008 by Mr. Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile), Mr. Malick El Hadji Sow (Senegal) and 
Mr. Aslan Abashidze (Russian Federation), respectively. During the period 1 January to 
31 July 2008, Mr. Seyyed Mohammed Hashemi (Islamic Republic of Iran) was also a member of 
the Working Group. He was replaced on 1 August 2008 by Ms. Shaheen Sardar Ali (Pakistan). 
</p>
<p>3. On 6 May 2008, Manuela Carmena Castrillo was appointed as Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group and Malick El Hadji Sow was appointed as the Working Group&#8217;s 
Vice-Chairperson.

<p><b>3.  Government reactions to Opinions 
</b></p>
<p>8. In a letter dated 11 April 2008, the Permanent Representative of the United States of 
America to the United Nations Office at Geneva noted that his Government was deeply troubled 
by several of the assertions in the Working Group&#8217;s Opinion No. 43/2006 (United States of 
America) concerning Mr. Ali Salem Kahlah Al-Marri. The Permanent Representative stated that 
the United States is in a legal state of armed conflict with Al-Qaida, the Taliban, and their 
affiliates and supporters. Al-Qaida leaders explicitly declared war against the United States, and 
its members attacked United States embassies, military vessels and military headquarters, its 
financial centre and capital city, killing more than 3,000 people in the process. The Taliban 
allowed Al-Qaida to use Afghanistan as an area from which to plot attacks and train in the use of 
weapons. The Security Council explicitly recognized the right of the United States to act in 
self-defence in response to these armed attacks. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO), the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Security Treaty between Australia, 
New Zealand and the United States of America (ANZUS) all invoked the collective self-defence 
provisions of their respective treaties. Contrary to the Working Group&#8217;s assertion, anyone who 
takes up arms against another State is by definition an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; subject to detention 
under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group takes note of the letter of the Permanent Representative of the 
United States of America. However, it wishes to reiterate that it has consistently not supported 
this position.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>10. The Permanent Representative further pointed out that the use of material witness warrants 
is a long-standing practice authorized by statute and dating back to 1789. Every material witness 
has the right to challenge, in court, before a judicial officer, his or her confinement as a material 
witness. An attorney will be appointed if the material witness cannot afford to pay for a lawyer. 
Lastly, the Permanent Representative reported that Mr. Al-Marri&#8217;s case is pending litigation at a 
three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Information received concerning previous Opinions 
</b></p>
<p>11. In connection with Opinion No. 38/2005 (China), the source reported that Mr. Hu Shigen 
was released on 26 August 2008. He had been sentenced to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment for carrying 
out counter-revolutionary propaganda and organizing a counter-revolutionary group. 
</p>
<p>12. The source reported that Messrs. Moustapha Talal Mesto and Ayman Noureddine Tarabay 
were released on 27 August 2008. Their detention had been considered arbitrary by the Working 
Group in its Opinion No. 37/2007 (Lebanon). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Request for review of Opinions 
</b></p>
<p>13. By letter dated 29 February 2008, the Government of Lebanon requested a revision, in 
accordance with paragraph 21 of the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, of Opinion 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  See, for example, E/CN.4/2006/120, paras. 19 et seq. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>No. 37/2007 (Lebanon) (A/HRC/10/21/Add.1, p. 79). After having carefully examined the 
contents of this letter, the Working Group decided, at its fifty-second session, not to grant the 
request. It considered that the letter neither contained entirely new facts on which the requests 
were based and such as to have caused the Working Group to alter its decision had it been aware 
of them (paragraph 21 (a) of the methods of work), nor that facts had not been known or had not 
been accessible to the Government (paragraph 21 (b) of the methods of work). The Working 
Group also wishes to highlight that, contrary to the statement of the Government of Lebanon in 
this letter that it would have appreciated if the Working Group had brought to its attention the 
information received from the source and upon which it based its Opinion No. 37/2007, the 
Working Group had indeed transmitted this information to the Government and received its reply 
as is reflected in the Opinion. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Follow-up on Opinions 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Working Group has, since 1992, been seized with innumerable allegations in relation 
to the practice of arbitrary detention resorted to by the Government of Myanmar. The Working 
Group has, on five occasions,<b>3</b> pronounced itself on the consecutive and renewed detentions that 
have affected Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The Working Group is also aware 
of other cases of arbitrary detention which violate the human conscience, such as the case of the 
activist U Ohn Than forming the basis of Opinion No. 44/2008 (Myanmar). He also had spent a 
large part of his life in prison for calls for democracy for his country, and was sentenced to life 
imprisonment in 2008 for a peaceful and solitary demonstration in his homeland. 
</p>
<p>15. These Opinions were adopted in light of the lack of cooperation by the government 
authorities with the Working Group, and with the Human Rights Council. The Working Group, 
therefore, requests the Council to take these circumstances into account. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Communications giving rise to urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the period 1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008, the Working Group 
transmitted 130 urgent appeals to 44 Governments concerning 1,256 individuals (603 men, 
57 women, 4 boys, 3 girls and 589 unidentified persons). In conformity with paragraphs 22 to 24 
of its methods of work (E/CN.4/1998/44, annex I), the Working Group, without prejudging 
whether the detention was arbitrary, drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to 
the specific case as reported, and appealed to them to take the necessary measures to ensure that 
the detained persons&#8217; right to life and to physical integrity were respected. When the appeal 
made reference to the critical state of health of certain persons or to particular circumstances, 
such as failure to execute a court order for release, the Working Group requested the 
Government concerned to take all necessary measures to have the persons concerned released. In 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/2, the Working Group integrated into its 
methods of work the prescriptions of the Code of Conduct relating to urgent appeals and has 
since applied them.

<p>18. Sources reported that 40 persons had been released. The Working Group wishes to thank 
those Governments that heeded its appeals and took steps to provide it with information on the 
situation of the persons concerned, especially the Governments that released those persons. In 
other cases, the Working Group was assured that the detainees concerned would receive fair trial 
guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Future activities 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Working Group is aware of, and commends, the joint initiative on secret places of 
detention launched by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment or punishment and by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights while countering terrorism, which aims at studying and analysing the reality, as 
well as the objectives and implications, of secret places of detention on human rights. This 
thematic subject is of great importance, as the human rights of persons arrested, detained or 
imprisoned can only be enjoyed if the person is held in a public place. Access to legal counsel, to 
family, to a judge or other judicial authority, to education, to health and medical attention, and 
the right to denounce torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading practices, would be rendered 
impossible in secret or otherwise clandestine prisons. Therefore, the Working Group offers its 
full cooperation to this initiative. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Country missions 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Request for visits 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Working Group has been invited to visit Malta, Senegal and the United States of 
America. The visit to Malta has been scheduled to take place in January 2009. 
</p>
<p>21. During its fifty-first session, the Working Group held meetings with representatives of the 
Governments of Senegal and the United States to discuss possible dates for visits. The Working 
Group has also asked to visit Sierra Leone, a country which, in spite of having extended an open 
formal invitation to all the thematic mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, has not yet 
replied to the Working Group&#8217;s request. It has also made requests to visit Afghanistan, Algeria, 
Argentina (a follow-up visit), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, 
Guinea-Bissau, India, Japan, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Morocco, Nauru, Nicaragua 
(a follow-up visit to Bluefields), Papua New Guinea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, 
Sierra Leone, Thailand, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Follow-up to country visits of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>22. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided in 1998 to address a 
follow-up letter to the Governments of the countries it visited, requesting information on such 
initiatives as the authorities might have taken to give effect to the relevant recommendations 
adopted by the Group contained in the reports on its country visits (E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 36). 
</p>
<p>23. In 2008, the Working Group received replies to communications sent in 2007 and 2008 
from the Governments of Belarus (E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.3), Canada (E/CN.4/2006/7/Add.2), </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>China (E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.4), Ecuador and Turkey (A/HRC/4/40/Add.2 and 5, respectively). 
No replies have been received from the Governments of Honduras (A/HRC/4/40/Add.4) or 
Nicaragua (A/HRC/4/40/Add.3). 
</p>
<p><b>Belarus 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Government of Belarus submitted information concerning the recommendations made 
by the Working Group on the outcome of its visit, carried out from 16 to 24 August 2004. With 
regard to the recommendation concerning taking all appropriate measures to guarantee the 
effective independence of judges and lawyers, the Government reported that a new Code on the 
Judicial System and the Status of Judges had been adopted on 13 January 2007. The Code has set 
forth all the fundamental principles necessary for safeguarding judicial independence. Judges 
may not be transferred to another position or court without their personal consent and are 
inviolable during their term of office. They may not be held to account for any opinion they 
express during the administration of justice or for the decisions they hand down. The Bar Act 
establishes that the bar is an independent legal entity which assures genuine professional 
self-government and enables lawyers to combine their efforts to establish and strengthen the rule 
of law. No court may refuse to recognize the right of a lawyer to represent the interests of a 
person who applies for legal assistance. The activities of the National Bar Association, the 
provincial bar associations, the Minsk City Bar Association and the specialized Belarusian bar 
association &#8220;Belinyurkollegia&#8221; are governed by statutes adopted by the associations&#8217; higher 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>25. In relation to the recommendation concerning reconsidering the legal framework relating 
to pretrial detention, the Government reported that the procuratorial body must decide whether to 
initiate proceedings within 12 hours of the actual arrest. If no decision is taken, the detained 
person must be released. On the expiry of a 72-hour period, an appropriate preventive measure 
must be imposed or the detained person must be released from custody. Article 144 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure sets out the guarantees allowing persons who are detained to have the 
legality of their detention, remand or house arrest, reviewed by a court.  
</p>
<p>26. The Government reported that, between 2004 and 2007, the Penal Correction Department 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs implemented a raft of measures to reduce the number of 
persons being held in remand centres and prisons and to provide detainees with the living space 
required under health standards. The aggregate number of persons being held in remand centres 
and prison remand wings is currently within the set limit. The Supreme Court and the 
Procurator-General of Belarus are informed by the Penal Correction Department of instances in 
which cassation courts have exceeded the legally established time limits for the consideration of 
criminal cases and cases in which courts have extended custody after the deadline stipulated in 
the Code of Criminal Procedure. Concerning detention of juveniles, the Government reported 
that since 2005, work has been under way on the elaboration of a draft juvenile justice policy 
with the participation of all interested organizations, including UNICEF.  
</p>
<p>27. In relation to administrative detention, the Government reported that a Code of 
Administrative Procedure and Enforcement was adopted on 20 December 2006, and had been in 
force since 1 March 2007. The Code provides an extensive and detailed description of the rights 
and duties of the participants in administrative proceedings. Its norms extend, inter alia, to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>foreign nationals and stateless persons detained for the purposes of identification or enforcement 
of a decision to deport them. Lastly, concerning the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation on 
facilitating the participation of civil society in the oversight of prisons and other detention 
facilities, the Government reported that, on 15 December 2006, the Ministry of Justice adopted 
its decision No. 85 ratifying the Instructions on the Procedures for the Formation of Voluntary 
Watchdog Committees. 
</p>
<p><b>Canada 
</b></p>
<p>28. By note verbale dated 13 November 2008, the Government of Canada informed the 
Working Group about the implementation of the recommendations made by the Group following 
its 1-15 June 2005 visit to Canada. In relation to the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation to 
reverse the trend to ever-increasing use of pretrial detention and to find innovative alternatives to 
the detention on remand of accused without strong roots in the community, the Government 
reported that, in January 2008, provincial and territorial Deputy Ministers endorsed the creation 
of a Task Force to confirm and/or quantify the nature of adult corrections population as well as 
the nature of recent shifts in its composition. The Task Force is expected to make preliminary 
recommendations in January 2009 on the growing remand population and on the impact of 
federal justice legislation on correctional capacity. 
</p><p>29. The Government pointed out that there were several opportunities for an accused without 
strong roots in the community to be released pending trial or sentence. Over the next five years, 
the Government will contribute Can$ 560 million to provinces and territories for criminal legal 
aid and $57 million for immigration and refugee legal aid. In the case of the Northwest 
Territories, Yukon and Nunavut, funding for criminal legal aid, court work and public legal 
education and information is administered through the Access to Justice Service Agreements. In 
connection to the recommendation concerning the elimination of the use of security certificates, 
the Government stated that security certificate proceedings should be characterized as 
deportation proceedings. There is nothing arbitrary, ipso facto, about detention of an alien based 
on the issuance of a security certificate provided for by law. The Immigration and Refugee 
Protection Act (IRPA) contains extensive procedural and human rights safeguards and is 
subjected to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The security certificate process is 
intended to deal with those people in Canada who are or have been involved in, for example, 
terrorist activity. On 23 February 2008, IRPA was amended, strengthening the ability of the 
person detained under a security certificate to know the case against him or her and participate in 
the judicial process. This amendment requires the establishment of a security-cleared &#8220;special 
advocate&#8221;, who will have access to the sensitive information against the detainee. 
</p>
<p>30. Finally, concerning the recommendation related to strengthening policies to address the 
overrepresentation of Aboriginals among the prison population, the Government reported on 
several law enforcement, justice and correctional services initiatives to reduce offending and 
therefore, the overrepresentation of Aboriginal peoples in the criminal justice system and among 
the prison population. Several programmes are being carried out by the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, the Judiciary and the Correctional Service of Canada. A forum on justice 
system responses to violence in northern and remote Aboriginal communities took place in 2008 
in Ottawa.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>China 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Government of China reported that, over the past four years, the Legal Committee of 
the National People&#8217;s Council, the People&#8217;s Supreme Court, the People&#8217;s Supreme Procuratorate, 
the State Council Legislative Affairs Office and the Ministries of Public Security and Justice 
have taken full account of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations made after its visit to China 
in 2004, in the course of the legislative and judicial reform process under way in China. 
Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure have been included in the legislative 
programme of the tenth session of the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress, in 
order to prevent the extortion of confessions by torture; to strengthen arrangements to protect the 
legal rights of litigants; to ensure better reflection of the policy of tempering severity in justice 
with leniency; to ensure fair trials and to raise the standard of legal proceedings and to strengthen 
protection of the rights of juvenile criminal suspects and defendants. 
</p><p>32. The Government reported that, on 28 August 2005, the Maintenance of Public Security 
(Penalties) Act was enacted by the Standing Committee of the People&#8217;s National Congress and 
passed into law on 1 March 2006. The Act ensures that the degree of severity of administrative 
detention is more appropriately determined, sets out more stringent procedures, further 
standardizes the penalties and provides for more effective oversight. The Act is more strongly 
people-oriented, ensuring respect for and protection of human rights, upholding the rights of 
citizens to a remedy and attaching due priority to the regulation and oversight of police authority. 
The new legislation further restricts the discretionary powers of the public security authorities to 
impose administrative detention. In 2006, 1,277 proceedings were instituted challenging 
administrative detention orders, of which 910 were granted, 77 dismissed and 28 revised. 
</p>
<p>33. Concerning the system of re-education through labour, the Government reported that the 
Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress at its tenth session incorporated 
legislation on labour re-education, specifically the Unlawful Conduct (Rehabilitation) Act, in the 
five-year legislative plan. In addition, Beijing and certain other cities have set up pilot schemes 
for the social correction of persons serving terms of labour re-education outside the custodial 
facility. Regarding the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation on mandatory medical treatment, the 
Government reported that the relevant departments have completed the basic draft of a mental 
health act, which has been included in the 2007 legislative plan. In 2005 the city of Ningbo and 
in 2006 the city of Hangzhou promulgated mental health regulations setting out strict 
requirements for the administration of mandatory psychiatric treatment. A new Narcotics Control 
Act has been drafted, stipulating the conditions triggering compulsory treatment for drug 
addiction and the protection of the rights and interests of those undergoing the treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Government of Ecuador submitted to the Working Group a complete report on the 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Working Group after its February 2006 
visit to the country. Provisions contained in Act No. 2003-101, which established &#8220;detenci&#243;n en 
firme&#8221; (mandatory preventive detention), were declared contrary to the Constitution by the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court on 23 October 2006.<b>4</b> On 26 June 2007, the Government declared the 
national prison system in a state of emergency. Necessary funding had also been provided to the 
Judiciary, which had allowed the creation of 20 new penal courts, 11 new chambers at high 
courts of appeal and 40 new specialized courts for minors. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government further reported that by Executive Decree No. 441 of 26 June 2007, a 
criminal defence unit had been established in the new Ministry of Justice and Human Rights to 
improve free access to public defenders. Around US$ 7 million had been allocated to the new 
unit. The overloading in pretrial detention centres and social rehabilitation centres had 
diminished in 37 per cent. Nine legal firms in Guayaquil and five in Quito, with 183 lawyers, 
had been recruited as public defenders. They are currently providing free legal services to 
7,386 detainees. Ecuador is also promoting a flexible mechanism to provide pardons for 
prisoners who are terminally ill or those who are serving unfair prison sanctions. 
</p>
<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>36. In relation to the recommendations by the Working Group after its visit to Turkey 
from 9 to 20 October 2006 (see A/HRC/4/40/Add.5 and A/HRC/4/G/8), the Government 
reported on 9 October 2008 that the Ministry of Health was in the process of considering the 
views expressed in section B (subsection 2 and 3) of the Working Group&#8217;s report with a view to 
formulating possible solutions and policies. The Ministry of Health has also been analysing the 
Working Group&#8217;s Deliberation No. 7 (E/CN.4/2005/6) on psychiatric detention pointed out in the 
recommendations. Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice is considering the issue of psychiatric 
hospitalization pending a judicial intervention.  
</p><p>37. The Government further reported that article 252/2 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which 
establishes the maximum duration of remand detention in cases of terrorist crimes, will enter into 
force on 31 December 2010. Necessary measures will be taken to ensure its correct interpretation 
and implementation in practice, in line with the recommendations of the Working Group. In 
relation to its recommendation concerning the amendment of the definition of terrorism with a 
view to limiting its scope, the Government reported that Law No. 5532 amended in 2006 
article 1 of the Anti-Terror Law, repealing its second and third paragraphs. The anti-terror 
legislations are under constant review, owing to the scourge of terrorism with which Turkey is 
faced.  
</p>
<p>38. Concerning recommendations regarding the juvenile system, the Government reported that 
the law enforcement agencies have been restructured in order to set up new child units, child 
bureaux and departments which will deal with all proceedings concerning the child, including 
those in need of protection, without parental care, seeking asylum, drawn into offences, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  According to the system of &#8220;detenci&#243;n en firme&#8221;, judges were obliged to maintain in detention 
</p>
<p>a suspect without taking into consideration whether the time limit for pretrial detention had 
elapsed. Thousands of persons were thus detained for longer periods than the Constitution 
allows. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>homeless, etc. The Gendarmerie has also set up special child centres including special child 
protection experts in order to deal with the proceedings against juvenile offenders within its 
jurisdiction. Finally, concerning foreigners who do not have the financial means or necessary 
documents in order to leave the country, the Government reported that they are accommodated in 
special guest houses until their return and that the Government of Turkey will bear the travel 
costs if they cannot be afforded by the foreigner, his relatives or the relevant consulate or 
embassy.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Future country missions 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Working Group has been informed by the Secretariat that, when extending the 
Group&#8217;s mandate, the Human Rights Council provided for two country visits per year, each visit 
not to exceed eight working days. Three visits of the Working Group have already been accepted 
for 2009 and it conducted three visits in 2004, two in 2005, four in 2006, three in 2007 and four 
in 2008. In order to be able to verify the implementation of its recommendations, the Working 
Group should also be in a position to undertake follow-up visits. 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group considers follow-up visits as an essential element of its mandate, the 
only means to assess and monitor in situ the situation of personal liberty in various countries. 
Furthermore, the Working Group believes that it should conduct further country visits, as they 
are of great importance to victims of arbitrary detention. The usefulness of most of the 
forthcoming visits of the Working Group might be hampered by a limitation to 10 calendar days. 
The abolishment of a number of country mandates further adds to the necessity of answering 
calls from the victims of human rights violations by the thematic mandates.  
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group calls on the Human Rights Council to take into account the fact that 
the Working Group comprises five members. In order to best make use of its potential and 
enable it to discharge its mandate more effectively, the Working Group would request the 
Human Rights Council to provide it with additional funds to be able to conduct at least five 
country visits per year and its relevant follow-up visits within an appropriate time frame. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THEMATIC CONSIDERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Rights of persons deprived of their liberty 
</b></p>
<p>42. It is estimated that many of the 9 million people who are currently imprisoned worldwide 
suffer from violations of their human rights. Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights establishes that &#8220;all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with 
humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person&#8221;, but reality looks 
different in some parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>43. Since its establishment, the Working Group, entrusted with the investigation of instances 
of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily, has visited prisons and detention centres during 
30 country missions, where it has conducted interviews with detained and imprisoned persons. It </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>has reported systematically on some of their plight in its previous annual reports <b>5</b> whenever the 
particular rights issue fell within the ambit of its mandate, or has taken issues up immediately 
with government authorities during country missions. 
</p>
<p>44. Its experience permits the Working Group to present before the Human Rights Council its 
conclusions with a view to cooperate with States more efficiently in the protection of this 
vulnerable group of people. The Working Group has certainly visited prisons and detention 
centres which can be described as exemplary. However, even in these centres, the Working 
Group has at times perceived difficulties in guaranteeing all rights to detained and imprisoned 
people.  
</p>
<p>45. Although article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes that &#8220;no one 
shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile&#8221;, the truth is that an important number of 
persons deprived of their liberty are frequently unable to benefit from legal resources and 
guarantees that they are entitled to for the conduct of their defence as required by law in any 
judicial system and by applicable international human rights instruments. 
</p><p>46. The main element that defines deprivation of liberty is the inability of those who are in 
detention to defend and protect themselves, as their daily life is largely dependent on the 
decisions taken by the staff at the detention facilities. Additionally, and although legal safeguards 
to prevent arbitrary detention from occurring have been adopted by the majority of countries, 
many persons deprived of their liberty have no access to such substantive, procedural and 
institutional guarantees. Most of them do not have the economic means to afford expensive and 
complex legal procedures, especially when legal aid systems are absent or dysfunctional. 
Moreover, the transmission of communications from detention centres may face obstacles and in 
some cases means of communication are inexistent. 
</p>
<p>47. In such an environment, persons deprived of their liberty not only have difficulties in 
verifying the lawfulness of their detention, but also find themselves subjected to a lack of an 
effective control of their other rights. They are at risk of suffering abuse of authority, 
humiliation, ill-treatment and other utterly unacceptable deprivations of rights, practices 
which all run counter to the essential objective of social reintegration set out in paragraphs 65 
and 66 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, approved by the 
Economic and Social Council in its resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) 
of 13 May 1977, and principles 6, 8 and 10 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 45/111 of 14 December 1990. 
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is not the only mechanism aware of the social 
reality in detention centres. Rather, other thematic special procedures, such as the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  For example, in A/HRC/7/4, paras. 55 et seq. (Groups in detention which are susceptible to 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse), A/HRC/4/40, paras. 59 et seq. (Overview of penitentiary systems and the 
conditions of detainees), or E/CN.4/2005/6, paras. 68 et seq<i>. </i>(The negative impact on the right to 
defence of inadequate conditions of detention). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, or the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, frequently visit prisons and 
other detention centres. However, and although a duplication of visits occasionally occurs, at 
present there appears to be no special procedures mandate that could address the full range of 
human rights enjoyed by detainees, and especially their right to rehabilitation, which can 
potentially be violated while in detention. Certainly, there is no special procedure of the Human 
Rights Council whose mandate provides for a global and comprehensive approach to the 
protection of all human rights of all persons deprived of their liberty. In fact, a paradox emerges: 
while important international standards such as the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment 
of Prisoners and the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners provide norms and standards 
on the rights of persons deprived of their liberty, no mechanism which monitors the compliance 
of these standards exists. 
</p>
<p>49. Therefore, and due to the Working Group&#8217;s serious concern regarding the protection of this 
vulnerable group, the Working Group has decided to formally propose to the Human Rights 
Council an expansion of its mandate, to include the monitoring of State compliance with their 
obligations concerning all human rights of detained and imprisoned persons. The mandates of 
the Special Rapporteur on prisons and conditions of detention in Africa of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights as well as of the Rapporteurship on the rights of 
persons deprived of liberty of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights might provide 
some guidance as to the scope of such an extended mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Detentions in the framework of measures countering terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Working Group already expressed, in previous reports, some concerns related to the 
continuing tendency of using deprivation of liberty in the context of States&#8217; legitimate fight 
against terrorism.  
</p>
<p>51. However, as the number of allegations concerning this aspect of the problem is 
skyrocketing and it is expected that this tendency will regrettably remain in future, the Working 
Group considers it justified to reiterate some key elements from the previous reports on the issue 
under examination and incorporate them in the present report. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group considers it necessary to reiterate that some States continue to use 
deprivation of liberty without charges or trial or other applicable procedural guarantees against 
persons accused of terrorist acts in the context of the implementation of criminal policies against 
terrorism, a practice which is contrary to international human rights instruments. The Working 
Group has noticed such practices in numerous cases presented before it in recent years, as well as 
from information received, notably from non-governmental organizations working in the field. 
</p>
<p>53. Therefore, for the time being and notwithstanding further additions, the Working Group 
considers it advisable to set up a list of principles in conformity with articles 9 and 10 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, which may be used in relation to deprivation of liberty of persons 
accused of acts of terrorism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>54. The principles are the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Terrorist activities carried out by individuals shall be considered as punishable 
criminal offences, which shall be sanctioned by applying current and relevant penal and criminal 
procedure laws according to the different legal systems; 
</p>
<p> (b) Resort to administrative detention against suspects of such criminal activities is 
inadmissible; 
</p>
<p> (c) The detention of persons who are suspected of terrorist activities shall be 
accompanied by concrete charges; 
</p>
<p> (d) The persons detained under charges of terrorist acts shall be immediately informed of 
them, and shall be brought before a competent judicial authority, as soon as possible, and no later 
than within a reasonable time period; 
</p>
<p> (e) The persons detained under charges of terrorist activities shall enjoy the effective 
right to habeas corpus following their detention; 
</p>
<p> (f) The exercise of the right to habeas corpus does not impede on the obligation of the 
law enforcement authority responsible for the decision for detention or maintaining the 
detention, to present the detained person before a competent and independent judicial authority 
within a reasonable time period. Such person shall be brought before a competent and 
independent judicial authority, which then evaluates the accusations, the basis of the deprivation 
of liberty, and the continuation of the judicial process; 
 (g) In the development of judgements against them, the persons accused of having 
engaged in terrorist activities shall have a right to enjoy the necessary guarantees of a fair trial, 
access to legal counsel and representation, as well as the ability to present exculpatory evidence 
and arguments under the same conditions as the prosecution, all of which should take place in an 
adversarial process; 
</p>
<p> (h) The persons convicted by a court of having carried out terrorist activities shall have 
the right to appeal against their sentences. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group acknowledges the significant progress made in the promotion and 
protection of human rights in the counter-terrorism context; however, there remains a fragmented 
approach by international bodies to this issue. The Working Group therefore proposes that the 
Human Rights Council consider organizing a special forum, to deliberate and work on common 
positions necessary to guarantee the respect for the right to be free from arbitrary detention in the 
counter-terrorism context. This special forum should give special consideration to the methods 
and framework applied by States, particularly in perceived emergency situations, and will call 
for the participation of representatives of all relevant special procedures and treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Arbitrary detention and corruption 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Working Group has observed, during the various visits conducted, the devastating 
effects caused by corruption on the effective fulfilment of human rights, including the right to be 
free from arbitrary detention.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. As referred to in previous reports, the Working Group could observe throughout the years 
that there has been a notable increase in the number of States that have ratified international 
human rights instruments. These States consequently have introduced in their constitutions and 
national legislation provisions to guarantee the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for persons 
deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>58. Nevertheless, in spite of the increase in formal recognition of human rights instruments, 
implementation of these instruments has not yet reached the desirable level.  
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group has identified, as one main cause for this discrepancy between theory 
and practice, the issue of corruption, which it observed to continue to exist among some officials 
in the police, the judicial, legislative and other State institutions. 
</p><p>60. When police officers, prison administration staff, judicial civil servants, judges, public 
prosecutors and lawyers approach individuals deprived of their liberty varyingly, depending on 
whether or not bribes or other irregular payments or favours have been received, then the whole 
system of guarantees becomes devoid of any content, empty and meaningless; it renders 
defenceless all those who cannot or refuse to pay the amounts that are asked from them and in 
turn further reduces the credibility of the entire system of administration of justice. 
61. The Working Group shares the opinion of those who believe in the necessity of linking the 
fight against corruption with the enjoyment of human rights. The United Nations Convention 
against Corruption, adopted by General Assembly resolution 58/4 of 31 October 2003 and which 
entered into force on 14 December 2005, reflects in its preamble, inter alia, the concerns of State 
parties about &#8220;the seriousness of problems and threats posed by corruption to the stability and 
security of societies, undermining the institutions and values of democracy, ethical values and 
justice and jeopardizing sustainable development and the rule of law&#8221;.  
62. From the viewpoint of the mandate of the Working Group, it is considered that corruption 
can have an enormous consequence on any legal system in that corruption prevents such legal 
systems from being effective instruments for its eradication. 
</p>
<p>63. If there is a legal system perceived to be generally corrupt, it is essential to analyse in the 
first place the underlying root causes facilitating corrupt conduct. They are, without a doubt, 
usually manifold and concurrent. However, the Working Group considers it important, among 
other things, to highlight the following: the absence of a system of information for citizens with 
respect to their rights and a lack of awareness resulting from it; the lack of transparency in 
judicial proceedings due to their obscurity and complexity; and the absence of effective 
instruments to investigate into and redress allegations of corruption which can be approached 
anonymously. 
</p>
<p>64. With a view to the United Nations Convention against Corruption recently entered into 
force, which establishes a comprehensive set of extraordinarily ample measures for the 
prevention and prosecution of corrupt practices, the Working Group calls on States affected by 
this phenomenon to study these measures and seek the implementation of those measures most </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>suitable and adequate for them, in order to eradicate corruption from its system of administration 
of justice. The Working Group calls on those States which have not yet become a party to this 
Convention to ratify, accept, approve or accede to it. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Detention of immigrants in irregular situations 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group has noted with concern, during the period reported upon, a 
development yet again towards tightening restrictions, including deprivation of liberty, applied to 
asylum-seekers, refugees and immigrants in an irregular situation even to the extent of making 
the irregular entry into a State a criminal offence or qualifying the irregular stay in the country as 
an aggravating circumstance for any criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group has also publicly expressed, together with other mandate holders of 
special procedures, its concern regarding a law-making initiative of a regional organization 
comprising mainly receiving countries which would allow concerned States to detain immigrants 
who are in an irregular situation for a period of time of up to 18 months, pending removal. It 
would also be permitted to detain unaccompanied children, victims of human trafficking, and 
other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>67. It was felt that States should be reminded that detention shall be the last resort and 
permissible only for the shortest period of time and that alternatives to detention should be 
sought whenever possible. Grounds for detention must be clearly and exhaustively defined and 
the legality of detention must be open for challenge before a court and regular review within 
fixed time limits. Established time limits for judicial review must even stand in &#8220;emergency 
situations&#8221; when an exceptionally large number of undocumented immigrants enter the territory 
of a State. Provisions should always be made to render detention unlawful if the obstacle for 
identifying immigrants in an irregular situation or carrying out removal from the territory does 
not lie within their sphere, for example, when the consular representation of the country of origin 
does not cooperate or legal considerations - such as the principle of non-refoulement barring 
removal if there is a risk of torture or arbitrary detention in the country of destination - or factual 
obstacles - such as the unavailability of means of transportation - render expulsion impossible. 
</p>
<p>68. In conclusion, the Working Group feels duty bound to reiterate that immigrants in irregular 
situations should not be qualified or treated as criminals and be viewed only from the perspective 
of national security. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Video and audio recording of criminal interrogations 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Working Group is aware of a seemingly recent tendency of various international and 
regional human rights bodies recommending to Governments the installation of video and/or 
audio (recording) equipment in rooms where interrogations related to criminal investigations are 
undertaken. Such recommendations vary with respect to their scope. At times it is advised that 
such equipment be installed in police stations only. In other instances it is proposed to extend the 
measure to investigators&#8217; or prosecutors&#8217; offices, or all rooms where law enforcement authorities 
have relevant competencies. Such recommendations are made to Governments of States 
regarding which there are concerns about confessions obtained under torture or other forms of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment. The purpose of such recommendations is to effectively prevent instances of 
coerced confessions from occurring and to ensure that they will not be admitted as evidence in 
courts during criminal trials. 
</p>
<p>70. Such measures have far-reaching implications, for example, with respect to the right to 
privacy of the suspect, to the possibility of abuses when used during confidential meetings 
between defence counsel and clients, or to costs in relation to effectiveness, also with a view to 
different designs such measures may take. The Working Group feels that the issue warrants 
further study and calls upon Governments and other stakeholders to provide the Working Group 
with relevant information and share experiences made. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Working Group, in the fulfilment of its mandate, welcomes the cooperation it has 
received from States, with regard to the responses by the Governments concerned 
concerning cases brought to their attention. During 2008, the Working Group 
adopted 46 Opinions concerning 183 persons in 22 countries. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Working Group welcomes the invitations extended to it as well as the 
cooperation on the part of Governments. The Working Group conducted four official visits 
in 2008, to Colombia, Italy, Mauritania and Ukraine. Among all the requested country 
visits, the Working Group has received invitations by the Governments of Malta, Senegal 
and the United States of America. The Working Group reiterates its belief that its country 
visits are essential in fulfilling its mandate. For Governments, these visits provide an 
excellent opportunity to show developments and progress in detainees&#8217; rights and the 
respect for human rights, including the crucial right not to be arbitrarily deprived of 
liberty. Further to this, the Working Group considers that future visits and follow-up visits 
are of utmost importance. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group considers the question of detention in the context of 
counter-terrorism. As such, the Working Group considers it necessary to reiterate the 
prominent concern that, in the counter-terrorism context, some States continue to use 
deprivation of liberty without charges or trial or other applicable procedural guarantees 
against persons accused of terrorist acts; a practice the Group considers as contrary to 
international human rights instruments. Specifically, the Working Group considers that 
detained persons suspected of terrorist activities and/or acts shall be immediately informed 
of such charges in line with relevant national legislation; they shall be brought before a 
competent judicial authority; and they shall enjoy the effective right to habeas corpus. The 
Working Group deems it appropriate to put forward a list of principles in conformity with 
articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and articles 9 and 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which may be used in the context of 
measures countering terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group considers that, among other factors, corruption is detrimental to 
the rule of law and on the effective fulfilment of human rights, including the right to be free 
from arbitrary detention. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The Working Group feels bound to reiterate that detention shall be the last resort 
and permissible only for the shortest period of time, and that alternatives to detention shall 
be sought whenever possible, all of which particularly concern the deprivation of liberty 
applied to asylum-seekers, refugees and irregular migrants. Furthermore, the Working 
Group feels that immigrants in irregular situations should not be qualified or treated as 
criminals and viewed only from the perspective of national security.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Finally, the Working Group considers it most useful to reiterate its concern over the 
deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily, and that a still important number of persons are 
frequently unable to benefit from legal resources and guarantees to which they are entitled 
for the conduct of their defence by law and by applicable human rights instruments. 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Working Group requests the Human Rights Council to adopt a resolution or 
decision to provide additional funds for the Working Group to enable it to conduct at least 
five country visits per year and relevant follow-up visits. This would put the Working 
Group in a position to best use its potential as a group of five members and to discharge its 
mandate more effectively. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Working Group proposes to the Human Rights Council to expand the mandate 
of the Working Group so as to include the monitoring of State compliance with their 
obligations concerning all human rights of detained and imprisoned persons. The mandates 
of the Special Rapporteur on prisons and conditions of detention in Africa of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights as well as of the Rapporteurship on the rights 
of persons deprived of liberty of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights might 
provide some guidance as to the scope of such extended mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Working Group proposes that the Human Rights Council consider organizing a 
special forum, to deliberate and work on common positions necessary to guarantee the 
respect for the right to be free from arbitrary detention in the counter-terrorism context. 
This special forum should give special consideration to the methods and framework 
applied by States, particularly in perceived emergency situations and will call for the 
participation of representatives of all relevant special procedures and treaty bodies.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Working Group recommends to States to take duly into account the principles 
contained in the present report with respect to deprivation of liberty in the context of 
measures countering terrorism and review their legislation and practice in the light of these 
principles. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Working Group calls on those States which have not yet become a party to the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption to ratify, accept, approve or accede to it. It 
further calls on all States to study the set of measures contained in this Convention for the 
prevention and prosecution of corrupt practices and to seek the implementation of those 
measures most suitable and adequate for their efforts in combating arbitrary detention. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>With regard to detention of immigrants in an irregular situation the Working Group 
reminds States that detention should be the last resort, and is permissible only for the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>shortest period of time. Alternatives to detention must be sought whenever possible. 
Grounds for detention must be clearly and exhaustively defined and the legality of 
detention must be open for challenge before a court and regular review within fixed time 
limits. Provisions should always be made to render detention unlawful if the obstacle for 
identifying immigrants in an irregular situation or carrying out removal from the territory

country of origin does not cooperate or legal considerations - such as the principle of 
non-refoulement barring removal if there is a risk of torture or arbitrary detention in the 
country of destination - or factual obstacles, such as the unavailability of means of 
transportation - render expulsion impossible.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Finally, the Working Group requests States and other stakeholders to provide the 
Group with information and share their experiences regarding the installation of video 
and/or audio (recording) equipment in rooms where interrogations related to criminal 
investigations are conducted. The Working Group has taken note of a seemingly recent 
tendency of international and regional human rights bodies recommending to States the 
implementation of such measures to prevent the extraction of confessions under torture or 
other forms of ill-treatment and their admission as evidence in criminal trials. It considers 
that the issue warrants further study.
