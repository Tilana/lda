<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> <i>in particular</i> by the increase in enforced or involuntary 
disappearances in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, 
when these are part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number 
of reports concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of 
disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the Convention sets out the right of victims to know the truth 
regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and the result of 
the investigation and the fate of the disappeared person, and sets forth State party 
obligations to take appropriate measures in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with interest </i>of the general comment of the Working Group on the right 
to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances,  
</p>

against humanity, as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,  
</p>

disappearances as a crime of a continuous nature and, in this regard, recalling the relevant 
provisions of the Convention and the Declaration,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the decision of the General Assembly to declare 30 August International 
Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances and its call upon Member States, the 
United Nations system and other international and regional organizations, as well as civil 
society, to observe this day,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that many Governments have cooperated with the Working Group,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her

</p>
<p> 1.  <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance to 
consider doing so as a matter of priority, and to consider as well the option provided for in 
articles 31 and 32 of the Convention regarding the Committee on Enforced Disappearances;  
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Notes</i> that 2012 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the 
General Assembly of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, and encourages all States to translate the Declaration into their languages in

due consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this issue made by the Working 
Group in its reports;  
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Encourages</i> the Working Group, in accordance with its working methods, to 
continue to provide concerned States with relevant and detailed information concerning 
allegations of enforced disappearances in order to facilitate a prompt and substantive 
response to these communications without prejudice to the need for concerned States to 
cooperate with the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Notes with concern</i> that, according to the Working Group, it has insufficient 
resources to effectively exercise its mandate, particularly in relation to human resources, 
where there is an acute need,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/16/48, para. 585. </footnote> and requests the Secretary-General to provide the assistance
