<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  On 27 March 2012, pursuant to its resolution 18/23, the Human Rights Council held 
</p>
<p>a high-level interactive panel discussion to highlight, examine and suggest ways in which 
</p>
<p>sport and major sporting events, in particular the Olympic and Paralympic Games, can be 
</p>
<p>used to promote awareness and understanding of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the application of the principles enshrined therein. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 18/23, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to liaise with relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures, States and other stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and 
</p>
<p>agencies, with a view to ensuring their participation in the above-mentioned panel 
</p>
<p>discussion. It also requested OHCHR to prepare a summary on the high-level discussion. 
</p>
<p>The present summary was prepared pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p>3. The objectives of the panel were to discuss how to harness the vast potential of the 
</p>
<p>Olympic and Paralympic Games and other major sporting events to raise awareness of the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights among more people than ever before; to reinforce 
</p>
<p>educative messages about the power of sport to bring about positive change (in this context, 
</p>
<p>the focus was on exploring synergies between Olympic values and the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights); and to explore the feasibility of putting in place a process on 
</p>
<p>which the hosts of future Olympic events might build in order to reinforce such underlying 
</p>
<p>concepts as universality, non-discrimination and equality, which underpin both the Olympic 
</p>
<p>spirit and human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The panel discussion was moderated by the Minister of State for the Foreign and 
</p>
<p>Commonwealth Office, Jeremy Browne (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland). An opening statement was delivered by the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights. The panellists were the Deputy Chairperson of the London 2012 
</p>
<p>Organizing Committee, Sir Keith Mills; the , President of Rio 2016, , Carlos Nuzman and 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Ombudsman and President of the Russian Paralympic Committee, 
</p>
<p>Vladimir Lukin, 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights and contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>6.  In her opening address, the High Commissioner stated that sport had been 
</p>
<p>acknowledged as a vehicle for peace and human development in several key United Nations 
</p>
<p>documents and declarations, in particular, the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 the 
</p>
<p>2005 World Summit Outcome2 and the outcome document of the High-level Plenary 
</p>
<p>Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals.3  
</p>
<p>7. In reference to the Olympic Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner underlined the fact that sport and human rights share many 
</p>
<p>fundamental values and objectives, but noted, nevertheless that it was surprising how little 
</p>
<p>interaction there had been to date between the human rights movement, mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>institutions and the world of sports.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  General Assembly resolution 55/2. 
</p>
<p> 2  General Assembly resolution 60/1. 
</p>
<p> 3  General Assembly resolution 65/1. </p>


<p>8. The High Commissioner highlighted the fact that practicing sports contributes 
</p>
<p>greatly to the development and empowerment of human beings, perhaps most of all to that 
</p>
<p>of children, because it can build self-confidence, develop social, educational and physical 
</p>
<p>skills and teach respect for such key human rights principles as non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p>equality, accountability and participation. She stressed that sport was also a tremendous 
</p>
<p>public health instrument and was, for instance, an exceptional platform to raise public 
</p>
<p>awareness of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. Moreover, sport had historically 
</p>
<p>been a powerful tool for the empowerment of social or marginalized groups, such as girls 
</p>
<p>and women, minorities, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner added that, in many countries struggling with poverty or conflict, sport had 
</p>
<p>assisted greatly in building development and peace; she referred in this regard to the 
</p>
<p>demobilization process of child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where children from 
</p>
<p>opposing factions had been integrated in rehabilitation centres and placed in mixed football 
</p>
<p>teams. 
</p>
<p>9. Given the unique media attention attracted, the Olympic and Paralympic Games had 
</p>
<p>an enormous potential to promote awareness and understanding of human rights. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner therefore encouraged the host organizers of the upcoming Olympic Games 
</p>
<p>in London and Rio de Janeiro, and on the sites of Sochi in the Russian Federation and 
</p>
<p>PyeongChang in the Republic of Korea, to pay special attention to the promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights, for instance, through varied promotional activities and campaigns. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner stressed that, given the impact of such mega-events, it was essential that 
</p>
<p>human rights implications be duly considered at all stages and by all actors involved. She 
</p>
<p>referred specifically to housing rights in this regard. 
</p>
<p>10. Like any social activity, sport could also have potentially negative side effects. The 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner therefore recommended that measures should be taken to prevent sport 
</p>
<p>becoming a source of human rights violations. She stated that the International Olympic 
</p>
<p>Committee must assume the moral leadership to ensure that human rights norms are fully 
</p>
<p>integrated and respected in the sporting world. She also called on all international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, especially the relevant special procedures mechanisms of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council and the treaty bodies, to look carefully and systematically at the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights in the context of sports.  
</p>
<p>11. The moderator, Jeremy Browne, stressed the importance of making a connection 
</p>
<p>between the values embodied by the Human Rights Council and those by the Olympic 
</p>
<p>Games. Indeed, the principles underpinning the Olympic Charter, such as non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and equality, were also the bedrock of human rights. He stated that the 
</p>
<p>Olympic Games were not just a celebration of sport; they were a celebration of shared 
</p>
<p>humanity. Billions had watched the previous Beijing Games and it would be important for 
</p>
<p>the London Games to harness this attention to demonstrate the wider economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural agenda that the Games stand for. 
</p>
<p>12. Sir Mills underlined the importance that the meeting reflect on the role of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and the Olympic Games in these difficult times, and stated the 
</p>
<p>importance of growing cooperation between the United Nations and the Olympic Games. 
</p>
<p>He recalled that, in 1948, when the Olympics were last held in London, the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights was also adopted. It was also then that the first competition 
</p>
<p>for war veterans with spinal cord injuries was held, which meant the start of what was to 
</p>
<p>become the Paralympics.  
</p>
<p>13. Sir Mills stated that sport could be the answer to all questions, but was an agent that 
</p>
<p>could be used to spread human rights across the world in this era of globalization. He 
</p>
<p>illustrated how London was building on this platform to generate long-term change by 
</p>
<p>using sport as an ambassador for peace, and also as a catalyst for transformation and 
</p>
<p>opportunities for the young. He highlighted how the Olympic truce had been a core concept </p>


<p>of the Olympics Games since ancient Greece, and referred in this regard to how the truce 
</p>
<p>had allowed for vaccination during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. He underlined the 
</p>
<p>fact that the Olympic truce resolution of the United Kingdom was aimed at building 
</p>
<p>friendship and cooperation between nations and to develop long-term economic 
</p>
<p>development. He furthermore presented examples of how schools around the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom had used the truce to address issues ranging from bullying to gang culture, and 
</p>
<p>illustrated how a number of poor areas in East London had benefited from the Olympic 
</p>
<p>Games and been transformed into vibrant neighbourhoods.  
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Nuzman expressed the commitment to the promotion of human rights in all its 
</p>
<p>aspects. He explained how Brazil, as a country enjoying economic stability, had taken an 
</p>
<p>extensive number of initiatives in preparation for the Olympic Games. Brazil has adopted 
</p>
<p>the Rio Master Plan, which included a number of urban development projects, such as 
</p>
<p>training centres, a high-performance transport ring and the refurbishment of a number of 
</p>
<p>existing facilities. He also explained how the objective was to bring these projects to all 
</p>
<p>favelas in order to promote social inclusion and enhance urban dwelling in those areas, by 
</p>
<p>providing essential services such as rain drainage, paving and public lighting. Mr. Nuzman 
</p>
<p>added that, in the event that individuals and families had to be relocated, a step-by-step 
</p>
<p>resettlement procedure would facilitate the transition to a better situation for those involved. 
</p>
<p>In closing, Mr. Nuzman stressed that sport was a catalyst for key issues and a real 
</p>
<p>opportunity for transformation and for creating a legacy of peace. 
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Lukin stated that, while the Universal Declaration of Human Rights did not refer 
</p>
<p>to sports or to the Olympics, the principles that underpinned it were nonetheless in line with 
</p>
<p>the Olympic Charter. He cautioned that, although sports might be perceived as aggressive, 
</p>
<p>this was not the case in reality. He recommended that States should strengthen education 
</p>
<p>programmes to generate tolerance and respect for others. The International Olympic 
</p>
<p>Committee had an important role to play in supporting human rights. Mr. Lukin stressed 
</p>
<p>that practicing sports was a human right and that everyone should have the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>engage in it without discrimination. Sport was, moreover, an essential element of the 
</p>
<p>fundamental right to health and should be considered an urgent issue for the world 
</p>
<p>community to tackle. 
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Lukin also referred to the situation in the Russian Federation, where the 
</p>
<p>introduction of criminal liability for doping use, in addition to the application of a 
</p>
<p>suspension, was currently being considered. The Paralympics in Sochi would be a 
</p>
<p>locomotive for change and provide impetus for more and better facilities for the disabled, 
</p>
<p>making the city a place of active recreation for persons with disabilities. Mr. Lukin 
</p>
<p>concluded by stating that the Olympic Games should be no place for politicization.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>17. States and observers pointed out that sport had a major impact on domestic policies 
</p>
<p>and was a source of inspiration. Reference was made to the importance of sport in 
</p>
<p>achieving the Millennium Development Goals and in the promotion of sustainable 
</p>
<p>development and peace. Emphasis was also put on the need to ensure easy mobility for all 
</p>
<p>sports teams. It was stressed that the principles of non-discrimination and equality were 
</p>
<p>ideal tools for social, human and intellectual development. It was suggested that sports 
</p>
<p>activities be provided for persons with disabilities, including in schools, and that sufficient 
</p>
<p>resources be allocated to ensure their effective participation in sport through any physical 
</p>
<p>and linguistic means possible. Other recommendations from States and observers concerned 
</p>
<p>the need to prevent the exclusion of women in sport, to counter discrimination against 
</p>
<p>women and girls in sports clubs, and for all countries to include women in their Olympic 
</p>
<p>delegations.  </p>


<p>18. Questions raised concerned the contribution of the Olympics to the promotion of 
</p>
<p>anti-discrimination policies and to boosting tolerance, the link between the Olympic Games 
</p>
<p>and the Millennium Development Goals, the impact of the Paralympics on persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, ways and means of involving the human rights machinery in the holding of 
</p>
<p>such events, involving all countries and not only the host country in the preparations, 
</p>
<p>facilitating the sharing of good practices on addressing concerns in terms of climate and 
</p>
<p>sustainability, and whether participation should be limited to those countries that do not 
</p>
<p>openly discriminate. Specific questions regarding the London Olympic Games asked how 
</p>
<p>the organizing committee had chosen the legacy projects to be pursued and whether it had 
</p>
<p>performed an ethical evaluation of the companies it had chosen to contract.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Comments and replies by the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>19. Sir Mills replied that the International Olympic Committee was working hard to deal 
</p>
<p>with discrimination against women and girls in sports, and pointed out that progress had 
</p>
<p>been made in a number of countries. He also reported that the Committee had undertaken a 
</p>
<p>substantive due diligence test with regard to companies hired in the organization of the 
</p>
<p>Olympic Games. 
</p>
<p>20. Mr. Nuzman stated that Brazil had created an interministerial group to follow up on 
</p>
<p>progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and referred in particular to 
</p>
<p>advances in reducing poverty. He also underlined the fact that the International Olympic 
</p>
<p>Committee only concluded partnerships with organizations whose work it believed was in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the values of the Olympic movement. 
</p>
<p>21. Mr. Lukin referred to the issue of discrimination against women and girls, and added 
</p>
<p>that the problem had to be seen in a broader context, including, for instance, the non-
</p>
<p>participation of men in artistic sports. He also stressed the need to dedicate attention to 
</p>
<p>important environmental problems. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion by the moderator  
</b></p>
<p>22. The moderator welcomed the timeliness of a discussion on this important issue and 
</p>
<p>thanked the panellists and participants for their contributions before closing the meeting.  
</p>
