 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/29 of 14 December 2007, the Human Rights Council extended the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health (the right to health) for an additional three years. At its seventh 
session held in June 2008, the Human Rights Council nominated Mr. Anand Grover (India) as 
the Special Rapporteur. He assumed his duties on 1 August 2008, succeeding Mr. Paul Hunt 
whose six-year tenure expired on 31 July 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with his mandate, the Special Rapporteur will continue to further develop 
cooperation with relevant national and international actors such as Governments, national human 
rights institutions, United Nations treaty bodies, international institutions, different agencies and 
programmes and independent experts, as well as health professionals, academics, civil society 
organizations, community-based organizations of affected peoples and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would also like to develop close cooperation with relevant 
government bodies to help them identify policies and programmes which promote the enjoyment 
of the right to health. In this context, he underlines the importance of including rights holders, 
particularly communities, in decision-making processes as they can offer a vast and diverse 
perspective to various issues central to the right to health. He will therefore consult with affected 
communities and concerned stakeholders around common goals to ensure the constant progress 
of the enjoyment of the right to health. 
4. The Special Rapporteur intends to continue to promote, and encourage others to promote, 
the right to health. Recognizing the work done in unpacking the issues relating to the right to 
health and understanding the relation between health and human rights,<b>1</b> he envisages further 
developing the rights-based approach and the principles of equality, non-discrimination and 
participation in the context of the right to health. The Special Rapporteur also aims to identify 
best practices for the operationalization of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>5. In this report, the Special Rapporteur explores the impact of the Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and &#8220;TRIPS plus&#8221; standards on 
access to medicines within the broader framework of the right to health. The Special Rapporteur 
commends the work done by the former Special Rapporteur on the right to health and the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on trade and intellectual 
property issues relevant to the right to health.<b>2</b> He found these reports highlighted the need for 
TRIPS flexibilities to be implemented and noted the adverse impacts of free trade agreements 
(FTAs) on access to medicines. The full use of TRIPS flexibilities can help countries meet their 
obligations to protect, promote and fulfil the right to health by improving access to affordable 
</p>
<p>

<p>medicines. The Special Rapporteur notes however, that use of TRIPS flexibilities has been 
variable and that there are growing instances of developing countries and least developed 
countries (LDCs) adopting TRIPS-plus standards that may have an adverse affect on the right to 
health. He therefore highlights the need to revisit trade-related agreements in light of their impact 
on the right to health and in particular on access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>6. After taking up his duties in August 2008, the Special Rapporteur had fruitful discussions 
with a number of State representatives, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint 
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Populations Fund 
(UNFPA) officials and several civil society organizations. The Special Rapporteur also had the 
opportunity to exchange views with members of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. He hopes to continue such exchanges with other United Nations 
treaty bodies in the future. 
</p>
<p>7. Since August 2008, the Special Rapporteur has participated in numerous consultations and 
conferences on the right to health. These include the International AIDS Conference in Mexico 
City, the symposium co-organized by the International Federation of Health and Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Centre of Essex University and hosted by the British Medical Association 
in London, the International Strategy Meeting on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
organized by ESCR-NET, in Nairobi, consultations on the draft principles on extreme poverty 
and human rights in Geneva, a consultation on the right to health in Brazil organized by 
Conectas, and the fourteenth World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Mumbai. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE RIGHT TO THE HIGHEST ATTAINABLE STANDARD OF HEALTH 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to health, enshrined in numerous international and regional human rights treaties 
and in many national constitutions,<b>3</b> is an inclusive right, extending not only to timely and 
appropriate health care, but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to clean 
water and sanitation, adequate housing and nutrition as well as social determinants such as 
gender, racial and ethnic discrimination and disparities. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, if integrated into national and international health 
policymaking, the right to health can help establish laws, policies and practices that are 
sustainable, equitable, meaningful and responsive to the needs of those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>10. In recent years, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, WHO and 
many others have developed an analysis of the right to health to make it easier to understand 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The right to health was first addressed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It 
</p>
<p>is established under article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and is also well recognized in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and apply to health-related laws, policies, programmes and practices.<b>4</b> Key elements 
of the analytical framework relevant to this report include the propositions that: 
</p>
<p> (a) All health services, goods and facilities shall be available, accessible, acceptable and 
of good quality. In the context of access to medicines this requires States to ensure that 
medicines are available, accessible, culturally acceptable, and of good quality; 
</p>
<p> (b) States have a duty to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health reaffirms the framework as it adopts the aforesaid key elements of 
the right to health. In this regard, medical care in the event of sickness, as well as the prevention, 
treatment and control of diseases, are central features of the right to health. These features 
depend upon access to medicines. Therefore, access to medicines forms an indispensable part of 
the right to health.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>11. States have an obligation under the right to health to ensure that medicines are available, 
financially affordable, and physically accessible on a basis of non-discrimination to everyone 
within their jurisdiction. Developed States also have a responsibility to take steps towards the 
full realization of the right to health through international assistance and cooperation.<b>6</b> Moreover, 
all States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have a 
legal obligation not to interfere with the rights conferred under the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the Covenant, including the right to health.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  State of health and access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p>12. Health trends indicate that despite progress made in the last 30 years, massive inequalities 
remain in access to health services and medicines around the world.<b>8</b> &#8220;Diseases of poverty&#8221; 
(i.e. communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional diseases) still account for 50 per cent of

<p>the burden of disease in developing countries, nearly ten times higher than in developed 
countries.<b>9</b> There has been a resurgence of tuberculosis and malaria in the last decade:<b>10</b> 
58 per cent of malaria cases occur in the poorest 20 per cent of the world population and each 
year there are nearly 529,000 maternal deaths.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>13. The state of health correlates significantly with poverty. Public health spending in both 
high and low income countries benefits the rich more than the poor. People with the most means 
and often with less need consume the most care, while those with the least means and most need 
consume the least care.<b>12</b> Over 100 million people fall into poverty annually because they have to 
pay for health care.<b>13</b> In developing countries, patients themselves pay for 50-90 per cent of 
essential medicines.<b>14</b> A report from WHO and Health Action International on the results of 
surveys undertaken in 36 countries reported that in the public sector only one third of essential 
medicines needed were available and in the private sector only two thirds of such medicines 
were available.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Nearly 2 billion people lack access to essential medicines.<b>16</b> Improving access to medicines 
could save 10 million lives a year, 4 million in Africa and South East Asia.<b>17</b> The inability of 
populations to access medicines is partly due to high costs.<b>18</b> In the context of HIV, as of 2007, 
only 31 per cent of people living with HIV who needed treatment received it.<b>19</b> Furthermore, it is

</p>
<p>estimated that people living with HIV will become resistant to their first-line medicine regimens 
and will need second-line treatment which can currently cost  between 9 and 19 times as much as 
first-line medicines. 
</p>
<p>15. Accessibility of medicines has different dimensions.<b>20</b> This report specifically considers 
the dimension of financial affordability. In this regard intellectual property (IP) laws as they 
impact on the affordability of medicines can have a significant bearing on access to medicines.<b>21 
</b></p>
<p>16. Current health inequalities regarding access to medicines demonstrate the need for States 
to respect their obligations under international law to protect the right to health. This includes 
ensuring that their laws and practices, including those related to IP, take into consideration the 
right to health and the need to ensure access to affordable medicines to all. This report highlights 
some measures that States can take to ensure that their national IP regimes protect the right to 
health. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Intellectual property laws and access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p>17. IP law has an impact on the right to health, as it protects pharmaceutical products. It 
regulates the creation, use and exploitation of mental or creative labour and encompasses 
copyright, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, layout designs of integrated 
circuits, patents and their designs, undisclosed information and trade secrets. 
</p>
<p>18. Patents confer legal rights on inventors, more importantly negative rights over process or 
product inventions. Patentees can, therefore, prevent persons not authorized by them from 
making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the patented invention. Patents create 
monopolies, limit competition and allow patentees to establish high prices. While product 
patents confer absolute monopolies, process patents lead to relative monopolies.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>19. In regard to medicines, a product patent enables a patentee to set high prices. Higher 
standards of patent protection, which can reduce the number of easily granted patents, can 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  Accessibility has four dimensions; first, medicines must be accessible in all parts of the 
</p>
<p>country; second, medicines must be affordable to all, including those living in poverty; third, 
medicines must be accessible without discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds; fourth, 
reliable information about medicines must be accessible to patients and health professionals for 
them to take well-informed decisions (A/61/338, para. 49). 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  Intellectual property laws can also affect medical research and this can bear upon access to 
medicines. The Commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH) has 
noted that, &#8220;There is no evidence that the implementation of the TRIPS agreement in developing 
countries will significantly boost R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals on Type II, and particularly Type III 
diseases. Insufficient market incentives are the decisive factor.&#8221; See footnote 9 above, p. 85.  
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  Product patents can create absolute monopolies as they can restrict use of a product. Process 
patents only restrict the use of the patented process and therefore a generic version of the product 
could be made using an alternative process. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>facilitate competition and lower the prices of medicines. Lower standards of patent protection, 
however, which can increase the number of easily granted patents can lead to higher prices. 
Generic competition in the field of pharmaceuticals has the potential to significantly lower prices 
and increase access. 
</p>
<p>20. The example of HIV medicines is particularly illustrative. In 2001, when the HIV crisis 
was at its peak and the need for antiretrovirals (ARVs) was the most acute, it was the availability 
of cheaper generic ARVs from developing countries that led to a reduction in prices from over 
US$ 10,000 per patient per year to less than US$ 350 per patient per year for a first-line 
combination therapy.<b>23</b> Today generic competition has helped reduce prices of first generation 
ARVs by more than 99 per cent.<b>24</b> The availability of generic medicines from developing 
countries like Brazil, India, South Africa and Thailand has exerted a downward pressure on 
prices and increased the range of affordable options for national treatment programmes.<b>25</b> 
Generic manufacturers have also been able to produce fixed-dose combinations of ARVs, which 
are easier to administer and use in developing countries and LDCs, including some combinations 
that are not available from patentees.<b>26</b> The importance of generic medicines continues to be 
underscored today by their prominence in international medicine supply programmes. 
</p>
<p>21. However, the continued supply of generic medicines is now in doubt. For developing 
countries including those that manufacture and supply generic medicines, the deadline for TRIPS 
compliance and the introduction of product patents came in 2005. With this deadline, there is 
concern that the ability of companies to patent new pharmaceutical products on a near-global 
scale could inhibit further competition and prevent the price reductions needed to make 
antiretroviral therapy more widely available.<b>27</b> For instance, several developing countries and 
LDCs expressed concerns to WHO that future, generic ARVs would not be available from India 
after 2005.<b>28</b> This issue is valid for medicines for other diseases as well. Even where some 
countries are able to continue to manufacture generic medicines, TRIPS implementation in other 
countries may make it difficult to import these medicines.

<p>22. With growing concern over TRIPS implementation and its impact on access to medicines, 
several initiatives have been launched in recent years by countries, the private sector, charitable 
foundations and non-governmental organizations to increase access to existing medicines. 
However, these initiatives have not been sufficient to surmount the challenge of ensuring access 
to medicines.<b>29</b> Developing countries and LDCs should be enabled to take steps to modulate the 
implementation of TRIPS on access to medicines including by encouraging competition and 
being able to access affordable generic versions of patented medicines. The next section of the 
report discusses TRIPS and more particularly the flexibilities that can enable developing 
countries and LDCs in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>II. AGREEMENT ON TRADE-RELATED ASPECTS OF 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (TRIPS) 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>23. TRIPS came into force along with the establishment of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) in 1995. It was one of the most controversial agreements, as developed countries pushed 
for extensive IP protection and the harmonization of IP norms.<b>30</b> Developing countries argued 
that extensive IP standards would hinder their development prospects as they were not 
well-equipped to reap the benefits of such standards. Developing countries eventually gave way, 
under the pressure of developed countries as they were ultimately dependent on them for trade. It 
has to be noted, however, that TRIPS was a compromise. The ultimate goal of developed 
countries was and is the universal harmonization of IP laws according to their standards. 
Therefore, post-TRIPS, they have continued to push for standards of IP protection through 
various free trade and multilateral trade agreements, which conform to standards in their 
countries. 
</p>
<p>24. TRIPS establishes minimum global standards for all major IP rights and sets rules for their 
enforcement.<b>31</b> It marks a departure from the Paris Convention of 1883 as it ignores diversity of 
national needs and establishes patent protection for a minimum term of 20 years. The Paris 
Convention, and the subsequent agreements that built upon it, only required signatory States to 
adhere to the principles of non-discrimination, national treatment and priority. It gave countries 
sufficient flexibility to adapt their IP regime in light of their socio-economic needs and 
objectives and allowed States to exclude strategic sectors, such as the pharmaceutical and 
agrochemical industries, from patentability and to determine the length of protection. TRIPS is 
binding on all WTO member States and is legally enforceable through the Dispute Settlement 
Body, backed by sanctions. For most developing countries and LDCs, TRIPS implementation

 <p> 
</p>
<p>requires them to update their IP standards, which in turn involves a complex set of reforms to 
redraft and update existing laws.<b>32</b> It also requires considerable increase in the financial and 
human resources allocated to IP issues.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  TRIPS flexibilities and their implementation 
</b></p>
<p>25. TRIPS provides flexibilities that WTO member States can use. Article 1 establishes the 
core principle that member States can determine the appropriate method for implementing 
TRIPS within their own legal system and practice. Furthermore, the objectives and principles of 
TRIPS emphasize the balance of rights and obligations and provide the basis for countries to 
utilize the flexibilities and adopt IP protection at the national level to meet their social and 
developmental needs. Article 8 specifically provides that member States may, in formulating or 
amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health. The 
Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health (Doha Declaration) adopted by the WTO 
Ministerial Conference in 2001 recognized concerns over the effect of IP on medicine prices and 
reaffirmed the right of member States to use TRIPS flexibilities to achieve public health needs 
and promote access to medicines for all. 
</p>
<p>26. Countries have varied in the extent to which they have implemented TRIPS flexibilities. 
While some countries lack sufficient awareness about the full use of flexibilities and have 
limited technical capacity to implement them, others have not sufficiently streamlined their 
patent laws to facilitate use. Furthermore, pressure from developed countries has played a 
prominent role in shaping the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in developing countries and 
LDCs.

<p>27. From a right to health perspective, developing countries and LDCs should be enabled to 
use TRIPS flexibilities. More particularly, their national laws should incorporate the flexibility 
to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Make full use of the transition periods; 
</p>
<p> (b) Define the criteria of patentability; 
</p>
<p> (c) Issue compulsory licences and provide for government use; 
</p>
<p> (d) Adopt the international exhaustion principle, to facilitate parallel importation; 
</p>
<p> (e) Create limited exceptions to patent rights; 
</p>
<p> (f) Allow for opposition and revocation procedures. 
</p>
<p>In addition, countries need to have strong pro-competitive measures to limit abuse of the patent 
system.

<p><b>1.  Transition periods 
</b></p>
<p>28. TRIPS grants member States different deadlines for implementation depending on their 
level of economic development. Developing countries had until 2000 to comply with TRIPS. 
Countries that did not grant product patent protection in certain areas of technology, such as 
India, Egypt and Brazil, had an additional five years to comply with TRIPS with respect to those 
areas of technology. LDCs had until January 2006 to implement TRIPS, which was extended to 
1 July 2013. With respect to medicines, the Doha Declaration granted LDCs an extension 
to 2016. 
</p>
<p>29. The potential of the full use of the transition period to increase access to medicines is 
demonstrated in the case of India which has become a global supplier of affordable generic 
medicines.<b>34</b> This is primarily due to the fact that in the early 1970s, India eliminated product 
patent protection for medicines and only preserved process patent protection, thus encouraging 
the growth of the domestic pharmaceutical industry specializing in the production of generic 
versions of medicines that were patented in developed counties. This catapulted India from a 
country importing most of its medicines at extremely high prices to a country that has become 
one of the most important exporters of affordable life-saving medicines to the developing world. 
</p>
<p>30. While some developing countries such as India made full use of this transition period by 
providing product patent protection only in 2005 on the expiry of their TRIPS deadline, others 
such as Brazil introduced product patent protection for medicines before their respective 
deadlines. Several LDCs also complied with TRIPS before their deadlines. Twelve francophone 
LDCs, for example, brought their legislative standards substantially in line with TRIPS by 2002, 
11 years ahead of their 2013 deadline.<b>35</b> Furthermore, at the time of the Doha Declaration, all but 
three (Angola, Ghana, and Malawi) of the 25 African member States already had laws which 
approved patents for medicines.<b>36</b> Cambodia and Nepal appear to be the only LDCs to have 
excluded pharmaceutical products from patentability until 2016.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p>31. The importance of the transition period is underscored by the fact that the absence of 
product patents on medicines can, help establish local manufacturing capacity, promote generic 
manufacturing and facilitate the import of affordable medicines from other countries. 
Developing countries that have been successful in the use of the transition period in any of these 
</p>

promote access to medicines?&#8221;, CIPIH, World Health Organization, 2006 pp. 13-15. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>respects may present good examples for LDCs to consider in adapting to their own needs and 
circumstances. LDCs should also consider seeking further extensions of the transition period, as 
provided by article 66, paragraph 1, of TRIPS. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Patentable subject matter 
</b>32. Article 27, paragraph 1, of TRIPS requires patents to be available for inventions that are 
&#8220;new, involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application&#8221;. It does not define 
these patentability criteria. Therefore, member States have the freedom to define each criteria 
according to their needs. Countries apply different standards to each of these criteria, either 
statutorily or through judicial development. While countries that apply a low level of 
patentability standards allow patents to be granted easily, those that provide higher patentability 
standards allow for patents only on genuine inventions. 
</p>
<p>33. Furthermore, article 27 allows member States to exclude certain categories of inventions 
from patentability. Thus, they can exclude from patentability those inventions whose commercial 
exploitation is detrimental to human life or health. They can also exclude diagnostic, therapeutic 
and surgical methods for treatment of humans from patentability. TRIPS does not provide an 
exhaustive list of permissible exclusions allowing countries to exclude certain categories of 
inventions in order to protect public health. 
</p>
<p>34. From a right to health perspective, the &#8220;evergreening&#8221; of patents by pharmaceutical 
companies is of particular concern. Evergreening refers to the practice of obtaining new patents 
on a patented medicine by making minor changes to it.<b>38</b> For example, patents are obtained on 
new uses, forms, combinations and formulations of known medicines in a bid to extend the 
period of the patentee&#8217;s monopoly. Such evergreening delays the entry of competitive generic 
medicines into the market. 
</p>
<p>35. The freedom to set high patentability criteria and exclude certain inventions is an important 
tool that countries can use to address evergreening and ensure that patents are granted only to 
genuine inventions in the pharmaceutical field. Thus, countries can deny patents on new uses, 
forms, formulations or combinations of known medicines. India and the Philippines for example, 
exclude from patentability new forms of known substances unless they are significantly more 
efficacious and new (or second) uses and combinations of known substances.<b>39</b> If implemented 
properly, this can help limit evergreening tactics. Reducing the number of patents granted on 
medicines can limit the impact of patents on access to medicines and facilitate the early entry of 
generic competition.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Compulsory licensing and government use 
</b></p>
<p>36. Compulsory licensing derives from article 31 of TRIPS. It enables member States to 
license the use of a patented invention for itself or a third party &#8220;without authorization&#8221; of the 
patentee. Although TRIPS places some restrictions on compulsory licences, member States are 
free to determine the grounds upon which to issue a compulsory licence, which can include: 
(a) refusal to license; (b) public interest; (c) public health and nutrition; (d) national emergency 
or situation of extreme urgency; (e) anti-competitive practices; (f) dependent patents; and 
(g) failure to exploit or insufficiency of working.<b>40</b> Member States also have the freedom to 
establish new grounds as they deem appropriate. 
</p>
<p>37. Paragraph 5 (b) of the Doha Declaration specifically reaffirmed the right of member States 
to determine the grounds for issuing compulsory licences. Countries are free to provide grounds 
to protect public health and promote access to medicines for all. TRIPS does not restrict the use 
of compulsory licences to situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme 
urgency, or to cases of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. As such, the issuance of compulsory 
licences by Thailand on heart disease, cancer and HIV medicines is in compliance with TRIPS.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Government use is a species of compulsory licence, which allows the use of a patented 
invention by or for a government for a public non-commercial use. Countries can issue such 
licences to third parties to make patented medicines for governments in order to make the 
medicines available to the public. The expression &#8220;public non-commercial purpose&#8221; is not 
defined and countries have the freedom to define and implement such use. The United States of 
America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland patent laws provide 
useful examples of how patents can be broadly used for almost any public non-commercial 
purpose.<b>42</b> The restriction under article 31 of prior negotiations with the patentee does not apply 
to government use. This allows for a speedy process that assists governments in meeting their 
obligations to provide access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>39. While many countries have adopted mechanisms to issue compulsory licences, the grounds 
for use have varied<b>43</b> and procedures in national laws are at times cumbersome and need to be 
streamlined and simplified to facilitate issuance of such licences. 
</p>

<p>  See footnote 18 above, p. 61, Table 6. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>40. Countries with little or no manufacturing capacity face difficulties in utilizing compulsory 
licences to import generic medicines as, article 31 (f) of TRIPS requires that goods produced 
under a compulsory licence should be for &#8220;predominantly&#8221; local use. This difficulty was 
recognized by the Doha Declaration, pursuant to which the WTO General Council 
provided a framework to address this issue through the decision of 30 August 2003. This 
decision is contained in a Protocol which if signed by two thirds of the WTO members 
by 31 December 2009 would become a formal amendment to TRIPS. 
</p>
<p>41. Countries have faced difficulties in implementing the 30 August decision as it entails 
complex administrative procedures. Even though a number of potentially exporting countries 
amended their national laws to incorporate the 30 August decision, their regulations have added 
further administrative requirements that make it difficult to implement.<b>44</b> The first and only case 
of export of a patented medicine under the 30 August decision occurred in 2008 to Rwanda, 
five years after the adoption of the decision. The case of Rwanda highlights the need to revisit 
the decision.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Parallel importation and international exhaustion 
</b></p>
<p>42. Parallel importation refers to the purchase of a patented medicine from a lawful source in 
an exporting country and its importation without seeking the consent of the &#8220;parallel&#8221; patent 
holder in the importing country.<b>45</b> It can be a useful tool for countries to save money as it allows 
them to import a patented product from countries where they may be sold at a lower price than 
on the domestic market. 
</p>
<p>43. Parallel importation depends on the principle of exhaustion. While a patentee has the 
exclusive right to prevent others from manufacturing or marketing the patented product, the 
principle of exhaustion bars the patentee from further exercising exclusive rights once the 
product is sold on the market. Article 6 of TRIPS specifically allows countries to determine the 
point at which IP rights have been exhausted, giving member States the discretion to choose the 
exhaustion principle applicable to their patent regimes. 
</p>
<p>44. The principle of exhaustion can be applied at, the national, regional and international 
levels. Under the national exhaustion principle, the patentee can oppose the importation of 
patented products marketed abroad. International exhaustion, on the other hand, prevents the 
patentee from exercising further control over the product once it has been sold in any part of the 
world and therefore facilitates parallel importation. 
</p>
<p>45. Countries have varied in the choice of exhaustion regime. While countries including 
South Africa, Kenya, Honduras and members of the Andean Community have adopted the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international exhaustion regime to promote affordability and availability of essential medicines, 
a number of countries have adopted the national exhaustion regime.<b>46</b> Others have applied the 
regional exhaustion principle.<b>47</b> Countries, which have incorporated an international exhaustion 
regime, have greater ability to facilitate access to medicines. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Limited exceptions to the right of patent owners 
</b></p>
<p>46. Article 30 of TRIPS allows member States to design limited exceptions to the exclusive 
rights conferred by a patent, as long as such exceptions do not unreasonably prejudice the rights 
of a patentee. This leaves considerable flexibility to create exceptions that facilitate access to 
medicines. 
</p>
<p>47. Exceptions for research and experimental use fall within the ambit of article 30. Such 
exceptions can be a useful way for researchers and manufacturers to encourage innovation of 
new medicines, particularly those for neglected diseases.  
</p>
<p>48. The &#8220;early working&#8221; or Bolar exception, allows competitors to import, manufacture and 
use a patented product for the purpose of seeking regulatory approval. Allowing for the 
completion of registration requirements before patent expiry, facilitates the prompt entry of 
generic medicines on the market once a patent expires. The WTO Dispute Settlement Panel, 
in 2000, upheld such an exception by Canada as permissible under article 30. 
</p>
<p>49. While the early working exception has been incorporated into the national patent laws 
of many countries, it is not as commonly found as the &#8220;research or experimental use&#8221; 
exception.<b>48</b>  
</p>
<p><b>6.  Opposition and revocation procedures 
</b></p>
<p>50. As TRIPS is silent on procedural aspects relating to patent examination, it allows for 
member States to establish mechanisms that subject patent applications to high levels of scrutiny. 
In this regard, countries can permit oppositions by any persons to patent applications before 
(pre-grant) and after (post-grant opposition and revocation proceedings) the grant of a patent. 
This allows concerned stakeholders including, civil society organizations and patient groups to 
oppose the grant of patents. Opposition proceedings can assist in subjecting patent applications 
and granted patents to higher scrutiny as patent offices are often understaffed and overburdened. 
India and Thailand allow for oppositions, which have been used successfully in relation to some

</b>  Brazil and Morocco for instance have adopted the principle of national exhaustion.

</b>  See footnote 37 above, p. 56.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>crucial HIV medicines.<b>49</b> Brazil adopts an additional mechanism to ensure higher scrutiny, where 
prior consent of the National Sanitary Supervision Agency (ANVISA) is required before a patent 
application relating to medicine is reviewed by the patent office.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>51. Traditionally, opposition proceedings were limited to competitors and governments. 
Lately, they have been broadened to include interested persons such as civil society 
organizations and patients&#8217; groups. This is particularly important when generic companies may 
not have an interest in opposing a patent on a medicine of public importance. 
</p>
<p>52. Ensuring higher scrutiny of patent applications before a patent is granted and of patents 
that have been granted can be a useful tool to limit the impact of patents on medicines. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>7.  Pro-competitive measures 
</b></p>
<p>53. Article 40 of TRIPS specifically recognizes the adverse effects of licensing conditions or 
practices relating to intellectual property rights (IPRs). It therefore allows member States to 
identify in their national laws licensing conditions or practices which may constitute an abuse of 
IPRs and have an adverse effect on competition. The South Africa Competition Commission for 
example, has held that the practice of a pharmaceutical company in not granting licences to 
generic companies amounts to an abuse of dominant position.<b>51</b> As such, note should be taken of 
reports of competition authorities of developed countries detailing anti-competitive practices in 
the pharmaceutical sector.<b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>54. The use of anti-competition law can be an important tool to promote access to medicines. 
TRIPS article 31 for example allows a relaxation of certain restrictions, such as prior negotiation 
with patentees and predominantly domestic use, relating to compulsory licences which may be 
useful to remedy anti-competitive practices.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. While this report does not specifically further explore use of anti-competition laws, there is 
a need for countries to adopt and effectively apply pro-competitive measures allowed under 
TRIPS to prevent or remedy anti-competitive practices having a bearing on the use of patented 
medicines.

<p><b>C.  Concerns regarding the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities 
</b></p>
<p>56. Developing countries, while attempting to implement TRIPS flexibilities in order to 
address public health concerns, have experienced pressures from developed countries and 
multinational pharmaceutical corporations. In this respect, the cases of South Africa, Thailand 
and India are particularly illustrative. 
</p>
<p>57. In 1996, South Africa adopted a new National Drugs Policy with the goal of &#8220;ensuring an 
adequate and reliable supply of safe, cost-effective drugs of acceptable quality to all citizens of 
South Africa&#8221;.<b>53</b> Following the principles of the Policy, the South African Government amended 
its existing Medicines Act to improve access to medicines.<b>54</b> In response, South Africa was 
placed on the United States Special 301 Watch List<b>55</b> and 39 pharmaceutical companies filed a 
suit, challenging the amendments, contending that they would destroy patent protections by 
giving the Health Minister overly broad powers to produce or import cheaper versions of drugs 
still under patent.<b>56</b> Worldwide public outrage eventually led to a change in the US position<b>57 </b>and 
to the withdrawal of the lawsuit by the pharmaceutical companies in 2001.  
</p>
<p>58. Thailand also faced pressure following its attempts to lower prices of medicines through 
compulsory licensing. Between 2006 and 2007, Thailand issued compulsory licences for HIV 
and heart disease medicines in order to meet its obligations to provide universal access to 
medicines.<b>58</b> In 2007, Thailand was placed on the Special 301 Priority Watch List.<b>59</b> The 
position of the European Commission was also unwelcoming of the measures taken by

<p>Thailand.<b>60</b> One of the affected companies withdrew seven pending applications for registration 
of new medicines in Thailand, thus effectively withholding them from the Thai market.<b>61</b>  
</p>
<p>59. In 2008, noting the burden of cancer and the necessity for the Government health 
programme to provide access to cancer medicines, Thailand issued compulsory licences for three 
anti-cancer medicines.<b>62</b> A global campaign to support the Thai compulsory licences led to 
several statements of support for the use of this TRIPS flexibility;<b>63</b> however Thailand continues 
to face growing pressure in response to its use of compulsory licensing.<b>64</b>  
</p>
<p>60. Similarly, India faced pressure for its attempt to use safeguards. India, in 2005 included 
strict patentability criteria in its patent law to address the evergreening of patents.<b>65</b> This 
provision was challenged by a pharmaceutical company in the Madras High court alleging it was 
a violation of TRIPS and of the constitutional equality provision. The amendment was upheld, 
among other grounds as a fulfilment of the right to health obligations of the Government.<b>66</b> The 
Indian case also garnered significant global international support for the use of public health 
safeguards by developing countries in their patent laws.<b>67</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>61. The experiences of South Africa, Thailand, and India provide examples of difficulties 
countries have had to overcome to implement TRIPS flexibilities. Although they were successful 
in their attempts, there is fear that pressure from developed countries and pharmaceutical 
companies will thwart future actions.<b>68</b>  
</p>
<p>62. Furthermore, different aspects of the capacity of governments of developing countries and 
LDCs also contribute to variations in the use of TRIPS flexibilities. This includes the degree of 
technical expertise, of technological capacity and of engagement amongst national law and 
policymakers and the public in the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities.  
</p>
<p>63. Many developing countries and LDCs inherited IP laws from former colonizers. As a 
result, when TRIPS came into force, many countries did not necessarily have the technical 
expertise to effectively implement the agreement or take advantage of the flexibilities. In some 
cases, limited institutional capacity led to dependence on developed countries and independent 
bodies for technical assistance in drafting laws.<b>69</b> It should be noted that there have been 
concerns regarding the qualitative nature of assistance that is typically provided in relation to 
TRIPS<b>70</b> and in some cases LDCs seeking external assistance have adopted TRIPS-plus 
standards in their national laws.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p>64. The capacity of countries is also influenced by the degree of participation by individuals, 
communities and their representatives. Experiences from Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, 
Argentina, India, and the Philippines indicate that public interest groups can help promote efforts 
to pass laws that facilitate access to medicines.<b>72</b> Furthermore, rights impact assessments can 
help highlight the impact of TRIPS and TRIPS-plus standards on the right to health.<b>73</b> Examples

</p>
<p>and models to assess the impact of these provisions on access to medicines including in relation 
to affordability have also emerged.<b>74</b> Such initiatives should be encouraged to assist developing 
countries and LDCs in making decisions about the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities.  
</p>
<p>65. Few LDCs have local manufacturing capacities or any technological base to fully take 
advantage of TRIPS or TRIPS flexibilities.<b>75</b> In this regard, concrete steps towards the specific 
obligation under article 66, paragraph 2, of TRIPS of developed countries to provide incentives 
to promote and encourage technology transfer to LDCs in order to enable them to create a sound 
and viable technological base should be encouraged.  
</p>
<p>66. The lack of capacity and external pressures imposed by developed countries, significantly 
contribute to difficulties faced by developing countries, especially LDCs, in the use of TRIPS 
flexibilities. Therefore there is a real need for developing countries and LDCs to seek appropriate 
means to build up their capacity, and for developed countries to refrain from hampering the use 
of TRIPS flexibilities.  
</p>
<p>67. The next section of the report examines the effect of standards imposed beyond TRIPS 
(TRIPS-plus) by FTAs on access to medicines and the right to health. Due to space constraints, 
not all issues arising out of existing or proposed international trade agreements that affect access 
to medicines will be discussed. 
</p>
<p><b>III. FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS, THE RIGHT TO HEALTH 
AND ACCESS TO MEDICINES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>68. Many countries have signed or are currently engaged in negotiations on extensive trade 
agreements, including bilateral investment treaties (BITs), FTAs, economic partnership 
agreements (EPAs) etc. Such agreements have extensive implications for pharmaceutical patent 
protection, which can directly impact access to medicines. Some developed countries, for 
example have negotiated FTAs which reflect their standard of IP protection.<b>76</b>  
</p>
<p>69. These agreements are usually negotiated with little transparency or participation from the 
public, and often establish TRIPS-plus provisions. These provisions undermine the safeguards 
and flexibilities that developing countries sought to preserve under TRIPS.<b>77</b> Studies indicate that 
                                                 
</p>

<p>  Several authors have written on this subject. See, e.g., C. Correa, &#8220;Implications of bilateral 
free trade agreements on access to medicines&#8221;, <i>Bulletin of the World Health Organization</i>, 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>TRIPS-plus standards increase medicine prices as they delay or restrict the introduction of 
generic competition.<b>78</b> It should also be noted that TRIPS-plus measures could also arise in other 
contexts such as terms for WTO accession.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p>70. The need for public health to be taken into consideration in negotiating these agreements 
has been highlighted not only in developing countries and LDCs but also in developed countries. 
The European Parliament for example, in 2007, specifically asked the European Commission to 
take into consideration the need to protect public health in support of the Doha Declaration and 
refrain from negotiating TRIPS-plus provisions. Nevertheless, countries continue to negotiate 
and introduce agreements with TRIPS-plus standards.<b>80</b> TRIPS and the Doha Declaration 
specifically allow for countries to protect the right to health. As FTAs can directly affect 
access to medicines, there is a need for countries to assess multilateral and bilateral trade 
agreements for potential health violations and that all stages of negotiation remain open and 
transparent. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Restricting TRIPS flexibilities 
</b></p>
<p>71. Several FTAs and BITs seek to restrict countries from implementing TRIPS flexibilities. 
An illustrative example is the attempt to broaden the scope of patentability.  
</p>
<p>72. As discussed, TRIPS flexibilities allow member States to define patentability criteria. 
However, a number of FTAs signed or currently being negotiated have restricted or even 
eliminated this flexibility by requiring that parties provide patent protections for second uses,<b>81</b> 
thereby allowing patentees to evergreen existing patents.

<p>  European Parliament, Resolution on the TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines 
(12 July 2007). The Resolution specifically mentions prevention of use of data exclusivity and 
patent extension.  
<b>81
</b></p>
<p>  See for example, article 17.9 (1), United States-Australia FTA, article 15.9 (2), 
United States-Morocco FTA and article 14.8 (2), United States-Bahrain FTA. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. In addition, article 27 (3) (b) of TRIPS also allows members to exclude plants and animals 
from patentability as long as some sui generis system of protection for plant varieties is put in 
place. Some FTAs however, look to enhance patent protection for plants and animals, which can 
have an impact on access to medicine.<b>82</b>  
</p>
<p>74. Some FTAs also restrict procedural flexibilities, such as prohibiting pre-grant opposition 
procedures. Still others seek to limit the grounds on which compulsory licences can be issued.<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C. TRIPS-plus standards in the area of patent law in  
free trade agreements (FTAs) 
</b></p>
<p>75. TRIPS-plus provisions in FTAs differ from agreement to agreement, but their purposes are 
by and large to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Extend the patent term 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Introduce data exclusivity 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Introduce patent linkage with drug registration and approval 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Create new enforcement mechanisms for IPRs 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Patent term extensions 
</b></p>
<p>76. TRIPS provides for a 20-year patent protection term, starting from the date of filing the 
patent application. It should be noted that prior to TRIPS, developing countries only 
allowed 5-10 year patent protection while developed countries allowed 15-17 years.<b>84  
</b></p>
<p>77. Several FTAs require an extension of the patent term for pharmaceutical products under 
certain circumstances.<b>85</b> The extension of patent life in developing countries and LDCs can 
significantly impact the ability of patients to access medicines, and may pose a burden for 
national health budgets. For instance, it has been estimated that the three-year patent extension 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>82
</b>  Article 15.9 (2) United States-Morocco FTA.  
</p>
<p><b>83
</b>  United States-Singapore FTA, and draft United States-Thailand FTA.  
</p>
<p><b>84
</b>  See footnote 30 above, p. 114. </p>
<p><b>85
</b>  The United States-Jordan FTA, which requires a term extension for delays in marketing 
</p>
<p>approval but not for patent grant procedures, is an exception. However, most United States 
negotiated FTAs require extension to &#8220;compensate the patent holder for unreasonable 
curtailment of the effective patent term&#8221; due to delays in the marketing approval of the 
medicines and the examination of the patent. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provision in the United States-South Korea FTA, would cost US$ 504.5 billion and a four-year 
extension would cost US$ 722.5 billion, consequently putting a strain on the national health 
insurance system in South Korea.<b>86</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Data exclusivity 
</b></p>
<p>78. Before a pharmaceutical company introduces a new medicine onto the market, it has to 
submit clinical test data to national drug regulatory authorities (DRA) to prove the medicine&#8217;s 
safety and efficacy. In many countries, a subsequent generic manufacturer who seeks approval to 
market the generic equivalent is not required to submit fresh clinical test data but can show that 
its medicine is bioequivalent to the medicine of the originator company. Relying on the clinical 
test data of the originator, the DRA can grant marketing approval to the subsequent version. This 
allows generic medicines to enter the market quickly. Data exclusivity prevents such reliance on 
the original clinical test data by the DRA for a number of years and requires generic producers to 
submit their own clinical test data. Such a replication requires generic producers to allocate time 
and money to prove what is &#8220;already known&#8221; and also raises ethical concerns of replicating trials 
on human populations. Data exclusivity deters and considerably delays the entry of generic 
medicines and can lead to the maintenance of high prices of medicines.<b>87 
</b></p>
<p>79. Although developed countries proposed the inclusion of data exclusivity in TRIPS, it was 
not adopted.<b>88</b> TRIPS does not require countries to provide data exclusivity. Where a national 
DRA requires the submission of undisclosed data for the registration of a medicine, TRIPS only 
requires countries to protect such data against &#8220;unfair commercial use&#8221; in case it relates to a 
&#8220;new chemical entity&#8221; and if the origination of such data involved a &#8220;considerable effort&#8221;.<b>89</b> 
Countries can therefore determine how to protect such data. Reliance by the DRA on the clinical 
trial data of the originator company to approve a subsequent medicine does not amount to unfair 
commercial use.<b>90</b>  
</p>
<p>80. The requirement to impose data exclusivity features in several FTAs. For instance, the 
US-Morocco FTA provides for data exclusivity. In fact, it does not limit data exclusivity to a 
&#8220;new chemical entity&#8221;, which is known internationally, but mandates the protection of test data 
of any &#8220;new product&#8221; defined as one previously unapproved in that territory.<b>91</b>  </p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>81. In some cases, the period of data exclusivity may run during the life of the patent. 
However, there are a number of circumstances in which exclusive rights over test data can 
restrict the availability of medicines. Data exclusivity, being independent from patent protection, 
can allow pharmaceutical companies to secure monopoly rights for off-patent or non-patentable 
medicines. Evidence from Jordan indicates that pharmaceutical companies are choosing to rely 
on data exclusivity to enforce their monopoly instead of filing for patents.<b>92</b> In the context of 
developed countries, as evidence from Canada and Australia suggests, data exclusivity leads to 
higher costs of prescription medicines.  
</p>
<p>82. Data exclusivity may also block the production of generics after a compulsory licence is 
issued. Because marketing approval is independent from patent law, it is possible that a national 
DRA may refuse to approve a generic drug based on bioequivalence during the exclusivity 
period. This will pose a problem unless the law relating to data exclusivity provides an exception 
in the case of compulsory licences. However, even with this, there could be a delay in the entry 
of a generic version, as the marketing approval process may commence only after the 
compulsory licence is issued.  
</p>
<p>83. Data exclusivity is at odds with TRIPS flexibilities, such as those that allow governments 
to enforce their own criteria for granting patents, contest the validity of patents or issue 
compulsory licences. Therefore, in the context of developing countries and LDCs, data 
exclusivity may actually provide pharmaceutical companies with market monopoly without 
providing the public benefits and safeguards associated with the patent system.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Patent linkage 
</b></p>
<p>84. Patent linkage is another TRIPS-plus obligation imposed through FTAs. It makes the 
marketing approval of a medicine dependent on its patent status. Thus if the medicine is 
patented, no marketing approval would be given to its generic version.  
</p>
<p>85. The laws of a number of countries permit national DRAs to grant marketing approval to a 
medicine, irrespective of its patent status.<b>93</b> Some countries, however establish a link between the 
patent system and drug marketing approval procedures.<b>94</b> For many developing countries and 
LDCs, patent linkages are introduced through FTAs that require the national DRA either to 
refuse to grant marketing approval for the generic version or to disclose to the patentee the 
identity of a third party seeking approval.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>92
</b>  A country analysis of public health and patent law in Jordan has shown that of 103 medicines 
</p>
<p>registered and launched since 2001 that currently have no patent protection in Jordan, at 
least 79 per cent have no competition from a generic equivalent as a consequence of data 
exclusivity. See footnote 78 above, p. 9.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>93
</b></p>
<p>  See footnote 90 above<i>. 
<b></b></i><b>94
</b></p>
<p>  Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (The Hatch-Waxman Act), 
United States 1984. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>86. While some argue that patent linkage merely prevents governments from issuing patents 
while simultaneously permitting their infringement, it should be noted that patent linkage is at 
odds with the conception of patents as private rights.<b>95</b> It imposes an obligation on a country&#8217;s 
DRA to prevent possible infringement of the private rights of patent holders either by denying 
registration or informing a patentee.  
</p>
<p>87. Further, it should be noted that the European Union (EU) does not have a system of patent 
linkages<b>96</b> and in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has stated that it does not 
have the expertise or resources to review patents.<b>97</b>  
</p>
<p>88. This is of particular concern as patent linkage would affect the entry of generic medicines 
in the case of the patents being invalidated. By delaying the process of granting marketing 
approval, patent linkage provides patent holders with additional opportunities to prolong their 
monopoly rights and delays the entry of generic medicines into the market. In fact, a 
United States Federal Trade Commission study showed that the United States linkage system is 
subject to substantial abuse by patent holders.<b>98</b> The Canadian Federal Government and Supreme 
Court have also recognized that companies had been using the Canadian linkage system to 
evergreen their patents.<b>99</b>  
</p>
<p>89. Patent linkages, by not allowing the registration of generic versions of patented drugs can 
also adversely impact the early working exception, which ensures the immediate entry of generic 
competition after the expiry of the patent. Similarly, refusal to register also creates uncertainty in 
relation to compulsory licences.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Intellectual property (IP) enforcement mechanisms 
</b>90. The enforcement of IP claims should refrain from creating any undue barriers to access 
to medicines. In this respect, FTAs that impose TRIPS-plus IP enforcement measures are a 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>95
</b>  See TRIPS Agreement, preamble. 
</p>
<p><b>96
</b>  &#8220;Patent linkage is considered unlawful under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive

 <p> 
</p>
<p>cause for concern. For instance, proposals in the EU-CAN FTA under negotiation remarkably 
expand the scope of information that can be requested in IP infringement proceedings.<b>100</b>  
</p>
<p>91. The most important provisions of the EU-CAN (Andean Community of Nations) proposal 
remain those establishing criminal sanctions for IP infringement. Whereas TRIPS mandates 
&#8220;criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark 
counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale&#8221;, the proposal encompasses intentional 
infringement on all IP rights, including patents with sanctions ranging from imprisonment, 
monetary fines, confiscation of equipment and products, destruction of goods to permanent 
closure of involved establishments. Criminalizing patent infringement is particularly worrisome 
given that patents challenged in court by alleged infringers are often found to be invalid.<b>101</b> Such 
overreaching provisions, with a low evidentiary standard, may have a chilling impact on 
producers of generic medicines who could be threatened with sanctions before the validity of the 
patent is even determined. 
</p>
<p>92. Furthermore, TRIPS-plus IP enforcement can adversely impact access to medicines. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur is concerned with reports of IP enforcement measures that have 
resulted in multiple seizures at some ports of shipments of generic medicines heading to 
developing countries and LDCs.<b>102</b> Customs regulations of some countries allow the seizures of 
goods suspected of IP infringement even if they are only in transit.<b>103</b>  Such regulations impose a 
far higher standard of IPR enforcement than that required by TRIPS, which requires that IP 
enforcement measures should not create barriers to legitimate trade.<b>104</b> In effect, such actions 
can bring to naught TRIPS flexibilities exercised by developing countries and LDCs, and 
de facto impose IP protection on LDCs that are not yet required to comply with TRIPS as 
generic medicines they need do not reach them. In particular the use of compulsory licensing or 
the 30 August decision to export and import medicines is effectively negated.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>100
</b>  In addition to the requirement mandated by the TRIPS Agreement that the infringing party 
</p>
<p>provide the information, the EU proposal would also require any other person who was found in 
possession of, using, or providing the infringing goods or services on a commercial scale to 
provide the information.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur also notes possible concerns that recent developments in national 
legislation<b>105</b> and international negotiations on an anti-counterfeiting trade agreement (ACTA) 
may impose a TRIPS-plus enforcement regime.<b>106</b> The lack of transparency and secrecy 
surrounding the negotiations is of particular concern.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The framework of the right to health makes it clear that medicines must be available, 
accessible, acceptable, and of good quality to reach ailing populations without 
discrimination throughout the world. As has been evident, TRIPS and FTAs have had an 
adverse impact on prices and availability of medicines, making it difficult for countries to 
comply with their obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil the right to health.</b> 
</p>
<p>95. <b>Similarly, lack of capacity coupled with external pressures from developed countries 
has made it difficult for developing countries and LDCs to use TRIPS flexibilities to 
promote access to medicines.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>Flexibilities were included in TRIPS to allow States to take into consideration their 
economic and development needs. States need to take steps to facilitate the use of TRIPS 
flexibilities.</b> 
</p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that developing countries and LDCs 
should review their laws and policies and consider whether they have made full use of 
TRIPS flexibilities or included TRIPS-plus measures, and if necessary consider amending 
their laws and policies to make full use of the flexibilities.</b>  
</p>
<p>98. <b>LDCs should make full use of the transition period and in relation to medicines 
revoke or suspend their patent laws, if necessary, for the balance of the period. LDCs 
should also consider asking for a further extension of the transition period.</b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>LDCs should use the transition period to seek the most effective technical and other 
assistance from countries and institutions to develop technical capacity and also explore 
options to establish local manufacturing capabilities.</b>  
</p>
<p>100. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should establish high patentability standards and 
provide for exclusions from patentability, such as new forms and new or second uses, and 
combinations, in order to address evergreening and facilitate generic entry of medicines.</b> 
</p>
<p>101. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should adopt the principle of international 
exhaustion and provide for parallel importation with simplified procedures in their 
national laws.</b> 
</p>
<p>

</b>  EU Parliament resolution, INI/2008/2133<b> </b>of September 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>Developing countries and LDCs need to incorporate in their national patent laws all 
possible grounds upon which compulsory licences, including government use, may be 
issued. Such laws provide straightforward, transparent procedures for rapid issue of 
compulsory licences. There is also a need to revisit the 30 August decision and provide for a 
simpler mechanism.</b> 
</p>
<p>103. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should specifically adopt and apply pro-competition 
measures to prevent the abuse of the patent system, particularly in regard to access to 
medicines.</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should incorporate both Bolar (early working) and 
research, experimental and educational exceptions in their patent laws and explore how 
additional limited exceptions could further promote access to medicines.</b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should establish liberal pre-grant, post-grant 
opposition and revocation procedures, which can be taken advantage of by all concerned 
stakeholders, including patients&#8217; groups.</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should seek international assistance in building 
capacity to implement TRIPS flexibilities to promote the right to health. WHO and other 
United Nations bodies could provide such assistance.</b> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>LDCs and developing countries should actively promote the participation of 
individuals and communities in decision-making processes relating to TRIPS and TRIPS 
flexibilities and conduct impact assessments of the same. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Developing countries and LDCs should not introduce TRIPS-plus standards in their 
national laws. Developed countries should not encourage developing countries and LDCs to 
enter into TRIPS-plus FTAs and should be mindful of actions which may infringe upon the 
right to health. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>All technical assistance and cooperation by developed countries, WHO and the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), to developing countries and LDCs should be 
based on the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health.
