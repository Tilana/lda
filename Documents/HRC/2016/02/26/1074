Postponement of the renewal of the mandate of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
</b></p>
<p> At its 53rd meeting, on 27 March 2014, the Human Rights Council, recalling the 
annex to its resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011 and to General Assembly resolution 65/281 
of 17 June 2011, decided, in an effort to synchronize schedules for resolutions, mandates 
and the presentation of reports by the special procedures of the Council, to postpone the 
renewal of the mandate of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
to its twenty-seventh session and, for that reason, to extend, on an exceptional basis, the 
mandate of the Working Group until that session.
