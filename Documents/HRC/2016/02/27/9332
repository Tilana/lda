 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In the present report, the independent expert on the effects of economic reform policies and 
foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights, Bernards Mudho, describes his recent activities, focusing on the challenges met in the 
preparation of the general guidelines requested by the Commission on Human Rights in its 
resolutions 2004/18 and 2005/19, to be eventually implemented by States and private and 
financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and structural 
reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief. The aim of the guidelines is 
to guarantee that compliance with the commitments arising from foreign debt does not 
undermine the capacity of States to fulfil their obligations for the full realization of fundamental 
human rights.  
</p>
<p> In the introduction of the report, the independent expert briefly recalls the activities 
undertaken in 2007 in relation to the preparation of the draft general guidelines, such as the 
organization of an expert consultation, held on 9 and 10 July in Geneva, as well as the holding of 
annual consultations with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on 28 and 
29 November in Washington, D.C. Mention is also made of his country mission to Burkina Faso 
and the report he submitted to the General Assembly and the annual report presented to the 
Human Rights Council in 2007. 
</p>
<p> The first part of the report describes what the key principles of the draft guidelines should 
be. In view of the disparities in conditions for each country and the difficulties in determining 
concrete indicators reflecting the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, the 
guidelines should be designed to encourage countries to elaborate flexible context-specific 
standards, benchmarks and indicators based on the core content or minimum human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p> In addition, the concept and definition of debt sustainability play a major role in the 
discussions on the effects of foreign debt on human rights. The independent expert describes 
some of the proposed debt sustainability frameworks and briefly addresses their strengths and 
weaknesses, giving some orientations on the way forward. The main challenge identified in the 
report is the definition of the responsibility and obligations of stakeholders at the national and 
international levels in the design of a set of analytical tools. Such tools need to combine financial 
parameters, measurable human rights needs and poverty reduction objectives, with a focus on the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the independent expert provides a summary of the latest developments concerning 
the mandate and formulates some recommendations for its future. Economic reform and foreign 
debt measures have gradually become components of poverty reduction strategies. This situation 
raises a need for a new and multidimensional approach. He therefore recommends that the 
mandate be refocused on the subject of human rights and public finance. He also recommends 
that the new mandate-holder work in close collaboration with the Working Group on the Right to 
Development and its high-level task force in order to ensure synergy of their actions.<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to resolution 2000/82, by which the Commission on Human Rights established 
his mandate and in accordance with resolution 5/1, by which the Human Rights Council 
extended the mandate, the independent expert on the effects of economic reform policies and 
foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights, hereby submits his final report. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 2000/82, the Commission requested the independent expert to pay 
particular attention to: 
</p>
<p> (a) The effects of foreign debt and the policies adopted to address them on the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, economic, social and cultural rights in developing 
countries; 
</p>
<p> (b) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial 
institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily 
indebted countries;  
</p>
<p> (c) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international financial 
institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations with respect to structural adjustment policies and human rights.  
</p><p>3. In its resolutions 2004/18 and 2005/19, the Commission further requested the independent 
expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to draft general guidelines to be followed by States and 
by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making and 
execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from 
foreign debt relief, and to submit a final draft of general guidelines to the Commission at its 
sixty-second session. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that compliance with the 
commitments arising from foreign debt do not undermine the capacity of States to fulfil their 
obligations for the full realization by their citizenry of fundamental economic, social and cultural 
rights, as provided for in international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>4. Subsequently, by its decision 2/109, the Human Rights Council requested the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene an expert consultation to 
contribute to the ongoing process of drafting the draft general guidelines and to invite 
international financial institutions, notably the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF), regional developments banks, relevant United Nations agencies and national experts 
and stakeholders to contribute to the consultations. 
</p>
<p>5. The expert consultation was held on 9 and 10 July 2007, in Geneva. Its main objectives 
were: 
</p>
<p> (a) To provide an overall picture of how foreign debt and debt relief programmes and 
different kinds of economic reform policies affect the capacity of States to comply with human 
rights standards;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) To identify recommendations to States, international organizations and other 
stakeholders regarding possible policy elements to promote and protect human rights in 
developing countries while implementing debt and economic reform programmes.  
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert conducted his annual consultation with the World Bank and IMF 
on 28 and 29 November 2007, in Washington, D.C. He consulted with a wide range of 
interlocutors involved in human rights-related issues in both institutions. While the independent 
expert was updated on progress in the implementation of debt relief programmes and poverty 
reduction strategies supported by both institutions, in-depth discussions were held on the 
contents of the draft general guidelines. In particular, the independent expert exchanged views on 
the application of the poverty social impact analysis and on the roles of the inspection panel in 
the context of implementing economic reform programmes supported by the World Bank. The 
independent expert also held discussions with IMF staff on efforts to safeguard the poor 
population and social expenditure during economic reforms. The result of the consultation is 
reflected in the current draft of the general guidelines. 
</p>
<p>7. During the reporting period, the independent expert undertook a country mission to 
Burkina Faso from 23 to 27 April, the report on which is submitted as an addendum to the 
present report (A/HRC/7/9/Add.1). The independent expert wishes to thank the Government of 
Burkina Faso and, in particular, the Ministry for the Promotion of Human Rights for the 
assistance and support provided to the mission and its indispensable coordination role. He also 
wishes to thank the United Nations country team and all those organizations and individuals who 
provided valuable information. 
</p>
<p>8. In compliance with resolution 2005/19 of the Commission on Human Rights, the 
independent expert submitted a report to the General Assembly (A/62/212). The independent 
expert was gratified to have had that opportunity to inform the Third Committee of the Assembly 
about the ongoing process of drafting the general guidelines on a human rights-consistent design 
and implementation of economic reform policies and foreign debt programmes. His report 
focused, in particular, on the outcome and recommendations of the above-mentioned expert 
consultation in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>9. In his annual report for 2007 (A/HCR/4/10) submitted to the Council, the independent 
expert retraced the evolution of the mandate over past years and summarized main findings on 
the human rights impact of recent debt relief initiatives, underlying concepts of debt 
sustainability and economic reform policies frequently used in poverty reduction strategies. This 
work inspired the first draft of general guidelines, which was shared with the participants of the 
above-mentioned expert consultation of July 2007 as a basis for discussion. The present report 
builds on this earlier work. In particular, it contains an updated version of the key principles that 
inspire the draft guidelines, reflecting main findings of the mandate and essential comments 
made during the expert consultation, for the consideration of the Council. In the second part of 
the report, the independent expert provides general remarks on the nature of the mandate itself 
and gives suggestions on its possible future framework.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE DRAFT GUIDELINES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Minimum standards, core content and core obligations 
</b></p>
<p>10. The main objective of the draft general guidelines elaborated by the independent expert is 
to provide some indication on how economic reform policies and foreign debt schemes should be 
designed and implemented in order not to undermine States&#8217; obligations to ensure the full 
realization by their citizenry of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights. Consequently, 
policies related to economic reforms and foreign debt need to be developed based on the core 
content of these fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. Concrete thresholds reflecting the attainment of economic, social and cultural rights are not 
always available or measurable. The general comments of the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights provide some indication in this regard. Nonetheless, it is often not easy to 
extrapolate core content of the relevant rights from such an authoritative interpretation of the 
provisions of the relevant instruments in a concrete and measurable way. The essential drug list 
published by the World Health Organization, or the requirements concerning universal, free and 
mandatory primary education, are some of the concrete examples which help identify basic 
standards that any policy measures to facilitate economic reforms or to meet debt-related 
obligations must not undermine. In other areas, such as basic shelter or access to drinking water, 
minimum standards cannot be easily determined in a generalized way, as they often depend on 
the specific context in each country, including, for example, different climatic conditions. 
</p>
<p>12. While it is important that international norms continue to be further strengthened, for 
instance, through consideration of general comments and interpretation of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the light of the new challenges associated 
with development (for example, HIV/AIDS and globalization), it is important to recognize that 
national conditions are so different that the minimum standards or core content of human rights 
to be safeguarded against the economic reforms and foreign debt burdens cannot be easily 
expressed as a universal international standard. 
</p>
<p>13. Therefore, the draft general guidelines are not intended to formulate a global definition of 
core content or to set some minimum standards to be observed by all countries. In fact, the 
guidelines are designed to encourage countries to elaborate their own context-specific standards, 
benchmarks and indicators. At the same time, such an exercise must of necessity be in line with 
the requirements of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and 
should take into account the ongoing efforts being made by the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to clarify and interpret requirements of the Covenant.  
</p>
<p>14. The identification of country-specific standards should also be a dynamic process. Regular 
reviews will have to be made in order to reflect changes in the country context to consider other 
useful guidance developed by human rights bodies. In this sense, the minimum norms at the 
country level may be determined within a fairly flexible framework. However, national 
minimum standards, within such a dynamic framework, should be defined regardless of the 
availability of resources and the recognition that economic, social and cultural rights are to be 
implemented progressively.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>15. Given that such minimum standards and core content would be identified as dynamic and 
country-specific benchmarks, the guidelines would also highlight necessary steps towards the 
full realization of human rights. It should be noted that meeting the obligations corresponding to 
minimum standards is not enough to achieve the full realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights.  
</p>
<p>16. In this regard, the independent expert also recommends that the draft general guidelines 
should be used as a basis for developing more operational guidance, which will help States 
consider concrete criteria for the elaboration of national core content or minimum standards.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Debt sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>17. The concept and definition of debt sustainability play a crucial role in discussions on the 
effects of foreign debt on human rights. Recognizing an unsustainable debt situation often 
triggers policy measures such as debt relief and increasing grant proportions in development 
assistance, which are expected to ensure a larger fiscal space for expenditures directly enhancing 
living conditions and livelihoods.  
</p>
<p>18. In 2005, the World Bank and IMF elaborated their improved analytical model on debt 
sustainability by tailoring it to a more country-specific analysis. Such an improved framework is 
also aimed at ensuring early detection of the risk of default and excessive debt burden. More 
specifically, this new analysis involves: 
</p>
<p> (a) A forecast on how a country&#8217;s outstanding debt is likely to grow over time in relation 
to its ability to pay, taking into account the country&#8217;s debt management policies and the 
performance of Government institutions related to debt service;  
</p>
<p> (b) An examination of how the outlook would change if reasonably expected shocks, 
such as a rise in oil prices, are taken into consideration;  
</p>
<p> (c) A final account, if the result of the above analysis indicates a possibly unsustainable 
situation.  
</p>
<p>19. However, the above model still does not go beyond the analysis of financial sustainability, 
as it concentrates on the analysis of the financial capacity to repay debt. In other words, the 
model alone falls short of assessing a country&#8217;s ability to achieve its poverty reduction goals or 
meeting human rights obligations while servicing its foreign debt. 
</p>
<p>20. Many experts consider that debt sustainability assessments conducted by international 
financial institutions sometimes focus exclusively on the ability to service debt and on the risk of 
debt default, while considerations on human rights, for which these institutions do not have the 
necessary expertise, may not have to be integrated in this particular exercise. In that view, the 
assessment on whether a country has sufficient resources to finance expenditure to maintain 
minimum human rights standards would require a separate set of analytical tools. However, the 
existing debt-sustainability analytical framework could help identify the proportion of grant 
requirements, particularly for official development assistance. If human rights-related needs can 
be costed, the need for grants could be calculated by subtracting domestic fiscal resources - and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the amount of international assistance provided in the form of loans - from the costs for fulfilling 
human rights. Nonetheless, it must be noted that, in most cases, grants for the needed amount are 
not available. 
</p>
<p>21. Therefore, the capacity to pay should not be assessed by primary financial parameters 
alone; there is a need to take into account the cost of avoiding violation of international human 
rights obligations as well. A sustainability framework that does not consider human rights 
obligations would fail to indicate if a certain debt level, particularly over the long term, can be 
justified in the light of the international legal framework.  
</p><p>22. An alternative framework, based on the Millennium Development Goals, has been 
suggested by a number of non-governmental organizations. The key concept for this framework 
is net available revenue, which is an estimation of potential Government revenues, for example, 
20 per cent of domestic income. While the income earned by the poorest part of the population 
would not count as potential source of Government revenue, the amount of grants provided in 
the forms of development cooperation is included. This framework also counts the estimated 
costs of fulfilling human rights obligations. However, as described above, there is currently no 
generally recognized methodology for human rights costing and this model concerns only some 
selected economic, social and cultural rights in the context of the Millennium Development 
Goals. Other fixed costs, such as maintaining public administration, police services and basic 
infrastructure, are added to this amount. Thus, net available revenue can be calculated by 
subtracting the total amount of such costs for maintaining the human rights standards from the 
total amount of potential or gross available revenue. This framework suggests that from 20 to 
50 per cent of the net available revenue could reasonably be used for debt service. According to 
this framework, the foreign debt of 70 countries could be considered excessive and hence should 
be cancelled. This would reduce the number of borrowing countries to about 40. 
</p>
<p>23. Over the medium and long term, the rules and mechanisms of international public finance 
need to be further improved to take into account the international human rights regime and of 
innovative analytical tools on debt sustainability. Such requirements should then be binding for 
all stakeholders, including Government and private donors, as well as the borrowing countries.   
</p>
<p><b>C.  Role of the Millennium Development Goals as interim targets 
</b></p>
<p>24. The usefulness of the Millennium Development Goals as benchmarks or thresholds for 
implementing economic reform policies and debt management was frequently discussed during 
the preparation of the draft general guidelines. 
</p>
<p>25. The Millennium Development Goals and human rights are manifestly different in nature. 
The Goals are highly aggregated development targets, which do not take into account disparities 
between regions and population groups or possible discrimination and marginalization in a 
country. As targets, they can be delayed or modified over time. They are also not explicit enough 
on the accountability of Governments for their obligations to rights holders. Furthermore, they 
emphasize development outcomes but do not pay the same attention to the need for a 
participatory and transparent process, which is extremely important from a human rights 
perspective and as a practical strategy to achieve development outcomes.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. However, there are significant relationships between economic and social rights 
obligations and the development issues and indicators dealt with at the centre of the Millennium 
Development Goals. Currently, the Goals are the most widely accepted operational reference 
framework regarding some of these problems; they provide internationally recognized targets, 
indicators and monitoring structures that allow, in some areas, broad quantification for the 
realization of economic and social rights and estimations of the related costs.  
</p>
<p>27. Against this backdrop, the draft guidelines suggest the need for a step-by-step approach. A 
first step would be to try to elaborate the above-mentioned national minimum standards and core 
content for each country. In doing so, countries may consider the Millennium Development 
Goals a transitional threshold. Secondly, countries analyse the coherence of their economic 
reform policies and debt management in the light of such minimum standards and core content. 
</p>
<p>28. Based on such an analysis, both creditors and borrowers should look into sustainability of 
the debt. One entry point of such discussion is to assess if a country is able to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals on time while servicing its debt. The guidelines would then call 
on donors and creditors to redress this situation by renegotiating loan conditions, including a 
possibility of debt relief, or shifting development cooperation from loans to grants. The 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative was already explicitly designed to help heavily indebted poor 
countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.   
</p>
<p><b>D.  Responsibility of international financial institutions 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Commission on Human Rights had requested the independent expert to draft 
guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial 
institutions. However, the discussion of the human rights obligations of international financing 
institutions, particularly the World Bank and IMF, has been controversial. IMF tends to argue 
that its articles of agreement do not make reference to human rights. 
</p>
<p>30. While it can be questioned whether or not international financial institutions are bound by 
human rights obligations as part of customary international law, it is undisputed that they are 
multi-State actors governed by their member States. States that are shareholders of international 
financial institutions are bound by international human rights law, as they are signatories and 
parties to human rights instruments. Enhancing coherence among multilateral institutions in 
relation to human rights principles would reduce the danger of providing conflicting policy 
advice and the need to face unacceptable trade-offs between macroeconomic requirements and 
human rights obligations. It would place the Governments of developing countries in a better 
position to uphold their international human rights obligations when negotiating with donors and 
creditors. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Human rights impact assessments 
</b></p>
<p>31. The draft guidelines emphasize that meeting the requirements of foreign debt servicing 
economic reforms needs to be balanced with human rights obligations. In fact, sound 
macroeconomic management, underpinned by the stability of basic commodity prices and 
sufficient fiscal space for public and social expenditures, should be conducive to enhanced 
enjoyment of human rights.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. It is also true, however, that other economic policy choices or debt decisions can lead to 
different results, depending on the specific context of the respective countries. In this regard, 
general guidelines can only attempt to indicate key elements of reform measures which need to 
be looked at critically in assessing their consistency with the human rights obligations defined in 
a country-specific context. Accordingly, the guidelines emphasize the crucial role of human 
rights impact assessment as a decision-making tool. 
</p>
<p>33. Nevertheless, it must be noted that, to date, there are no well-established and generally 
accepted tools or methodologies for human rights impact assessment, particularly in the context 
of economic reform and foreign debt management. Future work on the guidelines should 
therefore include elaboration of such operational tools, which may be built upon the existing 
analytical and monitoring tools developed by States, international financial institutions, 
non-governmental organizations and human rights bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  REVIEW AND FUTURE OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Commission on Human Rights established the mandate of the independent expert in 
April 2000, against the backdrop of the negative effects on human rights observed as a result of 
structural adjustment programmes, particularly during the 1990s. At that time, economic reform 
measures in developing countries were usually implemented in accordance with the economic 
conditionality suggested, or in some cases imposed, by the international creditors, notably the 
World Bank and the IMF, as a prerequisite for new loan agreements or debt relief programmes. 
</p>
<p>35. In recent years, however, the situation has gradually changed to a limited extent. With the 
emergence of poverty reductions strategy processes, most economic reforms in developing 
countries are now designed and guided by more comprehensive poverty reduction strategies or 
national development plans. This has allowed a larger measure of country ownership and 
improved participation of stakeholders. Economic reforms led by the Governments themselves 
are, therefore, only indirectly influenced by debt considerations and pressure from creditors. 
Nevertheless, the linkages between debt burden, loan conditionality and economic reforms still 
exist; for example, a positive financial track record remains an important condition for granting 
debt relief. However, it has become more evident that economic reforms and foreign debt now 
tend to be identified as subsets of renewed and overarching poverty reduction strategies among 
other elements, such as development planning, social safety nets, anti-corruption, 
decentralization, trade liberalization and foreign direct investment. The rationale for examining 
foreign debt and economic reforms in terms of their impact on human rights within the same 
mandate has become less evident.  
</p>
<p>36. It should also be recognized that the impact of foreign debt and economic reform policies 
on human rights is felt across different dimensions and time frames. On the one hand, debt 
burden and debt relief operations have an indirect and longer-lasting influence on human rights 
through limited fiscal space, i.e., the available financial resources to finance human rights-related 
expenditure. On the other hand, economic reforms, such as the privatization of State-owned 
companies and the cutting of trade and agricultural subsidies can be the source of direct shocks 
to individual households and communities and result in the denial of the rights to work and to 
food and so on, in a relatively short period of time. In recent reports, and in the approach chosen 
for the draft general guidelines, the independent expert has attempted to take into consideration </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>these differences through a more holistic but strategic approach aimed at ensuring that 
appropriate fiscal space for the realization of human rights can be maintained over both the short 
and the long term. 
</p>
<p>37. In order to bring such a discussion forward, the Council may wish to consider refocusing 
the mandate on the same sphere of the impact of economic management on human rights. The 
experience gained to date shows that combining two distinct thematic focuses into one mandate 
has created ambiguity as to the area of intervention and has, in turn, led to a necessarily general 
approach to a variety of implicit aspects of the mandate. One possible way forward, which would 
be in line with the directions suggested by the draft general guidelines, therefore, could be to 
redefine the mandate in terms of human rights and public finance. 
</p>
<p>38. Such an approach would also allow a more structured view of debt-related issues as a part 
of the mandate. Work on the draft guidelines has shown that the impact of the foreign debt 
burden on the ability of States to comply with human rights obligations cannot be separated from 
other aspects of public finance. The impact of foreign debt, therefore, can continue to be 
addressed as part of this renewed but more focused mandate, which would look at public 
expenditure management through the lense of human rights principles.  
</p>
<p>39. The independent expert appointed by the Council would, therefore, be expected to possess 
great expertise in fiscal policies and aid programming, in addition to essential knowledge of 
international human rights norms and principles. He or she would thus be properly equipped to 
investigate the potential for improving public finance mechanisms and poverty reduction 
strategies at the country level. In particular, the expert could further review, revise and develop 
the draft general guidelines elaborated to date. In doing so, the new mandate-holder would, 
moreover, be expected to advise stakeholders by facilitating practical discussions on the tools 
which allow human rights-based decision-making, including:  
</p>
<p> (a) Human rights impact assessments;  
</p>
<p> (b) Quantification of minimum standards and identification of core contents beyond the 
Millennium Development Goals; 
</p>
<p> (c) Human rights-based budgeting;   
</p>
<p> (d) Social safety net programming as a means to mitigate the negative impact of reforms 
and privatization;  
</p>
<p> (e) Government revenue and human rights (e.g. taxation, service fees, grant/loan 
proportion);   
</p>
<p> (f) Enhanced accountability of international financial institutions by means of 
safeguarding provisions, or investigation mechanisms linked with advisory and lending 
decisions;  
</p>
<p> (g) Participation of and consultation with stakeholders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>40. The mandate-holder should also work closely with the Working Group on the Right to 
Development and its high-level task force. The Working Group has been mandated to monitor 
and review progress made in the promotion and implementation of the right to development, 
which involves consideration of the many issues that also fall within the ambit of public finance. 
The new mandate-holder should take into account the plans of the Working Group in defining 
workplans and the focus of intervention in order to ensure complementarities.  
</p>
<p>41. The new mandate-holder should also call for greater engagement by the stakeholders, 
notably States, international financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and 
non-governmental organizations. For example, the World Bank and IMF have both developed 
expertise in the areas of social impact assessment and social policy and protection. It is important 
to acknowledge that efforts have been made by a variety of organizations and individuals to look 
into the impact of public finance on human rights. Seeking collective wisdom will be essential to 
produce recommendations, which can be accepted and implemented by the parties concerned. In 
this context, the consultation organized in July 2007 was extremely helpful in bringing together 
different viewpoints, and a similar mechanism should be contemplated to continue to support the 
work of the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

<p>42. <b>The independent expert is submitting to the Human Rights Council at its session the

standards or core content in the areas of economic, social and cultural rights. Such 
standards must be coherent with the provisions of international human rights law, in 
particular the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and take 
into account the relevant general comments of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. The existence of such standards would be an important step towards the 
implementation of the general guidelines.   
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>Shareholders and member States of organizations such as the World Bank and IMF 
are bound by international human rights law. They should therefore review their own 
internal procedures and institutional set-ups, including their articles of agreement if 
necessary,  in order to harmonize them with international human rights law.  Integration 
of human rights obligations within the overall objectives of all multilateral organizations 
would reduce the risk of conflicting and contradictory policy advice to developing 
countries.   </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>45. <b>With regard to the review of the mandate on the effects of economic reform policies 
and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, it is the considered opinion and 
recommendation of the independent expert that it is necessary to both redefine and rename 
the mandate with a view to achieving a more specific focus on economic management. The 
renewed and reformulated mandate would henceforth examine the impact of public 
finance management on the achievement of fundamental human rights. In essence, the 
thematic areas of foreign debt and international financial assistance should be repositioned 
as a part of more comprehensive public financial management. The central issue to be 
tackled would, therefore, be how to secure a sufficient fiscal space to respect human rights 
standards while receiving financial assistance with non-disabling repayment obligations.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The new mandate-holder charged with assisting the Council in examining the 
question of human rights and public finance could be invited to further review, revise and 
develop the draft general guidelines. Future work on the general guidelines could also 
include the development of analytical tools and operational guidance facilitating their 
implementation. Such tools would include human rights impact assessment, formulation of 
minimum standards and identification of core content, human rights-based budgeting and 
measures to strengthen the accountability of international financial institutions with regard 
to their international human rights obligations. Quantification of human rights obligations 
will remain a key problem in the link between public finance, including debt service, and 
human rights. Costing exercises would be an essential part of such analyses and advice on 
additional required fiscal space, debt relief, development aid or domestic revenues might 
be required. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>Many of the issues regarding this mandate are also relevant to the right to 
development. Working relationships between the mandate-holder and the Working Group 
on the Right to Development and its high-level task force should be strengthened. The 
independent expert should take into account their work in order to ensure 
complementarity of their action. Moreover, the mandate should gain more support from 
the various stakeholders, notably States, international financial institutions, other 
United Nations bodies and non-governmental organizations.
