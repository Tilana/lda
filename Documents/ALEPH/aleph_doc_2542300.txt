IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR YOU TO READ
THE DEADLINE TO VOTE ON THE JOINT PREPACKAGED CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF
HERCULES OFFSHORE, INC., ET AL. IS AUGUST 12, 2015 AT 5:00 P.M. PREVAILING
EASTERN TIME.
FOR YOUR VOTE TO BE COUNTED, YOUR BALLOT MUST BE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY
THE VOTING AND CLAIMS AGENT BEFORE THE VOTING DEADLINE AS DESCRIBED
HEREIN.
The information contained in this disclosure statement including the Exhibits annexed hereto
(collectively, the “Disclosure Statement”) is included herein for purposes of soliciting
acceptances of the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Hercules Offshore,
Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates (the “Plan”) and may not be relied upon for any purpose other than to
determine how to vote on the Plan. The Bankruptcy Court has not approved the adequacy of
the disclosure contained in this Disclosure Statement or the merits of the Plan. No person
is authorized by the Debtors in connection with the Plan or the solicitation of acceptances of the
Plan to give any information or to make any representation regarding this Disclosure Statement
or the Plan other than as contained in this Disclosure Statement and the Exhibits annexed
hereto, incorporated by reference or referred to herein, and if given or made, such information or
representation may not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Debtors.
The Disclosure Statement shall not be construed to be advice on the tax, securities, financial,
business, or other legal effects of the Plan as to holders of Claims against, or Equity Interests in,
the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or any other person. Each holder should consult with its
own legal, business, financial, and tax advisors with respect to any matters concerning this
Disclosure Statement, the solicitation of votes to accept the Plan, the Plan, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.
The Debtors urge the holders of Senior Notes Claims in Class 3, the only Class of Claims
entitled to vote on the Plan, to (1) read the entire Disclosure Statement and Plan carefully;
(2) consider all of the information in this Disclosure Statement, including, importantly, the
risk factors described in Article XI of this Disclosure Statement; and (3) consult with your
own advisors with respect to reviewing this Disclosure Statement, the Plan, and all
documents that are attached to the Plan and Disclosure Statement before deciding
whether to vote to accept or reject the Plan. Plan summaries and statements made in this
Disclosure Statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Plan and the Exhibits
annexed to the Plan and this Disclosure Statement. Please be advised, however, that the
statements contained in this Disclosure Statement are made as of the date hereof unless another
time is specified herein, and holders of Claims reviewing this Disclosure Statement should not
infer at the time of such review that there has not been any change in the information set forth
herein since the date hereof unless so specified. In the event of any conflict between the
descriptions set forth in this Disclosure Statement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan
shall govern.
See the Risk Factors in Article XI of the Disclosure Statement for certain risks that you
should carefully consider.
The financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Disclosure Statement
has not been audited, except as specifically indicated otherwise. The Debtors’ management, in
consultation with
i
their advisors, has prepared the Financial Projections (as defined below) attached hereto as
Exhibit D and described in this Disclosure Statement. The Debtors’ management did not prepare
the projections in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) or
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or to comply with the rules and regulations
of the SEC or any foreign regulatory authority. The financial projections, while presented with
numerical specificity, necessarily were based on a variety of estimates and assumptions that are
inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Debtors’ management. Important
factors that may affect actual results and cause the management forecasts not to be achieved
include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Debtors’ businesses
(including their ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives, and targets over applicable periods),
industry performance, the regulatory environment, general business and economic conditions
and other factors. The Debtors caution that no representations can be made as to the accuracy of
these projections or to their ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the
forecasts or that the forecasted results will be achieved. Therefore, the financial projections may
not be relied upon as a guarantee or other assurance that the actual results will occur.
As to contested matters, existing litigation involving, or possible litigation to be brought by, or
against, the Debtors, adversary proceedings, and other actions or threatened actions, this
Disclosure Statement and Plan shall not constitute, or be construed as, an admission of any fact
or liability, a stipulation, or a waiver, but rather as a statement made without prejudice solely for
settlement purposes in accordance with Federal Rule of Evidence 408, with full reservation of
rights, and is not to be used for any litigation purpose whatsoever by any person, party, or entity.
The Board of Directors (or equivalent thereof, as applicable) of each of the Debtors has
approved the Plan and recommends that the holders of Senior Notes Claims (Class 3) vote
to accept the Plan. The Plan has been negotiated with, and has the support of, the
Steering Group, an ad hoc group of holders of Senior Notes that together hold in excess
of 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. This Disclosure
Statement, the Plan, and the accompanying documents have been extensively negotiated
with the legal and/or financial advisors to the Steering Group. The votes on the Plan are
being solicited in accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement dated as of
June 17, 2015 (as may be amended from time to time), which was executed by the Debtors
and each of the members of the Steering Group.
The Debtors intend to confirm the Plan and cause the Effective Date to occur promptly after
confirmation of the Plan. There can be no assurance, however, as to when and whether
confirmation of the Plan and the Effective Date actually will occur. The confirmation and
effectiveness of the Plan are subject to material conditions precedent. See Section VIII.A
—“Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness.” There is no assurance that these conditions will be
satisfied or waived. Procedures for distributions under the Plan are described under Section VII.F
—“Distributions Under the Plan.” Distributions will be made only in compliance with these
procedures.
If the Plan is confirmed by the Court and the Effective Date occurs, all holders of Claims against,
and Equity Interests in, the Debtors (including, without limitation, those holders of Claims and
Equity Interests that do not submit ballots to accept or reject the Plan or that are not entitled to
vote on the Plan) will be bound by the terms of the Plan and the transactions contemplated
thereby.
If the financial restructuring of the indebtedness contemplated by the Plan is not approved and
consummated, there can be no assurance that the Debtors will be able to effectuate an
alternative restructuring or successfully emerge from its chapter 11 cases, and the Debtors may
be forced into a liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or under the laws of other
countries. As reflected in the Liquidation Analysis (as defined below), the Debtors believe that if
operations are terminated and their assets are liquidated under chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, the value of the assets available for payment to creditors
and interest holders would be significantly lower than the value of the distributions
contemplated by and under the Plan.
ii
SPECIAL NOTICE REGARDING FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS
As of the date of distribution, neither this Disclosure Statement nor the Plan has been filed
with or reviewed by the Court, and neither this Disclosure Statement nor the Plan has been
filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any state
authority. The Plan has not been approved or disapproved by the SEC or any state
securities commission and neither the SEC nor any state securities commission has
passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Disclosure Statement or the merits of the
Plan. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
This Disclosure Statement has been prepared pursuant to section 1125 of the Bankruptcy
Code and Bankruptcy Rule 3016(b) (but has not yet been approved by the Court as
complying with section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 3016(b)). The
securities to be issued under the Plan on or after the Effective Date will not have been the
subject of a registration statement filed with the SEC under the Securities Act or any
securities regulatory authority of any state under any state securities laws (“Blue Sky
Laws”).
Prior to the filing of the chapter 11 cases, the Debtors will rely on the exemption provided
by section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable exemptions
from Blue Sky Laws. After the commencement of the chapter 11 cases, the Debtors intend
to rely on the exemption from the Securities Act and Blue Sky Laws registration
requirements provided by section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code to exempt the
issuance of securities issued under, or in connection with, the Plan.
Each holder of a Senior Notes Claim will be required to certify on its ballot whether it is an
Accredited Investor or a Qualified Institutional Buyer. If a holder of Senior Notes Claims is
not an Accredited Investor or a Qualified Institutional Buyer, its vote will not be counted.
Neither the Solicitation nor this Disclosure Statement constitutes an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or
solicitation is not authorized.
See the Risk Factors in Article XI of the Disclosure Statement for certain risks that you
should carefully consider.
This Disclosure Statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements consist of any
statement other than a recitation of historical fact and can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “intend,”
“consider,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” “estimate,” or “continue”
or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. You are
cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual events or results to differ materially from those referred to in such forward-
looking statements. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include those in Article V: “Certain Risk Factors to be Considered,” generally and in
particular “Additional Factors to be Considered—Forward-Looking Statements are not
Assured, and Actual Results May Vary.” The Liquidation Analysis set forth in Exhibit E,
distribution projections and other information contained herein and annexed hereto are
estimates only, and the timing and amount of actual distributions to Holders of Allowed
Claims and Allowed Equity Interests may be affected by many factors that cannot be
predicted. Any analyses, estimates or recovery projections may or may not turn out to be
accurate.

Parties in Interest May Object to the Debtors’ Classification of Claims and Interests
Contingencies Not to Affect Votes of Impaired Classes to Accept or Reject the Plan
The Debtors May Fail to Satisfy the Solicitation Requirements Requiring a Re-
Solicitation
The Restructuring Support Agreement Could be Terminated
Risk of Non-Confirmation, Non-Occurrence, or Delay of the Plan
Risk of Non-Occurrence of the Effective Date
Impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Debtors
The Plan is Based Upon Assumptions the Debtors Developed which May Prove
Incorrect and Could Render the Plan Unsuccessful
C. Certain Risks Related to the Debtors’ Business and Operations
The Company’s Business Depends on the Level of Activity in the Oil and Natural
Gas Industry, which is Significantly Affected by Volatile Oil and Natural Gas Prices
The Offshore Service Industry is Highly Cyclical and Experiences Periods of Low
Demand and Low Dayrates. The Volatility of the Industry has in the Past Resulted
and Could Again Result in Sharp Declines in the Company’s Profitability
Maintaining Idle Assets or the Sale of Assets Below Their Then Carrying Value May

Maintaining Idle Assets or the Sale of Assets Below Their Then Carrying Value May
Cause the Company to Experience Losses and May Result in Impairment Charges
HERO is a Holding Company, and it is Dependent Upon Cash Flow From
Subsidiaries to Meet Financial Obligations
Many Customer Contracts are Short Term, and Customers May Seek to Terminate,
Renegotiate or Decline to Renew Contracts During Depressed Market Conditions,
Which Will Result in Reduced Revenue and Profitability
Hercules can Provide No Assurance That its Current Backlog of Contract Revenue
and Receivables Will be Ultimately Realized
A Significant Portion of The Company’s Business is Conducted in Shallow-Water
Areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Mature Nature of This Region Could Result in
Less Drilling Activity in the Area, Thereby Reducing Demand for the Company’s
Services and Requiring Hercules to Cold Stack Additional Rigs
The Debtors’ Industry is Highly Competitive, With Intense Price Competition. The
Debtors’ Inability to Compete Successfully may Reduce Profitability
An Increase in Supply of Rigs or Liftboats Could Adversely Affect the Debtors’
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Asset Sales Have Been an Important Component of the Company’s Business
Strategy. Hercules may be Unable to Identify Appropriate Buyers With Access to
Financing or to Complete any Sales on Acceptable Terms
The First Lien Exit Facility Will Impose Significant Additional Costs and Operating
and Financial Restrictions on the Company, Which May Prevent Hercules From
Capitalizing on Business Opportunities and Taking Certain Actions
The Company’s International Operations are Subject to Additional Political,
Economic, and Other Uncertainties not Generally Associated With Domestic
Operations
vii
More of the Company’s Existing Jackup Rigs are at a Relative Disadvantage to
Higher Specification Rigs, Which May be More Likely to Obtain Contracts Than
Lower Specification Jackup Rigs Such as the Company’s
A Small Number of Customers Account for a Significant Portion of the Company’s
Revenue, and the Loss of One or More of These Customers Could Adversely Affect
the Company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The Company’s Business Involves Numerous Operating Hazards and Exposure to
Extreme Weather and Climate Risks, and the Company’s Insurance may not be
Adequate to Cover its Losses
The Company’s Insurance Coverage has Become More Expensive, May Become
Unavailable in the Future and May be Inadequate to Cover its Losses
The Company’s Customers may be Unable or Unwilling to Indemnify It
HERO Expects That its Common Stock Will Become Delisted from Trading on
NASDAQ Following the Petition Date
Any Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) or Similar Laws and
Regulations Could Result in Significant Expenses, Divert Management Attention,
and Otherwise Have a Negative Impact
The Company’s International Operations May Subject it to Political and Regulatory

Operations and its Financial Results
Hercules Cannot Guarantee the Timely Completion and Delivery of its Newbuild Rig
that is Being Constructed And that is Currently Scheduled for Delivery in April 2016
Hercules Cannot Guarantee that Hercules Highlander Will be Completed or Pass
the Acceptance Tests
Failure to Retain or Attract Skilled Workers Could Hurt the Company’s Operations
Governmental Laws and Regulations, Including Those Arising Out of the Macondo
Well Incident and Those Related to Climate Change and Emissions of Greenhouse
Gases, May Add to the Company’s Costs or Limit Drilling Activity
Compliance With or a Breach of Environmental Laws and Regulations can be Costly
and Could Limit the Company’s Operations
 76  
Hercules May Not Be Able to Maintain or Replace its Rigs and Liftboats as They Age  76  
The Company’s Operating and Maintenance Costs With Respect to its Rigs Include
Fixed Costs That Will Not Decline in Proportion to Decreases in Dayrates
Upgrade, Refurbishment and Repair Projects are Subject to Risks, Including Delays
and Cost Overruns, Which Could Have an Adverse Impact on the Company’s
Available Cash Resources and Results of Operations
 77  
Hercules is Subject to Litigation That Could Have an Adverse Effect on its Business  78  
The Company’s Operations Present Hazards and Risks That Require Significant
and Continuous Oversight, and it Depends Upon the Security and Reliability of its
Technologies, Systems and Networks in Numerous Locations Where it Conducts
Business
Changes in Effective Tax Rates, Taxation of the Company’s Foreign Subsidiaries,
Limitations on Utilization of the Company’s Net Operating Losses or Adverse
Outcomes Resulting From Examination of the Company’s Tax Returns Could
Adversely Affect its Operating Results and Financial Results

I. INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Hercules Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“HERO”) and certain of its direct and indirect
subsidiaries (the “Debtor Subsidiaries,”) which intend to become chapter 11 debtors and
debtors in possession (the “Debtors”) in chapter 11 cases to be filed (the “Chapter 11 Cases”),
submit this Disclosure Statement pursuant to section 1126 of title 11 of the United States Code
(the “Bankruptcy Code”) for use in the solicitation of votes on the Plan. A copy of the Plan is
annexed as Exhibit A to this Disclosure Statement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Debtors’ foreign direct and indirect subsidiaries are not presently contemplated to be
debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases.
HERO provides shallow-water drilling and marine services to the oil and natural gas exploration
and production industry globally through its Domestic Offshore, International Offshore and
International Liftboats segments (as discussed further below). At June 23, 2015, the Debtors and
their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries (collectively, “Hercules” or the “Company”) operated a fleet of 27
jackup rigs, including one rig under construction, and 24 liftboat vessels. Hercules’ diverse fleet
is capable of providing services such as oil and gas exploration and development drilling, well
service, platform inspection, maintenance and decommissioning operations in several key
shallow-water provinces around the world.
The purpose of this Disclosure Statement is to provide information of a kind, and in sufficient
detail, to enable creditors of the Debtors that are entitled to vote on the Plan to make informed
decisions on whether to vote to accept or reject the Plan. This Disclosure Statement sets forth
certain information regarding the Debtors’ prepetition operating and financial history, the Debtors’
need to seek chapter 11 protection, significant events that are expected to occur during the
Chapter 11 Cases, and the Debtors’ anticipated organization, operations, and liquidity upon
successful emergence from chapter 11 protection.
The Plan and this Disclosure Statement are the result of extensive and vigorous negotiations
among the Debtors and the Steering Group, which is an ad hoc group of holders of Senior Notes
that collectively hold in excess of 66 2/3% of the Senior Notes. The culmination of such
negotiations was the entry into the Restructuring Support Agreement (as may be amended from
time to time, the “Restructuring Support Agreement”), a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit B. The Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth the material terms and conditions of
the restructuring provided for in the Plan and described herein (the “Restructuring”). As
described in more detail below, the Plan substantially deleverages the Debtors’ balance sheet by
converting approximately $1.2 billion of debt under the Senior Notes into 96.9% of the equity in
Reorganized HERO. As part of the overall settlement embodied in the Restructuring Support
Agreement and the Plan, the holders of Senior Notes are voluntarily forgoing their right to part of
the distributions under the Plan that they are otherwise entitled to receive so that the Debtors can
(i) pay in full allowed general unsecured claims, such as the claims of suppliers and vendors, in
the ordinary course according to existing business terms and (ii) provide a pro rata distribution of
a portion of the New HERO Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants to holders of HERO
Equity Interests in exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their Equity Interests.
The key components of the Plan are as follows:
•
•
•
•
Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims, including Allowed Claims of trade
vendors, suppliers, and customers, will not be affected by the filing of the Chapter 11
Cases and, subject to Court approval, are anticipated to be paid in full in the ordinary
course of business during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or reinstated and
left unimpaired under the Plan in accordance with their terms as part of the overall
compromise embodied in the Plan.
Payment in full, in cash, of all Allowed Administrative Claims, Fee Claims, Priority
Tax Claims, statutory fees, Other Priority Claims, and Other Secured Claims.
Holders of Allowed Senior Notes Claims will receive their Pro Rata share of 96.9%
on a fully diluted basis (subject only to the New HERO Warrants and the New HERO
Management Incentive Program Equity) of the New HERO Common Stock
outstanding as of the Effective Date.
1
In addition, each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim that is an Eligible
Noteholder shall have the opportunity to participate, on a Pro Rata basis, in the First
Lien Exit Facility in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the First
Lien Exit Facility Subscription Procedures during the period from the Petition Date
through the date of the Confirmation Hearing.
•
•
HERO Equity Interests shall be cancelled and discharged and shall be of no further
force or effect, whether surrendered for cancellation or otherwise, and holders of
HERO Equity Interests shall not receive or retain any property under the Plan on
account of such HERO Equity Interests; provided, however, that on the Effective
Date, holders of HERO Equity Interests shall receive, in exchange for the surrender
or cancellation of their HERO Equity Interests and for the releases by such holders of
the Released Parties, their Pro Rata share of (1) 3.1% of the New HERO Common
Stock on a fully diluted basis (subject only to the New HERO Warrants and the
Management Incentive Program Equity) and (2) the New HERO Warrants; provided,
further, that holders of HERO Equity Interests that opt not to grant the voluntary
releases contained in the Plan shall not be entitled to receive their Pro Rata share of
such New HERO Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants and shall not
receive any consideration in exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their
HERO Equity Interests.
Entry into the new $450 million First Lien Exit Facility, which will be used (i) to pay
for the construction and purchase of the Hercules Highlander, a newbuild jackup rig
that is expected to be delivered in April 2016, (ii) to pay all restructuring fees and
costs and other payments required under the Plan, and (iii) for working capital and
general corporate purposes on and after the Effective Date.
The Debtors and the other parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement believe that the
restructuring contemplated by the Plan is in the best interests of all stakeholders because it
(i) achieves a substantial deleveraging of the Debtors’ balance sheet through consensus with the
overwhelming majority of the holders of Senior Notes, (ii) provides for a reduction of
approximately $50 million of the Debtors’ pre-Restructuring annual interest burden on previously
funded debt, (iii) provides $450 million of new financing in the form of the First Lien Exit Facility,
and (iv) eliminates potential deterioration of value—and disruptions to worldwide operations—
that could otherwise result from protracted and contentious bankruptcy cases. Importantly, the
Debtors would not be able to implement the conversion of debt-to-equity contemplated by the
Plan without the support of the Steering Group. In sum, the Plan embodies a global settlement as
part of an expeditious and consensual restructuring. This avoids potential litigation that could
decrease value for all stakeholders and delay (and possibly derail) the restructuring process. The
significant support obtained by the Debtors pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement
provides a fair and reasonable path for an expeditious consummation of the Plan and the
preservation of Hercules’ ordinary course of business.
As of the Effective Date, Reorganized HERO will be a reporting company under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of July 13, 2015, HERO common stock was listed for
trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker “HERO.” In March
2015, HERO received a letter from NASDAQ informing HERO that its common stock was below
the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ. Hercules expects that its
common stock will become delisted from trading on NASDAQ following the Petition Date and will
then be traded on the OTC Pink market. Reorganized HERO will use reasonable efforts to cause
the listing on NASDAQ of the New HERO Common Stock on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Date.
Additionally, as described in Section VII.E herein, the Plan provides for certain releases of
Claims against, among others, the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Non-Debtor
Subsidiaries, the parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Senior Notes
Indenture Trustees, and each of their professionals, employees, officers, and directors.
Because holders of HERO Equity Interests are substantially
2
out of the money under absolute priority principles, the Plan further provides that any
holder of HERO Equity Interests that opts not to grant the voluntary releases contained in
the Plan shall not receive the New HERO Equity Interests and New HERO Warrants that it
would otherwise be entitled to receive under the Plan and shall not receive any distribution
whatsoever under the Plan.
FOR A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLAN, YOU SHOULD READ THIS
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE PLAN, AND THE EXHIBITS THERETO IN THEIR
ENTIRETY. IF ANY INCONSISTENCY EXISTS BETWEEN THE PLAN AND THIS
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE TERMS OF THE PLAN ARE CONTROLLING. ALL
EXHIBITS TO THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ARE INCORPORATED INTO AND ARE A
PART OF THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AS IF SET FORTH IN FULL HEREIN.
THE DEBTORS HAVE NOT YET COMMENCED BANKRUPTCY CASES UNDER CHAPTER
11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE DEBTORS EXPECT TO FILE THEIR
BANKRUPTCY CASES AFTER THEY SOLICIT THE VOTES OF THE IMPAIRED CLASS OF
CLAIMS ENTITLED TO VOTE ON THE PLAN.
BECAUSE NO BANKRUPTCY CASES HAVE YET BEEN COMMENCED, THIS
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED BY ANY COURT WITH
RESPECT TO WHETHER IT CONTAINS ADEQUATE INFORMATION WITHIN THE MEANING
OF SECTION 1125(a) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. NONETHELESS, ONCE THE
CHAPTER 11 CASES ARE COMMENCED, THE DEBTORS EXPECT TO PROMPTLY SEEK
ENTRY OF AN ORDER OF THE COURT APPROVING THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
PURSUANT TO SECTION 1125 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND DETERMINING THAT
THE SOLICITATION OF VOTES ON THE PLAN BY MEANS OF THIS DISCLOSURE
STATEMENT WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 1125(a) OF THE BANKRUPTCY
CODE.
Each holder of a Claim entitled to vote on the Plan should read this Disclosure Statement, the
Plan, and the instructions accompanying the Ballots in their entirety before voting on the Plan.
These documents contain, among other things, important information concerning the
classification of Claims for voting purposes and the tabulation of votes. The statements contained
in this Disclosure Statement are made only as of the date hereof unless otherwise specified, and
there can be no assurance that the statements contained herein will be correct at any time
hereafter.
All creditors should also carefully read Article XI of this Disclosure Statement—“Certain
Risk Factors to be Considered”—before voting to accept or reject the Plan.
THE DEBTORS BELIEVE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN IS IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE DEBTORS, THEIR ESTATES, AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS. FOR ALL
OF THE REASONS DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS
URGE YOU TO RETURN YOUR BALLOT ACCEPTING THE PLAN BY THE VOTING
DEADLINE (I.E., THE DATE BY WHICH YOUR BALLOT MUST BE ACTUALLY RECEIVED),
WHICH IS AUGUST 12, 2015 AT 5:00 P.M. (PREVAILING EASTERN TIME).
II. SUMMARY OF THE CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY
INTERESTS UNDER THE PLAN
The Plan establishes a comprehensive classification of Claims and Equity Interests.3 The
following table summarizes the classification and treatment of Claims and Equity Interests
against each Debtor under the Plan and the estimated distributions to be received by the holders
of Allowed Claims under the Plan thereunder. Amounts assumed for purposes of projected
recoveries are estimates only; actual recoveries received under the Plan may differ materially
from the projected recoveries.
3 In accordance with section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan does not classify
Administrative Claims, Priority Tax Claims, U.S. Trustee Fees and Fee Claims.
3
The summaries in this table are qualified in their entirety by the description of the treatment of
such Claims in Article III of the Plan. All claims and interests against a particular Debtor are
placed in classes for each of the Debtors (as designated by subclasses a through o for each of
the 15 Debtors). Specifically, such subclasses represent Claims against and Equity Interests in
the Debtors as follows: Cliffs Drilling Company (subclass a); Cliffs Drilling Trinidad LLC
(subclass b); FDT LLC (subclass c); FDT Holdings LLC (subclass d); Hercules Drilling Company
LLC (subclass e); Hercules Liftboat Company LLC (subclass f); Hercules Offshore, Inc. (subclass
g); Hercules Offshore Services LLC (subclass h); Hercules Offshore Liftboat Company LLC
(subclass i); HERO Holdings, Inc. (subclass j); SD Drilling LLC (subclass k); THE Offshore
Drilling Company (subclass l); THE Onshore Drilling Company (subclass m); TODCO Americas,
Inc. (subclass n); and TODCO International, Inc. (subclass o).

4 For the avoidance of doubt, the projected recovery for holders of Senior Notes Claims does not
include any recovery attributable to the right of holders of Senior Notes Claims who are Eligible
Noteholders to participate in the First Lien Exit Facility.
4
In addition to the foregoing, each holder of an Allowed
Senior Notes Claim that is an Eligible Noteholder shall
have the opportunity to participate, on a Pro Rata basis,
in the First Lien Exit Facility in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in the First Lien Exit
Facility Subscription Procedures during the period from
the Petition Date through the date of the Confirmation
Hearing. The opportunity to participate in the First Lien
Exit Facility does not constitute a distribution to the
holders of Allowed Senior Notes Claims on account of
their Claims.
In full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and
discharge of, and in exchange for, each Allowed
General Unsecured Claim, on the Effective Date, each
holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim shall, at
the discretion of the Debtors (with the consent of the
Steering Group), and only to the extent such holder’s
Allowed General Unsecured Claim was not previously
paid in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to an
order of the Court, or otherwise: (i) have its Allowed
General Unsecured Claim Reinstated as an obligation of
the applicable Reorganized Debtor, and be paid in
accordance with ordinary course terms, (ii) receive such
other treatment as may be agreed between such holder
and the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group)
or (iii) receive such other treatment, as determined by the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), that
will render it Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the
Bankruptcy Code. Payment of an Allowed General
Unsecured Claim is subject to the rights of the Debtors,
Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest to
dispute such Claim as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not
been commenced in accordance with applicable
nonbankruptcy law.
In full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and
discharge of, and in exchange for, each Allowed
Intercompany Claim, on the Effective Date, each
Intercompany Claim shall be Reinstated. On and after
the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors and the
Non-Debtor Subsidiaries will be permitted to transfer
funds between and among themselves as they
determine to be necessary or appropriate to enable the
Reorganized Debtors to satisfy their obligations under
the Plan. Except as set forth herein, any changes to
intercompany account balances resulting from such
transfers will be accounted for and settled in accordance
with the Debtors’ and the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries’
historical intercompany account settlement practices.
On the Effective Date, Intercompany Interests shall be
Reinstated.

5 At May 31, 2015, the Company’s accounts payable was approximately $52 million on a
consolidated basis. The Company’s accounts payable balances fluctuate from month to month
depending upon business activity and other factors. The Debtors estimate Class 4 General
Unsecured Claims in the range of approximately $40 million.

On the Effective Date, HERO Equity Interests shall
be cancelled and discharged and shall be of no
further force or effect, whether surrendered for
cancellation or otherwise, and holders of HERO
Equity Interests shall not receive or retain any
property under the Plan on account of such HERO
Equity Interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on
or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date,
holders of HERO Equity Interests shall receive, in
exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their
HERO Equity Interests and for the releases by such
holders of the Released Parties, their Pro Rata
share of (1) the Shareholder Equity Distribution and
(2) the New HERO Warrants; provided, however,
that any holder of a HERO Equity Interest that opts
not to grant the voluntary releases contained in
Article VII.F of the Plan shall not be entitled to
receive its Pro Rata share of the Shareholder
Equity Distribution and the New HERO Warrants
and shall not receive any consideration in
exchange for the surrender or cancellation of its
HERO Equity Interests or any distribution
whatsoever under the Plan; and provided, further,
that, notwithstanding Article VIII.B.8, the Debtors
(with the consent of the Steering Group) may
provide any holder of a HERO Equity Interest that
would otherwise be entitled to receive a distribution
of less than one (1) share of the New HERO
Common Stock under Article III.D.7.(b) of the Plan
with a distribution of one (1) share of New HERO
Common Stock.

III. VOTING PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS
A. Classes Entitled to Vote on the Plan
The following Class is the only Class entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan (the “Voting
Class”):
Class
3
Claim or Interest
  Senior Note Claims
Status
  Impaired7
If your Claim or Equity Interest is not included in the Voting Class, you are not entitled to vote. If
your Claim is included in the Voting Class, you should read your ballot and carefully follow the
instructions included in the ballot. Please use only the ballot that accompanies the Disclosure
Statement or the ballot that the Debtors, or the Voting and Claims Agent on behalf of the Debtors,
otherwise provided to you.
B. Votes Required for Acceptance by a Class
Under the Bankruptcy Code, acceptance of a plan of reorganization by a class of claims or
interests is determined by calculating the amount and, if a class of claims, the number, of claims
and interests voting to accept, as a percentage of the allowed claims or interests, as applicable,
that have voted. Acceptance by a class of claims requires an affirmative vote of (i) at least two-
thirds in dollar amount of the total allowed claims that have voted and (ii) more than one-half in
number of the total allowed claims that have voted. Your vote on the Plan is important. The
Bankruptcy Code requires as a condition to confirmation of a plan of reorganization that each
class that is impaired and entitled to vote under a plan votes to accept such plan, unless the plan
is being confirmed under the “cram down” provisions of section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.
6 As discussed above, holders of Class 7 Equity Interests will receive no distribution on account
of their HERO Equity Interests, provided, however, that such holders that do not opt out of the
Releases contained in Article VII of the Plan shall receive their Pro Rata share of (i) 3.1% of the
New HERO Common Stock, and (ii) the New HERO Warrants.
7 Eligible Noteholders are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan. Any votes cast by Non-
Eligible Noteholders will not be counted.
6
C. Certain Factors To Be Considered Prior to Voting
There are a variety of factors that all holders of Claims entitled to vote on the Plan should
consider prior to voting to accept or reject the Plan. These factors may impact recoveries under
the Plan and include:
•
unless otherwise specifically indicated, the financial information contained in the
Disclosure Statement has not been audited and is based on an analysis of data
available at the time of the preparation of the Plan and the Disclosure Statement;
•
although the Debtors believe that the Plan complies with all applicable provisions of
•
•
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors can neither assure such compliance nor that the
Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan;
the Debtors may request Confirmation without the acceptance of all Impaired
Classes in accordance with section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code; and
any delays of either Confirmation or Consummation could result in, among other
things, increased Administrative Claims and Fee Claims.
While these factors could affect distributions available to holders of Allowed Claims under the
Plan, the occurrence or impact of such factors will not necessarily affect the validity of the vote of
the Voting Class or necessarily require a re-solicitation of the votes of holders of Claims in such
Voting Class.
For a discussion of certain risk factors, please refer to ARTICLE XI, entitled “Certain Risk
Factors to Be Considered,” of this Disclosure Statement.
D. Classes Not Entitled To Vote on the Plan
Under the Bankruptcy Code, holders of claims and interests are not entitled to vote if their
contractual rights are unimpaired by the proposed plan or if they will receive no property under
the proposed plan on account of their claims or interests, as applicable, or are otherwise deemed
to reject. As holders of HERO Equity Interests are not entitled to receive any distributions on
account of the valuation of the Debtors, the votes of holders of HERO Equity Interests will not be
solicited and such holders will be deemed to reject. In addition, because holders of HERO Equity
Interests are substantially out of the money under absolute priority principles, holders of HERO
Equity Interests that opt not to grant the releases contained in Article VII of the Plan shall not
receive the New HERO Equity Interests and New HERO Warrants that they would otherwise be
entitled to receive under the Plan and shall not receive any distribution whatsoever under the
Plan. Accordingly, the following Classes of Claims and Equity Interests are not entitled to vote to
accept or reject the Plan:
Class   Claim or Interest
Status
1    Other Priority Claims
  Unimpaired
2    Other Secured Claims

Section 1129(b) permits confirmation of a plan of reorganization notwithstanding the non-
acceptance of the plan by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, so long as
at least one impaired class of claims or interests votes to accept a proposed plan. Under that
section, a plan may be confirmed by a bankruptcy court if it does not “discriminate unfairly” and is
“fair and equitable” with respect to each non-accepting class.
The Debtors intend to pursue a “cram down” of the holders of HERO Equity Interests in Class 7,
who are deemed to have rejected the Plan for the reasons described in subsection D above.
F. Allowed Claims
Only administrative expenses, claims, and equity interests that are “allowed” may receive
distributions under a chapter 11 plan. An “allowed” administrative expense, claim or equity
interest means that a debtor agrees, or in the event of a dispute, that the Bankruptcy Court
determines by Final Order, that the administrative expense, claim or equity interest, including the
amount thereof, is in fact a valid obligation of, or equity interest in, a debtor.
G.
Impairment generally
Under section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code, a class of claims or equity interests is “impaired”
unless, with respect to each claim or interest of such class, the plan of reorganization (i) does not
alter the legal, equitable or contractual rights of the holders of such claims or interests or
(ii) irrespective of the holders’ right to receive accelerated payment of such claims or interests
after the occurrence of a default, cures all defaults (other than those arising from, among other
things, the debtor’s insolvency or the commencement of a bankruptcy case), reinstates the
maturity of the claims or interests in the class, compensates the holders of such claims or
interests for any damages incurred as a result of their reasonable reliance upon any acceleration
rights and does not otherwise alter their legal, equitable or contractual rights.
Only holders of allowed claims or equity interests in impaired classes of claims or equity
interests that receive or retain property under a proposed plan of reorganization, but are
not otherwise deemed to reject the plan (such as Class 7 HERO Equity Interests in these
cases), are entitled to vote on such a plan. Holders of unimpaired claims or equity interests
are deemed to accept the plan under section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code and are not entitled
to vote. Holders of claims or equity interests that do not receive or retain any property on account
of such claims or equity interests are deemed to reject the plan under section 1126(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code and are not entitled to vote.
H. Solicitation and Voting Process
Each holder of a Senior Notes Claim as of July 9, 2015 (the “Voting Record Date”) that is an
Eligible Noteholder is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan and shall receive the
Solicitation Package in accordance with the solicitation procedures. Except as otherwise set forth
herein, the Voting Record Date and all of the Debtors’ solicitation and voting procedures shall
apply to all holders of Claims or Equity Interests and other parties in interest.
The following summarizes the procedures for voting to accept or reject the Plan. Holders of
Senior Notes Claims, the only Voting Class under the Plan, are encouraged to review the
relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules and/or to consult their own
attorneys.

Voting Deadlines.
To be counted, your Ballot(s) must be actually received by the Voting and Claims Agent
no later than:
•
August 12, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. (Prevailing Eastern Time) for Holders of Senior Notes
Claims entitled to vote on the Plan. This is the “Voting Deadline.” If you do not
return your Ballot prior to the Voting Deadline or if you are not an Eligible
Noteholder, your vote will not be counted.
Voting Instructions.
If you are a holder of a Class 3 Senior Notes Claim, a Ballot is enclosed for the purpose of
voting on the Plan. BALLOTS ARE ONLY BEING SOLICITED FROM HOLDERS OF CLASS
3 CLAIMS THAT ARE ACCREDITED INVESTORS OR QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYERS. THE VOTE OF ANY HOLDER OF A CLASS 3 CLAIM THAT DOES NOT CERTIFY
THAT IT IS AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR OR QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER WILL
NOT BE COUNTED. IF YOU ARE NOT AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR OR QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER, PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETE THE BALLOT. HOWEVER,
PLEASE READ THE NON-ELIGIBLE NOTEHOLDER ELECTION ATTACHED TO THE
BALLOT AS EXHIBIT A AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS SET FORTH THEREIN IF YOU
ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RELEASES IN ARTICLE VII.F OF THE PLAN. IF YOU DO NOT
COMPLETE AND RETURN THE BENEFICIAL HOLDER ELECTION BY THE VOTING
DEADLINE, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE GRANTED THE RELEASES IN ARTICLE
VII.F OF THE PLAN.
Except as provided below, holders of Claims are required to vote all of their Claims within
a Class either to accept or reject the Plan and may not split their votes. Any Ballot received
that does not indicate either an acceptance or rejection of the Plan or that indicates both
acceptance and rejection of the Plan will be counted as an acceptance. Any Ballot
received that is not signed or that contains insufficient information to permit the
identification of the holder will be an invalid Ballot and will not be counted.
If you are the record holder of Claims that are beneficially owned by another party, you
may submit a separate Ballot with respect to such portion of Claims that are beneficially
owned by such third party, and the vote indicated on such separate Ballot may differ from
the vote indicated on Ballots submitted with respect to Claims that you beneficially own
yourself or that are beneficially owned by other parties. In no event may you submit
Ballots with respect to Claims in excess of the amount of Claims for which you are the
record holder as of the Voting Record Date.
9
Please sign and complete a separate Ballot with respect to each Claim, and return your
Ballot(s) in accordance with the instructions provided by your Nominee (as defined
below), so that your Pre-Validated Ballot (as defined below) or the Master Ballot reflecting
your vote is received by Prime Clerk by the Voting Deadline. Pre-Validated Ballots or
Master Ballots reflecting your vote should be returned to the Debtors’ voting agent, Prime
Clerk, by hand delivery, overnight courier, or first class mail to:
Hercules Ballot Processing
c/o Prime Clerk, LLC
830 Third Avenue, 9th Floor
New York, NY 10022
If you are the beneficial owner of a Senior Note Claim, please follow the directions listed on
your Ballot and read the Section below titled “Beneficial Owners of the Senior Notes”.
Only Ballots with an original signature will be counted. Email submission of ballots is not
permitted. Only Ballots (including Master Ballots submitted by a Nominee) received by
Prime Clerk by the Voting Deadline will be counted.
If delivery of a Ballot is by mail, it is recommended that voters use an air courier with
guaranteed next day delivery or registered mail, properly insured, with return receipt
requested. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. The
method of such delivery is at the election and risk of the voter.
A Ballot may be withdrawn by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to Prime Clerk, so
that Prime Clerk receives the notice before the Voting Deadline. In order to be valid, a
notice of withdrawal must (a) specify the name of the creditor who submitted the Ballot to
be withdrawn, (b) contain a description of the Claim(s) to which it relates, and (c) be signed
by the creditor in the same manner as on the Ballot. The Debtors expressly reserve the
right to contest the validity of any withdrawals of votes on the Plan.
After the Voting Deadline, any creditor who has timely submitted a properly completed
Ballot to Prime Clerk or a Nominee (defined below), which is then timely delivered to Prime
Clerk by the Voting Deadline, may change or withdraw its vote only with the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court or the consent of the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering
Group). If more than one timely, properly completed Ballot is received with respect to the
same Claim and no order of the Bankruptcy Court allowing the creditor to change its vote
has been entered before the Voting Deadline, the Ballot that will be counted for purposes
of determining whether sufficient acceptances required to confirm the Plan have been
received will be the timely, properly-completed Ballot determined by Prime Clerk to have
been received last.
Nominees are required to retain for inspection by the Court for one year following the
Voting Deadline the Ballots cast by their beneficial holders.
Nominees may elect to pre-validate the Beneficial Holder Ballot (a “Pre-Validated Ballot”)
by (i) signing the applicable Beneficial Holder Ballot and including its DTC Participant
Number, (ii) indicating on the Beneficial Holder Ballot the account number of such holder,
and the principal amount of Notes held by the Nominee for such beneficial holder, and
(iii) forwarding the Beneficial Holder Ballot (together with the full Solicitation Package) to
the beneficial holder for voting. The beneficial holder must then complete the information
requested in the Beneficial Holder Ballot (including indicating a vote to accept or reject the
Plan), review the certifications contained therein, and return the Beneficial Holder Ballot
directly to the Voting Agent in the pre-addressed, postage paid envelope included with the
Solicitation Package so that it is actually received by the Voting Agent on or before the
Voting Deadline. A list of beneficial holders to whom the Nominee sent Pre-Validated
Ballots should be maintained by the Nominee for inspection for at least one year following
the Voting Deadline.
10
Votes cast by the beneficial holders through a Nominee and transmitted by means of a
Master Ballot or a Pre-Validated Ballot will be applied against the positions held by such
Nominee as evidenced by the list of record holders of Notes provided by the applicable
securities depository. The Debtors further propose that votes submitted by a Nominee on
a Master Ballot will not be counted in excess of the position maintained by the respective
Nominee on the Voting Record Date.8
To the extent that conflicting, double or over-votes are submitted on Master Ballots, the
Voting Agent shall attempt to resolve such votes prior to the vote certification in order to
ensure that the votes of beneficial holders of Notes are accurately tabulated.
To the extent that such conflicting double or over-votes are not reconcilable prior to the
vote certification, the Voting Agent is directed to count votes in respect of each Master
Ballot in the same proportion as the votes of the beneficial holders or entitlement holders
to accept or reject the Plan submitted on such Master Ballot, but only to the extent of the
applicable Nominee’s position on the Voting Record Date in the Notes.
For the purposes of tabulating votes, each beneficial holder shall be deemed (regardless
of whether such holder includes interest in the amount voted on its Ballot) to have voted
only the principal amount of its securities; any principal amounts thus voted may be
thereafter adjusted by the Voting Agent, on a proportionate basis to reflect the
corresponding claim amount, including any accrued but unpaid prepetition interest, with
respect to the securities this voted.
EACH BALLOT ADVISES HOLDERS OF CLAIMS THAT, IF THEY (1) (A) VOTE TO REJECT
THE PLAN OR (B) DO NOT CERTIFY ON THEIR BALLOT THAT THEY ARE AN
ACCREDITED INVESTOR OR QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR AND (2) DO NOT
ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RELEASE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE VII OF
THE PLAN, THEY SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE CONCLUSIVELY, ABSOLUTELY,
UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND FOREVER RELEASED AND DISCHARGED
ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE RELEASED PARTIES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN. ACCORDINGLY, IF YOU (1)(A) VOTE TO REJECT THE
PLAN OR (B) DO NOT CERTIFY THAT YOU ARE AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR OR
QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER AND (2) DO NOT ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE
RELEASE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE VII OF THE PLAN, YOU WILL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE GRANTED THE RELEASES CONTEMPLATED BY SUCH RELEASE
PROVISIONS.
HOLDERS OF CLAIMS WHO VOTE TO ACCEPT THE PLAN SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
CONCLUSIVELY, ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND FOREVER
RELEASED AND DISCHARGED ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE
RELEASED PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN. EACH BALLOT ALSO
ADVISES HOLDERS OF CLAIMS THAT, IF THEY FAIL TO RETURN A BALLOT VOTING
EITHER TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN OR FAIL TO RETURN A PROPERLY
COMPLETED NON-ELIGIBLE HOLDER ELECTION, THEY SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
CONCLUSIVELY, ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND FOREVER
RELEASED AND DISCHARGED ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE
RELEASED PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN.
NON-VOTING CLASSES INCLUDE UNIMPAIRED CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS.
UNIMPAIRED CLAIMS ARE ALSO DEEMED TO HAVE CONCLUSIVELY,
8 Each Nominee will distribute the Solicitation Packages, as appropriate, in accordance with
their customary practices and obtain votes to accept or reject the Plan also in accordance with
their customary practices. If it is the Nominee’s customary and accepted practice to submit a
“voting instruction form” to the beneficial holders for the purpose of recording the beneficial
holder’s vote, the Nominee is authorized to send the voting information form; provided,
however, that the nominee also distribute the appropriate ballot form approved by the
Solicitation Procedures Order.
11
ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND FOREVER RELEASED AND
DISCHARGED ALL CLAIMS AND/OR INTERESTS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST
THE RELEASED PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. HOLDERS OF EQUITY INTERESTS
WILL RECEIVE THE EQUITY RELEASE CONSENT NOTICE. EACH EQUITY RELEASE
CONSENT NOTICE ADVISES HOLDERS OF HERO EQUITY INTERESTS THAT DO NOT
ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RELEASE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE VII OF
THE PLAN, SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE CONCLUSIVELY, ABSOLUTELY,
UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND FOREVER RELEASED AND DISCHARGED
ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE RELEASED PARTIES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN. BECAUSE HOLDERS OF HERO EQUITY INTERESTS
ARE SUBSTANTIALLY OUT OF THE MONEY UNDER ABSOLUTE PRIORITY PRINCIPLES,
HOLDERS OF HERO EQUITY INTERESTS THAT ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RELEASE
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE VII OF THE PLAN SHALL NOT RECEIVE THE NEW
HERO EQUITY INTERESTS AND NEW HERO WARRANTS THAT THEY WOULD
OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UNDER THE PLAN.
ADDITIONALLY, AFTER AN ELECTION TO OPT OUT IS MADE BY A HOLDER OF HERO
EQUITY INTERESTS, SUCH ELECTION WILL BE BINDING ON ANY BUYER OF SUCH
HERO EQUITY INTERESTS IN ANY SUBSEQUENT SALE OR RE-SALE OF THE SHARES
PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH SHARES ARE CANCELLED. SPECIFICALLY, ONCE A
HOLDER THAT HOLDS ITS HERO EQUITY INTERESTS THROUGH DTC OPTS OUT
ELECTRONICALLY THROUGH DTC, (A) THE HOLDER WILL NO LONGER HAVE A RIGHT
TO SELL OR TRANSFER ANY HERO EQUITY INTERESTS EXCEPT MANUALLY IN
COOPERATION WITH DTC AND THE VOTING AGENT AND (B) THEIR HERO EQUITY
INTERESTS, AS STATED ABOVE, WILL BE CANCELLED AND DISCHARGED UNDER
THE PLAN AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND SUCH OPT OUT HOLDER WILL NOT
RECEIVE ANY CONSIDERATION OR DISTRIBUTIONS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER
UNDER THE PLAN. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, A TRADING MARKET FOR HERO
EQUITY INTERESTS HELD BY HOLDERS ELECTING TO OPT OUT OF THE RELEASES
MAY NOT EXIST AND ELECTING TO OPT OUT WILL LIKELY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
FOR SUCH OPT-OUT SHAREHOLDERS TO DISPOSE OF THEIR HERO EQUITY
INTERESTS OR TO REALIZE VALUE ON THE SHARES AT A TIME WHEN THEY MAY
WISH TO DO SO.
Beneficial Owners of the Senior Notes.
If you are a beneficial owner of Senior Notes, please use the Ballot for beneficial owners (a
“Beneficial Owner Ballot”) or the customary means of transmitting your vote to your
broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee (“Nominee”) to cast
your vote to accept or reject the Plan. You must return your completed Beneficial Owner
Ballot or otherwise transmit your vote to your Nominee so that your Nominee will have
sufficient time to complete a Ballot summarizing votes cast by beneficial owners holding
securities (each a “Master Ballot”), which must be forwarded to Prime Clerk by the Voting
Deadline. If your Beneficial Owner Ballot or other transmittal of your vote is not received by
your Nominee with sufficient time for your Nominee to submit its Master Ballot by the
Voting Deadline, your vote will not count.
If you are the Beneficial Owner of Senior Notes and hold them in your own name, you can
vote by completing a Beneficial Owner Ballot.
Do not return your Senior Notes or any other instruments or agreements that you may
have with your Ballot(s).
You may receive multiple mailings of this Disclosure Statement, especially if you own
Senior Notes through more than one brokerage firm, commercial bank, trust company, or
other nominee. If you submit more than one Ballot for a Class because you beneficially
own the securities in that Class through more than one broker or bank, you must indicate
in the appropriate item of the Ballot(s) the names of ALL broker-dealers or other
intermediaries who hold securities for you in the same Class.
12
Authorized signatories voting on behalf of more than one beneficial owner must complete
a separate Ballot for each such beneficial owner. Any Ballot submitted to a brokerage firm
or proxy intermediary will not be counted until the brokerage firm or proxy intermediary
(a) properly executes the Ballot(s) and delivers them to Prime Clerk, or (b) properly
completes and delivers a corresponding Master Ballot to Prime Clerk.
By voting on the Plan, you are certifying that you are the beneficial owner of the Senior
Notes (as of the Voting Record Date) being voted or an authorized signatory for the
beneficial owner. Your submission of a Ballot will also constitute a request that you (or in
the case of an authorized signatory, the beneficial owner) be treated as the record holder
of those securities for purposes of voting on the Plan.
Brokerage Firms, Banks, and Other Nominees.
A brokerage firm, commercial bank, trust company, or other nominee that is the agent on
behalf of a Senior Note for a beneficial owner, or an agent therefor, or that is a participant
in a securities clearing agency and is authorized to vote in the name of the securities
clearing agency pursuant to an omnibus proxy and is acting for a beneficial owner, can
vote on behalf of such beneficial owner by: (a)(i) distributing a copy of this Disclosure
Statement and all appropriate Ballots to the beneficial owners; (ii) collecting all such
Ballots; (iii) completing a Master Ballot compiling the votes and other information from the
Ballots and Elections collected; and (iv) transmitting the completed Master Ballot to Prime
Clerk; or (b) pre-validating the Beneficial Owner Ballot, and addressing such ballot as
returnable to Prime Clerk.
A proxy intermediary acting on behalf of a brokerage firm or bank may follow the
procedures outlined in the preceding sentence to vote on behalf of the beneficial owner. If
you are entitled to vote and you did not receive a Ballot, received a damaged Ballot or lost
your Ballot, please contact Prime Clerk in the manner set forth above.
I. The Confirmation Hearing
Shortly after commencing the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors will request that the
Bankruptcy Court schedule a hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan (the
“Confirmation Hearing”), at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware
(the “Bankruptcy Court”), 824 Market Street North, 3rd Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.
The Debtors will request confirmation of the Plan, as it may be modified from time to time
under section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in respect of the HERO Equity Interests,
and has reserved the right to modify the Plan to the extent, if any, that confirmation
pursuant to section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code requires modification.
IV. COMPANY BACKGROUND
See the Risk Factors in Article XI of the Disclosure Statement for certain risks that you
should carefully consider.
A. Business Segments and Organizational Structure
Hercules is a leading provider of shallow-water drilling and marine services to the oil and
natural gas exploration industry globally. The Company provides such services to
national oil and gas companies, major integrated energy companies and independent oil
and natural gas operators. Hercules currently reports its business activities in three
business segments: (1) Domestic Offshore, (2) International Offshore and (3) International
Liftboats. Hercules eliminates inter-segment revenue and expenses, if any.
The Company’s jackup rigs are used primarily for exploration and development drilling in
shallow waters. The Company’s liftboats are self-propelled, self-elevating vessels with a
large open deck space, which provides a versatile, mobile and stable platform to support a
broad range of offshore maintenance and construction services throughout the life of an
oil or natural gas well.
13
HERO is the ultimate parent of forty-two direct and indirect subsidiaries. Fifteen of those
subsidiaries are Debtors, and the remaining twenty-seven are Non-Debtors. The Debtor
entities are also the guarantors of the Senior Notes. As a general matter, the Debtors own
the Company’s Domestic Offshore segment, while the Non-Debtors own the Company’s
International Offshore and International Liftboats segments.
B. Fleet Status
Hercules posts a monthly fleet status report on its website at
http://www.herculesoffshore.com. The most current fleet status report as of June 23, 2015,
is attached hereto as Exhibit G.
C. Competition and Marketing
The shallow-water businesses in which Hercules operates are highly competitive.
Domestic drilling contracts are traditionally short term in nature, although Hercules has at
times been awarded longer term domestic drilling contracts. International drilling and
liftboat contracts are generally longer term in nature. The contracts are typically awarded
on a competitive bid basis. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which
qualified contractor is awarded a job, although technical capability of service and
equipment, unit availability, unit location, safety record and crew quality may also be
considered. Certain competitors in the shallow-water business may have greater financial
and other resources than Hercules. As a result, these competitors may have a better
ability to withstand periods of low utilization, compete more effectively on the basis of
price, build new rigs, acquire existing rigs, and make technological improvements to
existing equipment or replace equipment that becomes obsolete. Competition for offshore
rigs is usually on a global basis, as drilling rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a
cost that is sometimes substantial, from one region to another in response to demand.
However, the Company’s mat-supported jackup rigs are less capable than independent
leg jackup rigs of managing variable sea floor conditions found in most areas outside the
Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the Company’s ability to move its mat-supported jackup rigs to
certain regions in response to changes in market conditions is limited. Additionally, a
number of competitors have independent leg jackup rigs with generally higher
specifications and capabilities than most of the independent leg rigs that Hercules
currently operates. Particularly during market downturns when there is decreased rig
demand, higher specification rigs may be more likely to obtain contracts than lower
specification rigs.
D. Backlog
Hercules calculates its contract revenue backlog, or future contracted revenue, as the
contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days remaining on the contract assuming full
utilization, less any penalties or reductions in dayrate for late delivery or non-compliance
with contractual obligations. Backlog excludes revenue for management agreements,
mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. The
amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenue is earned
will be different than the backlog disclosed or expected due to various factors. Downtime
due to various operational factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance,
operational delays, health, safety and environmental incidents, weather events in the Gulf
of Mexico and elsewhere and other factors (some of which are beyond the Company’s
control), may result in lower dayrates than the full contractual operating dayrate. In some
of the contracts, the customer has the right to terminate the contract without penalty and
in certain instances, with little or no notice.
The Company’s backlog at June 23, 2015, totaled approximately $913,649,700 for its
executed contracts, including the Maersk contract for the newbuild jackup rig, Hercules
Highlander, which the Company expects to introduce into service in 2016. Approximately
$76,483,100 of this estimated backlog is expected to be realized during the remainder of
2015.
14
The following table reflects the amount of the Company’s contract backlog for its executed
contracts, including the Maersk contract for the newbuild jackup rig, Hercules Highlander,

E. Regulation
The Company’s operations are affected in varying degrees by federal, state, local and
foreign and/or international governmental laws and regulations regarding the discharge of
materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. The
industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and natural gas industry and,
accordingly, is also affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy
business generally. In the United States, Hercules is subject to the jurisdiction of the
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), U.S. Coast Guard (“Coast Guard”), the
National Transportation Safety Board (“NTSB”), the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(“CBP”), the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”)
and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), as well as
classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”). The Coast
Guard and the NTSB set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel
accidents and recommend improved safety standards, and the CBP is authorized to
inspect vessels at will. Coast Guard regulations also require annual inspections and
periodic drydock inspections or special examinations of vessels.
In the aftermath of the Macondo well blowout incident in April 2010, BSEE and BOEM have
proposed and implemented regulations and requirements that add safety measures,
increase permit scrutiny and add other requirements and policies such as contractor
sanctions that could materially increase the cost of offshore drilling in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico. Restrictions on oil and gas development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico, and the promulgation of notices to lessees have impacted and may continue to
impact the Company’s operations. In addition, the federal government has considered
legislation that could impose additional equipment and safety requirements on operators
and drilling contractors in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as regulations relating to the
protection of the environment, all of which could materially adversely affect the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
The shorelines and shallow-water areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are ecologically
sensitive. Heightened environmental concerns in these areas have led to higher drilling
costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process and, in general, have
adversely affected drilling decisions of oil and natural gas companies. In the United States,
the Company’s operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that
require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or governmental approvals; control the
discharge of materials into the environment; remove and cleanup materials that may harm
the environment; or otherwise comply with the protection of the environment. For
example, as an operator of mobile offshore units in navigable U.S. waters including the
OCS, and some offshore areas, Hercules may be liable for damages and costs incurred in
connection with oil spills or other unauthorized discharges of chemicals or wastes
resulting from or related to those operations. Failure to comply with these laws and
regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the
imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all
of the Company’s activities in the affected areas.
Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent over time
and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental
damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Some of these
laws and regulations may expose Hercules to liability
15
for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with
all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these legal
requirements or the adoption of new or more stringent legal requirements could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
The U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, commonly referred to
as the Clean Water Act, prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of
the United States without a permit. The regulations implementing the Clean Water Act
require permits to be obtained by an operator before specified discharge activities occur.
Offshore facilities must also prepare plans addressing spill prevention, control and
countermeasures. In place of the former Clean Water Act exemption, the EPA adopted a
Vessel General Permit, effective December 19, 2008, that required subject vessel
operators, including us, to obtain a Vessel General Permit for all of the Company’s
covered vessels by February 6, 2009. Hercules has obtained the necessary Vessel
General Permit for all of the Company’s vessels to which this permitting program applies
and has prepared Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans where appropriate.
In addition to the EPA’s issuance of the Vessel General Permit, some states are, and other
states are considering, regulating ballast water discharges. Violations of monitoring,
reporting and permitting requirements associated with applicable ballast water discharge
permitting programs or other regulatory initiatives may result in the imposition of civil and
criminal penalties. Moreover, Hercules has incurred added costs to comply with legal
requirements under the Vessel General Permit and may continue to incur further costs as
other legal requirements under federal and state ballast water discharge permit programs
are adopted and implemented, but Hercules does not believe that such compliance efforts
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
position.
The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), as amended, and related regulations impose a
variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention and/or reporting
of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters off the U.S. A
“responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or
vessel or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA
assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and
private damages. Under OPA, as amended by the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation Act of 2006, “tank vessels” are subject to certain specified liability limits.
Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA and the liability could be substantial.
Moreover, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross
negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction
or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the
cleanup, the liability limits likewise do not apply and certain defenses may not be available.
In addition, OPA imposes on responsible parties the need for proof of financial
responsibility to cover at least some costs in a potential spill. As required, Hercules has
provided satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility to the Coast Guard for all of the
Company’s vessels subject to such requirements.
The U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, authorizes regulations relating
to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on
the OCS. Included among these are regulations that require the preparation of spill
contingency plans and establish air quality standards for certain pollutants, including
particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides. Specific design and operational standards may apply to OCS vessels,
rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations of lease conditions or regulations
related to the environment issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act can
result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions
curtailing operations and canceling leases. Such enforcement liabilities can result from
either governmental or citizen prosecution.
The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as
amended, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund” law, imposes liability without regard
to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are
considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the
environment. These persons include the owner or operator of a facility where a release
occurred, the owner or operator of a vessel from which there is a release, and entities that
disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at a particular
site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under
CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the cost of cleaning up the
hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to
natural resources. Prior owners and operators are also subject to liability under CERCLA.
It is also not uncommon for third parties to file claims for personal injury and property
damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
Hercules generates wastes in the course of its routine operations that may be classified as
hazardous substances.
16
The U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, regulates the
generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of onshore hazardous and
non-hazardous wastes and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe
disposal of wastes. Hercules generates nonhazardous wastes and small quantities of
hazardous wastes in connection with routine operations. Hercules believes that all of the
wastes that it generates are handled in compliance in all material respects with the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws.
In recent years, a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security were adopted to
address terrorism risks, including the Coast Guard regulations implementing the Maritime
Transportation and Security Act of 2002. These regulations required, among other things,
the development of vessel security plans and on-board installation of automatic
information systems, or AIS, to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore
communications. Hercules believes that its vessels are in substantial compliance with all
vessel security regulations.
The United States is one of approximately 170 member countries to the International
Maritime Organization (“IMO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations that is
responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international
shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. Among the various international
conventions negotiated by the IMO is the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the
shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal
of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions.
Annex VI to MARPOL sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship
exhausts, prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances and includes
measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. Annex VI entered into force on May 19,
2005, and applies to all ships, fixed and floating drilling rigs and other floating platforms.
Annex VI also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for
specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls on sulfur
emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling rigs, Annex VI
imposes various survey and certification requirements. For this purpose, gross tonnage is
based on the International Tonnage Certificate for the vessel, which may vary from the
standard U.S. gross tonnage for the vessel reflected in the liftboat table previously. Annex
VI came into force in the United States on January 8, 2009. Moreover, on July 1, 2010,
amendments to Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention took effect requiring the imposition
of progressively stricter limitations on sulfur emissions from ships. As a result, limitations
imposed on sulfur emissions will require that fuels of vessels in covered Emission Control
Areas (“ECAs”) contain no more than 1% sulfur. In August 2012, the North American ECA
became enforceable. The North American ECA includes areas subject to the exclusive
sovereignty of the United States and extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coasts of
the United States, which area includes parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Consequently,
beginning on January 1, 2012, limits on marine fuel used to power ships in non-ECA areas
were capped at 3.5% sulfur and, in August 2012, when the North American ECA became
effective, the sulfur limit in marine fuel was capped at 1%, which is the capped amount for
all other ECA areas since July 1, 2010. These capped amounts will then decrease
progressively until they reach 0.5% by January 1, 2020 for non-ECA areas and 0.1% by
January 1, 2015 for ECA areas, including the North American ECA. The amendments also
establish new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine
engines, depending on their date of installation. The Company’s operation of vessels in
international waters, outside of the North American ECA, are subject to the requirements
of Annex VI in those countries that have implemented its provisions. Hercules believes the
rigs it currently offers for international projects are generally exempt from the more costly
compliance requirements of Annex VI and the liftboats it currently offers for international
projects are generally exempt from or otherwise substantially comply with those
requirements.
Accordingly, Hercules does not anticipate that compliance with MARPOL or Annex VI to
MARPOL, whether within the North American ECA or beyond, will have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position.
Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of international,
national, regional, state and local attention. Cap and trade initiatives to limit greenhouse
gas emissions have been introduced
17
in the European Union. Similarly, numerous bills related to climate change have been
introduced in the U.S. Congress, which could adversely impact most industries. In
addition, future regulation of greenhouse gas could occur pursuant to future treaty
obligations, statutory or regulatory changes or new climate change legislation in the
jurisdictions in which Hercules operates. It is uncertain whether any of these initiatives will
be implemented. Restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or other related legislative or
regulatory enactments could have an effect in those industries that use significant
amounts of petroleum products, which could potentially result in a reduction in demand
for petroleum products and, consequently and indirectly, the Company’s offshore support
services. Hercules is currently unable to predict the manner or extent of any such effect.
Furthermore, one of the asserted long-term physical effects of climate change may be an
increase in the severity and frequency of adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes,
which may increase insurance costs or risk retention, limit insurance availability or reduce
the areas in which, or the number of days during which, customers would contract for
vessels in general and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in particular. Hercules is currently unable
to predict the manner or extent of any such effect.
The Company’s non-U.S. operations are subject to other laws and regulations in countries
in which Hercules operates, including laws and regulations relating to the importation of
and operation of rigs and liftboats, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and natural
gas exploration and development, environmental protection, taxation of offshore earnings
and earnings of expatriate personnel, the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign
contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of rigs, liftboats and other
equipment. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in
regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding
concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and
natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental
activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by
major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less
developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable
as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal
matters and proceedings.
Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these
governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially adversely
affected the Company’s earnings or competitive position. Hercules believes that it is
currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental regulations to
which it is subject.
F. Properties
The Company’s property consists primarily of jackup rigs, liftboats and ancillary
equipment, substantially all of which it owns through various subsidiaries domestically
and internationally. U.S. domestic subsidiaries own substantially all of the assets located
in the U.S., and the foreign subsidiaries own substantially all of the assets overseas.
Certain of the rigs are owned by certain of the U.S. entities despite their location overseas.
Hercules maintains offices, maintenance facilities, yard facilities, warehouses, waterfront
docks as well as residential premises in various countries, including the United States,
United Kingdom, Nigeria, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and
Bahrain. All of these properties are leased except for an office and a warehouse in the
United Kingdom. The Company’s leased principal executive offices are located in
Houston, Texas.
G. Employees
As of June 22, 2015, Hercules had approximately 1,400 employees. The Debtors employ
approximately 785 employees, and Non-Debtor Subsidiaries employ approximately 615
employees. Hercules requires skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services
and support for its rigs and liftboats. As a result, Hercules conducts extensive personnel
training and safety programs. In the course of the last year as a result of prevailing
economic conditions, Hercules has reduced its total number of employees.
Certain of the Company’s employees in West Africa are working under collective
bargaining agreements. Additionally, efforts have been made from time to time to unionize
portions of the offshore workforce in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

H. The Debtors’ Pre-Petition Capital Structure.
Senior Secured Credit Facility
On April 3, 2012, HERO, as borrower, entered into a credit agreement (as amended on
July 8, 2013, the “Credit Agreement”) governing the senior secured revolving credit facility
(the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement provided for the $150 million
Senior Secured Credit Facility, with a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of
credit. HERO’s obligations under the Credit Agreement were guaranteed by the Debtor
Subsidiaries, and the obligations of HERO and the Debtor Subsidiaries were secured by
liens on substantially all of the vessels owned by HERO and the Debtor Subsidiaries,
together with certain accounts receivable, equity of subsidiaries, equipment and other
assets.
On June 22, 2015, the Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.
Accordingly, as of the date hereof, no amounts were owed under the Senior Secured
Credit Facility.
April 2019 Notes

the date hereof, approximately $7.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible
Notes remains outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest.
HERO Equity Interests
As of July 8, 2015, 161,637,220 shares of HERO Equity Interests were issued and
outstanding.
I. Significant Pre-Petition Contracts and Leases.
Drilling and Liftboat Contracts Generally
The Company’s contracts to provide services are individually negotiated and vary in their
terms and provisions. Currently, all of the Company’s drilling contracts are on a dayrate
basis. Dayrate drilling contracts typically provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with
higher rates while the unit is operating and lower rates or a lump sum payment for periods
of mobilization or when operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns,
adverse weather conditions or other factors.
A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering the drilling of a
single well or group of wells or covering a stated term. These contracts typically can be
terminated by the customer under various circumstances such as the loss or destruction
of the drilling unit or the suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as
a result of a breakdown of major equipment or due to events beyond the control of either
party. In addition, customers in some instances have the right to terminate contracts with
little or no prior notice, and without penalty or early termination payments. The contract
term in some instances may be extended by the customers exercising options for the
drilling of additional wells or for an additional term, or by exercising a right of first refusal.
Traditionally, most contracts in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been on a short-term basis of
less than six months. Contracts in international locations have historically been longer-
term, with contract terms of up to five years. For contracts over six months in term
Hercules may have the right to pass through certain cost escalations. Customers may
have the right to terminate, or may seek to renegotiate, existing contracts if Hercules
experiences downtime or operational problems above a contractual limit, if the rig is a total
loss, or in other specified circumstances. A customer is more likely to seek to cancel or
renegotiate its contract during periods of depressed market conditions. Hercules could be
required to pay penalties if some contracts with customers are canceled due to downtime
or operational problems. Suspension of drilling contracts results in the reduction in or
loss of dayrates for the period of the suspension.
20
A liftboat contract generally is based on a flat dayrate for the vessel and crew. Liftboat
dayrates are determined by prevailing market rates, vessel availability and historical rates
paid by the specific customer. Under most of its liftboat contracts, Hercules receives a
variable rate for reimbursement of costs such as catering, fuel, rental equipment and other
items. Liftboat contracts generally are for shorter terms than are drilling contracts.
On larger contracts, particularly outside the United States, Hercules may be required to
arrange for the issuance of a variety of bank guarantees, performance bonds or letters of
credit. The issuance of such guarantees may be a condition of the bidding process
imposed by customers for work outside the United States. The customer would have the
right to call on the guarantee, bond or letter of credit in the event Hercules defaults in the
performance of the services. The guarantees, bonds and letters of credit would typically
expire after Hercules completes the services.
Maersk and Highlander Agreements
In May 2014, a Non-Debtor Subsidiary of HERO signed a five-year drilling contract (the
“Maersk Agreement”) with Maersk Oil North Sea UK Limited (“Maersk”) for a newbuild
jackup rig, Hercules Highlander, that a Non-Debtor Subsidiary will own and operate.
Hercules expects performance under the Maersk Agreement to commence in mid-2016.
In support of the Maersk Agreement, in May 2014, a Non-Debtor Subsidiary signed a rig
construction contract with Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“JSL”) in Singapore with respect to
the Hercules Highlander (the “Highlander Agreement”). Hercules estimates the shipyard
cost of the Hercules Highlander at approximately $236 million. Including project
management, spares, commissioning and other costs, total delivery cost for the Hercules
Highlander is estimated at approximately $270 million of which approximately $244 million
remained to be paid at December 31, 2014. Hercules paid $23.6 million, or 10% of the
shipyard cost, to JSL in May 2014 and an additional 10% payment in May 2015. The final
80% of the shipyard payment will be due upon delivery of the rig, which is expected to be
in April 2016.
Saudi Aramco Agreements
Hercules has three rigs, Hercules 261, Hercules 262 and Hercules 266, under contract with
Saudi Aramco. Hercules 261 and Hercules 262 are operating under five-year contracts,
each of which are scheduled to terminate in the Fall 2019. The contract term for the
Hercules 266 is currently scheduled to expire between September 30, 2015 and April 8,
2016, at the discretion of Saudi Aramco. The originally contracted dayrate for Hercules
261, Hercules 262 and Hercules 266 was approximately $136,000, $118,000, and $125,000
per day, respectively. In June 2015, Hercules received notice from Saudi Aramco reducing
the dayrates for all three rigs to $67,000 per day. The reduced dayrates for Hercules 261
and Hercules 262 will apply from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016, and will
apply from January 1, 2015 for the remaining contract term for Hercules 266.
Eni Agreement
In March 2015, Hercules signed a five-year contract with a subsidiary of Eni S.p.A. for use
of the Hercules 260 in West Africa. The dayrate under the contract will range from a
minimum of $75,000 per day when the price of Brent crude oil is $86 or less per barrel, to a
maximum of $125,000 per day when the price of Brent crude oil is $125 or more per barrel.
This contract commenced in early April 2015.
Perisai Agreement
In November 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Perisai Drilling Sdn Bhd
(“Perisai”) whereby the Company agreed to market, manage and operate two Pacific Class
400 design new-build jackup drilling rigs, Perisai Pacific 101 and Perisai Pacific 102
(“Perisai Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Perisai Agreement, Hercules is
reimbursed for all operating expenses and Perisai pays for all capital
21
expenditures. Hercules receives a daily management fee for the rig and a daily operational
fee equal to 12% of the rig-based EBITDA, as defined in the Perisai Agreement. In August
2014, Perisai Pacific 101 commenced work on a three-year drilling contract in Malaysia.
Specific to the Perisai Agreement, Hercules recognized revenue and operating expenses
of $4.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2015
and $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2014.
These results are included in the Company’s International Offshore segment.
J. Pre-Petition Litigation.
Say-on-Pay Litigation
In June 2011, two separate shareholder derivative actions were filed purportedly on
HERO’s behalf in response to its failure to receive a majority advisory “say-on-pay” vote in
favor of HERO’s 2010 executive compensation. On June 8, 2011, the first action was filed
in the District Court of Harris County, Texas (the “Harris County Action”), and on June 23,
2011, the second action was filed in the United States Court for the District of Delaware
(the “Delaware Federal Action”). Subsequently, on July 21, 2011, the plaintiff in the Harris
County action filed a concurrent action in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Texas (the “Texas Federal Action” and, together with the Harris County Action
and the Delaware Federal Action, the “Say-on-Pay Litigation”). Each action named HERO
as a nominal defendant and certain of its officers and directors, as well as HERO’s
Compensation Committee’s consultant, as defendants.
Plaintiffs allege that HERO’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving
excessive executive compensation for 2010, that the Compensation Committee consultant
aided and abetted that breach of fiduciary duty, that the officer defendants were unjustly
enriched by receiving the allegedly excessive compensation, and that the directors
violated the federal securities laws by disseminating a materially false and misleading
proxy. The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount on HERO’s behalf from the
officer and director defendants, certain corporate governance actions, and an award of
their costs and attorney’s fees.
HERO and the other defendants have filed motions to dismiss the Say-on-Pay Litigation
for failure to make demand upon HERO’s board and for failing to state a claim. On June 11,
2012, the plaintiff in the Harris County Action voluntarily dismissed his action. On
March 14, 2013, HERO’s and the other defendants’ motions to dismiss the Delaware
federal action were granted. The motions to dismiss the Texas Federal Action are pending.
Hercules 265 Litigation
In January 2015, Cameron International Corporation (“Cameron”), and Axon Pressure
Products, Inc. and Axon EP, Inc. (collectively “Axon”) filed third-party complaints against
HERO in a subrogation action that Walter Oil & Gas Corporation (“Walter”) and its
underwriters, together with Walter’s working interest partners, Tana Exploration Company,
LLC and Helis Oil & Gas Company, LLC, filed against Cameron and Axon, among others,
to recover an undisclosed amount of damages relating to the well control incident at
South Timbalier 220 involving the Hercules 265 (the “Hercules 265 Litigation”). Cameron
and Axon also have filed answers and claims in a limitation of liability action that HERO
filed relating to the incident.
HERO has tendered defense and indemnity to Walter for the claims asserted by Cameron
and Axon, pursuant to the terms of the drilling contract between HERO and Walter. HERO
has also tendered defense and demanded indemnity to Axon for the claims asserted by
Cameron against HERO, pursuant to a Master Services Agreement between Axon and
HERO. Until such time as Walter and/or Axon accept the tender, HERO will vigorously
defend the claims.
EPA Notice of Potential Violation of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
In December 2014, HERO received a notice from the Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) alleging potential violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
related to hazardous waste generation requirements. HERO has executed a “Consent
Agreement and Final Order” with the EPA and has paid a penalty of approximately
$132,000 to resolve the matter.
Other Litigation Matters
22
HERO and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of other lawsuits, all of which have
arisen in the ordinary course of business. HERO does not believe that the ultimate liability,
if any, resulting from any such other pending litigation will have a material adverse effect
on its business or consolidated financial statements.
HERO cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the litigation matters
specifically described above or of any other pending litigation. There can be no assurance
that HERO’s belief or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any lawsuit or other
litigation matter will prove correct, and the eventual outcome of these matters could
materially differ from management’s current estimates.
V. EVENTS LEADING TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CHAPTER 11 CASES
A. Mobile Drilling Rig and Liftboat Market.
Demand for Hercules’ oilfield services is driven by its exploration and production
customers’ capital spending, which can experience significant fluctuation depending on
current commodity prices and their expectations of future price levels, among other
factors. The recent decline in the price of crude oil has negatively impacted dayrates and
demand for Hercules’ services. In addition to the oil price decline, the consolidation of the
domestic customer base has negatively impacted demand for jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico. Internationally, the new capacity growth expected over the next three years
could put further pressure on the operating environment for the existing jackup rig fleet.
Although activity levels for liftboats are not as closely correlated to commodity prices as
Hercules’ drilling segments, commodity prices are still a key driver of liftboat demand.
Demand for liftboat services in West Africa has been volatile, which Hercules believes has
been driven by budgetary constraints with major customers primarily in Nigeria.
On February 25, 2015, Hercules received a notice from Saudi Aramco terminating for
convenience its drilling contract for the Hercules 261, effective on or about March 27, 2015.
Hercules received subsequent notices from Saudi Aramco extending the effective date of
termination to May 31, 2015. On June 1, 2015, Hercules received notice from Saudi Aramco
reinstating the drilling contract on the Hercules 261, in exchange for dayrate concessions
on the Hercules 261, Hercules 262 and Hercules 266 from their existing contracted rates to
$67,000 per day. These reduced dayrates are effective retroactively from January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2016 for the Hercules 261 and Hercules 262, and through the
remaining contract term for the Hercules 266.
Hercules has taken numerous actions to mitigate the effects of the decline in activity
levels, including but not limited to: (i) cold stacking nine rigs and warm stacking four rigs
since the fourth quarter of 2014 to significantly reduce operating expenses;
(ii) significantly reducing its capital expenditures planned for 2015; and (iii) significantly
reducing its workforce, both onshore and offshore. Hercules continues to monitor its
operating environment and will respond to further activity level declines as appropriate.
Hercules cannot predict how an extended period of low commodity prices will affect its
operations and liquidity levels.
B. Certain Events that Set the Stage for the Restructuring and the Chapter 11 Cases.
Largely driven by the fluctuation in commodity prices, Hercules, like other companies in
the offshore drilling market, has faced challenges as demand for jackup rigs remains
weak, while the market is still scheduled to deliver a significant number of newbuild rigs in
the next several years.
Specifically, revenue generated from the Domestic Offshore segment for the first quarter
2015 decreased 63% to $52.9 million from $143.3 million in the first quarter 2014, driven by
lower utilization and dayrates on a reduced marketed rig fleet. Operating days during the
first quarter 2015 declined to 533 days with utilization of 60.1% as Hercules exited the
quarter with 9 marketed rigs, compared to 1,344 days on 18 marketed
23
rigs at 83.0% utilization during the first quarter 2014. Average revenue per rig per day
decreased to $99,203 in the first quarter 2015 from $106,596 in the comparable 2014
period. Operating expense decreased approximately 51% to $36.0 million in the first
quarter 2015 from $72.8 million in the first quarter 2014, largely attributable to the reduced
number of marketed rigs in operation. Domestic Offshore generated operating income of
$3.8 million in the first quarter 2015, compared to $51.5 million in the first quarter 2014.
International Offshore revenue declined to $51.6 million in the first quarter 2015, from $80.9
million in the first quarter 2014, driven largely by reduced utilization and partially offset by
slightly higher dayrates. Utilization decreased to 47.9% in the first quarter 2015 from 88.1%
in the first quarter 2014, largely due to scheduled downtime for equipment recertification
on the Hercules 262, as well as idle time on the Hercules Triumph, Hercules Resilience and
Hercules 260. Average revenue per rig per day increased to $149,704 in the first quarter
2015 from $136,030 in the first quarter of 2014, driven in part by a demobilization fee of $4.5
million received for the Hercules 208 following its contract conclusion, as well as higher
dayrates on the Hercules 261 and Hercules 262 as these rigs rolled to new contracts.
Operating expense in the first quarter 2015 was $50.2 million, up slightly from $47.5 million
in the respective 2014 period. Preparation costs for the Hercules 260 prior to commencing
its contract with a subsidiary of Eni S.p.A. in Gabon, as well as mobilization costs of the
Hercules 208 to Malaysia, contributed to the increase in segment operating expenses.
International Offshore recorded an operating loss of $20.9 million in the first quarter 2015
compared to operating income of $14.6 million in the prior year period.
International Liftboats revenue declined to $18.1 million in the first quarter 2015 from $32.5
million in the prior year period, due to lower utilization and dayrates. First quarter 2015
utilization of 38.1% reflects a continuation of lower activity in Nigeria as well as shipyard
work on multiple boats in both West Africa and the Middle East, and compares to 57.9%
utilization during the first quarter 2014 period. Average revenue per liftboat per day
decreased to $22,964 in the first quarter 2015 from $27,132 in the first quarter 2014,
primarily due to a shift in revenue mix toward the smaller class liftboats while larger boats
were in the shipyard. Operating expenses in the first quarter 2015 declined by 34% to $13.5
million, compared to $20.4 million in the first quarter 2014, reflecting lower activity levels
and the impact of the Company’s cost reduction measures. International Liftboats
recorded an operating loss of $0.4 million in the first quarter 2015 compared to operating
income of $5.6 million in the first quarter 2014.
C. Prepetition Restructuring Initiatives.
In early 2015, faced with a heavy debt burden and declining revenues, Hercules hired
financial and legal advisors to evaluate a wide range of options to improve Hercules’
financial position in the event of a prolonged market downturn. Hercules engaged Baker
Botts L.L.P. as legal restructuring counsel, Lazard as a financial advisor, and Deutsche
Bank as an investment banker. Hercules engaged in discussions with potential financing
sources and existing holders of Senior Notes to determine available options to enhance
liquidity, including new financing and deleveraging measures and considered both out-of-
court as well as bankruptcy court focused alternatives. Hercules and its Board of
Directors carefully considered and weighed each option with the benefit of advice from its
financial and legal advisors.
In March 2015, an ad hoc group of Hercules bondholders—that would ultimately become
the Steering Group—formed and hired professionals to advise the group about options to
protect their investment in Hercules bonds. The Steering Group engaged Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP as its legal counsel and the Blackstone Group as its financial
advisor. Thereafter, Hercules and the Steering Group entered into negotiations regarding
a potential restructuring transaction that would allow Hercules to substantially reduce its
debt burden and secure additional liquidity to help Hercules navigate the current
downcycle. The Restructuring Support Agreement, discussed below, contemplates a
value maximizing transaction for Hercules, providing for a balance sheet restructuring
while operations continue as usual. The new capital structure provided by the financial
restructuring contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan will
provide the best foundation for Hercules to meet the challenges in the global offshore
drilling market due to the downcycle in crude oil prices and the expected influx of
newbuild jackup rigs over the coming years as well as an opportunity for all of its existing
stakeholders to participate in any recovery. Although holders of existing equity interests
in HERO are out of the money and not entitled to a distribution under the Plan, the Plan
provides that holders of such equity interests will receive New HERO Equity Interests and
New HERO Warrants, so long as they do not opt out of granting the voluntary releases
24
contained in the Plan. Holders of existing equity interests that elect to not grant such
releases shall not receive any consideration under the Plan because such holders are
substantially out of the money under absolute priority principles.
In anticipation of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors opted to conserve cash and not to
make certain interest payments due on July 15, 2015 on certain of the Senior Notes. The
aggregate amount of those interest payments was $17.5 million.
D. The Restructuring Support Agreement.
On June 17, 2015, after weeks of intensive negotiations, the Debtors and the Steering
Group, who together hold in excess of two-thirds of the aggregate principal amounts
outstanding under the Senior Notes, entered into the Restructuring Support Agreement.
The Restructuring Support Agreement sets forth, subject to certain conditions, the
commitment to and obligations of, on the one hand, the Debtors, and on the other hand,
the Steering Group members in connection with a restructuring of the Senior Notes and
the HERO Equity Interests pursuant to the Plan. The Plan, which will substantially reduce
the Debtors’ debt burden and solidify the Debtors’ long-term growth and operating
performance, is based on the restructuring term sheet attached to and incorporated by
reference in the Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Term Sheet”).
Under the Plan as proposed, which requires Bankruptcy Court approval, the Debtors’
trade creditors, employees and vendors are expected to be paid in full in the ordinary
course of business, and all of the Debtors’ contracts are expected to remain in effect in
accordance with their terms preserving the rights of all parties.
Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Steering Group
Members have agreed, among other things, and subject to certain conditions:9
•  not to support any restructuring, reorganization, plan or sale process that is inconsistent
with the Restructuring Support Agreement;
•  not to instruct an agent or indenture trustee for any of the Senior Notes to take any action
that is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Restructuring Support Agreement,
including, without limitation, the declaration of an event of default, or acceleration of the
Senior Notes arising from, relating to, or in connection with the execution of the
Restructuring Support Agreement; and at the request of the Company, to waive or agree
to forbear from exercising any right to take action in respect of any default or acceleration
that may occur automatically without action of any as a result of the operation of the
indentures governing the Senior Notes; and
•  to vote to accept the Plan.
The Company has agreed, among other things, and subject to certain conditions:
•  to use reasonable best efforts to obtain approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the
documents required in connection with the Plan;
9 In the event of any inconsistency between this Disclosure Statement and the Restructuring
Support Agreement, the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement shall govern.
25
•  to take no action that is materially inconsistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement,
the Term Sheet or the Plan; and
•  not to support any alternative plan or transaction other than the Plan.
Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement, all documentation
necessary to implement the Plan and the Restructuring is subject to the approval of the
Steering Group Members, and thus, the Debtors may not make any filings with the
Bankruptcy Court without the approval of the Steering Group.
The Term Sheet contemplates that the Debtors will reorganize as a going concern and
continue their day-to-day operations substantially as currently conducted. The
Restructuring contemplated by the Term Sheet and the Plan is expected to provide a
substantial reduction in the Debtors’ funded debt obligations, including the following
principal terms:
•  A new capital raise of first lien debt with a maturity of 4.5 years and bearing interest at
LIBOR plus 9.5% per annum (1.0% LIBOR Floor), payable in cash, issued at a price
equal to 97% of the principal amount. The first lien debt will consist of $450 million for
general corporate use and to finance the remaining construction cost of the Company’s
newbuild rig, the Hercules Highlander, and will be guaranteed by substantially all of the
HERO’s U.S. domestic and international subsidiaries and secured by liens on
substantially all of HERO’s domestic and foreign assets. The first lien debt will include
financial covenants and other terms and conditions.
•  An exchange of $1.2 billion in principal amount of Senior Notes for 96.9% of the New
HERO Common Stock.
If the Plan is consummated as contemplated by the Term Sheet, holders of the HERO
Equity Interests will hold 3.1% of the New HERO Common Stock and will receive warrants
to purchase New HERO Common Stock on a Pro Rata basis despite the present valuation
of the Company. The Debtors and the Steering Group provided an opportunity for holders
of HERO Equity Interests to participate in the long-term growth of the Company despite
the fact that holders of HERO Equity Interests are out of the money so as to ensure an
expeditious and efficient emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. The New HERO Warrants
will be exercisable at any time until their expiration date for a per share price based upon a
$1.55 billion total enterprise value. The expiration date for the New HERO Warrants will be
six years from the Effective Date of the Plan, subject to earlier expiration upon the
occurrence of certain extraordinary events. If the terms for exercise of the New HERO
Warrants are not met before the applicable expiration date, then holders of HERO Equity
Interests shall receive only 3.1% of the New HERO Common Stock and shall not realize
any value under the terms of the Warrants. Because holders of HERO Equity Interests are
substantially out of the money under absolute priority principles, holders of HERO Equity
Interests that opt not to grant the releases contained in Article VII of the Plan shall not
receive the New HERO Equity Interests or New HERO Warrants that they would otherwise
receive under the Plan and shall not receive any distribution whatsoever under the Plan.
The Restructuring Support Agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain
events, including the appointment of an official committee of equity security holders in the
Chapter 11 Cases and the failure to meet specified milestones related to filing,
confirmation and consummation of the Plan, among other requirements, and in the event
of certain breaches by the parties under the Restructuring Support Agreement as
amended. The milestones referenced above are as follows:
•
•
•
•
on or before July 13, 2015, the Debtors shall commence solicitation of the Plan;
on or before August 22, 2015, the Debtors shall commence the Chapter 11 Cases;
on or before October 22, 2015, the Court shall commence a hearing to confirm the
Plan; and
on or before November 7, the Debtors will exit chapter 11.
26
Given the consensus among the majority of holders of Senior Notes, as evidenced by the
Restructuring Support Agreement, the Debtors believe that they will emerge from chapter
11 expeditiously, and with an significantly improved balance sheet that will allow the
Reorganized Debtors to succeed in a competitive industry. The Debtors believe that this
outcome would be in the best interests of the Debtors, their estates and all stakeholders.
VI. THE ANTICIPATED CHAPTER 11 CASES
Under the terms of the Restructuring Support Agreement and the milestones set forth
therein, the Debtors anticipate filing a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code on or before August 22, 2015.
The filing of a petition will commence the Chapter 11 Cases. At that time, all actions and
proceedings against the Debtors and all acts to obtain property from the Debtors will be
stayed under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors will continue to operate
their business and manage their property as debtors in possession under sections
1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Debtors expect to proceed expeditiously through the Chapter 11 Cases. To facilitate
the Chapter 11 Cases and to minimize disruption to their operations, the Debtors will file
motions seeking from the Bankruptcy Court, among other relief, the relief detailed below.
These requests will include, but are not limited to, orders permitting the Debtors to pay
employee obligations, pay allowed unsecured claims in the ordinary course of business,
and maintain its cash management system, including authorizing the transfer of funds
among the Debtors and the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, consistent with Hercules’ customary
practices, for the purpose of satisfying or paying Hercules’ ordinary course operating
expenses. Such relief, if granted, will assist in the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases.
There can be no assurance, however, that the Court will grant any or all of the relief
sought.
Commencing the Chapter 11 Cases will enable the Debtors to implement a financial
restructuring on the terms set forth in the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan
with little to no disruption of Hercules’ mobile rig and liftboat business. The Debtors
believe that the transactions contemplated by the Plan will deleverage its balance sheet,
improve go-forward liquidity, and position Hercules for flexibility and future growth in the
industry.
A. Expected Timetable of the Chapter 11 Case.
Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Debtors are required to proceed
expeditiously through chapter 11 in accordance with the milestones, which require the
Debtors to obtain confirmation of the Plan within 61 days of the Petition Date, and
consummate the Plan within 77 days of the Petition Date.
While the Debtors will request that the Court approve the timetable set forth in the
Solicitation Procedures Motion (as defined herein) on the Petition Date, no assurances
can be made that such relief will be granted. The failure to meet the milestones and
deadlines set forth in the Restructuring Support Agreement could derail the orderly
restructuring of the Debtors’ significant financial obligations.
B. Significant First Day Motions and Retention of Professionals.
On the Petition Date, the Debtors intend to file several motions requesting that the Court
enter orders authorizing the Debtors to continue operating their business in the ordinary
course (the “First Day Motions”). These First Day Motions are designed to facilitate a
smooth transition into chapter 11 and ease the strain on Hercules’ business as a
consequence of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. There is no guarantee that the Court
will grant any or all of the requested relief. The following summary highlights certain of the
First Day Motions that are presently expected to be filed.
27
Approval of Solicitation Procedures and Scheduling of Confirmation Hearing
The Debtors will be seeking confirmation of the Plan and emergence from chapter 11 as
soon as possible. To that end, the Debtor intends to file a motion (the “Plan Scheduling
Motion”) on the Petition Date requesting that the Court enter an order (a) scheduling a
combined hearing to consider, among other things, approval of the adequacy of the
Disclosure Statement and confirmation of the Plan, (b) approving the form and notice of
the Confirmation Hearing, (c) establishing a deadline and procedures for objections to the
Disclosure Statement and the Plan, (d) approving the Solicitation Procedures and
(e) approving the First Lien Exit Facility Solicitation Procedures. The Debtors will seek the
earliest possible date permitted by the applicable rules and the Court’s calendar for the
combined Confirmation Hearing.
Schedules and Statements Extension/Waiver
In general, a Debtors’ Schedules of Assets and Liabilities and Statement of Financial
Affairs (the “Schedules and Statements”) permit parties in interest to understand and
assess a Debtors’ assets and liabilities and, thereafter, negotiate and confirm a plan of
reorganization. When, as in the case of the Debtors, the debtor has already negotiated a
prepackaged plan of reorganization that lacks any need for proofs of claim to be filed
because creditors other than holders of the Senior Notes will be paid in full subject only to
the Company’s rights, if any, under any agreements with such creditors, the Schedules
and Statements will also lack the central benefit of assisting creditors with determining
whether they should file a proof of claim. As such, requiring the Schedules and
Statements to be filed notwithstanding confirmation of the Plan would only impose an
additional administrative burden on and expense to the Debtors’ estates, without any
corresponding benefit to parties in interest. To that end, the Debtors expect to file a motion
seeking entry of an order (i) extending the deadlines to file Schedules and SOFAs by
ninety (90) days and (ii) permanently waiving the requirement to file Schedules and SOFAs
if the Plan is confirmed before such extension expires.
Stabilizing Operations
Recognizing that any interruption of Hercules’ business, even for a short period, could
negatively impact customer and vendor relationships and Hercules’ goodwill, revenue,
and profits, which would be detrimental to the value of the Debtors’ estates, the Debtors
intend to file certain First Day Motions to ensure stabilization of its operations. The First
Day Motions that the Debtors currently contemplate filing are identified below. The
Debtors may add or remove First Day Motions from this list before filing. Although the
Non-Debtor Subsidiaries are not presently contemplated to be Debtors in the Chapter 11
Cases, out of an abundance of caution, the Debtors will request entry of orders
authorizing the Debtors to pay directly, or indirectly through its Non-Debtor Subsidiaries,
as applicable, specific unpaid obligations of the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries related to the
operation of Hercules’ business that arose prior to the Petition Date, subject to the
Aggregate Non-Debtor Subsidiary Cap (as defined herein).
(a)
Cash Management System.
Hercules maintains a centralized cash management system controlled by the Debtors in
the United States designed to collect, track, aggregate, and disburse cash on a daily basis
between the Debtors and the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries. To facilitate a smooth transition
into the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors intend to seek authority to continue using the
existing cash management system, bank accounts, and business forms and to continue
intercompany transactions. In connection with this relief, the Debtors will also seek
authority to make transfers to, or on behalf of, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries in order to
satisfy operating expenses.
(b)
Wages Motion.
The Debtors’ ability to manage their mobile drilling rig and liftboat businesses requires the
continued focus and commitment of its employees, crew members, and independent
contractors. These individuals rely on their compensation and benefits to pay their daily
living expenses, absent which they would be exposed to significant financial difficulties.
The Debtors cannot afford for these individuals to be distracted by unnecessary concern
over the payment of their wages and other benefits in the ordinary course of operations.
Moreover, the Debtors have substantial cash on hand to pay these obligations.
Accordingly, the Debtors intend to seek authority to
28
(a) pay all prepetition wages, salaries, and other compensation to the Debtors’ employees,
crew members, and independent contractors; (b) continue all benefit programs and
policies, consistent with the ordinary course of business and past practices, on a
postpetition basis, whether arising before or after the Petition Date; and (c) alter, modify, or
discontinue employee benefit programs as the Debtors deems necessary.
(c)
Vendor Motion.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Debtors rely on a variety of vendors and service
providers (many of which are not located in the United States). Although the Debtors
expect to pay all of their obligations in full pursuant to the Plan, some of the Debtors’
vendors and service providers may nonetheless seek to terminate their relationship with
the Debtors or alter payment terms, to the detriment of the Debtors, in the event that the
Debtors fail to timely honor outstanding obligations as they become due. To avoid the
potentially detrimental effects of any such party’s efforts to terminate its relationship with
the Debtors and to ensure uninterrupted operations and a seamless transition through the
Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors intend to seek authority to pay directly, or indirectly
through its Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, the amounts
owed to their vendors and service providers.
(d)
Taxes.
Although the Debtors expect to pay all taxes and regulatory obligations in full pursuant to
the Plan, in order to minimize the potential disruption to Hercules’ business during the
Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors intend to seek authority to pay directly, or indirectly
through the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Debtors’ fees and other similar charges and
assessments, as well as certain taxes, whether arising prior, or subsequent, to the Petition
Date, to the appropriate taxing, licensing, and other governmental authorities.
(e)
Utilities.
The Debtors incur utility expenses for electricity, telephone, and other essential services
in the ordinary course of their business at their global headquarters located in Houston,
Texas. The Debtors intend to seek approval of adequate assurance procedures in the
event that any utility provider makes a demand for adequate assurance or otherwise
threatens to alter, refuse, or discontinue utility service to the Debtors.
(f)
Insurance.
In connection with the operation of its business, the Debtors maintain comprehensive
insurance programs that include a variety of policies through several different insurance
carriers. The insurance programs are essential to preserve the Debtors’ business
operations, property, and assets. Moreover, the Debtors are required to maintain the
various insurance programs by various regulations, laws, loan agreements, and contracts
that govern the Debtors’ maritime and commercial activity. In the event any obligations
arising under the insurance programs may be attributed to prepetition insurance
coverage, the Debtors believe that payment of the obligations is necessary to ensure
continued coverage. Similarly, continued payment of such obligations as they come due
in the ordinary course of business is necessary in order to maintain relationships with the
Debtors’ insurance carriers and ensure the continued availability and pricing of insurance
coverage. Accordingly, the Debtors intend to seek authority to pay directly, or indirectly
through the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, any obligations on account of insurance programs,
including premiums, deductibles, taxes, and fees, whether arising prior or subsequent to
the Petition Date.
Procedural Motions and Professional Retention Applications.
The Debtors intend to file several procedural motions that are standard in chapter 11
cases of similar size and complexity, as well as applications to retain the various
professionals who will be assisting the Debtors during the Chapter 11 Cases.
29
VII. SUMMARY OF THE PLAN
The proposed restructuring under the Plan is favorable for the Debtors and all
stakeholders because it achieves a substantial deleveraging of the Company’s balance
sheet through consensus with the overwhelming majority of creditors and eliminates
potential deterioration of value—and disruptions to worldwide operations—that could
otherwise result from a protracted, contentious and costly bankruptcy case.
A. Unclassified Claims.
Unclassified Claims Summary
In accordance with section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan does not classify
Administrative Claims, Priority Tax Claims and Fee Claims. The aggregate amount of
Administrative Claims, Priority Tax Claims and Fee Claims for all Debtors is estimated to
be approximately $25 million as of the Effective Date based on an estimate of $16.4 million
for Fee Claims (assuming that all professionals are engaged pursuant to the terms of their
agreements with the Company).
(a) Administrative Claims
Each holder of an Allowed Administrative Claim (other than an Administrative Claim that is
a Fee Claim) as of the Effective Date shall receive, in full and final satisfaction, settlement,
release, and discharge of, and in exchange for, such Administrative Claim, (i) Cash in an
amount equal to the amount of such Allowed Administrative Claim as soon as reasonably
practicable after either (a) the Effective Date, if such Administrative Claim is Allowed as of
the Effective Date, (b) thirty (30) days after the date such Administrative Claim becomes an
Allowed Administrative Claim, if such Administrative Claim is Disputed as of, or following,
the Effective Date, or (c) the date such Allowed Administrative Claim becomes due and
payable in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the terms, and subject to
the conditions, of any agreements governing, instruments evidencing, or other
documents relating to, the applicable transaction giving rise to such Allowed
Administrative Claim, if such Allowed Administrative Claim is based on liabilities incurred
by the Debtors in the ordinary course of their business; or (ii) such other treatment as the
Debtors, the Steering Group and such holder shall have agreed in writing.
(b) Fee Claims
Final Fee Applications. The Bankruptcy Court shall determine the Allowed amounts of Fee
Claims after notice and a hearing in accordance with the procedures established by the
Bankruptcy Code. The Reorganized Debtors shall pay Fee Claims in Cash in the amount
Allowed by the Bankruptcy Court. All requests for compensation or reimbursement of Fee
Claims shall be filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors, counsel to the Reorganized
Debtors, the U.S. Trustee, counsel to the Steering Group, and such other entities who are
designated by the Bankruptcy Rules, the Confirmation Order, or other order of the Court,
no later than forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, unless otherwise agreed by the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group). Holders of Fee Claims that are required
to file and serve applications for final allowance of their Fee Claims that do not file and
serve such applications by the required deadline shall be forever barred from asserting
such Claims against the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, or their respective properties, and
such Fee Claims shall be deemed discharged as of the Effective Date. Objections to any
Fee Claims must be filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors, counsel to the
Reorganized Debtors, counsel to the Steering Group, and the requesting party no later
than thirty (30) days after the filing of the final applications for compensation or
reimbursement (unless otherwise agreed by the party requesting compensation of a Fee
Claim).
Payment of Professional Fees. The Reorganized Debtors shall pay in full Fee Claims in
Cash as soon as reasonably practicable after such Claims are Allowed by order of the
Bankruptcy Court.
Post-Effective Date Fees and Expenses. The Reorganized Debtors shall pay in Cash the
reasonable legal, professional, or other fees and expenses incurred by the Debtors’ and
the Steering Group’s Professionals on and after the Effective Date, in the ordinary course
of business, and without any further notice to or
30
action, order, or approval of the Court. Upon the Effective Date, any requirement that
Professionals comply with sections 327 through 331 of the Bankruptcy Code in seeking
retention or compensation for services rendered after such date shall terminate, and
Professionals may be employed and paid in the ordinary course of business without any
further notice to, or action, order, or approval of, the Court.
(c) Priority Tax Claims
Each holder of an Allowed Priority Tax Claim due and payable on or before the Effective
Date shall receive, as determined by the applicable Debtor (with the consent of the
Steering Group), in full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in
exchange for, such Priority Tax Claim (i) payment in full in Cash, payable in equal Cash
installments made on a quarterly basis in accordance with section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the
Bankruptcy Code, over a period not to exceed five (5) years following the Petition Date,
plus statutory interest on any outstanding balance from the Effective Date, calculated at
the prevailing rate under applicable nonbankruptcy law for each taxing authority and to
the extent provided for by section 511 of the Bankruptcy Code, and in a manner not less
favorable than the most favored nonpriority General Unsecured Claim provided for by the
Plan (other than cash payments made to a class of creditors pursuant to section 1122(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code); or (ii) such other treatment as may be agreed upon by such
holder, the Debtors and the Steering Group or otherwise determined upon a Final Order of
the Court.
(d) U.S. Trustee Fees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, on the Effective Date, the
Debtors shall pay, in full, in Cash, any fees due and owing to the U.S. Trustee at the time of
Confirmation. On and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall be
responsible for filing required post-confirmation reports and paying quarterly fees due to
the U.S. Trustee for the Reorganized Debtors until the entry of a final decree in the Chapter
11 Cases or until the Chapter 11 Cases are converted or dismissed.
B. Classified Claims and Equity Interests
1. Class 1 - Other Priority Claims (Subclasses 1a-1o).
a.
b.
Classification: Class 1 consists of Other Priority Claims.
Treatment: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Other Priority
Claim and the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) agree in
writing to less favorable treatment, in full and final satisfaction, settlement,
release, and discharge of, and in exchange for, each Allowed Other Priority
Claim, each holder of an Allowed Other Priority Claim shall receive
(i) payment in Cash in an amount equal to such Allowed Other Priority Claim
as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the Effective Date and (b) thirty
(30) days after the date when such Other Priority Claim becomes an Allowed
Other Priority Claim or (ii) such other treatment, as determined by the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), that will render it
Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.
c.
Voting: Class 1 is Unimpaired by the Plan, and each holder of a Class 1
Other Priority Claim is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan
pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of
Class 1 Other Priority Claims are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the
Plan.
2. Class 2 - Other Secured Claims (Subclasses 2a-2o).
a.
Classification: Class 2 consists of Other Secured Claims.
31
b.
Treatment: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Other Secured
Claim and the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) agree in
writing to less favorable treatment, in full and final satisfaction, settlement,
release and discharge of and in exchange for such Other Secured Claim,
each holder of an Allowed Other Secured Claim shall, as determined by the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), receive (i) Cash in an
amount equal to such Allowed Other Secured Claim, including any interest
on such Allowed Other Secured Claim, if such interest is required to be paid
pursuant to sections 506(b) and/or 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, as
soon as practicable after the later of (a) the Effective Date, and (b) thirty
(30) days after the date such Other Secured Claim becomes an Allowed
Other Secured Claim, (ii) the Collateral securing its Allowed Other Secured
Claim as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the Effective Date and
(b) thirty (30) days after the date such Other Secured Claim becomes an
Allowed Other Secured Claim, or (iii) such other treatment, as determined by
the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), that will render it
Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.
c.
Voting: Class 2 is Unimpaired by the Plan, and each holder of a Class 2
Other Secured Claim is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan
pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of
Class 2 Other Secured Claims are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the
Plan.
3. Class 3 – Senior Notes Claims (Subclasses 3a-3o).
a.
b.
Classification: Class 3 consists of Senior Notes Claims.
Treatment: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Senior Notes
Claim and the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) agree in
writing to less favorable treatment, in full and final satisfaction, settlement,
release, and discharge of, and in exchange for, each Senior Notes Claim, on
or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each holder of an Allowed
Senior Notes Claim shall receive its Pro Rata share of the Senior Notes
Equity Distribution.
In addition to the foregoing, each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim that is an
Eligible Noteholder shall have the opportunity to participate, on a Pro Rata basis, in the
First Lien Exit Facility in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the First
Lien Exit Facility Subscription Procedures during the period from the Petition Date
through the date of the Confirmation Hearing. The opportunity to participate in the First
Lien Exit Facility does not constitute a distribution to the holders of Allowed Senior Notes
Claims on account of their Claims.
c.
d.
Guarantee Claims: Each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim shall only
receive one recovery in full and complete satisfaction of all Senior Notes
Claims and all Guarantee Claims that may be held by such holder, which
recovery is specified in Article VII.B.3(b) above.
Voting: Class 3 is Impaired. Holders of Class 3 Senior Notes Claims are
entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan, provided that the Debtors are not
soliciting the votes of Non-Eligible Noteholders, and any votes cast by Non-
Eligible Noteholders will not be counted.
4. Class 4 – General Unsecured Claims (Subclasses 4a-4o).
32
a.
Classification: Class 4 consists of General Unsecured Claims.
d.
g.
Allowance Each General Unsecured Claim in Class 4 shall be Allowed
unless such Claim is Disputed. For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of
the Plan shall diminish, enhance, or modify any applicable nonbankruptcy
legal, equitable, and/or contractual rights of a holder of a General Unsecured
Claim to receive payment on account of such General Unsecured Claim in
Class 4, which are “riding through” the Chapter 11 Cases under the Plan as
if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced.
Treatment: In full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of,
and in exchange for, each Allowed General Unsecured Claim, on the
Effective Date, each holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim shall, at
the discretion of the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), and
only to the extent such holder’s Allowed General Unsecured Claim was not
previously paid in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to an order of
the Court, or otherwise: (i) have its Allowed General Unsecured Claim
Reinstated as an obligation of the applicable Reorganized Debtor, and be
paid in accordance with ordinary course terms, (ii) receive such other
treatment as may be agreed between such holder and the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group) or (iii) receive such other treatment, as
determined by the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), that will
render it Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Payment of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim is subject to the rights of
the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest to dispute
such Claim as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced in
accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, until an Allowed General Unsecured
Claim in Class 4 (including Cure Claims) that arises prior to the Effective Date has been
(x) paid in full in accordance with applicable law, or on terms agreed to between the holder
of such Claim and the Debtor (with the consent of the Steering Group) or Reorganized
Debtor, or in accordance with the terms and conditions of the particular transaction giving
rise to such Claim, or (y) resolved pursuant to the disputed claims procedures applicable
to General Unsecured Claims under Article VIII.A.3 of the Plan: (a) the provisions of Article
VII.A.C-H of the Plan shall not apply or take effect with respect to such Claim, (b) such
Claim shall not be deemed settled, satisfied, resolved, released, discharged, or enjoined
by any provision of the Plan, and (c) the applicable Reorganized Debtor shall remain liable
for such Claims. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the satisfaction of subpart (x) or (y) of
the foregoing sentence, subparts (a)-(c) of the foregoing sentence shall no longer apply
under the Plan. Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Class 4 shall not be
required to file a Proof of Claim with the Bankruptcy Court. Holders of Allowed General
Unsecured Claims in Class 4 (including Cure Claims) shall not be subject to any claims
resolution process in Bankruptcy Court in connection with their Claims, and shall retain all
their rights under applicable nonbankruptcy law to pursue their Allowed General
Unsecured Claims in Class 4 against the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors in any forum
with jurisdiction over the parties. The Debtors and Reorganized Debtors shall retain all
defenses, counterclaims, rights to setoff, and rights to recoupment as to Allowed General
Unsecured Claims in Class 4. If the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the
Reorganized Debtors dispute any Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Class 4, such
dispute shall be determined, resolved or adjudicated in the manner as if the Chapter 11
Cases had not been commenced. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
33
any holder of a Claim who files a Proof of Claim shall be subject to the Article VII of the
Plan unless and until such holder withdraws such Proof of Claim, and nothing herein
limits the retained jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court under Article XI of the Plan.
h.
Voting: Class 4 is Unimpaired, and each holder of a Class 4 General
Unsecured Claim is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan
pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of
Class 4 General Unsecured Claims are not entitled to vote to accept or reject
the Plan.
5. Class 5 – Intercompany Claims (Subclasses 5a-5o).
a.
b.
c.
Classification: Class 5 consists of Intercompany Claims.
Treatment: In full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of,
and in exchange for, each Allowed Intercompany Claim, on the Effective
Date, each Intercompany Claim shall be Reinstated. On and after the
Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors and the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries
will be permitted to transfer funds between and among themselves as they
determine to be necessary or appropriate to enable the Reorganized Debtors
to satisfy their obligations under the Plan. Except as set forth herein, any
changes to intercompany account balances resulting from such transfers will
be accounted for and settled in accordance with the Debtors’ and the Non-
Debtor Subsidiaries’ historical intercompany account settlement practices.
Voting: Class 5 is Unimpaired. Holders of Class 5 Intercompany Claims are
conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section
1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 5 Intercompany
Claims are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.
6. Class 6 – Intercompany Interests (Subclasses 6a-6o).
a.
b.
c.
Classification: Class 6 consists of Intercompany Interests.
Treatment: On the Effective Date, Intercompany Interests shall be
Reinstated.
Voting: Class 6 is Unimpaired. Holders of Class 6 Intercompany Interests are
conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section
1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 6 Intercompany
Interests are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.
7. Class 7 – HERO Equity Interests (Subclasses 7a-7o).
a.
b.
Classification: Class 7 consists of HERO Equity Interests.
Treatment: On the Effective Date, HERO Equity Interests shall be cancelled
and discharged and shall be of no further force or effect, whether
surrendered for cancellation or otherwise, and holders of HERO Equity
Interests shall not receive or retain any property under the Plan on account of
such HERO Equity Interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or as soon
as practicable after the Effective Date, holders of HERO Equity Interests
shall receive, in exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their HERO
Equity Interests and for the releases by such holders of the Released
Parties, their Pro Rata share of (1) the Shareholder Equity Distribution and
(2) the New HERO Warrants; provided, however, that any holder of a HERO
Equity Interest that opts not to grant the
34
voluntary releases contained in Article VII.F of the Plan shall not be entitled
to receive its Pro Rata share of the Shareholder Equity Distribution and the
New HERO Warrants and shall not receive any consideration in exchange
for the surrender or cancellation of its HERO Equity Interests or any
distribution whatsoever under the Plan; and provided, further, that,
notwithstanding Article VIII.B.8, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering
Group) may provide any holder of a HERO Equity Interest that would
otherwise be entitled to receive a distribution of less than one (1) share of the
New HERO Common Stock under this Article III.D.7.(b) with a distribution of
one (1) share of New HERO Common Stock.
c.
Voting: Class 7 is Impaired. Holders of Class 7 Equity Interests are
conclusively presumed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g)
of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 7 HERO Equity
Interests are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.
Special Provision Regarding Unimpaired and Reinstated Claims
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, nothing herein shall be deemed to
affect, diminish, or impair the Debtors’ or the Reorganized Debtors’ rights and defenses,
both legal and equitable, with respect to any Reinstated Claim or Unimpaired Claim,
including, but not limited to, legal and equitable defenses to setoffs or recoupment against
Reinstated Claims or Unimpaired Claims. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Plan, nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver or relinquishment of any Claim, Cause
of Action, right of setoff, or other legal or equitable defense which the Debtors had
immediately prior to the Petition Date against, or with respect to, any Claim left Unimpaired
by the Plan. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, the Reorganized
Debtors shall have, retain, reserve, and be entitled to assert, all such Claims, Causes of
Action, rights of setoff, and other legal or equitable defenses which they had immediately
prior to the Petition Date fully as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced, and all
of the Debtors’ legal and equitable rights with respect to any Reinstated Claim or Claim left
Unimpaired by this Plan may be asserted by the Reorganized Debtors after the
Confirmation Date and the Effective Date to the same extent as if the Chapter 11 Cases
had not been commenced.
C. Means for Implementation of the Plan
Operations Between the Confirmation Date and Effective Date.
During the period from the Confirmation Date through and until the Effective Date, the
Debtors may continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession, subject to all
applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court and any limitations set forth in the
Restructuring Support Agreement.
First Lien Exit Facility.
On or before the Effective Date, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) shall
be authorized, without the need for any further corporate action or without any further
action by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, to enter into the First
Lien Exit Facility Credit Agreement, the First Lien Exit Facility Documents and any
ancillary documents necessary or appropriate to satisfy the conditions to effectiveness of
the First Lien Exit Facility. The proceeds of the First Lien Exit Facility shall be used to
(i) pay the final installment and related expenses, costs and charges in the approximate
amount of $200 million related to the construction and purchase of the Highlander, (ii) pay
the Restructuring Expenses and (iii) provide the Reorganized Debtors and the Non-Debtor
Subsidiaries with working capital for their post-Effective Date operations and for other
general corporate purposes. The First Lien Exit Facility shall be Secured by first priority
security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Reorganized Debtors and the
Non-Debtor Subsidiaries that are guarantors under the First Lien Exit Facility, including
without limitation, the Highlander and all contracts related to the Highlander.
Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors and certain of the Steering Group Members entered
into the First Lien Exit Facility Commitment Letter, pursuant to which such Steering Group
Members agreed to provide
35
backstop commitments for the First Lien Exit Facility. As set forth in Article III.D.3 of the
Plan, each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim that is an Eligible Noteholder shall
have the opportunity to participate, on a Pro Rata basis, in the First Lien Exit Facility in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the First Lien Exit Facility
Subscription Procedures during the period from the Petition Date through the date of
Confirmation Hearing. The opportunity to participate in the First Lien Exit Facility does not
constitute a distribution to the holders of Allowed Senior Notes Claims on account of their
Claims.
Nonconsensual Confirmation.
The Debtors intend to request confirmation of the Plan under section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code with respect to any impaired Class that has not accepted or is deemed
to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, including
Class 7 (HERO Equity Interests).
Cancellation of Certain Indebtedness, Agreements, and Existing Securities.
On the Effective Date, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan, the
obligations of the Debtors under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Senior Notes,
the Guarantees, the Senior Notes Indentures, the HERO Equity Interests, and any other
certificate, share, note, bond, indenture, purchase right, option, warrant, or other
instrument or document directly or indirectly evidencing or creating any indebtedness or
obligation of or ownership interest in any of the Debtors giving rise to any Claim or Equity
Interest (except such certificates, notes, or other instruments or documents evidencing
indebtedness or obligations of any Debtors that are specifically reinstated pursuant to the
Plan), shall be cancelled as to any such Debtors, and the Reorganized Debtors shall not
have any continuing obligations thereunder; and the obligations of any of the Debtors
pursuant, relating, or pertaining to any agreements, indentures, certificates of designation,
by-laws, or certificate or articles of incorporation or similar documents governing the
Restructuring Support Agreement, the Senior Notes, the Guarantees, the Senior Notes
Indentures and any other shares, certificates, notes, bonds, purchase rights, options,
warrants, or other instruments or documents evidencing or creating any indebtedness or
obligation of any of the Debtors (except such agreements, certificates, notes, or other
instruments evidencing indebtedness or obligations of any Debtors that are specifically
reinstated pursuant to the Plan or assumed by any such Debtors) shall be released and
discharged; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the occurrence of the Confirmation
Date or the Effective Date, any such indenture or agreement that governs the rights of the
holder of a Claim shall continue in effect solely for purposes of (a) allowing holders of
such Claims to receive distributions under the Plan as provided herein, (b) allowing the
Senior Notes Indenture Trustees to make distributions under the Plan as provided herein,
and deduct therefrom such reasonable compensation, fees, and expenses due thereunder
or incurred in making such distributions, to the extent not paid by the Debtors and
authorized under such agreement, and (c) allowing the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees to
seek compensation and/or reimbursement of fees and expenses in accordance with the
terms of the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section shall affect the
discharge of or result in any obligation, liability, or expense of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, or affect the discharge of Claims or Equity Interests pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code, the Confirmation Order, or the Plan, or result in any additional
obligation, expense, or liability of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors. On and after
the Effective Date, all duties and responsibilities of the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees
shall be discharged except to the extent required to effectuate the Plan.
Issuance of New HERO Common Stock and Warrants.
(a)
Issuance of Securities.
Shares of New HERO Common Stock shall be authorized under the New HERO Charter,
and shares of New HERO Common Stock shall be issued on the Effective Date and
distributed as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with the Plan. The number of
shares of New HERO Common Stock to be distributed as set forth in this Plan, and the
number of shares of New HERO Common Stock issuable upon exercise of New HERO
Warrants and the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity and corresponding
strike prices, are subject to adjustment by the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering
Group) in a manner that does not alter the respective percentages of the outstanding New
HERO Common Stock allocated to any Class or Claim holder, except for immaterial
changes resulting from the treatment of fractional shares; provided that the New HERO
Common Stock, as of the Effective Date, shall be subject to dilution from the New HERO
Management Incentive Program Equity.
36
All of the New HERO Common Stock, issuable in accordance with the Plan, when so
issued, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable. The
issuance, with the consent of the Steering Group, of the New HERO Common Stock, the
New HERO Warrants, the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity by
Reorganized HERO, and the issuance of shares pursuant to the exercise of New HERO
Warrants and the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity, is authorized without
the need for any further corporate action and without any further action by any holder of a
Claim or Equity Interest.
The New HERO Common Stock distributed under the Plan will be issued in book-entry
form through the direct registry system of the transfer agent and DTC. The ownership
interest of each holder of such New HERO Common Stock, and transfers of ownership
interests therein, will be recorded on the records of the transfer agent and the direct and
indirect participants in DTC. To receive distributions of New HERO Common Stock
through DTC, holders of Senior Notes Claims will be required to designate a direct or
indirect participant in DTC with whom such holder has an account into which such New
HERO Common Stock may be deposited. The New HERO Common Stock issuable to
holders of HERO Equity Interests will, with respect to HERO Equity Interests held through
DTC, be delivered by the Reorganized HERO to the holders of HERO Equity Interests
through DTC (via Mandatory Exchange if applicable), and holders that do not hold their
HERO Equity Interests in DTC may designate a direct or indirect participant in DTC with
whom such holder has an account into which such New HERO Common Stock may be
deposited or have their shares issued in book-entry form on the register of the transfer
agent.
(b)
Exemption from Registration.
The offering of the New HERO Common Stock under Article III of the Plan shall be exempt
from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act and other applicable
law under section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or another available exemption from
registration under the Securities Act. The issuance and distribution of the New HERO
Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants under Article III of the Plan, and the New
HERO Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the New HERO Warrants shall be exempt
from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act and any other
applicable law requiring registration of an offer or sale of securities under section 1145(a)
of the Bankruptcy Code. The New HERO Common Stock underlying the Management
Incentive Program will be issued pursuant to a registration statement or another available
exemption from registration under the Securities Act and other applicable law.
The issuance of the New HERO Equity Interests to the holders of Senior Notes Claims and
the issuance of the New HERO Equity Interests and the New HERO Warrants to the
holders of HERO Equity Interests shall be exempt from the requirements of section 16(b)
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
thereunder) with respect to any acquisition of such securities by an officer or director (or a
director by deputization for purposes thereof) as of the Effective Date.
(c)
SEC Reporting Requirements and Listing of New HERO Common Stock.
As of the Effective Date, Reorganized HERO will be a reporting company under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of July 13, 2015, HERO common stock
was listed for trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”). In March 2015,
HERO received a letter from NASDAQ informing HERO that its common stock was below
the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ. Hercules expects
that its common stock will become delisted from trading on NASDAQ following the Petition
Date and will then be traded on the OTC Pink market. Reorganized HERO will use
reasonable efforts to cause the listing on NASDAQ of the New HERO Common Stock on
or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date.
The New HERO Warrants.
(a)
Issuance.
The New HERO Warrants will be issued pursuant to the terms of the New HERO Warrant
Agreement. Each New HERO Warrant will, subject to the anti-dilution adjustments
described below and in the New HERO Warrant Agreement, be exercisable for one
(1) share of New HERO Common Stock.
37
(b)
Anti-Dilution Protection.
The New HERO Warrant Agreement shall contain provisions for the adjustment of the
exercise price and shares of New Common Stock issuable upon exercise following certain
organic dilutive events such as splits, combinations, stock dividends or other similar
organic dilutive events involving the New HERO Common Stock. There shall be no anti-
dilution adjustment for the New HERO Warrants upon the post-Effective Date issuance of
New HERO Common Stock at a value below the exercise price for the New HERO
Warrants. The New HERO Warrants, as of the Effective Date, shall be subject to dilution
from the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity.
(c)
Form.
Except as provided below, all New HERO Warrants distributed under the Plan will be
issued in book-entry form through the direct registry system of the warrant agent and
DTC. The warrant agent will be the transfer agent for the New HERO Common Stock. The
ownership interest of each holder of such New HERO Warrants, and transfers of
ownership interests therein, will be recorded on the records of the warrant agent and the
direct and indirect participants in DTC. Holders of HERO Equity Interests that hold such
HERO Equity Interests in DTC will receive their New HERO Warrants by deposit to the
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC in which such HERO Equity Interests are
held. Holders that do not hold their HERO Equity Interests in DTC may designate a direct
or indirect participant in DTC with whom such holder has an account into which such New
HERO Warrants may be deposited or have their New HERO Warrants issued in book-entry
form on the register of the warrant agent for the New HERO Warrants. Beneficial owners of
the New HERO Warrants will be required to follow the procedures that DTC or its direct or
indirect participants or the warrant agent for the New HERO Warrants, as applicable, may
establish for exercising their rights in respect of the New HERO Warrants, including
exercise and transfer thereof. New HERO Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
New HERO Warrants will be issued in book-entry form and held through DTC or the
warrant agent for the New Hero Warrants, as applicable.
(d)
Value of the New HERO Warrants
As set forth herein, the Plan provides for holders of HERO Equity Interests to receive the
New HERO Warrants.
The New HERO Warrants entitle the holders to purchase up to 20.00% of the New HERO
Common Stock. Using the Black-Scholes model, the New HERO Warrants are valued, in
the aggregate, between approximately $5 million and $15 million, pre dilution for the New
HERO Management Incentive Program Equity. Black-Scholes inputs include: (a) warrant
term of 6 years; (b) volatility of 35%; (c) current equity value of $402 million to $592 million;
and (d) strike price based on a total enterprise value of approximately $1.55 billion.
Continued Corporate Existence and Vesting of Assets.
Except as otherwise provided herein: (i) each Debtor will, as a Reorganized Debtor,
continue to exist after the Effective Date as a separate legal entity, with all of the powers of
such a legal entity under applicable law and without prejudice to any right to alter or
terminate such existence (whether by merger, dissolution or otherwise) under applicable
law; and (ii) on the Effective Date, all property of each Debtor’s Estate, and any property
acquired by each Debtor or Reorganized Debtor under the Plan, will vest in such
Reorganized Debtor free and clear of all Claims, Liens, charges, other encumbrances,
Equity Interests, and other interests, except for the Liens and Claims established under
the Plan (including in respect of the First Lien Exit Facility).
On and after the Effective Date, each Reorganized Debtor may operate its business and
may use, acquire, and dispose of property and compromise or settle any claims without
supervision or approval by the Court and free of any restrictions of the Bankruptcy Code
or Bankruptcy Rules, subject only to those restrictions expressly imposed by the Plan or
the Confirmation Order as well as the documents and instruments executed and delivered
in connection therewith, including the documents, exhibits, instruments, and other
materials comprising the Plan Supplement. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Reorganized Debtors may pay the charges that they incur from and after the Effective Date
for Fee Claims, disbursements, expenses, or related support services (including fees
relating to the preparation of Professional fee applications) without application to, or the
approval of, the Court.
38
Claims Against Non-Debtor Subsidiaries.
Any claim (as such term is defined in section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code), Cause of
Action, or remedy asserted against any Non-Debtor Subsidiary by any Debtor will be
reinstated, adjusted (including by contribution, distribution in exchange for new debt or
equity, or otherwise), paid, continued, cancelled, or discharged to the extent determined
appropriate by the Reorganized Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group). Any
such transaction, with the consent of the Steering Group, may be effectuated on the
Effective Date or subsequent to the Effective Date without any further action by the Court
or by the stockholders of the Reorganized Debtors.
Intercompany Interests.
The Intercompany Interests will be retained and the legal, equitable, and contractual rights
to which the holder of such Allowed Intercompany Interest is entitled will remain unaltered.
Corporate Action.
Each of the matters provided for by the Plan involving the corporate structure of the
Debtors or corporate or related actions to be taken by or required of the Reorganized
Debtors, whether taken prior to or as of the Effective Date, shall be deemed authorized and
approved in all respects without the need for any further corporate action and without any
further action by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable; provided,
however, that any such matters or corporate or related actions taken by the Debtors shall
be subject to the consent of the Steering Group. Such actions may include: (a) the
adoption and filing of the New HERO Certificate of Incorporation, the New HERO Bylaws
and the amended articles of incorporation or certificates of formation for each of the
Reorganized Debtors (other than Reorganized HERO); (b) the authorization, issuance, and
distribution of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants; (c) the adoption or
assumption, as applicable, of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases; (d) adoption of
the New HERO Management Incentive Program; and (e) the entry into the First Lien Exit
Facility and the execution and delivery of the First Lien Exit Facility Documents, as
applicable.
Steering Group Fees and Expenses.
On the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall pay, in full, in Cash, the unpaid
reasonable fees, expenses, costs, and other charges of the Steering Group’s
professionals (including the fees, expenses, costs, and other charges of Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P.), in each case in
accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement, and as required by the underlying
fee letters of such professionals.
The reasonable fees, expenses, costs, and other charges of the Steering Group’s
professionals (including the fees, expenses, costs, and other charges of Akin Gump
Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P.) shall be paid in the
ordinary course in accordance with the underlying fee letters of such professionals during
the Chapter 11 Cases.
Senior Notes Indenture Trustee Fees and Expenses
On the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall pay all reasonable and documented
fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel)
incurred by the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees through and including the Effective Date
to the extent required by the Senior Notes Indentures. For the avoidance of doubt, any
such fees and expenses of the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees shall not be treated under
this Plan as General Unsecured Claims and shall not be subject to avoidance, objection,
challenge, deduction, subordination, recharacterization or offset. The Senior Notes
Indenture Trustees shall not be required to file any application under sections 330 or 331
of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise with regard to the allowance of their fees and
expenses.
39
D. Provisions Regarding Corporate Governance of the Reorganized Debtor.
Organizational Documents.
On or immediately before the Effective Date, the New HERO Charter will be filed with the
applicable authority in Delaware in accordance with the corporate laws of Delaware. The
New HERO By-Laws will be deemed to have been adopted and will become effective on
the Effective Date. The New HERO Charter shall prohibit the issuance of nonvoting equity
securities only so long as, and to the extent that, the issuance of nonvoting equity
securities is prohibited by the Bankruptcy Code.
On or immediately before the Effective Date, the amended articles of incorporation or
certificates of formation for each of the Reorganized Debtors (other than Reorganized
HERO) will be filed with the applicable authorities in the respective jurisdictions of
incorporation or formation in accordance with the corporate laws of its jurisdiction. The
amended by-laws or operating agreements for the Reorganized Debtors (other than
Reorganized HERO) will be deemed to have been adopted and will become effective on the
Effective Date. To the extent applicable, the amended organization documents for the
Reorganized Debtors (other than Reorganized HERO) shall prohibit the issuance of
nonvoting equity securities only so long as, and to the extent that, the issuance of
nonvoting equity securities is prohibited by the Bankruptcy Code.
Appointment of Officers and Directors.
As of the Effective Date, the term of the current members of the board of directors of
HERO shall expire without further action by any Person. The New Board shall consist of
seven (7) members. The initial directors of the New Board shall be comprised of John
Rynd and six (6) other directors selected by the Steering Group, one of whom will be chair
and an independent director (as defined by NASDAQ).
As of the Effective Date, subject to the consent of the Steering Group, the current
members of the boards of directors or boards of managers, as applicable, of the Debtor
Subsidiaries shall serve as the initial directors or managers for such Entities.
From and after the Effective Date, John Rynd shall be employed and serve as the Chief
Executive Officer of Reorganized HERO. The other senior executive officers of
Reorganized HERO shall be acceptable to the Steering Group and identified in the Plan
Supplement.
Powers of Officers.
The officers of the Reorganized Debtors shall have the power to enter into or execute any
documents or agreements that they deem reasonable and appropriate to effectuate the
terms of the Plan.
Indemnification of Directors, Officers, and Employees.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, from and after the Effective Date,
indemnification obligations owed by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors to directors,
officers, or employees of the Debtors who served or were employed by the Debtors before,
on or after the Petition Date, to the extent provided in the articles or certificates of
incorporation, by-laws or similar constituent documents, by statutory law or by written
agreement, policies or procedures of the Debtors, will be deemed to be, and treated as
though they are, executory contracts that are assumed pursuant to the Plan and section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code. All such indemnification obligations shall survive
confirmation of the Plan, remain unaffected thereby, and not be discharged, irrespective of
whether indemnification, defense, reimbursement or limitation is owed in connection with
an event occurring before, on, or after the Petition Date.
40
Existing Benefits Agreements and Retiree Benefits
Except as such benefits may be otherwise terminated by the Debtors in a manner
permissible under applicable law, all Existing Benefits Agreements shall be deemed
assumed as of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, pursuant to section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code, on and after the Effective
Date, all retiree benefits (as such term is defined in section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code),
if any, shall continue to be paid in accordance with applicable law.
New HERO Management Incentive Program
On or after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall adopt the New HERO
Management Incentive Program and shall provide for the distribution, and the reservation
for future issuance, as applicable, of the New HERO Management Incentive Program
Equity to participating officers, directors and employees of the Reorganized Debtors. A
description of the New HERO Management Incentive Program will be set forth in the Plan
Supplement.
Allocation of the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity to the Reorganized
Debtors’ participating officers, directors and employees shall be determined by the New
Board under the terms set forth in the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity
Agreements.
E. Effect of Confirmation of the Plan.
Compromise and Settlement.
Pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and in
consideration for the distributions and other benefits provided pursuant to the Plan, the
provisions of the Plan shall constitute a good faith compromise of all Claims, Equity
Interests and controversies relating to the contractual, legal, and subordination rights that
a Holder of a Claim may have with respect to any Allowed Claim, or any Distribution to be
made on account of such Allowed Claim.
Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of the Plan shall, upon consummation,
constitute a good faith compromise and settlement, pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019
and section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, among the Debtors and the Steering Group of
all disputes among the parties, including those arising from, or related to, (i) the Senior
Notes Claims and the Guarantee Claims and (ii) the Guarantees. In the event that, for any
reason, the Confirmation Order is not entered or the Effective Date does not occur, the
Debtors and the Steering Group reserve all of their respective rights with respect to any
and all disputes that would have been resolved and settled under the Plan had the
Effective Date occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, the total enterprise value upon which
the Plan is based does not represent a negotiated resolution or settlement but an actual
determination of likely value. Based on that value, HERO Equity Interests are not entitled
to a distribution, and thus holders of HERO Equity Interests are “out of the money” by a
substantial margin.
The entry of the Confirmation Order shall constitute the Court’s approval of each of the
compromises and settlements embodied in the Plan, and the Court’s findings shall
constitute its determination that such compromises and settlements are in the best
interests of the Debtors, their Estates, creditors, and other parties-in-interest, and are fair,
equitable, and within the range of reasonableness. The Plan and the Confirmation Order
shall have res judicata, collateral estoppel, and estoppel (judicial, equitable, or otherwise)
effect with respect to all matters provided for, or resolved pursuant to, the Plan and/or the
Confirmation Order, including, without limitation, the release, injunction, exculpation,
discharge, and compromise provisions contained in the Plan and/or the Confirmation
Order. The provisions of the Plan, including, without limitation, its release, injunction,
exculpation and compromise provisions, are mutually dependent and non-severable.
Subordination of Claims
The allowance, classification and treatment of all Allowed Claims and Equity Interests and
the respective Distributions and treatments under the Plan take into account and conform
to the relative priority and
41
rights of the Claims and Equity Interests in each Class in connection with any contractual,
legal, and equitable subordination rights relating thereto. However, the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group) reserve the right to reclassify any Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest in accordance with any contractual, legal or equitable subordination relating
thereto, unless otherwise provided in a settlement agreement concerning such Allowed
Claim.
Discharge of the Debtors.
Pursuant to section 1141(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as otherwise specifically
provided in the Plan or in any contract, instrument, or other agreement or document
created pursuant to the Plan: (a) the distributions, rights, and treatment that are provided
in the Plan shall be in complete satisfaction, discharge, and release of all Claims, Equity
Interests, and Causes of Action of any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued
on Claims or Equity Interests from and after the Petition Date, whether known or unknown,
against, liabilities of, Liens on, obligations of, rights against and Equity Interests in, the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or any of their assets, properties or Estates, regardless
of whether any property shall have been distributed or retained pursuant to the Plan on
account of such Claims, Equity Interests and Causes of Action, including demands,
liabilities and Causes of Action that arose before the Effective Date, any contingent or
non-contingent liability on account of representations or warranties issued on or before
the Effective Date; (b) the Plan shall bind all holders of Claims and Equity Interests,
notwithstanding whether any such holders failed to vote to accept or reject the Plan or
voted to reject the Plan; (c) all Claims and Equity Interests shall be satisfied, discharged
and released in full, and the Debtors’ liability with respect thereto, shall be extinguished
completely, including debts of the kind specified in sections 502(g), 502(h) or 502(i) of the
Bankruptcy Code, in each case whether or not: (i) a proof of Claim or Equity Interest based
upon such debt, right, or Equity Interest is filed or deemed filed pursuant to section 501 of
the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) a Claim or Equity Interest based upon such debt, right or Equity
Interest is Allowed; or (iii) the holder of such a Claim or Equity Interest has accepted the
Plan or is entitled to receive a distribution hereunder; and (d) all Entities shall be precluded
from ever asserting against the Debtors, the Debtors’ Estates, the Reorganized Debtors,
their successors and assigns, and their assets and properties any Claims and Equity
Interests based upon any documents, instruments, or any act or omission, transaction, or
other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Effective Date. Any default by
the Debtors with respect to any Claim or Equity Interest that existed immediately before or
on account of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed cured on the Effective
Date. The Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of the discharge of all
Claims and Equity Interests subject to the Effective Date occurring.
Injunction.

Preservation of Causes of Action.
In accordance with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as expressly
provided herein (including Articles IV.L and VII), the Reorganized Debtors shall retain all
Causes of Action. Nothing contained in this Plan or the Confirmation Order shall be
deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any claim, Cause of Action, right of setoff, or other
legal or equitable defense of any Debtor that is not specifically waived or relinquished by
this Plan. The Reorganized Debtors shall have, retain, reserve, and be entitled to assert, all
such claims, Causes of Action, rights of setoff, and other legal or equitable defenses that
any Debtor had immediately before the Petition Date as fully as if the Chapter 11 Cases
had not been commenced, and all of the Reorganized Debtors’ legal and equitable rights
respecting any claim that is not specifically waived or relinquished by this Plan may be
asserted after the Effective Date to the same extent as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not
been commenced. No Person may rely on the absence of a specific reference in the Plan
or the Disclosure Statement to any Cause of Action against them as any indication that the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, will not pursue any and all available
Causes of Action against such Person. The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as
applicable, expressly reserve all rights to prosecute any and all Causes of Action against
any Person, in accordance with the Plan. From and after the Effective Date, the
Reorganized Debtors shall have the exclusive right, authority, and discretion to determine
and to initiate, file, prosecute, enforce, abandon, settle, compromise, release, withdraw, or
litigate to judgment any Cause of Action and to decline to do any of the foregoing without
further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Court. The Reorganized Debtors are
deemed representatives of the Estates for the purpose of prosecuting any Claim or Cause
of Action and any objections to Claims pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1123(b)(3)(B).
Claims Incurred After the Effective Date.
Claims incurred by the Debtors after the Effective Date may be paid by the Reorganized
Debtors in the ordinary course of business and without application for or Court approval,
subject to any agreements with such holders of a Claim and applicable law.
Releases, Exculpations, and Injunctions of Released Parties.
(a) Releases by the Debtors.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, for good and valuable
consideration, including the service of the Released Parties to facilitate the reorganization
of the Debtors, the implementation of the restructuring contemplated by the Restructuring
Support Agreement and the Plan and the compromises contained herein, on and after the
Effective Date, the Released Parties are hereby released and discharged by the Debtors,
the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Reorganized Debtors and the Estates, including any
successor to the Debtors or any Estate representative from all claims, obligations, rights,
suits, damages, Causes of Action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including any
derivative claims asserted or assertable on behalf of a Debtor, whether known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, liquidated or unliquidated, contingent or fixed, existing
or hereafter arising, in law, at equity or otherwise, whether for indemnification, tort,
contract, violations of federal or state securities laws or otherwise, including, those that
any of the Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Reorganized Debtors or the Estates
would have been legally entitled to assert in their own right (whether individually or
collectively) or on behalf of the holder of any Claim or Equity Interest or any other Person,
based on or relating to, or in any manner arising from, in whole or in part, the Debtors and
their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Estates, the conduct of the businesses of the Debtors
and their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Chapter 11 Cases, the purchase, sale or rescission
of the purchase or sale of any security of the Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, or the
Reorganized Debtors, the subject matter of, or the transactions or events giving rise to,
any Claim or Equity Interest that is treated in the Plan, the restructuring of Claims and
Equity Interests prior to or during the Chapter 11 Cases, the negotiation, formulation or
preparation of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Plan, the Plan
43
Supplement, the Disclosure Statement, First Lien Exit Facility Documents, the New HERO
Warrant Agreement or, in each case, related agreements, instruments or other documents,
any action or omission with respect to Intercompany Claims, any action or omission as an
officer, director, agent, representative, fiduciary, controlling person, affiliate or responsible
party, or any transaction entered into or affecting, a Non-Debtor Subsidiary, or upon any
other act or omission, transaction, agreement, event, or other occurrence taking place on
or before the Effective Date of the Plan, other than claims or liabilities arising out of or
relating to any act or omission of a Released Party to the extent such act or omission is
determined by a Final Order to have constituted willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad
faith, fraud or a criminal act.
(b) Releases by Holders of Claims and Equity Interests.
Any holder of HERO Equity Interests that opts not to grant the releases contained in this
Article VII.F shall not receive the New HERO Equity Interests and New HERO Warrants that
it would otherwise be entitled to receive under Article III.D.7 of the Plan and will not receive
any distribution whatsoever under the Plan.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, for good and valuable
consideration, including the service of the Released Parties to facilitate the reorganization
of the Debtors, the implementation of the restructuring contemplated by the Restructuring
Support Agreement or the Plan, and the compromises contained herein, on and after the
Effective Date, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Releasing Parties
(regardless of whether a Releasing Party is a Released Party) shall be deemed to
conclusively, absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably and forever release, waive and
discharge the Released Parties of any and all claims, obligations, rights, suits, damages,
Causes of Action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including: any derivative claims
asserted or assertable on behalf of a Debtor or a Non-Debtor Subsidiary, whether known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, liquidated or unliquidated, contingent or fixed,
existing or hereafter arising, in law, at equity or otherwise, whether for indemnification, tort,
contract, violations of federal or state securities laws or otherwise, including, those that
any of the Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Reorganized Debtors or the Estates
would have been legally entitled to assert in their own right (whether individually or
collectively) or on behalf of the holder of any Claim or Equity Interest or any other Person,
based on or relating to, or in any manner arising from, in whole or in part, the Debtors and
their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Estates, the conduct of the businesses of the Debtors
and their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Chapter 11 Cases, the purchase, sale or rescission
of the purchase or sale of any Security of the Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries or the
Reorganized Debtors, the subject matter of, or the transactions or events giving rise to,
any Claim or Equity Interest that is treated in the Plan, the restructuring of Claims and
Equity Interests prior to or during the Chapter 11 Cases, the negotiation, formulation or
preparation of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Plan, the Plan Supplement, the
Disclosure Statement, the First Lien Exit Facility Documents, the New HERO Warrant
Agreement or, in each case, related agreements, instruments or other documents, any
action or omission with respect to Intercompany Claims, any action or omission as an
officer, director, agent, representative, fiduciary, controlling person, affiliate or responsible
party, or any transaction entered into or affecting, a non-Debtor subsidiary, or upon any
other act or omission, transaction, agreement, event or other occurrence taking place on
or before the Effective Date of the Plan, other than claims or liabilities arising out of or
relating to any act or omission of a Released Party to the extent such act or omission is
determined by a Final Order to have constituted willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad
faith, fraud or a criminal act.
Each Person providing releases under the Plan, including the Debtors, the Reorganized
Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Estates and the Releasing Parties, shall be
deemed to have granted the releases set forth in those sections notwithstanding that such
Person may hereafter discover facts in addition to, or different from, those which it now
knows or believes to be true, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence
of such different or additional facts, and such Person expressly waives any and all rights
that it may have under any statute or common law principle which would limit the effect of
such releases to those claims or causes of action actually known or suspected to exist at
the time of execution of such release.
44
(c) Release of Liens.
Except (a) with respect to the Liens securing the First Lien Exit Facility, to the extent set
forth in the First Lien Exit Facility Documents, and (b) as otherwise expressly provided in
the Plan, or in any contract, instrument, release, or other agreement or document created
pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date and concurrently with the applicable
distributions made pursuant to the Plan, all mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, and
other security interests against any property of the Debtors’ Estates shall be fully released
and discharged, and all of the right, title, and interest of any holder of such mortgages,
deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, and other security interests shall revert to the Reorganized
Debtors and each of their successors and assigns.
(d) Exculpation.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Exculpated Parties shall neither have nor incur any liability to any Entity for any
Restructuring-Related Action; provided that nothing in the foregoing “Exculpation” shall
exculpate any Entity from any liability resulting from any act or omission that is
determined by Final Order to have constituted fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence,
or criminal conduct; provided that each Exculpated Party shall be entitled to rely upon the
advice of counsel concerning his, her or its duties pursuant to, or in connection with, the
Plan or any other related document, instrument, or agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, as of the Effective Date, pursuant to
section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Solicitation Parties upon appropriate findings
of the Bankruptcy Court will be deemed to have solicited acceptance of the Plan in good
faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and to
have participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, in the offer, issuance, sale, or purchase of a security, offered or sold
under the Plan of a Reorganized Debtor, and shall not be liable to any Entity on account of
such solicitation or participation.
In addition to the protections afforded in this Article VII.G to the Exculpated Parties, and
not in any way reducing or limiting the application of such protections, the Bankruptcy
Court retains exclusive jurisdiction over any and all Causes of Action asserted against
any Debtor for any Restructuring-Related Action that are not otherwise exculpated or
enjoined by this Plan.
(e) Waiver of Avoidance Actions.
To the extent not already otherwise waived pursuant to another order of the Bankruptcy
Court, effective as of the Effective Date, the Debtors shall be deemed to have waived the
right to prosecute, and to have settled and released for fair value, any avoidance or
recovery actions under sections 545, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, and 553 of the Bankruptcy
Code or other applicable law that belong to the Debtors on account of paying or having
paid all General Unsecured Claims in full pursuant to an Order of the Court or this Plan.
(g) Limitations on Exculpations and Releases.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the Plan to the contrary, the releases and
exculpation contained in the Plan do not release any obligations of any party arising
under this Plan or any document, instrument or agreement (including those set forth in the
First Lien Exit Facility Documents, the New HERO Warrant Agreement and the Plan
Supplement) executed to implement the Plan.
(h) Preservation of Insurance.
The Debtors’ discharge, exculpation and release, and the exculpation and release in favor
of the Released Parties, as provided herein, shall not, except as necessary to be
consistent with this Plan, diminish or impair the enforceability of any insurance policy that
may provide coverage for claims against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Non-
Debtor Subsidiaries, their current and former directors and officers, or any other Person.
F. Distributions Under the Plan
45
One of the key concepts under the Bankruptcy Code is that only claims and interests that
are “allowed” may receive distributions under a chapter 11 plan. This term is used
throughout the Plan and the descriptions herein. In general, an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest means that the Debtors agree, or if there is a dispute, the Bankruptcy Court
determines, by Final Order, that the Claim or Equity Interest, and the amount thereof, is in
fact a valid obligation of or Equity Interest in the Debtors.
Filing Proofs of Claim
Holders of Claims need not file proofs of Claim with the Court. In the event that a holder of
a Claim elects to file a proof of Claim with the Court, it will be deemed to have consented to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of all purposes with respect to the determination,
liquidation, allowance, or disallowance of such Claim.
Disputed Claims Process
If the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) dispute any Claim as to which no
proof of Claim has been filed, such dispute shall be determined, resolved, or adjudicated,
as the case may be, in a manner as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced,
provided, however, that the Reorganized Debtors may elect, with the consent of the
Steering Group, to object under section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code to any proof of Claim
filed by or on behalf of a holder of a Claim.
Prosecution of Objections to Claims and Equity Interests
Except insofar as a Claim is Allowed under the Plan, the Debtors (with the consent of the
Steering Group), the Reorganized Debtors, and any other party in interest shall be entitled
to object to Claims. Any objections to Claims other than General Unsecured Claims shall
be filed and served by the Claims Objection Deadline. Any Claims other than General
Unsecured Claims not objected to by the Claims Objection Deadline shall be deemed
Allowed unless such period is extended upon approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, or any other party with
standing shall be entitled to dispute and/or otherwise object to any General Unsecured
Claim in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law. If the Debtors, Reorganized
Debtors, or any other party with standing dispute any General Unsecured Claim, such
dispute shall be determined, resolved, or adjudicated, as the case may be, in the manner
as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced. In any action or proceeding to
determine the existence, validity, or amount of any General Unsecured Claim, any and all
claims or defenses that could have been asserted by the applicable Debtor(s) or the Entity
holding such General Unsecured Claim are preserved as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not
been commenced.
No Interest
Except as specifically provided for in the Plan, no Claims or Equity Interests, Allowed or
otherwise (including Administrative Claims), shall be entitled, under any circumstances, to
receive any interest on a Claim or Equity Interests.
Allocation of Consideration
The aggregate consideration to be distributed to the holders of Allowed Claims in each
Class under the Plan shall be treated as first satisfying an amount equal to the principal
amount of the Allowed Claim for such holders, and any remaining consideration as
satisfying accrued, but unpaid interest, as applicable.
46
Disallowance of Certain Claims and Equity Interests
Except as provided herein or otherwise agreed, any and all proofs of Claim shall be
deemed expunged from the claims register on the Effective Date without any further notice
to or action, order, or approval of the Court and the Claim on which such proof of Claim
was filed shall be determined, resolved, or adjudicated, as the case may be, in the manner
as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced and shall survive the Effective Date
as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced.
Estimation.
Prior to or after the Effective Date, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or
the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, may (but are not required to), at any time, request
that the Court estimate (i) any Disputed Claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code or (ii) any contingent or unliquidated Claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code, for any reason, regardless of whether the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors has previously objected to such Claim or whether the Court has ruled on any
such objection. The Court will retain jurisdiction to estimate any Claim at any time,
including during proceedings concerning any objection to such Claim. In the event that
the Court estimates any Claim, such estimated amount shall constitute either (i) the
Allowed amount of such Claim, (ii) the amount on which a reserve is to be calculated for
purposes of any reserve requirement under the Plan or (iii) a maximum limitation on such
Claim, as determined by the Court. If the estimated amount constitutes the maximum
limitation on such Claim, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the
Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, may elect to object to any ultimate allowance of
such Claim. All of the aforementioned objection, estimation, and resolution procedures are
cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one another.
Insured Claims.
If any portion of an Allowed Claim is an Insured Claim, no distributions under the Plan
shall be made on account of such Allowed Claim until the holder of such Allowed Claim
has exhausted all remedies with respect to any applicable insurance policies. To the
extent that the Debtors’ insurers agree to satisfy a Claim in whole or in part, then
immediately upon such agreement, the portion of such Claim so satisfied may be
expunged without an objection to such Claim having to be filed and without any further
notice to or action, order or approval of the Court.
Allowed Claims.
(a) Delivery of Distributions.
Except as otherwise provided herein, distributions under the Plan shall be made by the
Reorganized Debtors (or their agent or designee) to the holders of Allowed Claims and
Allowed Equity Interests in all Classes for which a distribution is provided in this Plan at
the addresses set forth on the Schedules (if filed) or in the Debtors’ books and records, as
applicable, unless such addresses are superseded by proofs of Claim or Equity Interests
or transfers of Claim filed pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3001 by the Record Date (or at the
last known addresses of such holders if the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors have
been notified in writing of a change of address).
(b) Delivery of Distributions to Holders of Senior Notes Claims.
Each Senior Notes Indenture Trustee may, at the discretion of the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group), be deemed to be the holder of all applicable Senior Notes
Claims for purposes of distributions to be made hereunder, and all distributions on
account of each Senior Notes Claim may be, at the discretion of the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group), made to the applicable Senior Notes Indenture Trustee. If
such distributions are made to the applicable Senior Notes Indenture Trustee, as soon as
practicable following compliance with the requirements set forth in Article VIII of the Plan,
the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees shall arrange to deliver or direct the delivery of such
distributions to or on behalf of the holders of Allowed Senior Notes Claims in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Notes Indentures and the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in
the Plan to the
47
contrary, and without limiting the exculpation and release provisions of the Plan, the
Senior Notes Indenture Trustees shall not have any liability to any person with respect to
distributions made or directed to be made by the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees.
(c) Distribution of Cash.
Any payment of Cash by the Reorganized Debtors pursuant to the Plan will be made at the
option and in the sole discretion of the Reorganized Debtors by (i) a check drawn on, or
(ii) wire transfer from, a domestic bank selected by the Reorganized Debtors.
(d) Unclaimed Distributions of Cash.
Any distribution of Cash under the Plan that is unclaimed after six (6) months after it has
been delivered (or attempted to be delivered) shall, pursuant to section 347(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code, become the property of the Reorganized Debtors notwithstanding any
state or other escheat or similar laws to the contrary, and the entitlement by the holder of
such unclaimed Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest to such distribution or any
subsequent distribution on account of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest shall
be extinguished and forever barred.
(e) Distributions of New HERO Common Stock and Warrants.
On or about the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors (or their agent or designee) shall
distribute (i) the Senior Notes Equity Distribution to the holders of the Senior Notes
Claims, (ii) the Shareholder Equity Distribution to the holders of Allowed HERO Equity
Interests, and (iii) the New HERO Warrants to the holders of Allowed HERO Equity
Interests.
(f) Unclaimed Distributions of New HERO Common Stock and Warrants.
Any distribution of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants under the Plan
that is unclaimed after six (6) months after it has been delivered (or attempted to be
delivered) shall be retained by the Reorganized Debtors, notwithstanding any state or
other escheat or similar laws to the contrary, and the entitlement by the holder of such
Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest to such distribution or any subsequent
distribution on account of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest shall be
extinguished and forever barred.
G. Retention of Jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the entry of the Confirmation Order and the occurrence of the Effective
Date, the Bankruptcy Court shall retain its existing exclusive jurisdiction over all matters
arising in or out of, or related to, the Chapter 11 Cases or the Plan pursuant to sections
105(a) and 1142 of the Bankruptcy Code, including jurisdiction to:
i.
ii.

including Cure Claims pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; and

Equity Interests;

Date: (i) the First Lien Exit Facility Credit Agreement, (ii) the First Lien Exit Facility

organizational documents for any of the Reorganized Debtors (other than Reorganized
Hero), (vi) the New HERO Warrant Agreement and (v) the New HERO Management
Incentive Program Agreements.
H. Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.
The Bankruptcy Code grants the Debtors the power, subject to the approval of the Court,
to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases. If an executory contract or
unexpired lease is rejected, the other party to the agreement may file a claim for damages,
if any, incurred by reason of the rejection. In the case of the Debtors’ rejection of leases of
real property, such damage claims are subject to certain caps imposed by the Bankruptcy
Code.
Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.
Each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease shall be deemed assumed, without the
need for any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, as of
the Effective Date under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The assumption of
Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases hereunder may include the assignment of
certain of such contracts to Debtors or Non-Debtor Subsidiaries. The Confirmation Order
will constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the above-described
assumptions and assignments pursuant to sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code
as of the Effective Date.
Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the Debtors, the Steering Group, and
the applicable counterparty, each assumed Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease shall
include all modifications, amendments, supplements, restatements, or other agreements
related thereto, and all rights related thereto, if any, including all easements, licenses,
permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options, rights of first refusal, and any other
interests. Modifications, amendments, supplements, and restatements to prepetition
Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases that have been executed by the Debtors
during the Chapter 11 Cases shall not be deemed to alter the prepetition nature of the
Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or the validity, priority, or amount of any Claims
that may arise in connection therewith.
Cure Claims
At the election of the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized
Debtors, as applicable, any monetary defaults under each Executory Contract and
Unexpired Lease to be assumed under the Plan shall be satisfied pursuant to section
365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code in one of the following ways: (i) payment of the Cure
Claim in Cash on or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
(A) thirty (30) days after the determination of the Cure Claim, and (B) the Effective Date or
such other date as may be set by the Court; or (ii) on such other terms as agreed to by the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors and the non-
Debtor counterparty to such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease.
In the event of a dispute pertaining to assumption or assignment, the Cure Claim
payments required by section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be made following
the entry of a Final Order or orders resolving the dispute and approving the assumption.
No later than the Plan Supplement Filing Date, to the extent not previously filed with the
Court and served on affected counterparties, the Debtors shall provide for notices (in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group) of proposed assumption
and proposed cure
50
amounts to be sent to applicable contract and lease counterparties, together with
procedures for objecting thereto and resolution of disputes by the Court (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group). Any objection by a contract or
lease counterparty to a proposed assumption or related cure amount must be filed,
served, and actually received by the Debtors and counsel to the Steering Group by the
date on which objections to Confirmation are due (or such other date as may be provided
in the applicable assumption notice). Any counterparty to an Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease that fails to object timely to the proposed assumption or cure amount will
be deemed to have assented to such assumption or cure amount.
The only adequate assurance of future performance shall be the promise of the
Reorganized Debtors to perform all obligations under any executory contract or unexpired
lease under this Plan.
ASSUMPTION OF ANY EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR UNEXPIRED LEASE PURSUANT TO
THE PLAN OR OTHERWISE SHALL RESULT IN THE FULL RELEASE AND
SATISFACTION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DEFAULTS, WHETHER MONETARY OR
NONMONETARY, INCLUDING DEFAULTS OF PROVISIONS RESTRICTING THE CHANGE
IN CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP INTEREST COMPOSITION OR OTHER BANKRUPTCY-
RELATED DEFAULTS, ARISING UNDER ANY ASSUMED EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR
UNEXPIRED LEASE AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE DATE ANY OF THE DEBTORS OR THE
REORGANIZED DEBTORS ASSUMES SUCH EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR UNEXPIRED
LEASE. ANY PROOFS OF CLAIM FILED WITH RESPECT TO AN EXECUTORY
CONTRACT OR UNEXPIRED LEASE THAT HAS BEEN ASSUMED SHALL BE DEEMED
DISALLOWED AND EXPUNGED, WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE TO OR ACTION, ORDER
OR APPROVAL OF THE COURT.
Obligations arising under insurance policies assumed by any of the Debtors before the
Effective Date shall be adequately protected in accordance with any order authorizing
such assumption.
Reservation of Rights
Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute an admission by the Debtors that any such
contract or lease is in fact an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or that any
Reorganized Debtor has any liability thereunder. If there is a dispute regarding whether a
contract or lease is or was executory or unexpired at the time of assumption, the Debtors
(with the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall
have 45 days following entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute to alter their treatment
of such contract or lease, in which case the deemed assumptions and rejections provided
for in the Plan shall not apply to such contract or lease.
Assignment
Any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to be held by any of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors and assumed hereunder or otherwise in the Chapter 11 Cases, if not
expressly assigned to a third party previously in the Chapter 11 Cases, will be deemed
assigned to the applicable Reorganized Debtor pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code. If an objection to a proposed assumption, assumption and assignment, or Cure
Claim is not resolved in favor of the Debtors before the Effective Date, the applicable
Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease may be designated by the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors for rejection within five
(5) Business Days of the entry of the order of the Court resolving the matter against the
Debtors. Such rejection shall be deemed effective as of the Effective Date.
Post-Petition Contracts and Leases
All contracts, agreements, and leases that were entered into by one or more of the Debtors
or assumed by any of the Debtors after the Petition Date shall be deemed assigned by the
applicable Debtor(s) to the applicable Reorganized Debtor(s) on the Effective Date.
Insurance Policies.
51
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, all of the Debtors’ insurance policies
and any agreements, documents or instruments relating thereto, are treated as and
deemed to be Executory Contracts under the Plan. On the Effective Date, the Debtors shall
be deemed to have assumed all insurance policies and any agreements, documents, and
instruments related thereto.
I. Miscellaneous Provisions
Immediate Binding Effect
Notwithstanding Bankruptcy Rules 3020(e), 6004(h), 7062, or otherwise, upon the

in the Plan, each Entity acquiring property under the Plan, and any and all non-Debtor
parties to Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases with any of the Debtors.
Governing Law
Unless a rule of law or procedure is supplied by federal law (including the Bankruptcy
Code and Bankruptcy Rules), the laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof that would require or permit the application of the law
of another jurisdiction) shall govern the construction and implementation of the Plan and
any agreements, documents, and instruments executed in connection with the Plan,
unless otherwise specified.
Filing or Execution of Additional Documents
On or before the Effective Date or as soon thereafter as is practicable, the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors shall (on terms materially consistent with the Plan) file with the Court

or appropriate to effectuate and further evidence the terms and conditions of the Plan,
which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group.
Reservation of Rights.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the Plan shall have no force or effect unless and until
the Bankruptcy Court enters the Confirmation Order. Neither the filing of the Plan, any
statement or provision contained herein, nor the taking of any action by a Debtor or any

Interests or other Entity; or (b) any Holder of a Claim or an Equity Interest or other Entity
prior to the Effective Date.
Successors and Assigns.

reporting requirements imposed by any United States federal, state, local, or non-U.S.
taxing authority and all distributions hereunder shall be subject to any such withholding
and reporting requirements. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the
Reorganized Debtors shall be authorized to take all actions necessary or appropriate to
comply with such withholding and reporting requirements, including liquidating a portion
of the distribution to be made under the Plan to generate sufficient funds to pay applicable
withholding taxes, withholding distribution pending receipt of information necessary or
appropriate to facilitate such distributions, or establishing any other mechanisms they
believe are reasonable and appropriate.
Exemption From Transfer Taxes.

HERO Management Incentive Program Equity, and the security interests in favor of the
lenders under the First Lien Exit Facility, (ii) the making or assignment of any lease or
sublease, or (iii) the making or delivery of any other instrument whatsoever, in furtherance
of or in connection with the Plan, shall not be subject to any stamp, conveyance,
mortgage, sales or use, real estate transfer, recording, or other similar tax or governmental
assessment, and upon entry of the Confirmation Order, the appropriate state or local
governmental officials or agents shall forgo the collection of any such tax or governmental
assessment and accept for filing and recordation any of the foregoing instruments or
other documents without the payment of any such tax, recordation fee, or governmental
assessment.
Plan Supplement.

they are filed and shall promptly make such changes available online at www.pacer.gov
and cases.primeclerk.com/hercules.
Conflicts
The terms of the Plan shall govern in the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and
the Disclosure Statement. In the event of any inconsistency with the Plan and the
Confirmation Order, the Confirmation Order shall govern with respect to such
inconsistency.

B. Waiver of Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness
The Debtors, with the written consent of the Steering Group, may waive conditions set
forth in Article XI.A of the Plan at any time without leave of or order of the Court and
without any formal action.
C. Effect of Failure of Condition
In the event that the Effective Date does not occur on or before fifteen (15) days after the

shall constitute or be deemed a waiver, release, or discharge of any Claims or Equity
Interests by or against the Debtors or any other person or to prejudice in any manner the
rights of the Debtors or any person in any further proceedings involving the Debtors
unless extended by Court order.
D. Vacatur of Confirmation Order
54

Equity Interests; (ii) prejudice in any manner the rights of the holder of any Claim,
Guarantee Claim, or Equity Interest; (iii) prejudice in any manner any right, remedy, or
claim of the Debtors or the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries; or (iv) be deemed an admission

E. Modification of the Plan
Subject to the limitations contained in the Plan, and subject to the terms of the
Restructuring Support Agreement, (i) the Debtors reserve the right (with the consent of the
Steering Group), in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules, to
amend or modify the Plan prior to the entry of the Confirmation Order, including
amendments or modifications to satisfy section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and
(ii) after entry of the Confirmation Order, with the consent of the Steering Group, the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, may, upon order of the Court,
amend or modify the Plan, in accordance with section 1127(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confirmation Order shall authorize the Debtors (with
the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, to
make appropriate technical adjustments, remedy any defect or omission, or reconcile any
inconsistencies in the Plan, the documents included in the Plan Supplement, any and all
exhibits to the Plan, and/or the Confirmation Order, as may be necessary to carry out the
purposes and effects of the Plan, provided, however, that such action does not materially
and adversely affect the treatment of holders of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests
pursuant to the Plan.
F. Revocation, Withdrawal, or Non-Consummation.
Right to Revoke or Withdraw
The Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) reserve the right to revoke or
withdraw the Plan at any time before the Effective Date; provided, however, that this
provision shall have no impact on the rights of the Steering Group, as set forth in the
Restructuring Support Agreement, in respect of any such revocation or withdrawal.
Effect of Withdrawal, Revocation, or Non-Consummation
If the Debtors revoke or withdraw the Plan prior to the Effective Date, or if the Confirmation
Date or the Effective Date does not occur, the Plan, any settlement or compromise
embodied in the Plan (including the fixing or limiting to an amount certain any Claim or
Equity Interest or Class of Claims or Equity Interests), the assumption or rejection of
Executory Contracts, Unexpired Leases or benefit plans effected by the Plan, any release,
exculpation, or indemnification provided for in the Plan, and any document or agreement
executed pursuant to the Plan shall be null and void. In such event, nothing contained
herein, and no acts taken in preparation for consummation of the Plan shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver or release of any Claims by or against or Equity Interests in the
Debtors or any other Person, to prejudice in any manner the rights of the Debtors or any
Person in any further proceedings involving the Debtors, or to constitute an admission of
any sort by the Debtors or any other Person.
IX. CONFIRMATION PROCEDURES
A. Combined Disclosure Statement and Confirmation Hearing
Section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires a bankruptcy court, after notice, to hold a
hearing on confirmation of a chapter 11 plan and section 1129(b) provides that any party
in interest may object to the confirmation of the chapter 11 plan. When the Debtors
commence their Chapter 11 Cases, they will contemporaneously file a motion on the
Petition Date to schedule a hearing on the adequacy of the Disclosure Statement, the
sufficiency of the solicitation procedures, and confirmation of the Plan (“Combined
Hearing”).
55
Notice of the Combined Hearing will be provided to holders of Claims and Equity Interests
or their agents or representatives as established in the order establishing the schedule for
the Combined Hearing and related objections (“Notice of Combined Hearing”). Objections
to the Disclosure Statement and confirmation of the Plan must be filed with the Court by
the date set forth in the Notice of Combined Hearing and will be governed by Bankruptcy
Rules 3020(b) and 9014 and the local rules of the Court. UNLESS AN OBJECTION IS
TIMELY FILED AND SERVED, IT MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT.
B. Standards for Confirmation
At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan only if all of the
requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code are met. Among the requirements
for confirmation of a plan are that the plan is (i) accepted by all Impaired classes of Claims
and Equity Interests or, if rejected by an Impaired class, that the plan “does not
discriminate unfairly” and is “fair and equitable” as to such class, (ii) feasible and (iii) in the
“best interests” of creditors and equity interest holders that are Impaired under the Plan.
The following requirements must be satisfied pursuant to section 1129(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code before the Bankruptcy Court may confirm a plan of reorganization. The
Plan fully complies with the statutory requirements for Confirmation listed below.
•
The Plan complies with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
•
The proponents of the Plan have complied with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.
•
The Plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.
•
•
•
•
•
•
Any payment made or to be made by the Debtors (or any other proponent of the
Plan) or by a Person issuing Securities or acquiring property under the Plan, for
services or for costs and expenses in or in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, in
connection with the Plan and incident to the Chapter 11 Cases is subject to the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court as reasonable.
The Debtors (or any other proponent of the Plan) have disclosed the identity and
affiliations of any individual proposed to serve, after Confirmation, as a director, or
officer, the Reorganized Debtors, any Affiliate of the Debtors reorganized under the
Plan, or any successor to the Debtors under the Plan, and the appointment to, or
continuance in, such office of such individual is consistent with the interests of
Creditors and holders of Interests and with public policies.
The proponent of the Plan has disclosed the identity of any Insider that will be
employed or retained the Reorganized Debtors and the nature of any compensation
for such Insider.
Any governmental regulatory commission with jurisdiction, after confirmation of the
Plan, over the rates of the Debtors has approved any rate change provided for in the
Plan, or such rate change is expressly conditioned on such approval.
With respect to each holder within an Impaired Class of Claims or Interests, each
such holder (a) has accepted the Plan or (b) will receive or retain under the Plan on
account of such Claim or Interest property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is
not less than the amount that such holder would so receive or retain if the Debtors
were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on such date.
With respect to each Class of Claims or Interests, such Class (a) has accepted the
Plan or (b) is Unimpaired under the Plan (subject to the “cram-down” provisions
discussed below).
56
•
The Plan provides for treatment of Claims, as applicable, in accordance with the
provisions of section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.
•
•
•
If a Class of Claims or Equity Interests is Impaired under the Plan, at least one Class
of Claims or Equity Interests that is Impaired under the Plan has accepted the Plan,
determined without including any acceptance of the Plan by any Insider.
Confirmation is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further
financial reorganization, of the Reorganized Debtors, or any successor to the
Debtors under the Plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the
Plan.
All fees payable under 28 U.S.C. § 1930 have been paid or the Plan provides for the
payment of all such fees on the Effective Date.
Best Interests Test/Liquidation Analysis
As described above, section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that each holder
of an Impaired Claim or Interest either (a) accept the Plan or (b) receive or retain under the
Plan property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not less than the value such
holder would receive if the Debtors were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code. To assist holders in determining whether the Plan meets this requirement, the
Debtors, with the assistance of Alvarez & Marsal (“A&M”), have prepared an unaudited
liquidation analysis, which is attached hereto as Exhibit E (the “Liquidation Analysis”).
The distributions to all classes of Claims and Interests will exceed any likely recovery
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, as more fully discussed in further
detail in Article X.A of this Disclosure Statement, the Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies
the best interests test of Bankruptcy Code section 1129(a)(7).
Feasibility
The Bankruptcy Code requires that a debtor demonstrate that confirmation of a plan of
reorganization is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial
reorganization. For purposes of determining whether the Plan meets this requirement, the
Debtors have analyzed their ability to meet their obligations under the Plan. As part of this
analysis, and as discussed in further detail in Article X.A of this Disclosure Statement, the
Debtors have prepared projections, which, together with the assumptions on which they
are based, are attached hereto as Exhibit D (the “Financial Projections”). Based on such
Financial Projections, the Debtors believe that they will be able to make all payments
required under the Plan. Therefore, Confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by
liquidation or the need for further reorganization.
Confirmation Without Acceptance by All Impaired Classes
Under Bankruptcy Code section 1129(b), the Bankruptcy Court may confirm a plan of
reorganization over the rejection or deemed rejection of the plan of reorganization by a
class of claims or interests if the plan of reorganization “does not discriminate unfairly”
and is “fair and equitable” with respect to such class. In these cases, only the class of
HERO Equity Interests is deemed to reject the Plan. As set forth more fully below, the Plan
does not unfairly discriminate against the holders of such HERO Equity Interests and is
fair and equitable with respect to such Interests. Indeed, holders of HERO Equity Interests
are receiving New HERO Equity Interests and New HERO Warrants despite the fact that
they are out of the money.
No Unfair Discrimination
This test applies to Classes of Claims or Equity Interests that are of equal priority and are
receiving different treatment under the Plan. The test does not require that the treatment
be the same or equivalent, but that such treatment be “fair.” The Debtors do not believe
the Plan discriminates unfairly against any Impaired Class of Claims or Equity Interests.
The Debtors believe the Plan and the treatment of all Classes of Claims and Equity
Interests under the Plan satisfy the foregoing requirements for nonconsensual
confirmation.
Fair and Equitable Test
57
This test applies to Classes of different priority and status (e.g., secured versus
unsecured) and includes the general requirement that no Class of Claims or Equity
Interests receive more than 100% of the amount of the allowed Claims or Equity Interests
in such Class. As to the dissenting Class, the test sets different standards depending on
the type of Claims or Equity Interests of the Debtor in such Class. In order to demonstrate
that a plan is fair and equitable, the plan proponent must demonstrate:
•
•
•
Secured Creditors: Each holder of a secured claim: (1) retains its liens on the
property, to the extent of the allowed amount of its secured claim, and receives
deferred cash payments having a value, as of the effective date of the chapter 11
plan, of at least the allowed amount of such claim; (2) has the right to credit bid the
amount of its claim if its property is sold and retains its liens on the proceeds of the
sale (or if sold, on the proceeds thereof); or (3) receives the “indubitable equivalent”
of its allowed secured claim.
Unsecured Creditors: Either (1) each holder of an impaired unsecured claim
receives or retains under the chapter 11 plan property of a value equal to the amount
of its allowed claim or (2) the holders of claims and interests that are junior to the
claims of the non-accepting class will not receive any property under the chapter 11
plan.
Equity Interests: Either (1) each holder of an impaired interest will receive or retain
under the chapter 11 plan property of a value equal to the greatest of the fixed
liquidation preference to which such holder is entitled, the fixed redemption price to
which such holder is entitled, or the value of the interest or (2) the holders of interests
that are junior to the non-accepting class will not receive or retain any property under
the chapter 11 plan.
The Debtors believe the Plan satisfies the “fair and equitable” requirement
notwithstanding that Class 7 is deemed to reject the Plan, because, as to such Class, there
is no Class of equal priority receiving more favorable treatment and no Class that is junior
to such Class will receive or retain any property on account of the Claims in such Class.
The Release, Exculpation and Injunction Provisions Contained in the Plan
Article VII.E of the Plan provides for releases of certain claims and Causes of Action that
the Debtors may hold against the Released Parties. The Released Parties are comprised of
the following Entities: (a) the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries; (b) the Steering Group; (c) the
Steering Group Members; (d) the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees; and (e) with respect to
each of the foregoing Entities in clauses (a) through (d), such Entity’s predecessors,
successors and assigns, affiliates, subsidiaries, funds, portfolio companies, management
companies, and each of their respective current and former (to the extent employed or
serving at any time during the Chapter 11 Cases) directors, officers, members, employees,
partners, managers, independent contractors, agents, representatives, principals,
Professionals, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, investment
bankers, and other professional advisors (each solely in their capacity as such).
Article VII.F of the Plan provides for releases of certain claims and Causes of Action that
holders of Claims or Equity Interests may hold against the Released Parties in exchange
for good and valuable consideration, including the service of the Released Parties to
facilitate the reorganization of the Debtors, the implementation of the restructuring
contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement or the Plan, and the compromises
contained in the Plan (the “Third-Party Release”). The holders of Claims and Interests who
are releasing certain claims and Causes of Action against the Released Parties under the
Third-Party Release include: (a) the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees; (b) the Steering
Group and the Steering Group Members; (c) any holder of an Impaired Claim that (i) votes
to accept the Plan or (ii) either (A) abstains from voting, (B) votes to reject the Plan or (C) is
a Non-Eligible Noteholder and, in the case of either (A), (B) or (C), does not opt out of the
voluntary release contained in Section VII.F of the Plan by checking the opt out box on the
Ballot, and returning it in accordance with
58
the instructions set forth thereon, indicating that they opt not to grant the releases
provided in the Plan; (d) holders of Unimpaired Claims; (e) any holder of a HERO Equity
Interest that does not opt out of the voluntary release contained in Section VII.F of the Plan
by checking the opt out box on the Equity Release Consent Notice, and returning it in
accordance with the instructions set forth thereon, indicating that they opt not to grant the
releases provided in the Plan; (f) the current and former officers and directors of the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, and the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries; and (g) with respect
to each of the foregoing Entities in clauses (a) through (f), such Entity’s predecessors,
successors and assigns, affiliates, subsidiaries, funds, portfolio companies, management
companies, and each of their respective current and former shareholders, directors,
officers, members, employees, partners, managers, independent contractors, agents,
representatives, principals, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
investment bankers, and other professional advisors (each solely in their capacity as
such).
Article VII.G of the Plan provides for the exculpation from liability of each Exculpated Party
for any Restructuring-Related Actions. The released and exculpated claims are limited to
those claims or Causes of Action that may have arisen in connection with, related to, or
arising out of the restructuring of the Debtors or the Chapter 11 Cases.
Article VII.H of the Plan permanently enjoins Entities who have held, hold, or may hold
Claims or Equity Interests against the Debtors that have been released or discharged
pursuant to the Plan or are subject to exculpation pursuant to the Plan from asserting
such Claims or Equity Interests, or taking certain other actions, against the Debtors, the
Reorganized Debtors and the Released Parties.
Under applicable law, the Debtors’ release of the Released Parties is appropriate where:
(a) there is an identity of interest between the debtor and the third party, such that a suit
against the released non-debtor party is, at core, a suit against the debtor or will deplete
assets of the estate; (b) there is a substantial contribution by the non-debtor of assets to
the reorganization; (c) the injunction is essential to the reorganization; (d) there is
overwhelming creditor support for the injunction; and (e) the chapter 11 plan will pay all or
substantially all of the claims affected by the injunction. See In re Indianapolis Downs,
LLC, 486 B.R. 286, 303 (Bankr. D. Del. 2013). Importantly, these factors are “neither
exclusive nor are they a list of conjunctive requirements,” but “[i]nstead, they are helpful
in weighing the equities of the particular case after a fact-specific review.” Id. Further, a
chapter 11 plan may provide for a release of third party claims against non-debtors, such
as the Third-Party Release, where such releases are consensual. Id. at 304–06. In addition,
exculpation is appropriate where it applies to estate fiduciaries. Id. at 306. Finally, an
injunction is appropriate where it is necessary to the reorganization and fair pursuant to
section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. See In re W.R. Grace & Co., 475 B.R. 34, 107 (D.
Del. 2012).
The Debtors believe that the releases, exculpations, and injunctions set forth in the Plan
are appropriate because, among other things, the releases are narrowly tailored to the
Debtors’ restructuring proceedings, and each of the Released Parties has afforded value
to the Debtors and aided in the reorganization process, which facilitated the Debtors’
ability to propose and pursue confirmation of the Plan. The Debtors believe that each of
the Released Parties has played an integral role in negotiating and formulating the
Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan and has expended significant time and
resources analyzing and negotiating the issues presented by the Debtors’ prepetition
capital structure. Furthermore, holders of Senior Notes Claims are voluntarily forgoing
their right to part of the distributions under the Plan that they are otherwise entitled to
receive so that the Debtors can (i) pay in full Allowed General Unsecured Claims, such as
the Claims of suppliers and vendors, in the ordinary course according to existing
business terms and (ii) provide a Pro Rata distribution of a portion of the New HERO
Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants to holders of HERO Equity Interests in
exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their Equity Interests, provided that they do
not opt out of the voluntary releases contained in the Plan. In addition, certain holders of
Senior Notes Claims have agreed to backstop the First Lien Exit Facility. The Debtors
further believe that such releases, exculpations, and injunctions are a necessary part of
the Plan. Finally, the Debtors believe the Third-Party Release is entirely consensual under
the established case law in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware. See Indianapolis Downs, 486 B.R. at 304–06. The Debtors will be prepared to
meet their burden to establish the basis for the releases, exculpations, and injunctions for
each of the Released Parties and each Exculpated Party as part of Confirmation of the
Plan.
59
C. Alternatives to Confirmation and Consummation of the Plan
If the Plan is not confirmed and consummated, the alternatives to the Plan include
(i) liquidation of the Debtor under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) an alternative
plan of reorganization or a plan of liquidation.
The Court could confirm a plan different from the Plan. While the Plan provides for the
reorganization of the Debtors’ business as a going concern and the conversion of
approximately $1.2 billion of funded debt into equity, a different plan might involve either a
reorganization and continuation of the Debtors’ business or, in the alternative, a sale or
liquidation of the Debtors’ assets. In the event the Plan is not confirmed, there is no
guaranty the Debtors will be able to obtain any investment at all, let alone one that would
provide recoveries as favorable to its stakeholders as those provided pursuant to the
Plan. As an alternative to a going concern reorganization, a sale or liquidation of Debtors’
assets would, in Debtors’ view, be unlikely to provide returns equal or greater to the
returns provided by the Plan.
The Debtors believe that any alternative to the Plan would provide far less certainty and
could involve a larger Claims pool, diminished recoveries, significant delay, and larger
administrative costs. The Debtors believe that the Plan, as described herein, enables
creditors to realize the highest and best value under the circumstances as compared to
any foreseeable alternative.
If no plan is confirmed, the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to cases under chapter 7
of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to
liquidate the Debtors’ assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established
by chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. A discussion of the effects that a chapter 7
liquidation would have on the recoveries of holders of Claims and Equity Interests is set
forth in the Liquidation Analysis annexed as Exhibit E to this Disclosure Statement. For
the reasons above, the Debtors believe that liquidation under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code would result in smaller distributions being made to creditors than those provided for
in the Plan.
X. LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS, VALUATION AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. Liquidation Analysis
The Debtors believe that the Plan provides a greater recovery for holders of Allowed
Claims and Equity Interests as would be achieved in a liquidation under chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code. This belief is based on a number of considerations, including: (a) the
likely erosion in value of the Debtors’ rigs and vessels in a chapter 7 case in the context of
an expeditious liquidation and the “forced sale” atmosphere that would prevail under a
chapter 7 liquidation; (b) the additional Administrative Claims generated by conversion to
a chapter 7 case and any related costs in connection with a chapter 7 liquidation; (c) the
absence of a robust market for the liquidation sale of the Debtors’ assets and services in
which such assets and services could be marketed and sold; and (d) the additional claims
that would arise by reason of the breach or rejection in a chapter 7 of obligations under
leases and executory contracts that would otherwise be assumed under the Plan.
The Debtors, with the assistance of A&M, have prepared the Liquidation Analysis, which is
attached hereto as Exhibit E, to assist holders of Claims and Interests in evaluating the
Plan. The Liquidation Analysis compares the projected recoveries that would result from
the liquidation of the Debtors in a hypothetical case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code with the estimated distributions to holders of Allowed Claims and Interests under the
Plan. The Liquidation Analysis is based on the value of the Debtors’ assets and liabilities
as of a certain date and incorporates various estimates and assumptions, including a
hypothetical conversion to a chapter 7 liquidation as of a certain date. Further, the
Liquidation Analysis is subject to potentially material changes, including with respect to
economic and business conditions and legal rulings. Therefore, the actual liquidation
value of the Debtors could vary materially from the estimate provided in the Liquidation
Analysis.
B. Valuation Analysis
60
The Plan provides for the distribution of (a) New HERO Common Stock to holders of
Senior Notes Claims in Class 3 and HERO Equity Interests in Class 7 and (b) New HERO
Warrants to holders of HERO Equity Interests in Class 7, in each case upon
consummation of the Plan. Accordingly, Lazard, at the request of the Debtors, has
performed an analysis, which is attached hereto as Exhibit F, of the estimated implied
value of Reorganized HERO and its subsidiaries on a going-concern basis as of
September 30, 2015 (the “Valuation Analysis”). The Valuation Analysis, including the
procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications, and limitations on review
undertaken described therein, should be read in conjunction with Article XI of this
Disclosure Statement, entitled “Certain Risk Factors to be Considered.” The Valuation
Analysis is dated July 13, 2015, and is based on data and information as of that date.
Lazard makes no representations as to changes to such data and information that may
have occurred since the date of the Valuation Analysis.
C. Financial Projections
In connection with the planning and development of the Plan, the Debtors prepared
projections for the calendar years 2015 through 2018 to present the anticipated impact of
the Plan. The projections assume that the Plan will be implemented in accordance with its
stated terms. The Debtors are unaware of any circumstances as of the date of this
Disclosure Statement that would require the re-forecasting of the projections due to a
material change in the Debtors’ prospects. The projections are based on forecasts of key
economic variables and may be significantly impacted by, among other factors, changes
in the competitive environment, regulatory changes, and/or a variety of other factors,
including the factors listed in this Disclosure Statement and in the projections.
Accordingly, the estimates and assumptions underlying the projections are inherently
uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic, and competitive
uncertainties. Therefore, such projections, estimates, and assumptions are not
necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly
less or more favorable than set forth herein. The projections should be read in conjunction
with the assumptions, qualifications, and explanations set forth in this Disclosure
Statement and other financial information. The Debtors’ financial projections for the
calendar years 2015 through 2018 including management’s assumptions related thereto,
are attached hereto as Exhibit C.
The Financial Projections are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially include, but are not limited to: the ability of Reorganized HERO to operate
the Reorganized Debtors’ businesses consistent with its projections generally, including
the ability to maintain or increase revenue and cash flow to satisfy its liquidity needs,
service its indebtedness and finance the ongoing obligations of its business, and to
manage its future operating expenses and make necessary capital expenditures; the
ability of the Reorganized Debtors to comply with the covenants and conditions under
their credit facilities and their ability to borrow thereunder; the loss or reduction in
business from the Debtors’ significant customers or the failure of the Debtors’ significant
customers to perform their obligations to the Debtors; the loss or material downtime of
major suppliers; material declines in demand for services; changes in production of, or
demand for, hydrocarbons, either generally or in particular regions; changes in the typical
seasonal variations; social or political unrest or conflict in areas where Hercules conducts
its business, particularly in foreign countries; increases in costs including, without
limitation, crew wages, insurance, provisions, repairs and maintenance; changes in rules
and regulations applicable to the industry including, without limitation, legislation adopted
by international organizations or by individual countries; actions by the courts, the U.S.
Department of Justice or other governmental or regulatory authorities, and the results of
the legal proceedings to which the Reorganized Debtors or any of their affiliates may be
subject; changes in the condition of the Debtors’ operating assets or applicable
maintenance or regulatory standards (which may affect, among other things, the Debtors’
anticipated maintenance and repair costs); the Reorganized Debtors’ ability to attract and
maintain key executives, managers and employees; changes in general domestic and
international political conditions; and adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
rates affecting the Debtors’ expenses.
The projections should be read in conjunction Article XI of this Disclosure Statement,
entitled “Certain Risk Factors to be Considered.”
D. Other Available Information
HERO files with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K and all required amendments to those reports, proxy
statements and registration
61
statements. You may read and copy any material HERO files with the SEC at the SEC’s
Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may also obtain
information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-
SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an internet site at www.sec.gov that contains
reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers,
including HERO, that file electronically.
All of HERO’s reports and materials filed with the SEC are available free of charge through
its website, www.herculesoffshore.com, as soon as reasonably practical, after HERO
electronically files such material with the SEC.
HERO’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, together
with other financial information for prior reporting periods, are included in its Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2015. Such
information was prepared assuming that HERO will continue as a going concern and
contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, however, may be
contingent upon, among other factors, the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of a plan of
reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases and the Company’s ability to implement such a
plan of reorganization.
XI. CERTAIN RISK FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED
HOLDERS OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE DEBTORS SHOULD READ AND CONSIDER
CAREFULLY THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, AS WELL AS THE OTHER
INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT (AND THE DOCUMENTS
DELIVERED TOGETHER HEREWITH AND/OR INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
REFERENCE) PRIOR TO VOTING TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PLAN. THESE RISK
FACTORS SHOULD NOT, HOWEVER, BE REGARDED AS CONSTITUTING THE ONLY
RISKS INVOLVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLAN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION.
A. General
The following provides a summary of various important considerations and risk factors
associated with the Plan; however, it is not exhaustive. In considering whether to vote to
accept or reject the Plan, holders of Claims and Equity Interests should read and carefully
consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as all other information set forth or
otherwise referenced or incorporated by reference in this Disclosure Statement.
B. Certain Bankruptcy Law Considerations
Parties in Interest May Object to the Debtors’ Classification of Claims and Interests.
Section 1122 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor may place a claim or an
equity interest in a particular class under a plan of reorganization only if such claim or
equity interest is substantially similar to the other claims or equity interests in such class.
The Debtors believe that the classification of Claims and Equity Interests in the Plan
complies with the Bankruptcy Code requirements because the Debtors classified Claims
and Equity Interests, each encompassing Claims or Equity Interests, as applicable, that
are substantially similar to the other Claims and Equity Interests in each such Class.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the Court will reach the same conclusion.
Contingencies Not to Affect Votes of Impaired Classes to Accept or Reject the Plan.
The distributions available to holders of Allowed Claims under the Plan can be affected by
a variety of contingencies, including, without limitation, whether or not the Court enters an
order subordinating certain Allowed Claims to other Allowed Claims. The occurrence of
any and all such contingencies, which could affect the distributions available to holders of
Allowed Claims under the Plan, will not affect the validity of the vote taken by the Voting
Class to accept or reject the Plan or require any sort of revote by the Voting Class.
62
The Debtors May Fail to Satisfy the Solicitation Requirements Requiring a Re-Solicitation.
Section 1126(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the holder of a claim against, or
equity interest in, a debtor who accepts or rejects a plan of reorganization before the
commencement of a chapter 11 case is deemed to have accepted or rejected such plan
under the Bankruptcy Code so long as the solicitation of votes was made in accordance
with applicable non-bankruptcy law governing the adequacy of disclosure in connection
with such solicitation or, if such laws do not exist, such acceptance was solicited after
disclosure of “adequate information” as defined in section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Additionally, Bankruptcy Rule 3018(b) states that a holder of a claim or equity interest who
has accepted or rejected a plan before commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy
Code will not be deemed to have accepted or rejected the plan if the Court finds that the
plan was not transmitted to substantially all creditors and equity security holders of the
same class, that an unreasonably short time was prescribed for solicitation of creditors or
equity security holders to accept or reject the plan, or that the solicitation was not in
compliance with section 1126(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.
To satisfy the requirements of Bankruptcy Code section 1126(b) and Bankruptcy Rule
3018(b), the Debtors will be delivering the solicitation materials to all Holders of Senior
Notes Claims as of the Voting Record Date, although only Accredited Investors and
Qualified Institutional Buyers are being solicited and will have their votes counted.
Accordingly, the Debtors believe that the solicitation is proper under applicable non-
bankruptcy law, rules, and regulations. The Debtors cannot be certain, however, that the
solicitation of acceptances or rejections will be approved by the Court, and if such
approval is not obtained, Confirmation of the Plan could be denied. If the Court were to
conclude that the Debtors did not satisfy the solicitation requirements, then the Debtors
may seek to re-solicit votes to accept or reject the Plan or solicit votes from one or more
Classes not previously solicited. The Debtors cannot provide any assurances that such a
re-solicitation would be successful. Re-solicitation could delay or jeopardize Confirmation
of the Plan and result in termination of the Restructuring Support Agreement. Non-
confirmation of the Plan and loss of the benefits under the Restructuring Support
Agreement could result in protracted Chapter 11 Cases, which could significantly and
detrimentally impact relationships with vendors, suppliers, employees, and major
customers.
The Restructuring Support Agreement Could be Terminated.
The Restructuring Support Agreement contains certain provisions that give the Steering
Group the ability to terminate the Restructuring Support Agreement if various conditions
are satisfied. Among other things, the Restructuring Support Agreement provides that the
appointment of an official committee of equity security holders in the Chapter 11 Cases
would constitute a termination event due to the fact that, based on the Valuation Analysis,
holders of HERO Equity Interests are not entitled to a distribution under the Plan. As noted
above, termination of the Restructuring Support Agreement could result in protracted
Chapter 11 Cases, which could significantly and detrimentally impact relationships with
vendors, suppliers, employees, and major customers.
Risk of Non-Confirmation, Non-Occurrence, or Delay of the Plan.
Because the Plan is proposed as a prepackaged plan, the Debtors will begin soliciting
votes before the commencement of Chapter 11 Case. If votes are received from holders of
Senior Note Claims in number and amount sufficient to satisfy the requirements to confirm
a chapter 11 plan, then the Debtors will commence the Chapter 11 Cases and seek
Confirmation of the Plan as soon as reasonably practicable. If insufficient votes are
received, the Debtors may seek to accomplish an alternative to the Plan. There can be no
assurance that the terms of an alternative plan would be similar, or as favorable, to the
Holders of Allowed Claims or Allowed Equity Interests as those proposed by the Plan.
Additionally, if the Plan is not accepted prior to the Petition Date by the requisite number
of votes from the holders of Senior Note Claims, then the Debtors may commence the
Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a pre-negotiated plan of reorganization or could
pursue other out-of- court restructuring alternatives.
For the Debtors to emerge successfully from the Chapter 11 Cases as a viable entity, the
Debtors, like any other chapter 11 debtor, must obtain approval of the Plan from its
creditors and confirmation of the Plan through the Court, and then successfully implement
the Plan. The foregoing process requires the Debtors to (i) meet
63
certain statutory requirements with respect to the adequacy of this Disclosure Statement,
(ii) solicit and obtain creditor acceptances of the Plan, and (iii) fulfill other statutory
conditions with respect to the confirmation of the Plan.
Although the Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies all of the requirements necessary for
confirmation by the Court, there can be no assurance that the Court will reach the same
conclusion. Moreover, there can be no assurance that modifications to the Plan will not be
required for Confirmation, or that such modifications would not necessitate the re-
solicitation of votes to accept the Plan, as modified. Additionally, by its terms, the Plan will
not become effective unless, among other things, the conditions precedent described in
Article VIII.A of this Disclosure Statement have been satisfied or waived in accordance
with Article XI.A of the Plan.
Risk of Non-Occurrence of the Effective Date.
Although the milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement require that the Effective
Date occur by November 7, 2015, there can be no assurance as to such timing or that the
conditions to the Effective Date contained in the Plan will ever occur. The impact that a
prolonging of the Chapter 11 Cases may have on the Company’s operations cannot be
accurately predicted or quantified. The continuation of the Chapter 11 Cases, particularly if
the Plan is not approved, confirmed, or implemented within the time frame currently
contemplated, could adversely affect operations and relationships between Hercules and
its customers and charterers, suppliers, vendors, service providers, and other creditors
and result in increased professional fees and similar expenses. Failure to confirm the Plan
could further weaken the Company’s liquidity position, which could jeopardize the
Company’s exit from chapter 11.
Holders of HERO Equity Interests May Not Receive Any Distribution if the Plan is Not
Confirmed.
Based on the Valuation Analysis, there is no value in the Debtors for holders of HERO
Equity Interests who are “out of the money.” Accordingly, they are not entitled to a
distribution on account of their HERO Equity Interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Plan provides that, in exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their HERO Equity
Interests and for the releases by such holders of the Released Parties, holders of HERO
Equity Interests will receive their Pro Rata share of (1) the Shareholder Equity Distribution
and (2) the New HERO Warrants, so long as they do not opt out of granting the voluntary
releases contained in Article VII.F of the Plan. If (i) the Plan is not confirmed, (ii) the
Effective Date does not occur, or (iii) the Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated,
including as a result of the appointment of an official committee of equity security holders
in the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors could at some point commence one or more
bankruptcy cases without the benefits of the Restructuring Support Agreement for HERO
Equity Interests. If that occurs, it is not likely that holders of HERO Equity Interests will
receive any distribution on account of their HERO Equity Interests.
Impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Debtors.
Despite the treatment for holders of general unsecured claims under the Plan, the Chapter
11 Cases may affect the Debtors’ relationships with, and its ability to negotiate favorable
terms with, creditors, customers, suppliers, vendors, employees, and other personnel and
counterparties. While the Debtors expect to continue normal operations, public perception
of its continued viability may affect, among other things, the desire of new and existing
customers to enter into, or continue, agreements or arrangements with the Debtors. The
failure to maintain any of these important relationships could adversely affect the Debtors’
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of the public disclosure
of the Chapter 11 Cases and concerns vendors may have about liquidity, the Debtors’
ability to maintain normal credit terms with vendors may be impaired. Also, the Debtors’
transactions that are outside of the ordinary course of business are generally subject to
the approval of the Court, which may limit the Debtors’ ability to respond on a timely basis
to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. As a result, the effect that the
Chapter 11 Cases will have on the Debtors’ business, financial conditions, and results of
operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified at this time.
64
The Plan is Based Upon Assumptions the Debtors Developed which May Prove Incorrect
and Could Render the Plan Unsuccessful.
The Plan affects both the Debtors’ capital structure and the ownership, structure, and
operation of its business and reflects assumptions and analyses based on the Debtors’
experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future
developments, as well as other factors that the Debtors consider appropriate under the
circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with the
Debtors’ expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but
not limited to the Debtors’ (i) ability to implement the substantial changes to the capital
structure; (ii) ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) ability to
maintain customers’ confidence in the Company’s viability as a continuing entity and to
attract and retain sufficient business from them; and (iv) ability to retain key employees, as
well as the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial
and shipping industries, both in the United States and in global markets. The failure of any
of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of the
Debtors’ business.
In addition, the Plan relies upon Financial Projections, including with respect to revenues,
EBITDA, debt service, and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and
it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these
financial forecasts will not be accurate. In the Company’s case, the forecasts are even
more speculative than normal, because they involve fundamental changes in the nature of
its capital structure. Accordingly, Hercules acknowledges that its actual financial
condition and results of operations may differ, perhaps materially, from what was
anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments
contemplated by any plan of reorganization implemented will occur or, even if they do
occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on the Debtors and their subsidiaries or
their businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to
materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any
plan of reorganization.
C. Certain Risks Related to the Debtors’ Business and Operations
The Company’s Business Depends on the Level of Activity in the Oil and Natural Gas
Industry, which is Significantly Affected by Volatile Oil and Natural Gas Prices.
The Company’s business depends on the level of activity of oil and natural gas
exploration, development and production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and internationally,
and in particular, the level of exploration, development and production expenditures of its
customers. Demand for drilling services is adversely affected by declines associated with
depressed oil and natural gas prices. Even the perceived risk of a decline in oil or natural
gas prices often causes oil and gas companies to reduce spending on exploration,
development and production. However, higher prices do not necessarily translate into
increased drilling activity since clients’ expectations about future commodity prices
typically drive demand for the Company’s services. Reductions in capital expenditures of
the Company’s customers reduce rig utilization and dayrates. Oil and natural gas prices
are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including the following:
•
the demand for oil and natural gas in the United States and elsewhere;
•
the supply of oil and natural gas in the United States and elsewhere;
•
the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,
and the relative cost of onshore production or importation of natural gas;
•
political, economic and weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;
•
advances in drilling, exploration, development and production technology;
•
the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called
“OPEC,” to set and maintain oil production levels and pricing;
65
•
the level of production in non-OPEC countries;
•
domestic and international tax policies and governmental regulations;
•
•
•
•
the development and exploitation of alternative fuels, and the competitive, social and
political position of natural gas as a source of energy compared with other energy
sources;
the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their
oil and natural gas reserves;
the worldwide military and political environment and uncertainty or instability
resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises
in the Middle East, North Africa, West Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and other
significant oil and natural gas producing regions; and
acts of terrorism or piracy that affect oil and natural gas producing regions, especially
in Nigeria and the Middle East, where armed conflict, civil unrest and acts of
terrorism are increasingly common occurrences.
Reduced demand for drilling and liftboat services could materially erode dayrates and
utilization rates for the Company’s units, which could adversely affect its financial
condition and results of operations. Continued hostilities in the Middle East, North Africa,
West Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe, and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks
against the United States or other countries could negatively impact the economies of the
United States and other countries where Hercules operates. A decline in the United States
or global economy could result in a decrease in energy consumption and commodity
prices, which in turn would cause the Company’s revenue and margins to decline and limit
future growth prospects.
The Offshore Service Industry is Highly Cyclical and Experiences Periods of Low Demand
and Low Dayrates. The Volatility of the Industry has in the Past Resulted and Could Again
Result in Sharp Declines in the Company’s Profitability.
Historically, the offshore service industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high
demand and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand and low dayrates.
Periods of low demand or increasing supply intensify the competition in the industry and
often result in rigs or liftboats being idle for long periods of time. As a result of the
cyclicality of the Debtors’ industry, they expect results of operations to be volatile and to
decrease during market declines such as they are currently experiencing.
Maintaining Idle Assets or the Sale of Assets Below Their Then Carrying Value May Cause
the Company to Experience Losses and May Result in Impairment Charges.
Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets or the
sale of assets below their then carrying value may cause the Debtors to experience
losses. These events may also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain
assets if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at
the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable or if the Debtors sell
assets at below their then carrying value.
HERO is a Holding Company, and it is Dependent Upon Cash Flow From Subsidiaries to
Meet Financial Obligations.
The Debtors currently conduct operations through, and most assets are owned by, both
U.S. and foreign subsidiaries, and operating income and cash flow are generated by
subsidiaries. As a result, cash obtained from subsidiaries is the principal source of funds
necessary to meet debt service obligations. Contractual provisions or laws, as well as
subsidiaries’ financial condition and operating requirements, may limit the ability to obtain
cash from subsidiaries required to pay debt service obligations. Applicable tax laws may
also subject such payments by subsidiaries to further taxation.
66
The inability to transfer cash from subsidiaries may mean that, even though the Debtors
may have sufficient resources on a consolidated basis to meet obligations, they may not
be permitted to make the necessary transfers from subsidiaries to the parent company in
order to provide funds for the payment of the parent company’s obligations.
Many Customer Contracts are Short Term, and Customers May Seek to Terminate,
Renegotiate or Decline to Renew Contracts During Depressed Market Conditions, Which
Will Result in Reduced Revenue and Profitability.
Currently, all drilling contracts with major customers are dayrate contracts, where the
Debtors charge a fixed charge per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill
the well. Likewise, under existing liftboat contracts, the Debtors charge a fixed fee per day
regardless of the success of the operations that are being conducted by the customer
utilizing the liftboat. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, contracts are generally short term, and oil
and natural gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in response to depressed
oil and natural gas prices, such as the Debtors are currently experiencing. Due to the
short-term nature of most contracts, a decline in market conditions such as the Debtors
are currently experiencing can quickly affect business if customers reduce their levels of
operations. Also, during these periods of depressed market conditions, a customer may
no longer need a rig or liftboat that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a
comparable rig or liftboat at a lower daily rate. As a result, customers may seek to
renegotiate the terms of their existing contracts or avoid their obligations, including their
payment obligations, under those contracts. In addition, customers may have the right to
terminate, or may seek to renegotiate, existing contracts if Hercules experiences
downtime, operational problems above the contractual limit or safety-related issues, if the
rig or liftboat is a total loss, if the rig or liftboat is not delivered to the customer within the
period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances, which include events
beyond the control of either party.
The likelihood that a customer may seek to renegotiate or terminate a contract is
increased during periods of market weakness. If customers cancel or require Hercules to
renegotiate some of its significant contracts, if the Debtors are unable to secure new
contracts on substantially similar terms, especially those contracts in their International
Offshore segment, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time, revenue
and profitability would be materially reduced.
Hercules can Provide No Assurance That its Current Backlog of Contract Revenue and
Receivables Will be Ultimately Realized.
As of June 23, 2015, the Company’s total contract drilling backlog for Domestic Offshore,
International Offshore and International Liftboats segments was approximately
$913,649,700 for executed contracts, including the Maersk contract for the newbuild
jackup rig, Hercules Highlander. The Debtors calculate their contract revenue backlog, or
future contracted revenue, as the contract dayrate multiplied by the number of days
remaining on the contract assuming full utilization, less any penalties or reductions in
dayrate for late delivery or non-compliance with contractual obligations. Backlog excludes
revenue for management agreements, mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation
and customer reimbursables. The amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods
during which revenue is earned will be different than the backlog disclosed or expected
due to various factors. Hercules may not be able to perform under its drilling contracts
due to various operational factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance,
operational delays, health, safety and environmental incidents, weather events in the Gulf
of Mexico and elsewhere and other factors (some of which are beyond the Company’s
control), and customers may seek to cancel or renegotiate contracts for various reasons.
In some of the contracts, including the contracts for the Hercules 261 and Hercules 262,
the customer has the right to terminate the contract without penalty and in certain
instances, with little or no notice. In addition, Hercules can provide no assurance that
customers will pay any or all of the revenues that Hercules has earned from them for
providing drilling and liftboat services. The Company’s inability or the inability of its
customers to perform under the Company’s or their contractual obligations may have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
67
A Significant Portion of The Company’s Business is Conducted in Shallow-Water Areas of
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Mature Nature of This Region Could Result in Less Drilling
Activity in the Area, Thereby Reducing Demand for the Company’s Services and
Requiring Hercules to Cold Stack Additional Rigs.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and in particular the shallow-water region of the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico, is a mature oil and natural gas production region that has experienced substantial
seismic survey and exploration activity for many years. Because a large number of oil and
natural gas prospects in this region have already been drilled, additional prospects of
sufficient size and quality could be more difficult to identify. In addition, the amount of
natural gas production in the shallow-water U.S. Gulf of Mexico has declined over the last
decade. Moreover, oil and natural gas companies may be unable to obtain financing
necessary to drill prospects in this region. The decrease in the size of oil and natural gas
prospects, the decrease in production or the failure to obtain such financing may result in
reduced drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and reduced demand for the Company’s
services.
Of the Company’s 18 domestic rigs, all but nine are cold stacked. Of these nine, only six
are under short term contract contracts as of June 23, 2015. Hercules is actively marketing
an additional three rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If demand in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
does not improve or further weakens, Hercules may be required to cold stack additional
rigs. This would further negatively influence the Company’s financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.
The Debtors’ Industry is Highly Competitive, With Intense Price Competition. The Debtors’
Inability to Compete Successfully may Reduce Profitability.
The Debtors’ industry is highly competitive. Their contracts are traditionally awarded on a
competitive bid basis. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified
contractor is awarded a job, although rig and liftboat availability, location and technical
capability and each contractor’s safety performance record and reputation for quality also
can be key factors in the determination. Dayrates also depend on the supply of rigs and
vessels with excess capacity putting downward pressure on dayrates. Excess capacity
can occur when newly constructed rigs and vessels enter service, when rigs and vessels
are mobilized between geographic areas and when non-marketed rigs and vessels are
reactivated.
Several competitors also are incorporated in jurisdictions outside the United States, which
provides them with significant tax advantages that are not available to HERO as a U.S.
company and, as a result, may materially impair HERO’s ability to compete with them for
many projects that would be beneficial to us.
An Increase in Supply of Rigs or Liftboats Could Adversely Affect the Debtors’ Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
New construction of rigs and liftboats, mobilization of rigs to regions in which Hercules
operates, or reactivation of non-marketed rigs and liftboats, could result in excess supply
in the regions in which Hercules operates, and dayrates and utilization could be reduced.
Construction of rigs, including high specification rigs such as the Hercules Highlander,
the Hercules Triumph and the Hercules Resilience, could result in excess supply in
international regions, which could reduce the Company’s ability to secure new contracts
for its rigs and could reduce the Company’s ability to renew, extend or obtain new
contracts for working rigs at the end of such contract term. The excess supply could also
impact the dayrates on future contracts.
If market conditions improve, inactive rigs and liftboats that are not currently being
marketed could be reactivated to meet an increase in demand. Improved market
conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, particularly relative to other regions, could also lead
to the movement of jackup rigs and other mobile offshore drilling units into the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico. Improved market conditions in any region worldwide could lead to increased
construction of rigs and liftboats and upgrade programs by the Company’s competitors.
Some of the Company’s competitors have already announced plans to build additional
jackup rigs with higher specifications than most of the Company’s fleet. Many of the rigs
currently under construction have not been contracted for future work, which may
intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. A significant increase in the
supply of jackup rigs, other mobile offshore drilling units or liftboats could adversely affect
both the Company’s utilization and dayrates.
68
Asset Sales Have Been an Important Component of the Company’s Business Strategy.
Hercules may be Unable to Identify Appropriate Buyers With Access to Financing or to
Complete any Sales on Acceptable Terms.
Hercules is currently considering sales or other dispositions of certain of the Company’s
assets, and any such disposition could be significant and could significantly affect the
results of operations of one or more of the Company’s business segments. Asset sales
may occur on less favorable terms than terms that might be available at other times in the
business cycle. At any given time, discussions with one or more potential buyers may be
at different stages. Any such discussions and agreements to sell assets may or may not
result in the consummation of an asset sale. Hercules may not be able to identify buyers
with access to financing or complete sales on acceptable terms.
The First Lien Exit Facility Will Impose Significant Additional Costs and Operating and
Financial Restrictions on the Company, Which May Prevent Hercules From Capitalizing on
Business Opportunities and Taking Certain Actions.
The First Lien Exit Facility will impose significant additional costs and operating and
financial restrictions. These restrictions may limit the Company’s ability to, among other
things:
•
incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;
•
pay dividends or make other distributions;
•
make other restricted payments or investments;
•
sell assets or use the proceeds from asset sales;
•
create liens;
•
enter into agreements that restrict dividends and other payments by subsidiaries;
•
engage in transactions with affiliates; and
•
consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of HERO’s assets.
The Company’s compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect its
ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities
it believes to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures,
finance the Company’s acquisitions, equipment purchases and development
expenditures, or withstand the present or any future downturn in its business.
The First Lien Exit Facility Will Contain Financial Covenants That Limit the Company’s
Financial Flexibility.
The First Lien Exit Facility will contain financial covenants that, among other things,
require Hercules to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity and a maximum first lien
leverage ratio. Compliance with these financial covenants may restrict future business and
financing activity, including the ability to incur future indebtedness. In addition, the
Company’s ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events
outside of its control, and Hercules cannot provide assurance that it will be able to meet
these financial covenants.
The Company’s failure to comply with these financial covenants could lead to a default
under the First Lien Exit Facility. The actual financial covenants will be contained in the
credit agreement governing the First Lien Exit Facility, which has not been negotiated with
the Steering Group, although the Term Sheet includes a summary of the anticipated
financial covenants.
69
The Company’s International Operations are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, and
Other Uncertainties not Generally Associated With Domestic Operations.
An element of the Company’s business strategy is to continue to expand into international
oil and natural gas producing areas such as West Africa, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific
region and the North Sea. Hercules operates liftboats in West Africa, including Nigeria,
and in the Middle East. Hercules also operates and markets drilling rigs in Saudi Arabia,
West Africa, India and Southeast Asia. The Company’s international operations are
subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries,
including:
•
political, social and economic instability, war and acts of terrorism;
•
potential seizure, expropriation or nationalization of assets;
•
damage to the Company’s equipment or violence directed at the Company’s
employees, including kidnappings and piracy;
•
increased operating costs;
•
•
•
complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote
locations;
delays and potential prolonged disruption of operations associated with obtaining
visas for the Company’s employees and other local procedural requirements and
administrative matters;
repudiation, modification or renegotiation of contracts, disputes and legal
proceedings in international jurisdictions;
•
limitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage in certain areas;
•
import-export quotas;
•
confiscatory taxation;
•
work stoppages or strikes, particularly in Nigeria;
•
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•
wage and price controls;
•
imposition of trade barriers;
•
imposition or changes in enforcement of local content and cabotage laws,
particularly in West Africa and Southeast Asia, where the legislatures are active in
developing new legislation;
•
restrictions on currency or capital repatriations;
•
currency fluctuations and devaluations; and
•
other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond the
Company’s control.
Many governments favor or effectively require that liftboat or drilling contracts be awarded
to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase
supplies from, a particular
70
jurisdiction. In certain countries, government rules and regulations also require that local
citizens or entities be engaged as local representatives to support the operations of
foreign contractors or to own a portion of the equity or assets of companies operating
within their jurisdiction. These practices and legal requirements regarding the use of and
potential company equity and asset ownership by local representatives might limit the
Company’s business and operations, and occasions may arise when Hercules has
disagreements with its local representative, or the continuation of such relationship may
become infeasible. Any such developments might disrupt the Company’s operations and
continuity of business in such jurisdictions. If Hercules is unable to resolve issues with a
local representative, it may decide to terminate the relationship with such local
representative and seek another local representative or seek opportunities for the
Company’s rigs and vessels elsewhere. Where local representative relationships require
approval from the local government or other third parties Hercules may be constrained in
its ability to replace an existing local representative which may disrupt its operations and
continuity of business in such jurisdictions and require Hercules to seek opportunities for
its rigs and vessels elsewhere. In addition, if Hercules experiences delays or is unable to
perform its obligations under its contracts, customers may seek to cancel the contracts,
which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.
The Company’s non-U.S. contract drilling and liftboat operations are subject to various
laws and regulations in countries in which it operates, including laws and regulations
relating to the equipment and operation of drilling rigs and liftboats, currency conversions
and repatriation, oil and natural gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore
earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, employees and suppliers by foreign
contractors, the ownership of assets by local citizens and companies, and duties on the
importation and exportation of units and other equipment. Governments in some foreign
countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of
concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas
and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of
the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and
development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do
so. Operations in developing countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as
predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater risk and
uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. The Company’s ability to compete in
international markets may be adversely affected by these foreign governmental
regulations and/or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which
nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by
regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ, transfer ownership of equipment to,
or purchase supplies from citizens of a particular jurisdiction.
Due to the Company’s international operations, it may experience currency exchange
losses when revenue is received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or
when it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. It may also incur losses as a
result of its inability to collect revenue because of a shortage of convertible currency
available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over
the repatriation of income or capital.
More of the Company’s Existing Jackup Rigs are at a Relative Disadvantage to Higher
Specification Rigs, Which May be More Likely to Obtain Contracts Than Lower
Specification Jackup Rigs Such as the Company’s.
Many of the Company’s competitors have jackup fleets with generally higher specification
rigs than those in the Company’s jackup fleet other than the Company’s three ultra-high
specification rigs, including one under construction, the Hercules Highlander. In the
Company’s existing fleet, 17 of its 27 jackup rigs are mat-supported, which are generally
limited to geographic areas with soft bottom conditions like much of the Gulf of Mexico. In
addition, the majority of new rigs under construction are of higher specification than the
Company’s existing fleet, other than the Company’s three ultra-high specification rigs,
including one under construction. Most of these rigs under construction are currently
without contracts, which may intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates
occur. Particularly in periods in which there is decreased rig demand, higher specification
rigs may be more likely to obtain contracts than lower specification jackup rigs such as
the Company’s. In the past, lower specification rigs typically have been stacked earlier in
the cycle of decreased rig demand than higher specification rigs and have been
reactivated later in the cycle, which may adversely impact the Company’s business. In
addition, higher specification rigs may be more adaptable to different operating conditions
and therefore have greater flexibility to move to areas of demand in response to changes
in market conditions. Because a majority of the Company’s rigs were designed specifically
for drilling in the shallow-water of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the Company’s ability to move
them to other regions in response to changes in market conditions is limited.
71
Furthermore, there is an increasing amount of exploration and production expenditures
being concentrated in deepwater drilling programs and deeper formations, including deep
natural gas prospects, requiring higher specification jackup rigs, semisubmersible drilling
rigs or drillships. This trend is expected to continue and could result in a decline in
demand for lower specification jackup rigs like the Company’s, which could have an
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
A Small Number of Customers Account for a Significant Portion of the Company’s
Revenue, and the Loss of One or More of These Customers Could Adversely Affect the
Company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In recent years there has been a significant consolidation in the Company’s customer
base. Therefore, Hercules derives a significant amount of its revenue from a few energy
companies. Chevron Corporation, EPL Oil & Gas, Saudi Aramco and Cairn Energy
accounted for 15%, 14%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2014. The Company’s financial condition and results of
operations will be materially adversely affected if these customers interrupt or curtail their
activities, terminate or re-negotiate their contracts, fail to renew their existing contracts,
refuse to award new contracts and Hercules is unable to enter into contracts with new
customers at comparable dayrates, or fail to pay for the revenues that it has earned
providing drilling and liftboat services. The loss of any of these or any other significant
customer could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of
operations.
The Company’s Business Involves Numerous Operating Hazards and Exposure to
Extreme Weather and Climate Risks, and the Company’s Insurance may not be Adequate
to Cover its Losses.
The Company’s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and
operation of oil and natural gas wells, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of
production, loss of well control, punch throughs, craterings, fires and pollution, such as
the well control incident experienced in July 2013 by the Company’s jackup drilling rig
Hercules 265 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The occurrence of these events could result in the
suspension of drilling or production operations, claims by the operator, severe damage to
or destruction of the property and equipment involved, injury or death to rig or liftboat
personnel, and environmental damage. Hercules may also be subject to personal injury
and other claims of rig or liftboat personnel as a result of its drilling and liftboat operations.
Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal
operating conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services
and personnel shortages.
In addition, the Company’s drilling and liftboat operations are subject to perils of marine
operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe
weather. Tropical storms, hurricanes and other severe weather prevalent in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations. In addition,
damage to rigs, liftboats, shorebases and corporate infrastructure caused by high winds,
turbulent seas, or unstable sea bottom conditions could potentially cause Hercules to
curtail operations for significant periods of time until the damages can be repaired. In
addition, Hercules cold stacks a number of rigs in certain locations offshore. This
concentration of rigs in specific locations could expose Hercules to increased liability
from a catastrophic event and could cause an increase in the Company’s insurance costs.
Damage to the environment could result from the Company’s operations, particularly
through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. Hercules may also be subject to
property, environmental and other damage claims by oil and natural gas companies and
other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas. The Company’s insurance
policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses, and
Hercules may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Moreover,
pollution and environmental risks generally are subject to significant deductibles and are
not totally insurable. Risks from extreme weather and marine hazards may increase in the
event of ongoing patterns of adverse changes in weather or climate.
The Company’s Insurance Coverage has Become More Expensive, May Become
Unavailable in the Future and May be Inadequate to Cover its Losses.
The Company’s insurance coverage is subject to certain significant deductibles and levels
of self-insurance, does not cover all types of losses and, in some situations, may not
provide full coverage for losses or liabilities resulting from the Company’s operations. In
addition, due to the losses sustained by Hercules and the offshore drilling industry in
recent years, Hercules is likely to continue experiencing increased costs for available
72
insurance coverage, which may impose higher deductibles and limit maximum aggregated
recoveries, including for hurricane-related windstorm damage or loss and for pollution
and blowout events. Insurance costs may increase in the event of ongoing patterns of
adverse changes in weather or climate.
Further, Hercules may elect not to obtain or it may be unable to obtain windstorm
coverage in the future, thus putting Hercules at a greater risk of loss due to severe
weather conditions and other hazards. If a significant accident or other event resulting in
damage to the Company’s rigs or liftboats, including severe weather, equipment
breakdowns, terrorist acts, piracy, war, civil disturbances, blowouts, pollution or
environmental damage, occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable
indemnity from a customer, it could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations. Moreover, Hercules may not be able to maintain adequate
insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable or be able to obtain insurance
against certain risks.
As a result of a number of catastrophic weather related and other events, insurance
underwriters increased insurance premiums for many of the coverages historically
maintained and issued general notices of cancellation and significant changes for a wide
variety of insurance coverages. The oil and natural gas industry has suffered extensive
damage from several hurricanes over the last decade. As a result, the Company’s
insurance costs have increased significantly, its deductibles have increased and its
coverage for named windstorm damage was restricted. Any additional severe storm
activity in the energy producing areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the future could cause
insurance underwriters to no longer insure U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets against weather-
related damage. Further, due to the escalating costs for weather-related damage in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico, in the future Hercules may elect to forgo purchasing such coverage. A
number of the Company’s customers that produce oil and natural gas have previously
maintained business interruption insurance for their production. This insurance is less
available and may cease to be available in the future, which could adversely impact the
Company’s customers’ business prospects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and reduce demand
for the Company’s services.
The Company’s Customers may be Unable or Unwilling to Indemnify It.
Consistent with standard industry practice, the Company’s clients generally assume, and
indemnify it against, well control and subsurface risks under dayrate contracts, regardless
of how the loss or damages may be caused. Typically, the Company’s customer agrees to
indemnify Hercules for these risks, even if Hercules is grossly negligent. However, since
the Macondo well blowout and resulting litigation, some of the Company’s customers have
been reluctant to extend their indemnity obligations in instances where Hercules is
grossly negligent. These risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well, such
as blowout or cratering, the cost to regain control or redrill the well and associated
pollution. There can be no assurance, however, that these clients will necessarily be
financially able to indemnify Hercules against all these risks. Also, Hercules may be
effectively prevented from enforcing these indemnities because of the nature of the
Company’s relationship with some of its larger clients. Additionally, from time to time
Hercules may not be able to obtain agreement from its customers to indemnify Hercules
for such damages and risks.
HERO Expects That its Common Stock Will Become Delisted from Trading on NASDAQ
Following the Petition Date.
In March 2015, HERO received a letter from the NASDAQ notifying HERO that, for 30
consecutive business days, the bid price for the HERO’s common stock was below the
minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In addition, Hercules expects that its
common stock will become delisted from trading on NASDAQ following the Petition Date
and will then be traded on the OTC Pink market. The delisting could adversely impact
HERO by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of its common
stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire HERO’s common stock;
limiting HERO’s ability to issue additional securities in the future; and limiting HERO’s
ability to fund its operations.
Any Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) or Similar Laws and
Regulations Could Result in Significant Expenses, Divert Management Attention, and
Otherwise Have a Negative Impact.
HERO is subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their
intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of
obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. Any
determination that HERO has violated the FCPA or laws of any other jurisdiction could
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.
73
The Company’s International Operations May Subject it to Political and Regulatory Risks
and Uncertainties.
In connection with the Company’s international contracts, the transportation of rigs,
services and technology across international borders subjects HERO to extensive trade
laws and regulations. The Company’s import and export activities are governed by unique
customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where it operates. In each
jurisdiction, laws and regulations concerning importation, recordkeeping and reporting,
import and export control and financial or economic sanctions are complex and
constantly changing. The Company’s business and financial condition may be materially
affected by enactment, amendment, enforcement or changing interpretations of these laws
and regulations. Rigs and other shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for
a variety of reasons, some of which are outside the Company’s control and some of which
may result in failure to comply with existing laws and regulations and contractual
requirements. Shipping delays or denials could cause operational downtime or increased
costs, duties, taxes and fees. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory
obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines,
imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, seizure of goods and loss of import
and export privileges.
Public Health Threats Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Operations
and its Financial Results.
Public health threats, such as the Ebola virus, and other highly communicable diseases,
outbreaks of which have occurred in various parts of the world near where Hercules
operates, could adversely impact the Company’s operations, the operations of the
Company’s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil
and natural gas and the level of demand for the Company’s services. Any quarantine of
personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which HERO operates, or inability
to access the Company’s offices, rigs or liftboats could adversely affect its operations.
Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the
world in which Hercules operates, or any reduction in the demand for drilling or liftboat
services caused by public health threats in the future, may materially impact operations
and adversely affect the Company’s financial results.
Hercules Cannot Guarantee the Timely Completion and Delivery of its Newbuild Rig that is
Being Constructed And that is Currently Scheduled for Delivery in April 2016.
Hercules may be materially adversely affected if its newbuild rig, the Hercules Highlander,
to support the Maersk Agreement is not constructed or delivered on time in accordance
with the agreed specifications. Delayed delivery beyond December 31, 2016 will, unless
the delay is for certain reasons permitted under the Maersk Drilling Contract (including
certain instances of force majeure), give Maersk the right to terminate the Maersk Drilling
Contract.
The Company’s rights under the construction contract may not protect it against the
losses which may result if JSL is not able to deliver Hercules Highlander in accordance
with the requirements of the construction contract and the Maersk Drilling Contract.
Hercules cannot give any assurance in respect of the yard’s ability to complete the
construction of Hercules Highlander as contractually agreed. In the event of such a failure
or delay, Hercules may not be able to generate any income from the Maersk Drilling
Contract, which might lead to deferred or lost revenue, which is likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
Hercules could lose the Maersk Drilling Contract and/or receive potential liability claims
from the customer as a result of such delays.
Hercules may need to make changes to Hercules Highlander after delivery which could
result in additional construction costs and additional capital needs in the future.
74
Hercules Cannot Guarantee that Hercules Highlander Will be Completed or Pass the
Acceptance Tests.
Acceptance tests will be performed in connection with the delivery of Hercules Highlander.
The construction of Hercules Highlander was agreed to be based on an enhanced JSL JU-
2000E design, and in accordance with detailed specifications and the rules and
regulations of the classification society, the American Bureau of Shipping, as well as the
relevant laws, regulations and rules of the intended flag state, Liberia, and of the countries
in which Hercules Highlander is expected to operate. Such compliance will be pre-tested
prior to departure from the shipyard in Singapore in order to reduce the risk for not
meeting the performance specifications set out in the construction contract. Hercules
Highlander will not be delivered from the yard until it is in compliance with the performance
specifications, which could cause delivery to be delayed.
Failure to Retain or Attract Skilled Workers Could Hurt the Company’s Operations.
Hercules requires skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support
for its rigs and liftboats. Shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and
retain qualified personnel could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of the
Company’s work. In periods of economic crisis or during a recession, Hercules may have
difficulty attracting and retaining skilled workers as these workers may seek employment
in less cyclical or volatile industries or employers. In periods of recovery or increasing
activity, Hercules may have to increase the wages of skilled workers, which could
negatively impact the Company’s operations and financial results.
Although the Company’s domestic employees are not covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, the marine services industry has been targeted by maritime labor unions in an
effort to organize U.S. Gulf of Mexico employees. A significant increase in the wages paid
by competing employers or the unionization of the Company’s U.S. Gulf of Mexico
employees could result in a reduction of the Company’s skilled labor force, increases in
the wage rates that Hercules must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, the
Company’s capacity and profitability could be diminished and the Company’s growth
potential could be impaired.
Governmental Laws and Regulations, Including Those Arising Out of the Macondo Well
Incident and Those Related to Climate Change and Emissions of Greenhouse Gases, May
Add to the Company’s Costs or Limit Drilling Activity.
The Company’s operations are affected in varying degrees by governmental laws and
regulations. It is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the Customs and Border Protection, the Department of
Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and BSEE, as well as private industry
organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. New laws, regulations and
requirements imposed after the Macondo well incident may delay the Company’s
operations and cause Hercules to incur additional expenses in order for its rigs and
operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to be compliant with these new laws, regulations and
requirements. These new laws, regulations and requirements and other potential changes
in laws and regulations applicable to the offshore drilling industry in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico may also prevent the Company’s customers from obtaining new drilling permits
and approvals in a timely manner, if at all, which could materially adversely impact the
Company’s business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, Hercules may
be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and the
applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations.
Moreover, the cost of compliance could be higher than anticipated. For example, the BSEE
has extended its regulatory enforcement reach to include contractors, which exposes
contractors to potential fines, sanctions and penalties for violations of law arising in the
BSEE’s jurisdictional area. Similarly, the Company’s international operations are subject
to compliance with the FCPA, certain international conventions and the laws, regulations
and standards of other foreign countries in which it operates. It is also possible that
existing and proposed governmental conventions, laws, regulations and standards,
including those related to climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases, may in the
future add significantly to the Company’s operating costs or limit the Company’s activities
or the activities and levels of capital spending by its customers.
In addition to the laws, regulations and requirements implemented since the Macondo well
incident, the federal government has considered additional new laws, regulations and
requirements, including those that would have imposed additional equipment
requirements and that relate to the protection of the environment,
75
which would be applicable to the offshore drilling industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The
federal government may again consider implementing new laws, regulations and
requirements. The implementation of new, more restrictive laws and regulations could lead
to substantially increased potential liability and operating costs for Hercules and its
customers, which could cause customers to discontinue or delay operating in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico and/or redeploy capital to international locations. These actions, if taken by
any customers, could result in underutilization of the Company’s U.S. Gulf of Mexico
assets and have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue, profitability and financial
position.
In addition, as the Company’s vessels age, the costs of drydocking the vessels in order to
comply with governmental laws and regulations and to maintain their class certifications
are expected to increase, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations.
Compliance With or a Breach of Environmental Laws and Regulations can be Costly and
Could Limit the Company’s Operations.
The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign and/or
international laws and regulations that require Hercules to obtain and maintain specified
permits or other governmental approvals, control the discharge of materials into the
environment, require the removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment
or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. Governmental entities such as the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state agencies have the power to
enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them,
often requiring difficult and costly actions. For example, as an operator of mobile offshore
drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas, Hercules may be liable for
damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or other unauthorized discharges
of chemicals or wastes resulting from those operations. Additionally, the BSEE has
extended its regulatory enforcement reach to include contractors which exposes
contractors to potential fines, sanctions and penalties for violations of law arising in the
BSEE’s jurisdictional area. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in
the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial
obligations, and the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all of the Company’s
activities in the affected areas. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have
become more stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose strict liability,
rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault
on the part of such person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose Hercules to
liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in
compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of
these requirements, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new
requirements, both in U.S. waters and internationally, could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Hercules May Not Be Able to Maintain or Replace its Rigs and Liftboats as They Age.
The capital associated with the repair and maintenance of the Company’s fleet increases
with age. Hercules may not be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of
existing rigs and liftboats, and the Company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to
make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement units.
The Company’s Operating and Maintenance Costs With Respect to its Rigs Include Fixed
Costs That Will Not Decline in Proportion to Decreases in Dayrates.
Hercules does not expect its operating and maintenance costs with respect to its rigs to
necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenue. Operating revenue
may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrate, but costs for operating a rig are
generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned. Additionally,
if the Company’s rigs incur idle time between contracts, Hercules typically does not de-
man those rigs because it will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract. During
times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the
crew may be required to prepare the Company’s rigs for stacking, after which time the
crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, as the Company’s rigs
are mobilized from one geographic location to another, including mobilizations to harsh
environments where high specification rigs such as the Hercules Triumph, Hercules
Resilience and Hercules Highlander generally operate, the labor and other operating and
maintenance costs can increase significantly. In general, labor costs increase
76
primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses
fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and
condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and
length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over
which such expenditures are amortized.
Upgrade, Refurbishment and Repair Projects are Subject to Risks, Including Delays and
Cost Overruns, Which Could Have an Adverse Impact on the Company’s Available Cash
Resources and Results of Operations.
Hercules makes upgrade, refurbishment and repair expenditures for its fleet from time to
time, including when it acquires units or when repairs or upgrades are required by law, in
response to an inspection by a governmental authority or when a unit is damaged.
Hercules also regularly makes certain upgrades or modifications to its drilling rigs to meet
customer or contract specific requirements. Upgrade, refurbishment and repair projects
are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction
project, including costs or delays resulting from the following:
•  unexpectedly long delivery times for, or shortages of, key equipment, parts and materials;
•  shortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work;
•  unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials used for the
Company’s rigs, particularly steel;
•  unforeseen design and engineering problems;
•  latent damages to or deterioration of hull, equipment and machinery in excess of
engineering estimates and assumptions;
•  unanticipated actual or purported change orders;
•  work stoppages;
•  failure or delay of third-party service providers and labor disputes;
•  disputes with shipyards and suppliers;
•  delays and unexpected costs of incorporating parts and materials needed for the
completion of projects;
•  failure or delay in obtaining acceptance of the rig from the customer;
•  financial or other difficulties at shipyards, including shipyard incidents that could increase
the cost and delay the timing of projects;
•  adverse weather conditions; and
•  inability or delay in obtaining customer acceptance or flag-state, classification society,
certificate of inspection, or regulatory approvals.
Significant cost overruns or delays would adversely affect the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally, capital expenditures for rig upgrade,
reactivation and refurbishment projects could exceed the Company’s planned capital
expenditures. Failure to complete an upgrade, reactivation, refurbishment or repair project
on time may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a
drilling or liftboat contract and could put at risk the Company’s planned arrangements to
commence operations on schedule. Hercules also could be exposed to penalties for
failure to complete an upgrade, refurbishment or repair project and commence operations
in a timely manner. The Company’s rigs and liftboats undergoing upgrade, reactivation,
refurbishment or repair generally do not earn a dayrate during the period they are out of
service.
77
Hercules is Subject to Litigation That Could Have an Adverse Effect on its Business.
Hercules is from time to time involved in various litigation matters. The numerous
operating hazards inherent in the Company’s business increase its exposure to litigation,
including personal injury litigation brought against it by employees that are injured
operating the Company’s rigs and liftboats. These matters may include, among other
things, contract dispute, personal injury, environmental, asbestos and other toxic tort,
employment, tax and securities litigation, and litigation that arises in the ordinary course of
the Company’s business. Hercules has extensive litigation brought against it in federal
and state courts located in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Texas, areas that were
significantly impacted by hurricanes during the last decade and by the Macondo well
blowout incident. The jury pools in these areas have become increasingly more hostile to
defendants, particularly corporate defendants in the oil and gas industry. Hercules cannot
predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter. Litigation
may have an adverse effect because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated
with defending the lawsuits, the diversion of the Company’s management’s resources and
other factors.
The Company’s Operations Present Hazards and Risks That Require Significant and
Continuous Oversight, and it Depends Upon the Security and Reliability of its
Technologies, Systems and Networks in Numerous Locations Where it Conducts
Business.
Hercules continues to increase its dependence on digital technologies to conduct its
operations, to collect monies from customers and to pay vendors and employees. In
addition, Hercules has outsourced certain information technology development,
maintenance and support functions. As a result, Hercules is exposed to cybersecurity
risks at both its internal locations and outside vendor locations that could disrupt
operations for an extended period of time and result in the loss of critical data and in
higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents, although no such
material incidents have occurred to date. If the Company’s systems for protecting against
information technology and cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, Hercules could be
adversely affected by having its business and financial systems compromised, its
proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or its business operations and safety
procedures disrupted.
Changes in Effective Tax Rates, Taxation of the Company’s Foreign Subsidiaries,
Limitations on Utilization of the Company’s Net Operating Losses or Adverse Outcomes
Resulting From Examination of the Company’s Tax Returns Could Adversely Affect its
Operating Results and Financial Results.
The Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax
laws, both domestically and internationally. From time to time, Congress and foreign, state
and local governments consider legislation that could increase the Company’s effective
tax rates. Hercules cannot determine whether, or in what form, legislation will ultimately be
enacted or what the impact of any such legislation would be on its profitability. If these or
other changes to tax laws are enacted, the Company’s profitability could be negatively
impacted.
The Company’s future effective tax rates could also be adversely affected by changes in
the valuation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ultimate repatriation of earnings
from foreign subsidiaries to the United States, or by changes in tax treaties, regulations,
accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which
Hercules operates. In addition, Hercules is subject to the examination of its tax returns by
the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities where it files tax returns. Hercules
regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations
to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that any
existing or future examinations by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities
will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results and financial
condition.
Discharge of Prepetition Claims and Related Legal Proceedings.
The Debtors may be subject to Claims in various legal proceedings and may become
subject to other legal proceedings in the future. Although any such Claims will be
generally stayed while the Chapter 11
78
Cases are pending, the Debtors may not be successful in ultimately discharging or
satisfying such Claims. The ultimate outcome of each of these matters, including the
Debtors’ ability to have these matters satisfied and discharged in the bankruptcy
proceeding, cannot presently be determined, nor can the liability that may potentially
result from a negative outcome be reasonably estimated presently for every case. The
liability the Debtors may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters in the
event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued with respect
to such matters and, as a result, these matters may potentially be material to the Debtors’
business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
D. Certain Risks Relating to HERO Equity Interests related to the Plan and Bankruptcy
Filing.
Lack of Established Market for HERO Equity Interests as a Consequence of Plan and
Bankruptcy Filing.
As set forth above, Holders of HERO Equity Interests will be given the opportunity to opt
out of granting the releases set forth in section VII.F of the Plan. After an election to opt out
is made by a holder of HERO Equity Interests, such election will be binding on any buyer
of such HERO Equity Interests in any subsequent sale or re-sale of the shares prior to the
date such shares are cancelled. Specifically, once a Holder that holds its HERO Equity
Interests through DTC Opts Out electronically through DTC, (a) the Holder will no longer
have a right to sell or transfer any HERO Equity Interests except manually in cooperation
with DTC and the Voting Agent and (b) their HERO Equity Interests, as stated above, will
be cancelled and discharged under the plan as of the effective date and such opt out
holder will not receive any consideration or distributions of any kind whatsoever under the
Plan.
Under such circumstances, a trading market for HERO Equity Interests held by Holders
electing to opt out of the releases may not exist and electing to opt out will likely make it
more difficult for such opt-out shareholders to dispose of their HERO Equity Interests or to
realize value on the shares at a time when they may wish to do so.
E. Certain Risks Relating to the Shares of New HERO Common Stock and the New
HERO Warrants Under the Plan.
Significant Holders.
As set forth above, after the Effective Date, the holders of Senior Notes will receive 96.9%
of Reorganized HERO’s new common stock (subject to dilution). If such holders of New
HERO Common Stock were to act as a group, such holders would be in a position to
control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors, without the approval of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership
could also facilitate or hinder a negotiated change of control of the Reorganized Debtors
and, consequently, have an impact upon the value of the New HERO Warrants and New
HERO Common Stock.
Restrictions on Transfer of New HERO Common Stock.
The recipients of securities issued under the Plan who are deemed to be “underwriters” as
defined in section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code will be restricted in their ability to
transfer or sell their securities. In addition, securities issued under the Plan to affiliates of
the Reorganized Debtors will be subject to restrictions on resale. These persons will be
permitted to transfer or sell such securities only pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144
under the Securities Act, if available, or another available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. These restrictions may adversely impact the value of
the shares of New HERO Common Stock and make it more difficult for such shareholders
to dispose of their shares, or to realize value on the shares, at a time when they may wish
to do so. See Article XII, “Securities Law Matters,” for additional information regarding
restrictions on resales of the New HERO Common Stock.
Lack of Established Market for New HERO Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants.
A liquid trading market for the New HERO Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants
issued under the Plan does not exist. The future liquidity of the trading markets for New
HERO Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants will depend, among other things,
upon the number of holders of such securities and whether such securities become listed
for trading on an exchange or trading system at some future time.
79
The shares of common stock of HERO are currently listed on NASDAQ. HERO expects
that its common stock will become delisted from trading on NASDAQ following the Petition
Date and will then be traded on the OTC Pink market. The Reorganized Debtors will use
reasonable efforts to seek listing on NASDAQ in respect of the New HERO Common Stock
on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date. The Reorganized Debtors
are under no obligation to list the New HERO Warrants on any securities exchange. While
a liquid trading market may develop in the future for the New HERO Common Stock, this is
uncertain to be the case with respect to the New HERO Warrants.
The Anti-Dilution Protection for the New HERO Warrants Does Not Cover All Transactions
that Could Adversely Affect Such Warrants.
The terms of the New HERO Warrants will provide for anti-dilution protection in the event
of certain organic dilutive events such as splits, combinations, stock dividends and similar
organic dilutive events involving New HERO Common Stock. However, there could be
other transactions, such as the issuance of common stock at a price below the exercise
price for the New HERO Warrants or below the market price for the New HERO Common
Stock, for which there will be no anti-dilution adjustment. Also, if the Reorganized Debtors
were to engage in a business combination transaction for cash at a time when the market
value of the New HERO Common Stock was below the applicable exercise price, holders
of the New HERO Warrants would receive no value.
Historical Financial Information of the Debtors May Not Be Comparable to the Financial
Information of the Reorganized Debtor.
As a result of the consummation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby,
the financial condition and results of operations of the Reorganized Debtors from and
after the Effective Date may not be comparable to the financial condition or results of
operations reflected in the Debtors’ historical financial statements.
The Financial Projections Set forth in this Disclosure Statement May Not Be Achieved.
The Financial Projections cover the operations of the Reorganized Debtor through 2018.
The Financial Projections are based on numerous assumptions that are an integral part
thereof, including, but not limited to, Confirmation and consummation of the Plan in
accordance with its terms, the anticipated future performance of the Reorganized Debtors,
industry performance, general business and economic conditions, competition, adequate
financing, absence of material claims, the ability to make necessary capital expenditures,
the ability to establish strength in new markets and to maintain, improve, and strengthen
existing markets, customer purchasing trends and preferences, the ability to increase
gross margins and control future operating expenses, and other matters, many of which
are beyond the control of the Reorganized Debtors. In addition, unanticipated events and
circumstances occurring subsequent to the date of this Disclosure Statement may affect
the actual financial results of the operations of the Reorganized Debtors. These variations
may be material and adverse. Because the actual results achieved throughout the periods
covered by the Financial Projections will vary from the projected results, the Financial
Projections should not be relied upon as a guaranty, representation, or other assurance of
the actual results that will occur.
F. Additional Factors to Be Considered.
The Debtors Have No Duty to Update.
The statements contained in this Disclosure Statement are made by the Debtors as of the
date hereof, unless otherwise specified herein, and the delivery of this Disclosure
Statement after that date does not imply that there has been no change in the information
set forth herein since that date. The Debtors have no duty to update this Disclosure
Statement unless otherwise ordered to do so by the Court.
80
No Representations Made Outside this Disclosure Statement Are Authorized
The information contained in this Disclosure Statement is for purposes of soliciting
acceptances of the Plan and may not be relied upon for any other purpose. Except as
otherwise provided herein or in the Plan, no representations relating to the Debtors, the
Chapter 11 Cases, or the Plan are authorized by the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy
Code, or otherwise. Any representations or inducements made to secure your acceptance
or rejection of the Plan, other than as contained in or included with this Disclosure
Statement, should not be relied upon by you in arriving at your decision. You should
promptly report unauthorized representations or inducements to the counsel to the
Debtors and, if applicable, the U.S. Trustee.
The Debtors Relied on Certain Exemptions from Registration under the Securities Act
This Disclosure Statement has not been filed with the SEC or any state regulatory
authority. Neither the SEC nor any state regulatory authority has passed upon the
accuracy or adequacy of this Disclosure Statement or the exhibits or the statements
contained herein, and any representation to the contrary is unlawful. This Disclosure
Statement has been prepared pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 1125 and Bankruptcy
Rule 3016(b).
To the maximum extent permitted by Bankruptcy Code section 1145, the Securities Act,
and other applicable non-bankruptcy law, the issuance of the New HERO Common Stock
and New HERO Warrants will be exempt from registration under the Securities Act by
virtue of Bankruptcy Code section 1145 as described herein.
The Information Herein Was Provided by the Debtors and Relied upon by Their Advisors
Counsel to and other advisors retained by the Debtors have relied upon information
provided by the Debtors in connection with the preparation of this Disclosure Statement.
Although counsel to and other advisors retained by the Debtors have performed certain
limited due diligence in connection with the preparation of this Disclosure Statement, they
have not independently verified the information contained herein.
The statements contained in this Disclosure Statement are made by the Debtors as of the
date hereof, unless otherwise specified herein, and the delivery of this Disclosure
Statement after that date does not imply that there has not been a change in the
information set forth herein since that date. While the Debtors have used their reasonable
business judgment to ensure the accuracy of all of the information provided in this
Disclosure Statement and in the Plan, the Debtors nonetheless cannot, and do not,
confirm the current accuracy of all statements appearing in this Disclosure Statement.
Further, although the Debtors may subsequently update the information in this Disclosure
Statement, the Debtors have no affirmative duty to do so unless ordered to do so by the
Bankruptcy Court.
The financial information contained in this Disclosure Statement has not been audited
unless explicitly stated otherwise. In preparing this Disclosure Statement, the Debtors
relied on financial data derived from their books and records that was available at the time
of such preparation. Although the Debtors have used their reasonable business judgment
to ensure the accuracy of the financial information provided in this Disclosure Statement,
and while the Debtors believe that such financial information fairly reflects the financial
condition of the Debtors, the Debtors are unable to warrant or represent that the financial
information contained herein and attached hereto is without inaccuracies.
No Legal or Tax Advice Is Provided to You by this Disclosure Statement
This Disclosure Statement is not legal advice to you. The contents of this Disclosure
Statement should not be construed as legal, business, or tax advice. Each Holder of a
Claim or an Equity Interest should consult his or her own legal counsel and accountant
with regard to any legal, tax, and other matters concerning his or her Claim or Equity
Interest. This Disclosure Statement may not be relied upon for any purpose other than to
determine how to vote on the Plan or object to Confirmation of the Plan.
81
No Admissions Are Made by this Disclosure Statement
The information and statements contained in this Disclosure Statement will neither
constitute an admission of any fact or liability by any Entity (including, without limitation,
the Debtors) nor be deemed evidence of the tax or other legal effects of the Plan on the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, Holders of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests or any
other parties in interest. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the vote by a Holder of
an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest for or against the Plan does not constitute a waiver or
release of any Claims or rights of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors (or any party in
interest, as the case may be) to object to that Holder’s Allowed Claim or Equity Interest, or
recover any preferential, fraudulent, or other voidable transfer or assets, regardless of
whether any Claims or Causes of Action of the Debtors or their respective Estates are
specifically or generally identified herein.
In addition, no reliance should be placed on the fact that a particular litigation claim or
projected objection to a particular Claim or Equity Interest is, or is not, identified in this
Disclosure Statement. The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors may seek to investigate,
file, and prosecute objections to Claims and Equity Interests and may object to Claims
after the Confirmation or Effective Date of the Plan irrespective of whether this Disclosure
Statement identifies such Claims or objections to Claims.
Forward-Looking Statements in this Disclosure Statement
The Debtors make statements in this Disclosure Statement that are considered forward-
looking statements under the federal securities laws. The Debtors consider all statements
regarding anticipated or future matters, including the following, to be forward-looking

Exchange Commission for additional disclosures regarding risks and forward-looking
statements.
XII. SECURITIES LAW MATTERS
No registration statement will be filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), or pursuant to any state securities laws with respect to the offer and
distribution of securities under the Plan. Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Case, the
Debtors will rely on the exemption provided by section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and
applicable exemptions from Blue Sky Laws. The Debtor believes that the provisions of
section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code will exempt the issuance and distribution of
securities issued under the Plan (the “1145 Securities”) from federal and state securities
registration requirements. The 1145 Securities issued to affiliates of the Reorganized
Debtors will be treated as issued pursuant to section 1145(a)(1), but will be subject to
restrictions on resale and may be resold only under Rule 144 or another available
exemption from registration under the federal and state securities laws.
A. Bankruptcy Code Exemptions from Registration Requirements.
Securities Issued in Reliance on Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code exempts the offer and sale of securities under a
plan of reorganization from registration under the Securities Act and state laws if three
principal requirements are satisfied: (i) the securities must be offered and sold under a
plan of reorganization and must be securities of the debtor, of an affiliate participating in a
joint plan with the debtor, or of a successor to the debtor under the plan; (ii) the recipients
of the securities must each hold a prepetition or administrative expense claim against the
debtor or an interest in the debtor; and (iii) the securities must be issued in exchange for
the recipient’s claim against, or interest in, the debtor, or principally in such exchange and
partly for cash or property.
83
The exemptions provided for in section 1145 do not apply to an entity that is deemed an
“underwriter” as such term is defined in section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Section 1145(b) defines an “underwriter” as one who, except with respect to “ordinary
trading transactions” of an entity that is not an “issuer”:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
purchases a claim against, an interest in, or a claim for administrative
expense against, the debtor, with a view to distributing any security received
in exchange for such a claim or interest (“accumulators”);
offers to sell securities offered or sold under a plan for the holders of such
securities (“distributors”);
offers to buy securities offered or sold under a plan from the holders of such
securities, if the offer to buy is (i) with a view to distributing such securities
and (ii) under an agreement made in connection with the plan, with the
consummation of the plan, or with the offer or sale of securities under the
plan; and
is an “issuer” with respect to the securities, as the term “issuer” is defined in
section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, which includes affiliates of the issuer,
defined as persons who are in a relationship of “control” with the issuer.
As explained more fully in the next section, persons who are not deemed “underwriters”
of the issuer may generally resell 1145 Securities without registration under the Securities
Act or other applicable law. Persons deemed “underwriters” may sell such securities
without registration only pursuant to a registration statement or exemptions from
registration under the Securities Act and other applicable law.
Subsequent Resales of 1145 Securities.
Section 1145(c) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that securities issued pursuant to
section 1145(a)(1) are deemed to have been issued in a public offering. In general,
therefore, resales of and subsequent transactions in the 1145 Securities will be exempt
from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act,
unless the holder thereof is deemed to be an “issuer,” an “underwriter,” or a “dealer” with
respect to such securities. A “dealer,” as defined in section 2(a)(12) of the Securities Act,
is any person who engages either for all or part of his or her time, directly or indirectly, as
agent, broker, or principal, in the business of offering, buying, selling, or otherwise dealing
or trading in securities issued by another person. An “issuer” includes any “affiliate” of
the issuer, which is defined as a person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with the issuer. Affiliates of Reorganized HERO for these purposes
will generally include its directors and officers and its controlling stockholders.
“Control,” as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, means the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
While there is no precise definition of a “controlling” stockholder, the legislative history of
section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code suggests that a creditor who owns 10% or more of a
class of securities of a reorganized debtor may be presumed to be a “controlling person”
of the debtor. However, that presumption is rebuttable, and whether or not any particular
person would be deemed to be an “affiliate” of Reorganized HERO will depend upon
various facts and circumstances applicable to that person.
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1145(b) of the Bankruptcy Code regarding
accumulators and distributors, the staff of the SEC has taken the position that resales of
securities distributed under a plan of reorganization by accumulators and distributors of
securities who are not affiliates of the issuer of such securities are exempt from
registration under the Securities Act if effected in “ordinary trading transactions.” The
staff of the SEC has indicated in this context that a transaction by such non-affiliates may
be considered an “ordinary trading transaction” if it is made on a national securities
exchange or in the over-the-counter market and does not involve any of the following
factors:
(e)
(i) concerted action by the recipients of securities issued under a plan in
connection with the sale of such securities or (ii) concerted action by
distributors on behalf of one or more such recipients in connection with such
sales;
84
(f)
the use of informational documents concerning the offering of the securities
prepared or used to assist in the resale of such securities, other than a
bankruptcy court-approved disclosure statement and supplements thereto,
and documents filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act; or
(g)
the payment of special compensation to brokers and dealers in connection
with the sale of such securities designed as a special incentive to the resale
of such securities (other than the compensation that would be paid pursuant
to arm’s-length negotiations between a seller and a broker or dealer, each
acting unilaterally, not greater than the compensation that would be paid for
a routine similar-sized sale of similar securities of a similar issuer).
The staff of the SEC has not provided any guidance for privately arranged trades. The
views of the staff of the SEC on these matters have not been sought by the Debtors and,
therefore, no assurance can be given regarding the proper application of the “ordinary
trading transaction” exemption described above. Any person intending to rely on such
exemption is urged to consult their counsel as to the applicability thereof to their
circumstances.
Subsequent Transfers of the New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants Issued
to Affiliates.
Securities issued under the Plan to affiliates of Reorganized HERO will be subject to
certain restrictions on resale. Affiliates may resell such securities in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 144 or another available exemption under the Securities Act and
applicable Blue Sky Laws.
Rule 144 requires that certain information concerning the issuer be made publicly
available. Reorganized HERO expects to be a reporting company under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, thereby satisfying the public information requirement
of Rule 144. Affiliates of Reorganized HERO must also comply with the volume, manner of
sale, and notice requirements of Rule 144. However, affiliates of Reorganized HERO will
not be subject to the holding period requirement of Rule 144, as the New HERO Common
Stock and New HERO Warrants will be deemed to have been issued in a public offering.
Volume Requirement. Affiliates of Reorganized HERO will be limited in the number of
shares of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants (treated separately for this
purpose) that may be sold for their account (and related persons) in any three-month
period. They will be limited to the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding securities of the same
class being sold, and (ii) if the class is listed on a stock exchange, the average weekly
reported volume of trading in such securities during the four weeks preceding the filing of
a notice of proposed sale on Form 144 or if no notice is required, the date of receipt of the
order to execute the transaction by the broker or the date of execution of the transaction
directly with a market maker.
Manner of Sale Requirement. Under Rule 144, affiliates of Reorganized HERO may resell
their New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants solely in a broker’s transaction,
directly with a market maker, or in a riskless principal transaction (as defined in Rule 144).
Notice Requirement. If the amount of New HERO Common Stock or New HERO Warrants
sold by an affiliate under Rule 144 in any three month period exceeds 5,000 shares or
warrants or has an aggregate sale price greater than $50,000, the affiliate must file or
cause to be filed with the SEC three copies of a notice of proposed sale on Form 144, and
provide a copy to any exchange on which the securities are traded.
85
GIVEN THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A PARTICULAR
PERSON MAY BE AN UNDERWRITER, AFFILIATE, OR DEALER, THE DEBTOR MAKES
NO REPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF ANY PERSON TO TRADE IN
SECURITIES TO BE DISTRIBUTED PURSUANT TO THE PLAN. THE DEBTORS
RECOMMEND THAT HOLDERS OF CLAIMS CONSULT THEIR OWN COUNSEL
CONCERNING WHETHER THEY MAY FREELY TRADE SUCH SECURITIES.
Holders of Claims may wish to consult with their own legal advisors regarding the
applicability of securities laws and exemptions in their particular circumstances.
XIII. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN
A.
Introduction
The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Plan to the Debtors and to holders of Allowed Class 3 Senior Notes Claims in their
capacities as such.
This summary is provided for informational purposes only and is based on the Tax Code,
the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority and current
administrative rulings and practice, all as in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. A substantial amount of time may
elapse between the date of this Disclosure Statement and the receipt of a final distribution
under the Plan. Events subsequent to the date of this Disclosure Statement, such as the
enactment of additional tax legislation, court decisions or administrative changes, could
affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Plan and the transactions
contemplated thereunder. No ruling will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) with respect to any of the tax aspects of the Plan and no opinion of counsel has
heretofore been obtained by the Debtors with respect thereto. No representations are
being made regarding the particular tax consequences of the confirmation and
consummation of the Plan to the Debtor or any Holder of a Claim. No assurance can be
given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a different position
from any discussed herein. This summary does not address any aspects of U.S. federal
non-income, state, local, or non-U.S. taxation.
The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of Claims does
not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular
holder of a Claim in light of its particular facts and circumstances or to particular types of
holders of Claims subject to special treatment under the Tax Code (for example, financial
institutions; banks; broker-dealers; insurance companies; tax-exempt organizations;
retirement plans or other tax-deferred accounts; mutual funds; real estate investment
trusts; traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment; persons subject to the
alternative minimum tax; certain former U.S. citizens or long-term residents; persons who
hold Claims or New HERO Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale,
conversion or other integrated transaction; persons that have a functional currency other
than the U.S. dollar; governments or governmental organizations; pass-through entities;
investors in pass-through entities that hold Claims or New HERO Common Stock; and
persons who received their Claims or New HERO Common Stock upon exercise of
employee unit options or otherwise as compensation; or holders not entitled to vote on
the Plan). Furthermore, the summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to
holders of Claims applies only to holders that hold their Claims as capital assets for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment) and will hold their
New HERO Common Stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
the various debt and other arrangements to which the Debtors are parties will be
respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with their form. Insofar as
such summary addresses U.S. federal income tax consequences related to the New HERO
Common Stock, such summary applies only to holders of Claims that acquire the New
HERO Common Stock in exchange for their Claims pursuant to the Plan.
A “U.S. holder” for purposes of this summary is a beneficial owner of a Class 3 Senior
Note Claims that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
•
•
•
86
a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, that was created or organized in or under the laws of the United States,
any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or
a trust (1) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision
over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) that has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
A “Non-U.S. Holder” means a holder of a Claim that is not a U.S. holder and is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income taxes purposes), estate or trust.
If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner of a Claim or New HERO Common Stock, the treatment of
a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Partnerships and their partners should consult their tax
advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of participating in the Plan,
including the tax consequences with respect to the ownership and disposition of New
HERO Common Stock received under the Plan.
ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A
SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX PLANNING AND ADVICE BASED UPON THE
INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES PERTAINING TO A HOLDER. ALL HOLDERS OF CLAIMS
OR EQUITY INTERESTS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS FOR
THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN.
B. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Plan to the Debtors
The Debtors have reported consolidated U.S. net operating loss (“NOL”) carryovers for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $447.9 million as of December 31, 2014.
Certain of these NOLs are subject to limitations on their use. The Debtors expect to incur
further operating losses for the 2015 taxable year. If unused, these NOLs will expire in the
years 2029 through 2035. The amount of any such NOL carryforwards and other losses,
and the extent to which any limitations may apply, remains subject to audit and adjustment
by the IRS.
As discussed below, the amount of the Debtors’ NOL carryforwards, and possibly certain
other tax attributes, may be significantly reduced upon implementation of the Plan. In
addition, the Reorganized Debtors’ subsequent utilization of any net built-in losses with
respect to their assets and NOLs remaining, and possibly certain other tax attributes, may
be restricted as a result of and upon the implementation of the Plan.
Cancellation of Debt and Reduction of Tax Attributes
It is anticipated that the Plan will result in a cancellation of a portion of the Debtors’
outstanding indebtedness. In general, absent an exception, a debtor will realize and
recognize cancellation of debt income (“COD Income”) upon satisfaction of its
outstanding indebtedness for total consideration less than the amount of such
indebtedness. The amount of COD Income, in general, is the excess of (a) the adjusted
issue price of the indebtedness satisfied, over (b) the sum of the amount of cash paid and
the fair market value of any other consideration.
A debtor will not, however, be required to include any amount of COD Income in gross
income if the debtor is under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code and the discharge of debt occurs pursuant to that proceeding. Instead,
as a consequence of such exclusion, a debtor must reduce certain of its tax attributes by
the amount of COD Income that it excluded from gross income. In general, tax attributes
will be reduced in the following order: (a) NOLs and NOL carryovers; (b) certain tax credit
carryovers; (c) net capital losses and capital loss carryovers; (d) tax basis in assets (but
not below the amount of liabilities to which the debtor
87
remains subject); (e) passive activity loss and credit carryovers; and (f) foreign tax credit
carryovers. A debtor with COD Income may elect first to reduce the basis of its depreciable
assets. In the context of a consolidated group of corporations, the tax rules provide for a
complex ordering mechanism in determining how the tax attributes of one member can be
reduced by the COD Income of another member.
As a result of having their debt reduced in connection with their bankruptcy, the Debtors
generally will not recognize COD Income from the discharge of indebtedness pursuant to
the Plan; however, the Debtors expect that, subject to the limitations discussed herein,
they will be required to make material reductions in their tax attributes. Because the Plan
provides that holders of certain Claims may receive New HERO Common Stock, the
amount of COD Income, and accordingly the amount of tax attributes required to be
reduced, will depend in part on the fair market value of the New HERO Common Stock.
These values cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof.
Limitation of NOL Carryforwards and Other Tax Attributes
The Debtors had significant NOLs as of December 31, 2014 and expect to generate
operating losses through the Effective Date. The Debtors expect that, as a consequence
of the COD Income, their NOLs will be substantially reduced. The amount of tax attributes,
if any, that will be available to the Reorganized Debtors following such reduction is based
on a number of factors and is impossible to calculate at this time. Some of the factors that
will impact the amount of available tax attributes include: the amount of taxable income or
loss incurred by the Debtors in 2015 and the amount of COD Income recognized by the
Debtors in connection with the consummation of the Plan. Following the consummation of
the Plan, the Debtors anticipate that any remaining NOLs and other tax attributes, if any,
may be subject to limitation under section 382 of the Tax Code by reason of the
transactions under the Plan.
Under section 382 of the Tax Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,”
the amount of its pre-ownership change NOLs (collectively, “Pre-Change Losses”) that
may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation.
Corresponding rules may reduce a corporation’s ability to use losses if it has built-in
losses in its assets at the time of an ownership change. Capital loss carryovers and
certain tax credit carryovers are also generally limited after an ownership change under
section 383 of the Tax Code. Although the Debtors do not believe that their NOLs are
currently subject to these utilization limitations (other than certain carryovers relating to
the 2011 acquisition of Seahawk Drilling, Inc.), subsequent trading activity in HERO’s
shares or further changes in the ownership of HERO stock prior to the issuance of the
New HERO Common Stock pursuant to the Plan could result in “ownership changes” that
may ultimately affect the ability to fully utilize the Debtors’ NOLs. As discussed in greater
detail herein, the Debtors anticipate that the issuance of the New HERO Common Stock
pursuant to the Plan will result in an “ownership change” of the Reorganized Debtors for
these purposes, and that the Reorganized Debtors’ use of their Pre-Change Losses will be
subject to limitation unless an exception to the general rules of Section 382 of the Tax
Code applies. This limitation is independent of, and in addition to, the reduction of tax
attributes described in the preceding section resulting from the exclusion of COD Income.
(a) General Section 382 Annual Limitation
In general, the annual limitation determined under section 382 of the Tax Code in the case
of an “ownership change” of a corporation (the “Section 382 Limitation”) is equal to the
product of (a) the fair market value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the
ownership change (with certain adjustments) multiplied by (b) the applicable “long-term
tax-exempt rate” posted by the IRS (e.g., 2.74% for July 2015). Generally, the Section 382
Limitation may be increased to the extent that the corporation recognizes certain built-in
gains in its assets during the five-year period following the ownership change, or is treated
as recognizing built-in gains pursuant to certain safe harbors provided by the IRS.
Corresponding rules may reduce a corporation’s ability to use losses if it has built-in
losses in its assets at the time of an ownership change. Section 383 of the Tax Code
applies a limitation, similar to the Section 382 Limitation, to capital loss carryforwards and
tax credits. Any unused limitation may be carried forward, thereby increasing the annual
limitation in the subsequent taxable year. The debtor corporation’s Pre-Change Losses
will be subject to further limitations if the debtor does not continue its business enterprise
for at least two years following the ownership change or if it experiences additional future
ownership changes. As discussed below, however, special rules may apply in the case of
a corporation which experiences an ownership change as the result of a bankruptcy
proceeding.
88
(b) Special Bankruptcy Exceptions
An exception to the foregoing annual limitation rules generally applies when the existing
shareholders and/or so-called “qualified creditors” of a debtor corporation in a chapter 11
bankruptcy case receive, in respect of their claims or interests, at least 50% of the vote and
value of the stock of the reorganized debtor (or stock of a controlling corporation if also in
bankruptcy) pursuant to a confirmed chapter 11 plan (the “382(l)(5) Exception”). Under the
382(l)(5) Exception, a debtor’s Pre-Change Losses are not limited on an annual basis but,
instead, the debtor’s NOLs are required to be reduced by the amount of any interest
deductions claimed during any taxable year ending during the three-year period
preceding the taxable year that includes the effective date of the plan of reorganization,
and during the part of the taxable year prior to and including the effective date of the plan
of reorganization, in respect of all debt converted into stock in the reorganization. If the
382(l)(5) Exception applies and the debtor undergoes another ownership change within
two years after consummation of the plan, then the debtor’s Pre-Change Losses
effectively would be eliminated in their entirety.
When the 382(l)(5) Exception is not applicable (either because the debtor does not qualify
for it or the debtor otherwise elects not to utilize the 382(l)(5) Exception), a second special
rule will generally apply to a debtor in chapter 11 (the “382(l)(6) Exception”). When the
382(l)(6) Exception applies, a debtor corporation that undergoes an ownership change
generally is permitted to determine the fair market value of its stock after taking into
account the increase in value resulting from any surrender or cancellation of creditors’
claims in the bankruptcy. This differs from the ordinary rule that requires the fair market
value of a debtor corporation that undergoes an ownership change to be determined
before the events giving rise to the change. The 382(l)(6) Exception also differs from the
382(l)(5) Exception in that the debtor corporation is not required to reduce its NOLs by
interest deductions in the manner described above, and the debtor may undergo a change
of ownership within two years without triggering the elimination of its Pre-Change Losses.
Whether the Debtors qualify for the 382(l)(5) Exception is highly fact specific and
significant uncertainties exist as to the facts and law underlying this position. Thus, the
Debtors are not certain whether they will qualify for the Section 382(l)(5) Exception or
would choose to elect out of the Section 382(l)(5) Exception. If the Debtors do not qualify
for the 382(1)(5) Exception or the Debtors elect out of the 382(l)(5) Exception, the Debtors’
use of its Pre-Change Losses will be subject to the Section 382 Limitation following
confirmation of the Plan, calculated under the special rule of Section 382(1)(6) of the Tax
Code described above. However, any NOLs generated in any-post-Effective Date taxable
year (including the portion of the taxable year of the ownership change following the
Effective Date) should not be subject to this limitation.
Regardless of whether the Debtors take advantage of the 382(l)(5) Exception or the 382(l)
(6) Exception, the Reorganized Debtors’ use of their Pre-Change Losses, if any, after the
Effective Date may be adversely affected if an “ownership change” within the meaning of
Section 382 of the Tax Code were to occur after the Effective Date.
Alternative Minimum Tax
In general, an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) is imposed on a corporation’s alternative
minimum taxable income (“AMTI”) at a 20% rate to the extent such tax exceeds the
corporation’s regular federal income tax for the year. AMTI is generally equal to regular
taxable income with certain adjustments. For purposes of computing AMTI, certain tax
deductions and other beneficial allowances are modified or eliminated. For example,
except for AMT NOLs for certain taxable years, only 90% of a corporation’s AMTI may be
offset by available AMT NOL carryforwards. Additionally, under section 56(g)(4(G) of the
Tax Code an ownership change (as discussed above) that occurs with respect to a
corporation having a net unrealized built-in loss in its assets may cause the corporation’s
aggregate tax basis in its assets to be reduced for certain AMT purposes to reflect the fair
market value of such assets as of the change date.
89
C. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Plan to U.S. Holders of
Allowed Class 3 Senior Notes Claims
The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Plan to a U.S. holder of a Claim will
depend, in part, on whether the related Senior Note constitutes a “security” for federal
income tax purposes, whether the holder reports income on the accrual or cash basis,
whether the holder has taken a bad debt deduction or worthless security deduction with
respect to the Claim and whether the holder receives distributions under the Plan in more
than one taxable year. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax
consequences of the Plan based on their individual circumstances.
Definition of Securities
Whether an instrument constitutes a “security” is determined based upon all the facts and
circumstances, but most authorities have held that the length of the term of a debt
instrument is an important factor in determining whether such instrument is a security for
federal income tax purposes. These authorities have indicated that a term of less than five
years is evidence that the instrument is not a security, whereas a term of ten years or more
is evidence that it is a security. Under somewhat different facts, the IRS has ruled that new
debt obligations with a term of less than five years issued in exchange for and bearing the
same terms (other than interest rate) as securities should also be classified as securities
for this purpose, since the new debt represents a continuation of the holder’s investment
in the corporation in substantially the same form. The Senior Notes have terms between
seven (7) and thirty (30) years. There are numerous other factors that could be taken into
account in determining whether a debt instrument is a security, including the security for
payment, the creditworthiness of the obligor, the subordination or lack thereof to other
creditors, the right to vote or otherwise participate in the management of the obligor,
convertibility of the instrument into an equity interest of the obligor, whether payments of
interest are fixed, variable, or contingent, and whether such payments are made on a
current basis or accrued. Because of the inherently factual nature of this determination,
each U.S. holder of a Claim is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding whether a Senior
Note constitutes a security for federal income tax purposes.
Exchange of Claims
(a) Senior Notes are Securities for Tax Purposes
If a Senior Note is treated as a security for federal income tax purposes, the exchange of
such Senior Note pursuant to the Plan would be treated as a recapitalization, and therefore
a reorganization under the Tax Code. In general, if a Senior Note is treated as a security for
federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder (i) will recognize gain only to the extent of any
amounts received in respect of accrued but unpaid interest on a Senior Note and (ii) will
not be permitted to recognize a loss. In that case, the gain would generally be capital gain
except to the extent the “market discount” rules discussed below cause the gain to be
treated as ordinary income. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss, if
at the time of disposition of the Senior Note, a Holder held the Senior Note for more than
one year.
A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of New HERO Common Stock received
would equal the adjusted tax basis of the Senior Notes exchanged therefor. A U.S. holder
would have a holding period for the New HERO Common Stock that includes the holding
period for the Senior Notes exchanged therefor. The adjusted tax basis of any share of
New HERO Common Stock treated as received in satisfaction of accrued interest would
equal the fair market value of such New HERO Common Stock and the holding period for
such share of New HERO Common Stock would begin on the day following the day of
receipt.
(b) Senior Notes are Not Securities
If a Senior Note is not treated as a “security” for federal income tax purposes, the
exchange of such a Class 3 Senior Notes Claim should be a taxable transaction. Subject
to the discussion under “Distributions After the Effective Date” below, a U.S. holder
should generally recognize gain or loss on the exchange of a Class 3 Senior Notes Claim
pursuant to the Plan equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the New
HERO Common Stock (excluding New HERO Common Stock treated as attributable to
accrued interest on such Claims,
90
which is taxable as described below under “Accrued Interest”), and (ii) the U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such Claims. The character of such gain or loss as capital gain or
loss or as ordinary income or loss will be determined by a number of factors, including the
nature of the Claim in such U.S. holder’s hands, whether the Claim was purchased at a
discount, and whether and to what extent the U.S. holder has previously claimed a bad
debt deduction with respect to its Claim. See the discussions below under “Accrued
Interest” and “Market Discount.” The U.S. holder’s tax basis in such New HERO Common
Stock should generally be the fair market value of the New HERO Common Stock at the
time received, and the U.S. holder’s holding period in such New HERO Common Stock, if
any, should generally begin on the day following the day of receipt.
U.S. holders of Allowed Class 3 Senior Notes Claims should consult their tax advisors
regarding the tax consequences of the exchange, including: the tax consequences of any
distributions that may be made after the Effective Date on account of the disallowance of
any Disputed Claim and possible alternative characterizations of the exchange.
New HERO Common Stock
(b) Distributions
The gross amount of any distribution of cash or property made to a U.S. holder with
respect to New HERO Common Stock generally will be includible in gross income by a
U.S. holder as dividend income to the extent such distribution is paid out of current or
accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
Dividends received by non-corporate U.S. holders may qualify for reduced rates of
taxation. Subject to applicable limitations, a distribution which is treated as a dividend for
U.S. federal income tax purposes may qualify for the dividends-received deduction if such
amount is distributed to a U.S. holder that is a corporation and certain holding period and
certain other requirements are satisfied. Any dividend received by a U.S. holder that is a
corporation may be subject to the “extraordinary dividend” provisions of the Tax Code. A
distribution in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined
under U.S. federal income tax principles, will first be treated as a return of capital to the
extent of the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its New HERO Common Stock and will be
applied against and reduce such basis dollar-for-dollar (thereby increasing the amount of
gain or decreasing the amount of loss recognized on a subsequent taxable disposition of
the New HERO Common Stock). To the extent that such distribution exceeds the U.S.
holder’s adjusted tax basis in its New HERO Common Stock, the distribution will be
treated as capital gain, which will be treated as long-term capital gain if such U.S. holder’s
holding period in its New HERO Common Stock exceeds one year as of the date of the
distribution.
(c) Sale, Exchange, or Other Taxable Disposition.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss on
the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of any of its New HERO Common Stock in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized for the New HERO
Common Stock and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the New HERO Common Stock.
Subject to the rules discussed below under “Market Discount,” any such gain or loss
generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder
has a holding period in the New HERO Common Stock of more than one year as of the
date of disposition. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders derived with respect to a
sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of New HERO Common Stock held for more
than one year may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Under the Tax Code section
108(e)(7) recapture rules, a holder may be required to treat gain recognized on the taxable
disposition of the New HERO Common Stock as ordinary income if the holder took a bad
debt deduction with respect to the Senior Notes or recognized an ordinary loss on the
exchange of the Senior Notes for New HERO Common Stock. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors
regarding such limitations.
Holders of New HERO Common Stock are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the tax consequences related to the New HERO Common Stock.
91
Distributions After the Effective Date
If a U.S. holder of an Allowed Claim receives a distribution pursuant to the Plan
subsequent to the Effective Date, a portion of such distributions may be treated as
imputed interest under the imputed interest provisions of the Tax Code. Such imputed
interest may accrue over time, in which case a holder may be required to include such
imputed interest in income prior to the actual distributions. Any loss and a portion of any
gain realized by such holder may be subject to deferral. Furthermore, the “installment
sale” rules of the Tax Code may apply to gain recognized by such U.S. holder unless the
U.S. holder elects out of such rules.
U.S. holders of Claims should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences
of distributions made after the Effective Date, including the potential applicability of (and
ability to elect out of) the installment sale rules and the potential applicability of the
imputed interest rules.
Accrued But Unpaid Interest
To the extent that any amount received by a U.S. holder under the Plan is attributable to
accrued but unpaid interest and such interest has not previously been included in the U.S.
holder’s gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such amount would generally
be taxable to the U.S. holder as ordinary interest income. A U.S. holder may be able to
recognize a deductible loss to the extent that any accrued interest on the debt instrument
constituting such Claim was previously so included in the U.S. holder’s gross income but
was not paid in full by the Debtors.
The extent to which any amount received by a U.S. holder will be attributable to accrued
but untaxed interest is unclear. Under the Plan, the aggregate consideration to be
distributed to Holders of Allowed Claims in each Class in full or partial satisfaction of their
Claims will be treated as first satisfying the stated principal amount of the Allowed Claims
for such Holders and any remaining consideration as satisfying accrued, but unpaid,
interest, if any. The IRS could take the position, however, that the consideration received
by a Holder should be allocated in some way other than as provided in the Plan.
Holders of Claims should consult their own tax advisors regarding the proper allocation of
the consideration received by them under the Plan.
Market Discount
Under the “market discount” provisions of sections 1276 through 1278 of the Tax Code,
some or all of any gain realized by a U.S. holder exchanging any debt instrument
constituting its Allowed Claim may be treated as ordinary income (instead of capital gain),
to the extent of the amount of accrued “market discount” on the debt constituting the
surrendered Allowed Claim.
A debt instrument to which sections 1276 through 1278 of the Tax Code may apply is
generally considered to have been acquired with “market discount” if it is acquired other
than on original issue and its basis immediately after its acquisition by the U.S. holder is
less than (i) its “stated redemption price at maturity,” or (ii) in the case of a debt instrument
issued with OID, its “revised issue price,” by at least a statutorily defined de minimis
amount.
Any gain recognized by a U.S. holder on the taxable disposition of debts to which sections
1276 through 1278 of the Tax Code may apply and that it acquired with market discount
would be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that accrued
thereon while such debts were considered to be held by the U.S. holder (unless the U.S.
holder elected to include market discount in income as it accrued). To the extent that such
surrendered debts that had been acquired with market discount are exchanged for New
HERO Common Stock in a tax-free reorganization, any market discount that accrued on
such debts but was not recognized by the U.S. holder may be required to be carried over
to the property received therefor and any gain recognized on the subsequent sale,
exchange, redemption or other disposition of the New HERO Common Stock may be
treated as ordinary income to the extent of the accrued but unrecognized market discount
with respect to the exchanged debt instrument.
Medicare Tax
92
Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates, or trusts are required to pay an additional
3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or other
disposition of capital assets. U.S. holders that are individuals, estates, or trusts should
consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this tax provision on their own
situation.
D. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of Allowed
Class 3 Senior Notes Claims
The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of a Non-U.S. holder are complex. The
following discussion includes only certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
Plan to Non-U.S. holders. The discussion does not include any non-U.S. tax
considerations. Non-U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine
the effect of U.S. federal, state, and local tax laws, as well as any other applicable non-U.S.
tax laws and/or treaties, with regard to their participation in the transactions contemplated
by the Plan, their ownership of Allowed Class 3 Senior Notes Claims, and the ownership
and disposition of the New HERO Common Stock.
Whether a Non-U.S. holder realizes gain or loss on the exchange and the amount of such
gain or loss is determined in the same manner as set forth above in connection with U.S.
Holders.
Gain Recognition
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. holder on the exchange of its Claim generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless (a) the Non-U.S. holder is an individual who
was present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year which includes the
Effective Date and certain other conditions are met or (b) such gain is effectively
connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the U.S.
(and if an income tax treaty applies, such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment
maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the U.S.).
If the first exception applies, to the extent that any gain is taxable and does not qualify for
deferral as described above, the Non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate or exemption from tax under an applicable
income tax treaty) on the amount by which such Non-U.S. holder’s capital gains allocable
to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of
the exchange. If the second exception applies, the Non-U.S. holder generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to any gain realized on the exchange if
such gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or
business in the U.S. in the same manner as a U.S. holder. In order to claim an exemption
from withholding tax, such Non-U.S. holder will be required to provide a properly executed
IRS Form W-8ECI (or such successor form as the IRS designates) or IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E (if a treaty exemption applies). In addition, if such Non-U.S. holder is a
corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate
provided by an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and
profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Owning and Disposing of
New HERO Common Stock
(a) Dividends on New HERO Common Stock
Any distributions made with respect to New HERO Common Stock will constitute
dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of Reorganized HERO’s
current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax
principles. Except as described below, dividends paid with respect to New HERO Common
Stock held by a Non-U.S. holder that are not effectively connected with a Non-U.S. holder’s
conduct of a U.S. trade or business (or if an income tax treaty applies, are not attributable
to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the U.S.) will be
subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate or exemption
from tax, if applicable). A Non-U.S. holder generally will be required to satisfy certain IRS
certification requirements in order to claim a reduction of or exemption from
93
withholding under a tax treaty by filing IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or a successor
form) upon which the Non-U.S. holder certifies, under penalties of perjury, its status as a
non-U.S. person and its entitlement to the lower treaty rate or exemption from tax with
respect to such payments. Dividends paid with respect to New HERO Common Stock held
by a Non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with a Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a
U.S. trade or business (and if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the U.S.) generally will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as a U.S. holder, and a Non-U.S. holder that is
a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits
tax with respect to such Non-U.S. holder’s effectively connected earnings and profits that
are attributable to the dividends at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate or exemption from
tax under an applicable income tax treaty).
(b) Sale, Redemption, or Repurchase of New HERO Common Stock
A Non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to
any gain realized on the sale or other taxable disposition (including a cash redemption) of
New HERO Common Stock, unless:
(i) such Non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in
the taxable year of disposition or who is subject to special rules applicable to former
citizens and residents of the U.S.; or
(ii) such gain is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade
or business (and if an income tax treaty applies, such gain is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. holder in the U.S.); or
(iii) Reorganized HERO is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation”
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “USRPHC”) at any time during the shorter of the
Non-U.S. holder’s holding period for the New HERO Common Stock and the five year
period ending on the date of disposition (the “Applicable Period”).
If the first exception applies, the Non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate or exemption from tax under an applicable
income tax treaty) on the amount by which such Non-U.S. holder’s capital gains allocable
to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of
disposition of New HERO Common Stock. If the second exception applies, the Non-U.S.
holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such gain in the
same manner as a U.S. holder, and a Non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes may also be subject to a branch profits tax with respect to earnings
and profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business that are attributable to such
gains at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate or exemption from tax under an applicable
income tax treaty).
Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its United States real
property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its
worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or
business. Even if Reorganized HERO is or becomes a USRPHC, so long as the New HERO
Common Stock remains regularly traded on an established securities market for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, a Non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to United
States federal income tax on any gain from the disposition of the New HERO Common
Stock by virtue of Reorganized HERO being a USRPHC unless such Non-U.S. holder
actually or constructively owned more than 5% of the outstanding New HERO Common
Stock at some time during the Applicable Period. Any gain that is taxable because
Reorganized HERO is a USRPHC will generally be taxable in the same manner as gain that
is effectively connected income (as described above), except that the branch profits tax
will not apply. The Debtors believe that based on current business plans and operations,
Reorganized HERO is not and should not become a USRPHC in the future.
FATCA
Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), foreign financial institutions
and certain other foreign entities must report certain information with respect to their U.S.
account holders and investors or be subject to withholding on the receipt of “withholdable
payments.” For this purpose, “withholdable payments” are generally U.S.-source
payments of fixed or determinable, annual or periodical income (including dividends, if
any,
94
on New HERO Common Stock), and also include gross proceeds from the sale of any
property of a type which can produce U.S. source interest or dividends (which would
include New HERO Common Stock). FATCA withholding will apply even if the applicable
payment would not otherwise be subject to U.S. federal nonresident withholding tax.
FATCA withholding rules apply to U.S.-source payments on obligations issued after
July 1, 2014, and to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
property of a type that can produce U.S.-source interest or dividends that occurs after
December 31, 2016. Although administrative guidance and Treasury regulations have
been issued, the exact scope of these rules remains unclear and potentially subject to
material changes.
Each Non-U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the possible impact of
these rules on such Non-U.S. holder’s ownership of New HERO Common Stock.
E.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Payments made pursuant to the Plan will generally be subject to any applicable federal
income tax information reporting and backup withholding requirements. The Tax Code
imposes backup withholding tax on certain payments, including payments of interest and
dividends, if a taxpayer (a) fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number
(generally on IRS Form W-9 for a U.S. holder); (b) furnishes an incorrect taxpayer
identification number; (c) is notified by the IRS that it has previously failed to report
properly certain items subject to backup withholding tax; or (d) fails to certify, under
penalty of perjury, that such taxpayer has furnished its correct taxpayer identification
number and that the IRS has not notified such taxpayer that it is subject to backup
withholding tax. However, taxpayers that are C corporations generally are excluded from
these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules provided that evidence of
such corporate status is furnished to the payor. Backup withholding is not an additional
federal income tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding tax rules will
generally be allowed as a credit against a taxpayer’s federal income tax liability, if any, or
will be refunded to the extent the amounts withheld exceed the taxpayer’s actual tax
liability, if such taxpayer timely furnishes required information to the IRS. Each taxpayer
should consult its own tax advisor regarding the information reporting and backup
withholding tax rules as they relate to distributions under the Plan.
In addition, from an information reporting perspective, U.S. Treasury regulations generally
require disclosure by a taxpayer on its U.S. federal income tax return of certain types of
transactions in which the taxpayer participated, including, among other types of
transactions, certain transactions that result in the taxpayer’s claiming a loss in excess of
specified thresholds.
Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these regulations and whether
the transactions contemplated by the Plan would be subject to these regulations and
require disclosure on the holders’ tax returns.
F.
Importance of Obtaining Professional Tax Assistance
The foregoing discussion is intended only as a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Plan, does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be relevant to a particular Holder of a Claim in light of such Holder’s
circumstances and tax situation and is not a substitute for consultation with a tax
professional. The above discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax
advice. The tax consequences of the Plan are complex and are in many cases uncertain
and may vary depending on a claimant’s particular circumstances. Accordingly, all
Holders of Allowed Class 3 Senior Notes Claims are strongly urged to consult their own
tax advisors about the federal, state, local, and applicable non-U.S. income and other tax
consequences to them under the Plan, including with respect to tax reporting and record
keeping requirements.
XIV. RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION
The Debtors believe that confirmation of the Plan is in the best interests of all creditors
and Equity Interest holders and urge all creditors in Class 3 to vote in favor of the Plan.

INTRODUCTION
Hercules Offshore, Inc. and certain of its affiliated Debtors jointly propose the following
prepackaged plan of reorganization under section 1121(a) of chapter 11 of title 11 of the
United States Code. Although proposed jointly for administrative purposes, the Plan
constitutes a separate Plan for each Debtor for the resolution of outstanding Claims
against and Interests in each Debtor pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors seek
to consummate the restructuring on the Effective Date of the Plan. Each Debtor is a
proponent of the Plan within the meaning of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code. The
classifications of Claims and Interests set forth in Article III shall be deemed to apply
separately with respect to each Plan proposed by each Debtor, as applicable. The Plan
does not contemplate substantive consolidation of any of the Debtors.
Reference is made to the Disclosure Statement accompanying the Plan, including the
exhibits thereto, for a discussion of the Debtors’ history, business, results of operations,
and projections for future operations and risk factors, together with a summary and
analysis of the Plan.

Interpretation, Application of Definitions, and Rules of Construction.
Except as expressly provided herein, each capitalized term used in the Plan shall either
have (i) the meaning ascribed to such term in Article I or (b) if such term is not defined in
Article I, but such term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rules, the
meaning ascribed to such term in the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules, as the
case may be. Meanings of capitalized terms shall be equally applicable to both the singular
and plural forms of such terms. The words “herein,” “hereof,” and “hereunder” and other
words of similar import refer to the Plan as a whole (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Plan Supplement) and not to any particular section or subsection in the Plan unless
expressly provided otherwise. The words “includes” and “including” are not limiting and
mean that the things specifically identified are set forth for purposes of illustration, clarity
or specificity and do not in any respect qualify, characterize or limit the generality of the
class within which such things are included. Captions and headings to articles, sections
and exhibits are inserted for convenience of reference only, are not a part of this Plan, and
shall not be used to interpret this Plan. Where the Plan requires that (i)
16
any document or agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Steering
Group or (ii) any decisions or actions may be taken only with the consent or approval of
the Steering Group, such requirement shall be satisfied by the consent of Steering Group
Members holding at least 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes held
by all Steering Group Members, which consent shall be evidenced by written consent of
counsel to the Steering Group. The rules of construction set forth in section 102 of the
Bankruptcy Code shall apply to this Plan.
C. Computation of Time.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, in computing any period of time
prescribed or allowed by this Plan, the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) shall apply.

holder, the Debtors and the Steering Group or otherwise determined upon a Final Order of
the Court.
D. U.S. Trustee Fees.

ARTICLE III.
CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF
CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS
A. Classification of Claims and Equity Interests.
Except for those Claims addressed in Article II, all Claims and Equity Interests are placed
in the Classes set forth below. A Claim or Equity Interest is placed in a particular Class
solely to the extent that the Claim or Equity Interest falls within the description of that
Class, and the portion of a Claim or Equity Interest which does not fall within such
description shall be classified in another Class or Classes to the extent that such portion
falls within the description of such other Class or Classes. A Claim is also placed in a
particular Class for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to the Plan solely to
the extent that such Claim is an Allowed Claim in that Class and such Claim has not been
paid, released, or otherwise settled before the Effective Date.
All claims and interests against a particular Debtor are placed in classes for each of the
Debtors (as designated by subclasses a through o for each of the 15 Debtors).
Specifically, such subclasses represent Claims against and Equity Interests in the Debtors
as follows: Cliffs Drilling Company (subclass a); Cliffs Drilling Trinidad LLC (subclass b);
FDT LLC (subclass c); FDT Holdings LLC (subclass d); Hercules Drilling Company LLC
(subclass e); Hercules Liftboat Company LLC (subclass f); Hercules Offshore, Inc.
(subclass g); Hercules Offshore Services LLC (subclass h); Hercules Offshore Liftboat
Company LLC (subclass i); HERO Holdings, Inc. (subclass j); SD Drilling LLC (subclass k);
THE Offshore Drilling Company (subclass l); THE Onshore Drilling Company (subclass m);
TODCO Americas, Inc. (subclass n); and TODCO International, Inc. (subclass o).
B. Record Date.
As of the close of business on the Record Date, the claims register (for Claims) and
transfer ledger (for Equity Interests) shall be closed, and there shall be no further changes
in the record holders of any Claims or Equity Interests. The Reorganized Debtors shall
have no obligation to, but may, with the consent of the Steering Group, recognize any
transfer of any Claims or Equity Interests occurring after the Record Date. The
Reorganized Debtors shall instead be entitled to recognize and deal for purposes under
the Plan with only those record holders stated on the claims register (for Claims) and
transfer ledgers (for Equity Interests) as of the close of business on the Record Date.
C. Summary of Classification and Class Identification.
Below is a chart identifying Classes of Claims and Equity Interests against each such
Debtor, a description of whether each Class is Impaired, and each Class’s voting rights

cast by Non-Eligible Noteholders will not be counted.
19
Section 1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be satisfied, for the purposes of
Confirmation, by acceptance of the Plan by an Impaired Class of Claims against each such
Debtor; provided, however, that in the event no holder of a Claim with respect to a specific
voting Class timely submits a Ballot indicating acceptance or rejection of the Plan, such
Class will be deemed to have accepted the Plan. The Debtors hereby request that the
Court confirm the Plan pursuant to section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to
any rejecting Class of Claims or Equity Interests.
D. Treatment of Classified Claims and Equity Interests.
1. Class 1 - Other Priority Claims (Subclasses 1a-1o).
(a) Classification: Class 1 consists of Other Priority Claims.
(b) Treatment: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Other Priority Claim and the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) agree in writing to less favorable
treatment, in full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in
exchange for, each Allowed Other Priority Claim, each holder of an Allowed Other Priority
Claim shall receive (i) payment in Cash in an amount equal to such Allowed Other Priority
Claim as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the Effective Date and (b) thirty (30) days
after the date when such Other Priority Claim becomes an Allowed Other Priority Claim or
(ii) such other treatment, as determined by the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering
Group), that will render it Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(c) Voting: Class 1 is Unimpaired by the Plan, and each holder of a Class 1 Other Priority
Claim is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of
the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 1 Other Priority Claims are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.
2. Class 2 - Other Secured Claims (Subclasses 2a-2o).
(a) Classification: Class 2 consists of Other Secured Claims.
(b) Treatment: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Other Secured Claim and
the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) agree in writing to less
20
favorable treatment, in full and final satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge of and
in exchange for such Other Secured Claim, each holder of an Allowed Other Secured
Claim shall, as determined by the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group), receive
(i) Cash in an amount equal to such Allowed Other Secured Claim, including any interest
on such Allowed Other Secured Claim, if such interest is required to be paid pursuant to
sections 506(b) and/or 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code, as soon as practicable after the
later of (a) the Effective Date, and (b) thirty (30) days after the date such Other Secured
Claim becomes an Allowed Other Secured Claim, (ii) the Collateral securing its Allowed
Other Secured Claim as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the Effective Date and
(b) thirty (30) days after the date such Other Secured Claim becomes an Allowed Other
Secured Claim, or (iii) such other treatment, as determined by the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group), that will render it Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of
the Bankruptcy Code.
(c) Voting: Class 2 is Unimpaired by the Plan, and each holder of a Class 2 Other Secured
Claim is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of
the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 2 Other Secured Claims are not entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan.
3. Class 3 – Senior Notes Claims (Subclasses 3a-3o).
(a) Classification: Class 3 consists of Senior Notes Claims.
(b) Treatment: Except to the extent that a holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim and the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) agree in writing to less favorable
treatment, in full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in
exchange for, each Senior Notes Claim, on or as soon as practicable after the Effective
Date, each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim shall receive its Pro Rata share of the
Senior Notes Equity Distribution.
In addition to the foregoing, each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim that is an
Eligible Noteholder shall have the opportunity to participate, on a Pro Rata basis, in the
First Lien Exit Facility in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the First
Lien Exit Facility Subscription Procedures during the period from the Petition Date
through the date of the Confirmation Hearing. The opportunity to participate in the First
Lien Exit Facility does not constitute a distribution to the holders of Allowed Senior Notes
Claims on account of their Claims.
(c) Guarantee Claims: Each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim shall only receive
one recovery in full and complete satisfaction of all Senior Notes Claims and all Guarantee
Claims that may be held by such holder, which recovery is specified in Article III.D.3(b).
(d) Voting: Class 3 is Impaired. Holders of Class 3 Senior Notes Claims are entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan, provided that the Debtors are not soliciting the votes of Non-
Eligible Noteholders and any votes cast by Non-Eligible Noteholders will not be counted.
21
4. Class 4 – General Unsecured Claims (Subclasses 4a-4o).
(a) Classification: Class 4 consists of General Unsecured Claims.
(b) Allowance: Each General Unsecured Claim in Class 4 shall be Allowed unless such
Claim is Disputed. For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of the Plan shall diminish,
enhance, or modify any applicable nonbankruptcy legal, equitable, and/or contractual
rights of a holder of a General Unsecured Claim to receive payment on account of such
General Unsecured Claim in Class 4, which are “riding through” the Chapter 11 Cases
under the Plan as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced.
(c) Treatment: In full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in
exchange for, each Allowed General Unsecured Claim, on the Effective Date, each holder
of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim shall, at the discretion of the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group), and only to the extent such holder’s Allowed General
Unsecured Claim was not previously paid in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to
an order of the Court, or otherwise: (i) have its Allowed General Unsecured Claim
Reinstated as an obligation of the applicable Reorganized Debtor, and be paid in
accordance with ordinary course terms, (ii) receive such other treatment as may be agreed
between such holder and the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or
(iii) receive such other treatment, as determined by the Debtors (with the consent of the
Steering Group), that will render it Unimpaired pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Payment of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim is subject to the rights of the
Debtors, Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest to dispute such Claim as if the
Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced in accordance with applicable
nonbankruptcy law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, until an Allowed General Unsecured
Claim in Class 4 (including Cure Claims) that arises prior to the Effective Date has been
(x) paid in full in accordance with applicable law, or on terms agreed to between the holder
of such Claim and the Debtor (with the consent of the Steering Group) or Reorganized
Debtor, or in accordance with the terms and conditions of the particular transaction giving
rise to such Claim, or (y) resolved pursuant to the disputed claims procedures applicable
to General Unsecured Claims under Article VIII.A.3 of the Plan: (a) the provisions of Article
VII.A.C-H of the Plan shall not apply or take effect with respect to such Claim, (b) such
Claim shall not be deemed settled, satisfied, resolved, released, discharged, or enjoined
by any provision of the Plan, and (c) the applicable Reorganized Debtor shall remain liable
for such Claims. For the avoidance of doubt, upon the satisfaction of subpart (x) or (y) of
the foregoing sentence, subparts (a)-(c) of the foregoing sentence shall no longer apply
under the Plan. Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims in Class 4 shall not be
required to file a Proof of Claim with the Bankruptcy Court. Holders of Allowed General
Unsecured Claims in Class 4 (including Cure Claims) shall not be subject to any claims
resolution process in Bankruptcy Court in connection with their Claims, and shall retain all
their rights under applicable nonbankruptcy law to pursue their Allowed General
Unsecured Claims in Class 4 against the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors in any forum
with jurisdiction over the parties. The Debtors and Reorganized Debtors shall retain all
defenses, counterclaims, rights to setoff, and rights to recoupment as to Allowed General
Unsecured Claims in Class 4. If the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the
Reorganized Debtors dispute any Allowed General
22
Unsecured Claims in Class 4, such dispute shall be determined, resolved or adjudicated in
the manner as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any holder of a Claim who files a Proof of Claim shall be subject to the Article VII
of the Plan unless and until such holder withdraws such Proof of Claim, and nothing
herein limits the retained jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court under Article XI of the Plan.
(d) Voting: Class 4 is Unimpaired. Therefore, holders of Class 4 General Unsecured Claims
are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.
5. Class 5 – Intercompany Claims (Subclasses 5a-5o).
(a) Classification: Class 5 consists of Intercompany Claims.
(b) Treatment: In full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of, and in
exchange for, each Allowed Intercompany Claim, on the Effective Date, each
Intercompany Claim shall be Reinstated. On and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized
Debtors and the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries will be permitted to transfer funds between and
among themselves as they determine to be necessary or appropriate to enable the
Reorganized Debtors to satisfy their obligations under the Plan. Except as set forth herein,
any changes to intercompany account balances resulting from such transfers will be
accounted for and settled in accordance with the Debtors’ and the Non-Debtor
Subsidiaries’ historical intercompany account settlement practices.
(c) Voting: Class 5 is Unimpaired. Holders of Class 5 Intercompany Claims are
conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 5 Intercompany Claims are not entitled to
vote to accept or reject the Plan.
6. Class 6 – Intercompany Interests (Subclasses 6a-6o).
(a) Classification: Class 6 consists of Intercompany Interests.
(b) Treatment: On the Effective Date, Intercompany Interests shall be Reinstated.
(c) Voting: Class 6 is Unimpaired. Holders of Class 6 Intercompany Interests are
conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, holders of Class 6 Intercompany Interests are not entitled to
vote to accept or reject the Plan.
7. Class 7 – HERO Equity Interests (Subclasses 7a-7o).
(a) Classification: Class 7 consists of HERO Equity Interests.
(b) Treatment: On the Effective Date, HERO Equity Interests shall be cancelled and
discharged and shall be of no further force or effect, whether surrendered for cancellation
or otherwise, and holders of HERO Equity Interests shall not receive or retain any property
under the Plan on account of such HERO Equity Interests. Notwithstanding the
23
foregoing, on or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, holders of HERO Equity
Interests shall receive, in exchange for the surrender or cancellation of their HERO Equity
Interests and for the releases by such holders of the Released Parties, their Pro Rata
share of (1) the Shareholder Equity Distribution and (2) the New HERO Warrants; provided,
however, that any holder of a HERO Equity Interest that opts not to grant the voluntary
releases contained in Article VII.F of the Plan shall not be entitled to receive its Pro Rata
share of the Shareholder Equity Distribution and the New HERO Warrants and shall not
receive any consideration in exchange for the surrender or cancellation of its HERO
Equity Interests or any distribution whatsoever under the Plan; and provided, further, that,
notwithstanding Article VIII.B.8, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) may
provide any holder of a HERO Equity Interest that would otherwise be entitled to receive a
distribution of less than one (1) share of the New HERO Common Stock under this Article
III.D.7.(b) with a distribution of one (1) share of New HERO Common Stock.
(c) Voting: Class 7 is Impaired. Holders of Class 7 Equity Interests are conclusively
presumed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Therefore, holders of Class 7 HERO Equity Interests are not entitled to vote to accept or
reject the Plan.
E. Special Provision Regarding Unimpaired and Reinstated Claims.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, nothing herein shall be deemed to
affect, diminish, or impair the Debtors’ or the Reorganized Debtors’ rights and defenses,
both legal and equitable, with respect to any Reinstated Claim or Unimpaired Claim,
including, but not limited to, legal and equitable defenses to setoffs or recoupment against
Reinstated Claims or Unimpaired Claims. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Plan, nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver or relinquishment of any Claim, Cause
of Action, right of setoff, or other legal or equitable defense which the Debtors had
immediately prior to the Petition Date against, or with respect to, any Claim left Unimpaired
by this Plan. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, the Reorganized
Debtors shall have, retain, reserve, and be entitled to assert, all such Claims, Causes of
Action, rights of setoff, and other legal or equitable defenses which they had immediately
prior to the Petition Date fully as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced, and all
of the Debtors’ legal and equitable rights with respect to any Reinstated Claim or Claim left
Unimpaired by this Plan may be asserted by the Reorganized Debtors after the
Confirmation Date and the Effective Date to the same extent as if the Chapter 11 Cases
had not been commenced.
F. Voting of Claims.
Each holder of an Allowed Claim as of the Voting Deadline in an Impaired Class of Claims
that is not (a) deemed to have rejected the Plan or (b) conclusively presumed to have
accepted the Plan, and that held such Claim as of the Voting Record Date, shall be entitled
to vote to accept or reject the Plan. The instructions for completion of the Ballots are set
forth in the instructions accompanying each Ballot. The Debtors will seek approval of the
Solicitation Procedures in the Plan Scheduling Motion. The Solicitation Procedures are
described in the Disclosure Statement.
G. Nonconsensual Confirmation.
24
The Debtors intend to request confirmation of the Plan under section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code with respect to any Impaired Class that has not accepted or is deemed
to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, including
Class 7 (HERO Equity Interests).
ARTICLE IV.
MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN
A. Operations Between the Confirmation Date and Effective Date
During the period from the Confirmation Date through and until the Effective Date, the
Debtors may continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession, subject to all
applicable orders of the Bankruptcy Court and any limitations set forth in the
Restructuring Support Agreement.
B. First Lien Exit Facility.
On or before the Effective Date, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) shall
be authorized, without the need for any further corporate action or without any further
action by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, to enter into the First
Lien Exit Facility Credit Agreement, the First Lien Exit Facility Documents and any
ancillary documents necessary or appropriate to satisfy the conditions to effectiveness of
the First Lien Exit Facility. The proceeds of the First Lien Exit Facility shall be used to
(i) pay the final installment and related expenses, costs and charges in the approximate
amount of $200 million related to the construction and purchase of the Highlander, (ii) pay
the Restructuring Expenses and (iii) provide the Reorganized Debtors and the Non-Debtor
Subsidiaries with working capital for their post-Effective Date operations and for other
general corporate purposes. The First Lien Exit Facility shall be Secured by first priority
security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Reorganized Debtors and the
Non-Debtor Subsidiaries that are guarantors under the First Lien Exit Facility, including
without limitation, the Highlander and all contracts related to the Highlander.
Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors and certain of the Steering Group Members entered
into the First Lien Exit Facility Commitment Letter, pursuant to which such Steering Group
Members agreed to provide backstop commitments for the First Lien Exit Facility. As set
forth in Article III.D.3, each holder of an Allowed Senior Notes Claim that is an Eligible
Noteholder shall have the opportunity to participate, on a Pro Rata basis, in the First Lien
Exit Facility in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the First Lien Exit
Facility Subscription Procedures during the period from the Petition Date through the date
of Confirmation Hearing. The opportunity to participate in the First Lien Exit Facility does
not constitute a distribution to the holders of Allowed Senior Notes Claims on account of
their Claims.
25
C.
Issuance of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants.
1. Issuance of Securities. Shares of New HERO Common Stock shall be authorized under
the New HERO Charter, and shares of New HERO Common Stock shall be issued on the
Effective Date and distributed as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with the
Plan. The number of shares of New HERO Common Stock to be distributed as set forth in
this Plan, and the number of shares of New HERO Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of New HERO Warrants and the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity and
corresponding strike prices, are subject to adjustment by the Debtors (with the consent of
the Steering Group) in a manner that does not alter the respective percentages of the
outstanding New HERO Common Stock allocated to any Class or Claim holder, except for
immaterial changes resulting from the treatment of fractional shares; provided that the
New HERO Common Stock, as of the Effective Date, shall be subject to dilution from the
New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity. All of the New HERO Common Stock,
issuable in accordance with the Plan, when so issued, shall be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, and non-assessable. The issuance, with the consent of the Steering
Group, of the New HERO Common Stock, the New HERO Warrants, the New HERO

pursuant to the exercise of New HERO Warrants and the New HERO Management
Incentive Program Equity, is authorized without the need for any further corporate action
and without any further action by any holder of a Claim or Equity Interest.
Except as provided below, the New HERO Common Stock distributed under the Plan will
be issued in book-entry form through the direct registry system of the transfer agent and
DTC. The ownership interest of each holder of such New HERO Common Stock, and
transfers of ownership interests therein, will be recorded on the records of the transfer
agent and the direct and indirect participants in DTC. To receive distributions of New
HERO Common Stock through DTC, holders of Senior Notes Claims will be required to
designate a direct or indirect participant in DTC with whom such holder has an account
into which such New HERO Common Stock may be deposited. The New HERO Common
Stock issuable to holders of HERO Equity Interests will, with respect to HERO Equity
Interests held through DTC, be delivered by the Reorganized HERO to the holders of
HERO Equity Interests through DTC (via Mandatory Exchange if applicable), and holders
that do not hold their HERO Equity Interests in DTC may to designate a direct or indirect
participant in DTC with whom such holder has an account into which such New HERO
Common Stock may be deposited or have their shares issued in book-entry form on the
register of the transfer agent.
2. Exemption from Registration. The offering of the New HERO Common Stock under
Article III of the Plan shall be exempt from the registration requirements of section 5 of the
Securities Act and other applicable law under section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or
another available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The issuance and
distribution of the New HERO Common Stock and the New HERO Warrants under Article III
of the Plan, and the New HERO Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the New HERO
Warrants shall be exempt from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities
Act and any other applicable law requiring registration of an offer or sale of securities
under section 1145(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The New HERO Common Stock underlying
the Management Incentive Program will be issued pursuant to a registration statement or
another available exemption from registration under the Securities Act and other
applicable law.
26
The issuance of the New HERO Equity Interests to the holders of Senior Notes Claims and
the issuance of the New HERO Equity Interests and the New HERO Warrants to the
holders of HERO Equity Interests shall be exempt from the requirements of section 16(b)
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
thereunder) with respect to any acquisition of such securities by an officer or director (or a
director by deputization for purposes thereof) as of the Effective Date.
3. SEC Reporting Requirements and Listing of New HERO Common Stock. As of the
Effective Date, Reorganized HERO will be a reporting company under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of July 13, 2015, HERO common stock was listed
for trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”). In March 2015, HERO
received a letter from NASDAQ informing HERO that its common stock was below the
minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ. Reorganized HERO will
use reasonable efforts to cause the listing on NASDAQ of the New HERO Common Stock
on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date.
D. The New HERO Warrants.
1. Issuance. The New HERO Warrants will be issued pursuant to the terms of the New
HERO Warrant Agreement. Each New HERO Warrant will, subject to the anti-dilution
adjustments described below and in the New HERO Warrant Agreement, be exercisable
for one (1) share of New HERO Common Stock.
2. Anti-Dilution Protection. The New HERO Warrant Agreement shall contain provisions for
the adjustment of the exercise price and shares of New Common Stock issuable upon
exercise following certain organic dilutive events such as splits, combinations, stock
dividends or other similar organic dilutive events involving the New HERO Common
Stock. There shall be no anti-dilution adjustment for the New HERO Warrants upon the
post-Effective Date issuance of New HERO Common Stock at a value below the exercise
price for the New HERO Warrants. The New HERO Warrants, as of the Effective Date, shall
be subject to dilution from the New HERO Management Incentive Program Equity.
3. Form. Except as provided below, all New HERO Warrants distributed under the Plan will
be issued in book-entry form through the direct registry system of the warrant agent and
DTC. The warrant agent will be the transfer agent for the New HERO Common Stock. The
ownership interest of each holder of such New HERO Warrants, and transfers of
ownership interests therein, will be recorded on the records of the warrant agent and the
direct and indirect participants in DTC. Holders of HERO Equity Interests that hold such
HERO Equity Interests in DTC will receive their New HERO Warrants by deposit to the
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC in which such HERO Equity Interests are
held. Holders that do not hold their HERO Equity Interests in DTC may designate a direct
or indirect participant in DTC with whom such holder has an account into which such New
HERO Warrants may be deposited or have their Warrants issued in book-entry form on the
register of the warrant agent for the New HERO Warrants. Beneficial owners of the New
HERO Warrants will be required to follow the procedures that DTC or its direct or indirect
participants, or the warrant agent for the New HERO Warrants, as applicable, may
establish for exercising their rights in respect of the New HERO Warrants, including
exercise and transfer thereof. New HERO Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
New HERO Warrants will be issued in book-entry form and held through DTC or the
warrant agent for the New Hero Warrants, as applicable.
27
E. Cancellation of Certain Indebtedness, Agreements, and Existing Securities.
On the Effective Date, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan, the
obligations of the Debtors under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Senior Notes,
the Guarantees, the Senior Notes Indentures and any other certificate, share, note, bond,
indenture, purchase right, option, warrant, or other instrument or document directly or
indirectly evidencing or creating any indebtedness or obligation of or ownership interest
in any of the Debtors giving rise to any Claim or Equity Interest (except such certificates,
notes, or other instruments or documents evidencing indebtedness or obligations of any
Debtors that are specifically reinstated pursuant to the Plan), shall be cancelled as to any
such Debtors, and the Reorganized Debtors shall not have any continuing obligations
thereunder; and the obligations of any of the Debtors pursuant, relating, or pertaining to
any agreements, indentures, certificates of designation, by-laws, or certificate or articles of
incorporation or similar documents governing the Restructuring Support Agreement, the
Senior Notes, the Guarantees, the Senior Notes Indentures and any other shares,
certificates, notes, bonds, purchase rights, options, warrants, or other instruments or
documents evidencing or creating any indebtedness or obligation of any of the Debtors
(except such agreements, certificates, notes, or other instruments evidencing
indebtedness or obligations of any Debtors that are specifically reinstated pursuant to the
Plan or assumed by any such Debtors) shall be released and discharged; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the occurrence of the Confirmation Date or the Effective
Date, any such indenture or agreement that governs the rights of the holder of a Claim
shall continue in effect solely for purposes of (a) allowing holders of such Claims to
receive distributions under the Plan as provided herein, (b) allowing the Senior Notes
Indenture Trustees to make distributions under the Plan as provided herein, and deduct
therefrom such reasonable compensation, fees, and expenses due thereunder or incurred
in making such distributions, to the extent not paid by the Debtors and authorized under
such agreement, and (c) allowing the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees to seek
compensation and/or reimbursement of fees and expenses in accordance with the terms
of the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section shall affect the discharge of
or result in any obligation, liability, or expense of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors,
or affect the discharge of Claims or Equity Interests pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the
Confirmation Order, or the Plan, or result in any additional obligation, expense, or liability
of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors. On and after the Effective Date, all duties and
responsibilities of the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees shall be discharged except to the
extent required to effectuate the Plan.
F. Claims Against Non-Debtor Subsidiaries.
Any claim (as such term is defined in section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code), Cause of
Action, or remedy asserted against any Non-Debtor Subsidiary by any Debtor will be
reinstated, adjusted (including by contribution, distribution in exchange for new debt or
equity, or otherwise), paid, continued, cancelled, or discharged to the extent determined
appropriate by the Reorganized Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group). Any
such transaction, with the consent of the Steering Group, may be effectuated on the
Effective Date or subsequent to the Effective Date without any further action by the Court
or by the stockholders of the Reorganized Debtors.
G.
Intercompany Interests.
28
The Intercompany Interests shall be retained and the legal, equitable, and contractual
rights to which the holder of such Intercompany Interest is entitled shall remain unaltered.
H. Continued Corporate Existence and Vesting of Assets.
Except as otherwise provided herein: (i) each Debtor will, as a Reorganized Debtor,
continue to exist after the Effective Date as a separate legal entity, with all of the powers of
such a legal entity under applicable law and without prejudice to any right to alter or
terminate such existence (whether by merger, dissolution or otherwise) under applicable
law; and (ii) on the Effective Date, all property of each Debtor’s Estate, and any property
acquired by each Debtor or Reorganized Debtor under the Plan, will vest in such
Reorganized Debtor free and clear of all Claims, Liens, charges, other encumbrances,
Equity Interests, and other interests, except for the Liens and Claims established under
the Plan (including in respect of the First Lien Exit Facility).
On and after the Effective Date, each Reorganized Debtor may operate its business and
may use, acquire, and dispose of property and compromise or settle any claims without
supervision or approval by the Court and free of any restrictions of the Bankruptcy Code
or Bankruptcy Rules, subject only to those restrictions expressly imposed by the Plan or
the Confirmation Order as well as the documents and instruments executed and delivered
in connection therewith, including the documents, exhibits, instruments, and other
materials comprising the Plan Supplement. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Reorganized Debtors may pay the charges that they incur from and after the Effective Date
for Fee Claims, disbursements, expenses, or related support services (including fees
relating to the preparation of Professional fee applications) without application to, or the
approval of, the Court.

reasonable fees, expenses, costs, and other charges of the Steering Group’s

On the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall pay all reasonable and documented
fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel)
incurred by the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees through and including the Effective Date
to the extent required by the Senior Notes Indentures. For the avoidance of doubt, any
such fees and expenses of the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees shall not be treated under
this Plan as General Unsecured Claims and shall not be subject to avoidance, objection,
challenge, deduction, subordination, recharacterization or offset. The Senior Notes
Indenture Trustees shall not be required to file any application under sections 330 or 331
of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise with regard to the allowance of their fees and
expenses.
K. Waiver of Avoidance Actions.
To the extent not already otherwise waived pursuant to another order of the Bankruptcy
Court, effective as of the Effective Date, the Debtors shall be deemed to have waived the
right to prosecute, and to have settled and released for fair value, any avoidance or
recovery actions under sections 545, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, and 553 of the Bankruptcy
Code or other applicable law that belong to the Debtors on account of paying or having
paid all General Unsecured Claims in full pursuant to an Order of the Court or this Plan.
L. Preservation of Causes of Action.
In accordance with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as expressly
provided herein (including Articles IV.L and VII), the Reorganized Debtors shall retain all
Causes of Action. Nothing contained in this Plan or the Confirmation Order shall be
deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any claim, Cause of Action, right of setoff, or other
legal or equitable defense of any Debtor that is not specifically waived or relinquished by
this Plan. The Reorganized Debtors shall have, retain, reserve, and be entitled to assert, all
such claims, Causes of Action, rights of setoff, and other legal or equitable defenses that
any Debtor had immediately before the Petition Date as fully as if the Chapter 11 Cases
had not been commenced, and all of the Reorganized Debtors’ legal and equitable rights
respecting any claim that is not specifically waived or relinquished by this Plan may be
asserted after the Effective Date to the same extent as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not
been commenced. No Person may rely on the absence of a specific reference in the Plan
or the Disclosure Statement to any Cause of Action against them as any indication that the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, will not pursue any and all available
Causes of Action against such Person. The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as
applicable, expressly reserve all rights to prosecute any and all Causes of Action against
any Person, in accordance with the Plan. From and after the Effective Date, the
Reorganized Debtors shall have the exclusive right, authority, and discretion to determine
and to initiate, file, prosecute, enforce, abandon, settle, compromise, release, withdraw, or
litigate to judgment any Cause of Action and to decline to do any of the foregoing without
further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Court. The Reorganized Debtors are
deemed representatives of the Estates for the purpose of prosecuting any Claim or Cause
of Action and any objections to Claims pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1123(b)(3)(B).
M. Claims Incurred After the Effective Date.
30
Claims incurred by the Debtors after the Effective Date may be paid by the Reorganized
Debtors in the ordinary course of business and without application for or Court approval,
subject to any agreements with such holders of a Claim and applicable law.
N. Corporate Action.
Each of the matters provided for by the Plan involving the corporate structure of the
Debtors or corporate or related actions to be taken by or required of the Reorganized
Debtors, whether taken prior to or as of the Effective Date, shall be deemed authorized and
approved in all respects without the need for any further corporate action and without any
further action by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable; provided,
however, that any such matters or corporate or related actions taken by the Debtors shall
be subject to the consent of the Steering Group. Such actions may include: (a) the
adoption and filing of the New HERO Certificate of Incorporation, the New HERO Bylaws
and the amended articles of incorporation or certificates of formation for each of the
Reorganized Debtors (other than Reorganized HERO); (b) the authorization, issuance, and
distribution of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants; (c) the adoption or
assumption, as applicable, of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases; (d) adoption of

ARTICLE VII.
SETTLEMENT, RELEASE, INJUNCTION AND RELATED PROVISIONS
A. General Settlement of Claims and Interests.
Pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and in
consideration for the distributions and other benefits provided pursuant to the Plan, the
provisions of the Plan shall constitute a good faith compromise of all Claims, Equity
Interests and controversies relating to the contractual, legal, and subordination rights that
a Holder of a Claim may have with respect to any Allowed Claim, or any Distribution to be
made on account of such Allowed Claim.
Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of the Plan shall, upon consummation,
constitute a good faith compromise and settlement, pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019
and section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, among the Debtors and the Steering Group of
all disputes among the parties, including those arising from, or related to, (i) the Senior
Notes Claims and the Guarantee Claims and (ii) the Guarantees. In the event that, for any
reason, the Confirmation Order is not entered or the Effective Date does not occur, the
Debtors and the Steering Group reserve all of their respective rights with respect to any
and all disputes that would have been resolved and settled under the Plan had the
Effective Date occurred.
The entry of the Confirmation Order shall constitute the Court’s approval of each of the
compromises and settlements embodied in the Plan, and the Court’s findings shall
constitute its determination that such compromises and settlements are in the best
interests of the Debtors, their Estates, creditors, and other parties-in-interest, and are fair,
equitable, and within the range of reasonableness. The Plan and the Confirmation Order
shall have res judicata, collateral estoppel, and estoppel (judicial, equitable, or otherwise)
effect with respect to all matters provided for, or resolved pursuant to, the Plan and/or the
Confirmation Order, including, without limitation, the release, injunction, exculpation,
discharge, and compromise provisions contained in the Plan and/or the Confirmation
Order. The provisions of the Plan, including, without limitation, its release, injunction,
exculpation and compromise provisions, are mutually dependent and non-severable.
B. Subordination of Claims
34
The allowance, classification and treatment of all Allowed Claims and Equity Interests and
the respective Distributions and treatments under the Plan take into account and conform
to the relative priority and rights of the Claims and Equity Interests in each Class in
connection with any contractual, legal, and equitable subordination rights relating thereto.
However, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) reserve the right to
reclassify any Allowed Claim or Equity Interest in accordance with any contractual, legal or
equitable subordination relating thereto, unless otherwise provided in a settlement
agreement concerning such Allowed Claim.
C. Discharge of the Debtors.
Pursuant to section 1141(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as otherwise specifically
provided in the Plan or in any contract, instrument, or other agreement or document
created pursuant to the Plan: (a) the distributions, rights, and treatment that are provided
in the Plan shall be in complete satisfaction, discharge, and release of all Claims, Equity
Interests, and Causes of Action of any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued
on Claims or Equity Interests from and after the Petition Date, whether known or unknown,
against, liabilities of, Liens on, obligations of, rights against and Equity Interests in, the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or any of their assets, properties or Estates, regardless
of whether any property shall have been distributed or retained pursuant to the Plan on
account of such Claims, Equity Interests and Causes of Action, including demands,
liabilities and Causes of Action that arose before the Effective Date, any contingent or
non-contingent liability on account of representations or warranties issued on or before
the Effective Date; (b) the Plan shall bind all holders of Claims and Equity Interests,
notwithstanding whether any such holders failed to vote to accept or reject the Plan or
voted to reject the Plan; (c) all Claims and Equity Interests shall be satisfied, discharged
and released in full, and the Debtors’ liability with respect thereto, shall be extinguished
completely, including debts of the kind specified in sections 502(g), 502(h) or 502(i) of the
Bankruptcy Code, in each case whether or not: (i) a proof of Claim or Equity Interest based
upon such debt, right, or Equity Interest is filed or deemed filed pursuant to section 501 of
the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) a Claim or Equity Interest based upon such debt, right or Equity
Interest is Allowed; or (iii) the holder of such a Claim or Equity Interest has accepted the
Plan or is entitled to receive a distribution hereunder; and (d) all Entities shall be precluded
from ever asserting against the Debtors, the Debtors’ Estates, the Reorganized Debtors,
their successors and assigns, and their assets and properties any Claims and Equity
Interests based upon any documents, instruments, or any act or omission, transaction, or
other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Effective Date. Any default by
the Debtors with respect to any Claim or Equity Interest that existed immediately before or
on account of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed cured on the Effective
Date. The Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of the discharge of all
Claims and Equity Interests subject to the Effective Date occurring.
D. Release of Liens.
35
Except (a) with respect to the Liens securing the First Lien Exit Facility, to the extent set
forth in the First Lien Exit Facility Documents, and (b) as otherwise expressly provided in
the Plan, or in any contract, instrument, release, or other agreement or document created
pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date and concurrently with the applicable
distributions made pursuant to the Plan, all mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, and
other security interests against any property of the Debtors’ Estates shall be fully released
and discharged, and all of the right, title, and interest of any holder of such mortgages,
deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, and other security interests shall revert to the Reorganized
Debtors and each of their successors and assigns.
E. Releases by the Debtors.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, for good and valuable
consideration, including the service of the Released Parties to facilitate the reorganization
of the Debtors, the implementation of the restructuring contemplated by the Restructuring
Support Agreement and the Plan and the compromises contained herein, on and after the
Effective Date, the Released Parties are hereby released and discharged by the Debtors,
the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Reorganized Debtors and the Estates, including any
successor to the Debtors or any Estate representative from all claims, obligations, rights,
suits, damages, Causes of Action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including any
derivative claims asserted or assertable on behalf of a Debtor, whether known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, liquidated or unliquidated, contingent or fixed, existing
or hereafter arising, in law, at equity or otherwise, whether for indemnification, tort,
contract, violations of federal or state securities laws or otherwise, including, those that
any of the Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Reorganized Debtors or the Estates
would have been legally entitled to assert in their own right (whether individually or
collectively) or on behalf of the holder of any Claim or Equity Interest or any other Person,
based on or relating to, or in any manner arising from, in whole or in part, the Debtors and
their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Estates, the conduct of the businesses of the Debtors
and their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Chapter 11 Cases, the purchase, sale or rescission

Equity Interests prior to or during the Chapter 11 Cases, the negotiation, formulation or
preparation of the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Plan, the Plan Supplement, the

action or omission with respect to Intercompany Claims, any action or omission as an
officer, director, agent, representative, fiduciary, controlling person, affiliate or responsible
party, or any transaction entered into or affecting, a Non-Debtor Subsidiary, or upon any
other act or omission, transaction, agreement, event, or other occurrence taking place on
or before the Effective Date of the Plan, other than claims or liabilities arising out of or
relating to any act or omission of a Released Party to the extent such act or omission is
determined by a Final Order to have constituted willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad
faith, fraud or a criminal act.
36
F. Releases by Holders of Claims and Equity Interests.
Any holder of HERO Equity Interests that opts not to grant the releases contained in this
Article VII.F shall not receive the New HERO Equity Interests and New HERO Warrants that
it would otherwise be entitled to receive under Article III.D.7 of the Plan and will not receive
any distribution whatsoever under the Plan.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, for good and valuable
consideration, including the service of the Released Parties to facilitate the reorganization
of the Debtors, the implementation of the restructuring contemplated by the Restructuring
Support Agreement or the Plan, and the compromises contained herein, on and after the
Effective Date, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Releasing Parties
(regardless of whether a Releasing Party is a Released Party) shall be deemed to
conclusively, absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably and forever release, waive and
discharge the Released Parties of any and all claims, obligations, rights, suits, damages,
Causes of Action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including: any derivative claims
asserted or assertable on behalf of a Debtor or a Non-Debtor Subsidiary, whether known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, liquidated or unliquidated, contingent or fixed,
existing or hereafter arising, in law, at equity or otherwise, whether for indemnification, tort,
contract, violations of federal or state securities laws or otherwise, including, those that
any of the Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Reorganized Debtors or the Estates
would have been legally entitled to assert in their own right (whether individually or

their Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Estates, the conduct of the businesses of the Debtors

or before the Effective Date of the Plan, other than claims or liabilities arising out of or
relating to any act or omission of a Released Party to the extent such act or omission is
determined by a Final Order to have constituted willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad
faith, fraud or a criminal act.
Each Person providing releases under the Plan, including the Debtors, the Reorganized
Debtors, the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries, the Estates and the Releasing Parties, shall be
deemed to have granted the releases set forth in those sections notwithstanding that such
Person may hereafter discover facts in addition to, or different from, those which it now
knows or believes to be true, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or
37
existence of such different or additional facts, and such Person expressly waives any and
all rights that it may have under any statute or common law principle which would limit the
effect of such releases to those claims or causes of action actually known or suspected to
exist at the time of execution of such release.
G. Exculpation.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Exculpated Parties shall neither have nor incur any liability to any Entity for any
Restructuring-Related Action; provided that nothing in the foregoing “Exculpation” shall
exculpate any Entity from any liability resulting from any act or omission that is
determined by Final Order to have constituted fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence,
or criminal conduct; provided that each Exculpated Party shall be entitled to rely upon the
advice of counsel concerning his, her or its duties pursuant to, or in connection with, the
Plan or any other related document, instrument, or agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, as of the Effective Date, pursuant to
section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Solicitation Parties upon appropriate findings
of the Bankruptcy Court will be deemed to have solicited acceptance of the Plan in good
faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and to
have participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, in the offer, issuance, sale, or purchase of a security, offered or sold
under the Plan of a Reorganized Debtor, and shall not be liable to any Entity on account of
such solicitation or participation.
In addition to the protections afforded in this Article VII.G to the Exculpated Parties, and
not in any way reducing or limiting the application of such protections, the Bankruptcy
Court retains exclusive jurisdiction over any and all Causes of Action asserted against
any Debtor for any Restructuring-Related Action that are not otherwise exculpated or
enjoined by this Plan.

J. Preservation of Insurance.
The Debtors’ discharge, exculpation and release, and the exculpation and release in favor
of the Released Parties, as provided herein, shall not, except as necessary to be
consistent with this Plan, diminish or impair the enforceability of any insurance policy that

ARTICLE VIII.
DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE PLAN
A. Procedures for Treating Disputed Claims.
1. Filing Proofs of Claim. Holders of Claims need not file proofs of Claim with the Court. In
the event that a holder of a Claim elects to file a proof of Claim with the Court, it will be
deemed to have consented to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court for all purposes with
respect to the determination, liquidation, allowance, or disallowance of such Claim.
2. Disputed Claims. If the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) dispute any
Claim as to which no proof of Claim has been filed, such dispute shall be determined,
resolved, or adjudicated, as the case may be, in a manner as if the Chapter 11 Cases had
not been commenced, provided, however, that the Reorganized Debtors may elect, with
the consent of the Steering Group, to object under section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code to
any proof of Claim filed by or on behalf of a holder of a Claim.
39
3. Objections to Claims. Except insofar as a Claim is Allowed under the Plan, the Debtors
(with the consent of the Steering Group), the Reorganized Debtors, and any other party in
interest shall be entitled to object to Claims. Any objections to Claims other than General
Unsecured Claims shall be filed and served by the Claims Objection Deadline. Any Claims
other than General Unsecured Claims not objected to by the Claims Objection Deadline
shall be deemed Allowed unless such period is extended upon approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, or any other party with
standing shall be entitled to dispute and/or otherwise object to any General Unsecured
Claim in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law. If the Debtors, Reorganized
Debtors, or any other party with standing dispute any General Unsecured Claim, such
dispute shall be determined, resolved, or adjudicated, as the case may be, in the manner
as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced. In any action or proceeding to
determine the existence, validity, or amount of any General Unsecured Claim, any and all
claims or defenses that could have been asserted by the applicable Debtor(s) or the Entity
holding such General Unsecured Claim are preserved as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not
been commenced.
4. Disallowance of Claims. Except as provided herein or otherwise agreed, any and all
proofs of Claim shall be deemed expunged from the claims register on the Effective Date
without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Court and the Claim on
which such proof of Claim was filed shall be determined, resolved, or adjudicated, as the
case may be, in the manner as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced and shall
survive the Effective Date as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced.
B. Allowed Claims and Equity Interests.
1. Delivery of Distributions in General. Except as otherwise provided herein, distributions
under the Plan shall be made by the Reorganized Debtors (or their agent or designee) to
the holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests in all Classes for which a
distribution is provided in this Plan at the addresses set forth on the Schedules (if filed) or
in the Debtors’ books and records, as applicable, unless such addresses are superseded
by proofs of Claim or Equity Interests or transfers of Claim filed pursuant to Bankruptcy
Rule 3001 by the Record Date (or at the last known addresses of such holders if the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors have been notified in writing of a change of address).
2. Delivery of Distributions to Holders of Senior Notes Claims. Each Senior Notes
Indenture Trustee may, at the discretion of the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering
Group), be deemed to be the holder of all applicable Senior Notes Claims for purposes of
distributions to be made hereunder, and all distributions on account of each Senior Notes
Claim may be, at the discretion of the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group),
made to the applicable Senior Notes Indenture Trustee. If such distributions are made to
the applicable Senior Notes Indenture Trustee, as soon as practicable following
compliance with the requirements set forth in Article VIII of the Plan, the Senior Notes
Indenture Trustees shall
40
arrange to deliver or direct the delivery of such distributions to or on behalf of the holders
of Allowed Senior Notes Claims in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Indentures and the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, and without
limiting the exculpation and release provisions of the Plan, the Senior Notes Indenture
Trustees shall not have any liability to any person with respect to distributions made or
directed to be made by the Senior Notes Indenture Trustees.
3. Distribution of Cash. Any payment of Cash by the Reorganized Debtors pursuant to the
Plan shall be made at the option and in the sole discretion of the Reorganized Debtors by
(i) a check drawn on, or (ii) wire transfer from, a domestic bank selected by the
Reorganized Debtors.
4. Unclaimed Distributions of Cash. Any distribution of Cash under the Plan that is
unclaimed after six (6) months after it has been delivered (or attempted to be delivered)
shall, pursuant to section 347(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, become the property of the
Reorganized Debtors notwithstanding any state or other escheat or similar laws to the
contrary, and the entitlement by the holder of such unclaimed Allowed Claim or Allowed
Equity Interest to such distribution or any subsequent distribution on account of such
Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest shall be extinguished and forever barred.
5. Distributions of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants. On or about the
Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors (or their agent or designee) shall distribute (i) the
Senior Notes Equity Distribution to the holders of the Senior Notes Claims, (ii) the
Shareholder Equity Distribution to the holders of Allowed HERO Equity Interests, and
(iii) the New HERO Warrants to the holders of Allowed HERO Equity Interests.
6. Unclaimed Distributions of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants. Any
distribution of New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants under the Plan that is
unclaimed after six (6) months after it has been delivered (or attempted to be delivered)
shall be retained by the Reorganized Debtors, notwithstanding any state or other escheat
or similar laws to the contrary, and the entitlement by the holder of such Allowed Claim or
Allowed Equity Interest to such distribution or any subsequent distribution on account of
such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest shall be extinguished and forever barred.
7. Saturdays, Sundays, or Legal Holidays. If any payment, distribution or act under the
Plan is required to be made or performed on a date that is not a Business Day, then the
making of such payment or the performance of such act may be completed on the next
succeeding Business Day, and shall be deemed to have been completed as of the
required date.
8. Fractional New HERO Common Stock and New HERO Warrants and De Minimis
Distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, no
fractional shares of New HERO Common Stock or fractional New HERO Warrants shall be
issued or distributed pursuant to the Plan. Whenever any distribution of a fraction of a
share of New HERO Common Stock or a fractional New HERO Warrant would otherwise be
required under the Plan, the actual distribution made shall reflect a rounding of such
fraction to the nearest whole share or warrant (up or down), with half shares or warrants or
less being rounded down and fractions in excess of a half of a share or warrant being
rounded up. No consideration
41
will be provided in lieu of fractional shares that are rounded down. Fractional shares of
New HERO Common Stock or New HERO Warrants, as applicable, that are not distributed
in accordance with this Article VII.B.8 shall be cancelled. The Reorganized Debtors shall
not be required to, but may in their sole and absolute discretion, make any payment on
account of any Claim or Equity Interest in the event that the costs of making such payment
exceeds the amount of such payment.
9. Distributions to Holders of Claims:
(a) Initial Distribution to Claims Allowed as of the Effective Date. On or as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, or as otherwise expressly set forth in the
Plan, the Reorganized Debtors (or their agent or designee) shall distribute Cash or
Collateral, as the case may be, to the holders of Allowed Claims as contemplated herein.
(b) Claims Allowed after the Effective Date. Each holder of a Claim that becomes an
Allowed Claim subsequent to the Effective Date shall receive the distribution to which
such holder of an Allowed Claim is entitled as set forth in Article III, and distributions to
such holder shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan. As soon as
practicable after the date that the Claim becomes an Allowed Claim, the Reorganized
Debtors shall provide to the holder of such Claim the distribution (if any) to which such
holder is entitled under this Plan as of the Effective Date, without any interest to be paid on
account of such Claim.
10. Special Rules for Distributions to Holders of Disputed Claims and Disputed Equity
Interests. Notwithstanding any provision otherwise in the Plan and except as otherwise
agreed to by the relevant parties, no partial payments and no partial distributions shall be
made with respect to a Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest until all such disputes
in connection with such Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest, respectively, have
been resolved by settlement or Final Order. In the event that there are Disputed Claims or
Disputed Equity Interests requiring adjudication and resolution, the Reorganized Debtors
shall establish appropriate reserves for potential payment of such Claims or Equity
Interests. For the avoidance of doubt, General Unsecured Claims are not subject to this
Article VIII.B.9. If the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest dispute
any General Unsecured Claim, such dispute shall be governed by Article VIII.A.3 hereof.
11. Interest on Claims and Equity Interests. Except as specifically provided for in the Plan,
no Claims or Equity Interests, Allowed or otherwise (including Administrative Claims),
shall be entitled, under any circumstances, to receive any interest on a Claim or Equity
Interests.
C. Allocation of Consideration.
The aggregate consideration to be distributed to the holders of Allowed Claims in each
Class under the Plan shall be treated as first satisfying an amount equal to the principal
amount of the Allowed Claim for such holders, and any remaining consideration as
satisfying accrued, but unpaid interest, as applicable.
D. Estimation.
42
Prior to or after the Effective Date, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or
the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, may (but are not required to), at any time, request
that the Court estimate (i) any Disputed Claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code or (ii) any contingent or unliquidated Claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code, for any reason, regardless of whether the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors has previously objected to such Claim or whether the Court has ruled on any
such objection. The Court will retain jurisdiction to estimate any Claim at any time,
including during proceedings concerning any objection to such Claim. In the event that
the Court estimates any Claim, such estimated amount shall constitute either (i) the
Allowed amount of such Claim, (ii) the amount on which a reserve is to be calculated for
purposes of any reserve requirement under the Plan or (iii) a maximum limitation on such
Claim, as determined by the Court. If the estimated amount constitutes the maximum
limitation on such Claim, the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the
Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, may elect to object to any ultimate allowance of
such Claim. All of the aforementioned objection, estimation, and resolution procedures are
cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one another.
E.
Insured Claims.
If any portion of an Allowed Claim is an Insured Claim, no distributions under the Plan
shall be made on account of such Allowed Claim until the holder of such Allowed Claim
has exhausted all remedies with respect to any applicable insurance policies. To the
extent that the Debtors’ insurers agree to satisfy a Claim in whole or in part, then
immediately upon such agreement, the portion of such Claim so satisfied may be
expunged without an objection to such Claim having to be filed and without any further
notice to or action, order or approval of the Court.
ARTICLE IX.
RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

Date, on and after the Effective Date, the Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over all

of Claims or Equity Interests;
(vi) to enter and implement such orders as may be appropriate in the event the

(xiv) to hear and determine any Causes of Action preserved under the Plan;

exculpation provided under the Plan, and (ii) enter such orders as may be necessary or
appropriate to implement such discharge, releases, injunctions, exculpations, and other
provisions;
(xvii) to enter a final decree closing the Chapter 11 Cases;
44
(xviii) to issue injunctions, enter and implement other orders, or take such other actions as
may be necessary or appropriate to restrain interference by any entity with consummation
or enforcement of the Plan;
(xix) to adjudicate any and all disputes arising from or relating to distributions under the

(xx) to adjudicate any and all disputes arising from or relating to the First Lien Exit Facility

Date: (i) the First Lien Exit Facility Credit Agreement, (ii) the First Lien Exit Facility

organizational documents for any of the Reorganized Debtors (other than Reorganized
Hero), (vi) the New HERO Warrant Agreement and (v) the New HERO Management
Incentive Program Agreements.
ARTICLE X.
EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES
A. Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.
Each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease shall be deemed assumed, without the
need for any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, as of
the Effective Date under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The assumption of
Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases hereunder may include the assignment of
certain of such contracts to Debtors or Non-Debtor Subsidiaries. The Confirmation Order
will constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the above-described
assumptions and assignments pursuant to sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code
as of the Effective Date.
Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the Debtors, the Steering Group, and
the applicable counterparty, each assumed Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease shall
include all modifications, amendments, supplements, restatements, or other agreements
related thereto, and all rights related thereto, if any, including all easements, licenses,
permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options, rights of first refusal, and any other
interests. Modifications, amendments, supplements, and restatements to prepetition
Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases that have been executed by the Debtors
during the Chapter 11 Cases shall not be deemed to alter the prepetition nature of the
Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or the validity, priority, or amount of any Claims
that may arise in connection therewith.
B. Cure Claims.
45
At the election of the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized
Debtors, as applicable, any monetary defaults under each Executory Contract and
Unexpired Lease to be assumed under the Plan shall be satisfied pursuant to section
365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code in one of the following ways: (i) payment of the Cure
Claim in Cash on or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
(A) thirty (30) days after the determination of the Cure Claim, and (B) the Effective Date or
such other date as may be set by the Court; or (ii) on such other terms as agreed to by the
Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors and the non-
Debtor counterparty to such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease.
In the event of a dispute pertaining to assumption or assignment, the Cure Claim
payments required by section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be made following
the entry of a Final Order or orders resolving the dispute and approving the assumption.
No later than the Plan Supplement Filing Date, to the extent not previously filed with the
Court and served on affected counterparties, the Debtors shall provide for notices (in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group) of proposed assumption
and proposed cure amounts to be sent to applicable contract and lease counterparties,
together with procedures for objecting thereto and resolution of disputes by the Court (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group). Any objection by a
contract or lease counterparty to a proposed assumption or related cure amount must be
filed, served, and actually received by the Debtors and counsel to the Steering Group by
the date on which objections to Confirmation are due (or such other date as may be
provided in the applicable assumption notice). Any counterparty to an Executory Contract
or Unexpired Lease that fails to object timely to the proposed assumption or cure amount
will be deemed to have assented to such assumption or cure amount.
The only adequate assurance of future performance shall be the promise of the
Reorganized Debtors to perform all obligations under any executory contract or unexpired
lease under this Plan.
ASSUMPTION OF ANY EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR UNEXPIRED LEASE PURSUANT TO
THE PLAN OR OTHERWISE SHALL RESULT IN THE FULL RELEASE AND
SATISFACTION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DEFAULTS, WHETHER MONETARY OR
NONMONETARY, INCLUDING DEFAULTS OF PROVISIONS RESTRICTING THE CHANGE
IN CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP INTEREST COMPOSITION OR OTHER BANKRUPTCY-
RELATED DEFAULTS, ARISING UNDER ANY ASSUMED EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR
UNEXPIRED LEASE AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE DATE ANY OF THE DEBTORS OR THE
REORGANIZED DEBTORS ASSUMES SUCH EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR UNEXPIRED
LEASE. ANY PROOFS OF CLAIM FILED WITH RESPECT TO AN EXECUTORY
CONTRACT OR UNEXPIRED LEASE THAT HAS BEEN ASSUMED SHALL BE DEEMED
DISALLOWED AND EXPUNGED, WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE TO OR ACTION, ORDER
OR APPROVAL OF THE COURT.
46
Obligations arising under insurance policies assumed by any of the Debtors before the
Effective Date shall be adequately protected in accordance with any order authorizing
such assumption.
C. Reservation of Rights.
Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute an admission by the Debtors that any such
contract or lease is in fact an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or that any
Reorganized Debtor has any liability thereunder. If there is a dispute regarding whether a
contract or lease is or was executory or unexpired at the time of assumption, the Debtors
(with the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall
have 45 days following entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute to alter their treatment
of such contract or lease., in which case the deemed assumptions and rejections provided
for in the Plan shall not apply to such contract or lease.
D. Assignment.
Any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to be held by any of the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors and assumed hereunder or otherwise in the Chapter 11 Cases, if not
expressly assigned to a third party previously in the Chapter 11 Cases, will be deemed
assigned to the applicable Reorganized Debtor pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code. If an objection to a proposed assumption, assumption and assignment, or Cure
Claim is not resolved in favor of the Debtors before the Effective Date, the applicable
Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease may be designated by the Debtors (with the
consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors for rejection within five
(5) Business Days of the entry of the order of the Court resolving the matter against the
Debtors. Such rejection shall be deemed effective as of the Effective Date.
E.
Insurance Policies.
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all of the Debtors’ insurance policies
and any agreements, documents or instruments relating thereto, are treated as and
deemed to be Executory Contracts under the Plan. On the Effective Date, the Debtors shall
be deemed to have assumed all insurance policies and any agreements, documents, and
instruments related thereto.
F. Post-Petition Contracts and Leases.
All contracts, agreements, and leases that were entered into by one or more of the Debtors
or assumed by any of the Debtors after the Petition Date shall be deemed assigned by the
applicable Debtor(s) to the applicable Reorganized Debtor(s) on the Effective Date.
47

submitted by the Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group) to the Court: (i) the
Confirmation Order may be vacated, (ii) no distributions under the Plan shall be made;
(iii) the Debtors and all holders of Claims and Equity Interests shall be restored to the
status quo ante as of the day immediately preceding the Confirmation Date as though the
Confirmation Date had never occurred; and (iv) the Debtors’ obligations with respect to

shall constitute or be deemed a waiver, release, or discharge of any Claims or Equity
Interests by or against the Debtors or any other person or to prejudice in any manner the
rights of the Debtors or any person in any further proceedings involving the Debtors
unless extended by Court order.
D. Vacatur of Confirmation Order.

Equity Interests; (ii) prejudice in any manner the rights of the holder of any Claim,
Guarantee Claim, or Equity Interest; (iii) prejudice in any manner any right, remedy, or
claim of the Debtors or the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries; or (iv) be deemed an admission
against interest by the Debtors or the Non-Debtor Subsidiaries.
E. Modification of the Plan.
Subject to the limitations contained in the Plan, and subject to the terms of the
Restructuring Support Agreement, (i) the Debtors reserve the right (with the consent of the
Steering Group), in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules, to
amend or modify the Plan prior to the entry of the Confirmation Order, including
amendments or modifications to satisfy section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and
(ii) after entry of the Confirmation Order, with the consent of the Steering Group, the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, may, upon order of the Court,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confirmation Order shall authorize the Debtors (with
the consent of the Steering Group) or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, to
make appropriate technical adjustments, remedy any defect or omission, or reconcile any
inconsistencies in the Plan, the documents included in the
49
Plan Supplement, any and all exhibits to the Plan, and/or the Confirmation Order, as may
be necessary to carry out the purposes and effects of the Plan, provided, however, that
such action does not materially and adversely affect the treatment of holders of Allowed
Claims or Equity Interests pursuant to the Plan.
F. Revocation, Withdrawal, or Non-Consummation.
1. Right to Revoke or Withdraw. The Debtors (with the consent of the Steering Group)
reserve the right to revoke or withdraw the Plan at any time before the Effective Date;
provided, however, that this provision shall have no impact on the rights of the Steering
Group, as set forth in the Restructuring Support Agreement, in respect of any such
revocation or withdrawal.
2. Effect of Withdrawal, Revocation, or Non-Consummation. If the Debtors revoke or

of Claims or Equity Interests), the assumption or rejection of Executory Contracts,
Unexpired Leases or benefit plans effected by the Plan, any release, exculpation, or
indemnification provided for in the Plan, and any document or agreement executed
pursuant to the Plan shall be null and void. In such event, nothing contained herein, and
no acts taken in preparation for consummation of the Plan shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver or release of any Claims by or against or Equity Interests in the Debtors or any
other Person, to prejudice in any manner the rights of the Debtors or any Person in any
further proceedings involving the Debtors, or to constitute an admission of any sort by the
Debtors or any other Person.

8. Additional Representations and Warranties by the Steering Group Members. Each

that:
a.
Holdings by Steering Group. As of the date hereof, with respect to the Senior
Note claims held by such Steering Group Member as set forth on Schedule 2
hereto, such Steering Group Member (A) either (i) is the sole beneficial
owner of the principal amount of such Senior Note claims, or (ii) has sole
investment or voting discretion with respect to the principal amount of such
Senior Note claims as set forth herein and has the power and authority to
bind the beneficial owners of such Senior Note claims to the terms of the

exchange, assign, and transfer such Senior Note claims, including the power
and authority to execute and deliver the RSA and to perform its obligations
thereunder in each case, subject to any ordinary course financing
arrangements a Steering Group Member may have with respect to such
Senior Note claims.
b.
No Transfers. As of the date hereof, with respect to the Senior Note claims
held by such Steering Group Member as set forth on Schedule 2 hereto,

8
and has not entered into any other agreement to assign, sell, use,
participate, grant, convey, pledge, or otherwise transfer, in whole in or part,
any portion of its right, title, or interests in any such Senior Note claims that
are subject to the RSA that conflict with the representations and warranties
of such Steering Group Member therein or would render such Steering
Group Member otherwise unable to comply with the RSA and perform its
obligations thereunder (other than pledges, transfers or security interests that
such Steering Group Member may have created (y) in favor of a prime broker
under and in accordance with its prime brokerage agreement with such
prime broker or (z) in favor of a financing counterparty under in accordance
with any ordinary course financing arrangements).
c.
Sufficiency of Information Received. Such Steering Group Member has
reviewed, or has had the opportunity to review, with the assistance of
professional and legal advisors of its choosing, all information it deems
necessary and appropriate for such Steering Group Member to evaluate the
financial risks inherent in the Restructuring and accept the terms of the Plan
as set forth in the Term Sheet.
9. Transfer Restrictions. No Steering Group Member shall (i) sell, use, pledge, assign,
transfer, permit the participation in, or otherwise dispose of any ownership (including any
beneficial ownership) in the Senior Notes set forth on Schedule 2 hereto in whole or in part
(other than pledges, transfers or security interests that such Steering Group Member may
have created (y) in favor of a prime broker under and in accordance with its prime
brokerage agreement with such prime broker or (z) in favor of a financing counterparty
under in accordance with any ordinary course financing arrangements); or (ii) grant any
proxies, deposit any of such Steering Group Member’s interests in a Senior Note set forth
on Schedule 2 hereto into a voting trust, or enter into a voting agreement with respect to
any such interest (collectively, the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii), a “Transfer”),
unless it satisfies the following requirement (a transferee that satisfies such requirements,
a “Permitted Transferee,” and such Transfer, a “Permitted Transfer”): The intended
transferee executes and delivers to counsel to the Company and counsel to the Steering
Group on the terms set forth below an executed form of the transfer agreement in a form
attached to the RSA (a “Transfer Agreement”) before such Transfer is effective (it being
understood that any Transfer shall not be effective until notification of such Transfer and a
copy of the executed Transfer Agreement is received by counsel to the Company and
counsel to the Steering Group, in each case, on the terms set forth herein).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the foregoing provisions shall not
preclude any Steering Group Member from transferring Senior Notes and claims to
affiliates of such Steering Group Member (each, a “Creditor Affiliate”), which Creditor
Affiliate shall be automatically bound by the RSA upon the transfer of such Senior Notes
and claims, (ii) a Qualified Marketmaker1 that acquires any of the Senior Notes and claims
with the purpose and intent of acting as a Qualified Marketmaker for such Senior Notes
and claims, shall not be required to execute and deliver to counsel a Transfer Agreement
or otherwise agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this RSA if such
Qualified Marketmaker transfers such Claims (by purchase, sale, assignment,
participation, or otherwise) to a Steering Group Member or Permitted Transferee
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the requirement that such transferee execute a
Transfer Agreement) and the transfer otherwise is a Permitted Transfer, and (iii) to the
extent any Party, who has signed the RSA, is acting in its capacity as a Qualified
Marketmaker, it may Transfer any ownership interests in the Senior Notes that it acquires
from a holder that has not signed the RSA to a transferee that has not signed the RSA at
the time of such Transfer without the requirement that such transferee be or become a
signatory to the RSA.
1 As used herein, the term “Qualified Marketmaker” means an entity that (a) holds itself out to the
public or the applicable private markets as standing ready in the ordinary course of business to
purchase from customers and sell to customers Claims of the Debtors (or enter with customers
into long and short positions in Claims against the Debtors), in its capacity as a dealer or
market maker in claims against the Debtors and (b) is, in fact, regularly in the business of
making a market in claims against issuers or borrowers (including debt securities or other debt).
9
This RSA shall in no way be construed to preclude Steering Group Member or any of its
affiliates from acquiring additional Senior Notes or any other claim against or equity
interest in the Company; provided, however, that (i) if any Steering Group Member
acquires additional or transferred Senior Notes, as applicable, after the RSA Effective
Date, such Steering Group Member shall promptly notify the other Parties of such
acquisition including the amount of such acquisition and (ii) such acquired Senior Notes,
as the case may be, shall automatically and immediately upon acquisition by a Steering
Group Member, as applicable, be deemed subject to the terms of this RSA (regardless of
when or whether notice of such acquisition is given to in accordance herewith).
Any Transfer made in violation of this provision shall be void ab initio. Any Steering Group
Member that effectuates a Permitted Transfer to a Permitted Transferee shall have no
liability under this RSA arising from or related to the failure of the Permitted Transferee to
comply with the terms of this RSA.
10. Termination of Obligations.

further force or effect in the event that and upon the occurrence of any of the following
events: (i) occurrence of the effective date of the confirmed Plan, (ii) an order denying
confirmation of the Plan is entered, (iii) an order confirming the Plan is reversed or
vacated, (iv) any court of competent jurisdiction has entered an order declaring this

(i) a determination by the board of directors of HERO (the “Board”), in good faith, based on
the advice of its outside counsel, that proceeding with the Restructuring and pursuit of
confirmation and consummation of the Plan would be inconsistent with the Board’s
fiduciary obligations under applicable law;
(ii) a breach by any Steering Group Member of its material obligations hereunder, which
breach is not cured within twenty days after the giving of written notice by HERO of such
breach to such Steering Group Member; provided, however, that if the Company has not

the aggregate at least 33 1/3% of the Senior Notes and (b) counsel to the Steering Group,
the Company may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10(b)(ii)
following such twenty day notice period, if such breach or breaches have not been cured,
solely as to the Steering Group Member then in breach;
provided, that upon a termination of this Agreement by the Debtors pursuant to section
10(b), (x) all obligations of each Steering Group Member hereunder shall immediately
terminate without further action or notice by such Steering Group Member, and (y) the

representatives) shall not have or incur any liability under this Agreement or otherwise on

Steering Group;
(ii) after filing of the Plan, any amendment or modification to the Plan, or the filing of any
pleading by any of the Debtors that seeks to amend or modify the Plan, which amendment,
modification or filing is not in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering
Group;
(iii) a breach by the Debtors of their material obligations hereunder, which breach is not
cured within twenty days after the giving of written notice by counsel for the Steering
Group (acting on behalf of the Steering Group) of such breach;
(iv) the failure of the Debtors to comply with the Milestones within the periods specified
therein, unless otherwise agreed in writing with Steering Group Members holding at least
66 2/3% of the aggregate amount of the Senior Notes held by all members of the Steering

holiday on which the Bankruptcy Court is not open and holding hearings, such Milestone

11. Reserved.
12. Specific Performance. It is understood and agreed by the Parties that money damages
would be an insufficient remedy for any breach of this RSA by any Party and each non-
breaching Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable
relief (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) as a remedy
of any such breach, including an order of the Bankruptcy Court or other court of
competent jurisdiction requiring any Party to comply promptly with any of its obligations
hereunder. The Parties to the RSA expressly consent to entry of orders by the Bankruptcy
Court to enforce the RSA.

hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in multiple counterparts (including by
means of telecopied or electronically transmitted signature pages), all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same RSA.
14. No Solicitation and Acknowledgements. Each Party acknowledges that (a) no
securities of the Company are being offered or sold hereby and this Agreement neither
constitutes an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of the
Company and (b) that this Agreement is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a solicitation
of a vote for the acceptance of the Plan pursuant to section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code.
The acceptance of votes from holders of claims and interests, as applicable, will not be
solicited until such holders have received the Disclosure Statement and related
solicitation materials that meet the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, including (i) in
the case of a Pre-Negotiated Plan, Bankruptcy Code section 1125, and (ii) in the case of a
Pre-Pack Plan, Bankruptcy Code sections 1125 and 1126.

any governmental or regulatory authority, no Party shall issue any press release, make
any filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (other than required under
applicable securities law and regulation as reasonably determined in good faith by outside
counsel to the Debtors) or make any other public announcement regarding this RSA
without the consent of the other Parties, and each Party shall coordinate with the other
Parties regarding any public statements made, including any communications with the
press, public filings or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with respect
to this RSA; for the avoidance of doubt, each Party shall have the right, without any
obligation to any other Party, to decline to comment to the press with respect to this RSA.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, under no
circumstances may any Party make any public disclosure of any kind that would disclose
(i) the holdings of Senior Notes of any Steering Group Member or (ii) the identity of any
Steering Group Member without the prior written consent of such Steering Group Member.
12
16. Time is of the Essence. The Parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence,
and that they must each use best efforts to effectuate and consummate the Restructuring
as soon as reasonably practicable.
17. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY
CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISION WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees for itself that any legal action, suit, or proceeding against it with
respect to any matter under or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered in any such action, suit, or
proceeding, shall be brought, to the extent possible, in either the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State Court sitting in New
York City or following the Petition Date, the Bankruptcy Court (the “Chosen Courts”). By
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Parties irrevocably accepts and
submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, generally and
unconditionally, with respect to any such action, suit, or proceeding, and waives any
objection it may have to venue or the convenience of the forum.
18. Independent Analysis. Each Party hereby confirms that it has made its own decision to
execute this RSA based upon its own independent assessment of documents and
information available to it, as it has deemed appropriate.
19. Third-Party Beneficiaries.
Unless expressly stated herein, this Agreement shall be solely for the benefit of the Parties
hereto and no other person or entity shall be a third party beneficiary hereof.

21. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this RSA shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this
RSA is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this RSA. In the event that any
part of this RSA is declared by any court or other judicial or administrative body to be null,
void or unenforceable, said provision survives to the extent it is not so declared, and all of
the other provisions of this RSA remain in full force and effect only if, after excluding the
portion deemed to be unenforceable, the remaining terms provide for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby in substantially the same manner as originally set
forth at the later of the date this RSA was executed or last amended.
22. Mutual Drafting. This RSA is the result of the Parties’ joint efforts, and each of them and
their respective counsel have reviewed this RSA and each provision hereof has been
subject to the mutual consultation, negotiation, and agreement of the Parties, and the
language used in this RSA shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and therefore there shall be no construction against either
Party based on any presumption of that Party’s involvement in the drafting thereof.
23. Headings. The headings used in this RSA are for convenience of reference only and
do not constitute a part of this RSA and shall not be deemed to limit, characterize, or in
any way affect any provision of this RSA, and all provisions of this RSA shall be enforced
and construed as if no headings had been used in this RSA.
14
24. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1) any
decisions to be made, or consents or approvals to be given, by the Steering Group
pursuant to the terms of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement shall require the
consent of Steering Group Members holding at least 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Notes held by all members of the Steering Group, and (2) the RSA
may not be modified, amended, or supplemented, nor shall any provision or requirement
hereof be waived, without the prior written agreement signed by both (a) the Company and
(b) Steering Group Members holding at least 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Senior Notes then held by all members of the Steering Group; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any modifications, amendments, or supplements or
waivers to the RSA, including any exhibits hereto (including any provision in the Term
Sheet), to (i) Exhibit A to the Term Sheet, (ii) Exhibit B to the Term Sheet, (iii) the sub-
provision entitled “April 2019 Notes, July 2021 Notes, October 2021 Notes, April 2022
Notes, Legacy Notes and Convertible Notes” in the provision entitled “Treatment of
Claims and Interests” in the Term Sheet, (iv) the sub-provision entitled “Hero Equity
Interests” in the provision entitled “Treatment of Claims and Interests” in the Term Sheet,
(v) the sub-provision entitled “Board of Directors” in the provision entitled “Other
Implementation Provisions” in the Term Sheet, (vi) any documentation with regard to
(i) through (v) above, (vii) any change to this Section 24, and (viii) any proposed
modification, amendment or supplement to, or waiver of, any provision of the RSA that
would, or would reasonably be expected to, materially and adversely affect any Steering
Group Member in a manner that is disproportionate to any other Steering Group Member
or the Steering Group Members as a whole, may not be made without the prior written
consent of the Company and each member of the Steering Group (or, in the case of
“subsection (viii)”, by such Steering Group Member that would be so affected).
25. Several, Not Joint, Claims. The agreements, representations, warranties, and
obligations of the Parties under this RSA are, in all respects, several and not joint.

The proposed restructuring (the “Restructuring”) will be
implemented through either pre-packaged chapter 11
bankruptcy cases (collectively, the “Pre-Packaged Case”) or
pre-arranged chapter 11 bankruptcy cases (collectively, the
“Pre-Negotiated Case”) of the Debtors (the “Chapter 11
Cases”) commenced on August 22, 2015 (in the case of a Pre-
Packaged Case) or July 8, 2015 (in the case of a Pre-
Negotiated Case), as applicable (the “Petition Date”).
It is the intention of the parties to work towards implementation
of the Restructuring through a Pre-Packaged Case, but to the
extent that such a Pre-Packaged Case is not feasible (as
reasonably determined by the parties), the parties will seek to
effectuate the Restructuring through a Pre-Negotiated Case.
To that end, the parties will take the following steps on the
filing timeline:
1. No later than June 17, 2015, the parties will agree on the
material terms and conditions contained in this Term Sheet. To
memorialize that agreement, the Steering Group and the
Company shall enter into the RSA incorporating this Term
Sheet, documenting each side’s support for both the Pre-Pack
Plan and the Pre-Negotiated Plan (as set forth below) by no
later than June 17, 2015. The parties have commenced
documentation of the actual Restructuring documents, and the
Debtors have withdrawn any efforts in connection with raising
financing from any third parties, either through the process
being currently run by Deutsche Bank, or otherwise, pending
final negotiations on the RSA.
2
2. No later than July 8, 2015, without having commenced any Chapter
11 Cases, the Debtors will commence solicitation of votes on the pre-
packaged chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the “Pre-Pack Plan”).
3. Assuming that the Debtors are successful in obtaining the requisite
votes for the Pre-Pack Plan, the Debtors will commence the Pre-
Packaged Case no later than August 22, 2015, and seek the approval
of the Bankruptcy Court (as defined below) for a confirmation hearing
no later than October 22, 2015.
4. If the parties agree prior to July 8, 2015 that it is not reasonably
feasible to seek confirmation of a Pre-Pack Plan through a Pre-
Current Capital
Structure:
Packaged Case, the Debtors will file for chapter 11 through a Pre-
Negotiated Case no later than July 8, 2015 with a plan of
reorganization for a Pre-Negotiated Case (the “Pre-Negotiated Plan”)
and disclosure statement on that date.
The plan of reorganization implementing the Restructuring
contemplated by this Term Sheet (either the Pre-Pack Plan, or the Pre-
Negotiated Plan, the “Plan”) and the disclosure statement describing
the Plan (the “Disclosure Statement”) shall be in all material respects
consistent with the terms set forth herein and on any exhibits attached
hereto, and shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to

clarify that the class of holders of Hero Equity Interests is not entitled to
a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code, and is therefore not entitled
to vote.

After consummation of the Restructuring, all of the assets of the
Debtors shall be owned by the reorganized Debtors and their wholly
owned subsidiaries. The Steering Group may, at its option, review and
analyze the proposed tax and corporate structure of the reorganized
Debtors for tax and corporate efficiencies as part of the Restructuring
and the Plan will contain such provisions reasonably acceptable to the
Steering Group to ensure such tax and corporate efficiencies. The
Debtors shall work with the Steering Group to structure the
Restructuring and the transactions contemplated herein to the extent
practicable in a tax-efficient and cost-effective manner for the
reorganized Debtors, as determined by the Steering Group. The
proposed tax structure for the reorganized Debtors shall be finalized
prior to the Petition Date.
The Debtors’ management shall work with the members of the
Steering Group (and its advisors) that remain subject to a
nondisclosure agreement to determine and finalize the Company’s
long term business plan, which shall be finalized prior to the Petition
Date. After the Petition Date, to the extent requested by the Steering
Group, the Debtors’
9
management team and operational advisors will host weekly calls with
the members of the Steering Group that are subject to a nondisclosure
agreement and/or their advisors to provide updates with regard to the
business and any developments.
From the date of execution of the RSA (as defined and further
described herein) through consummation of any Plan, the Company
shall inform the advisors of the Steering Group (that remain under a
nondisclosure agreement) prior to entry into any new material
contracts and use reasonable best efforts to consult with, and obtain
the approval of the majority of the Steering Group members restricted
under a nondisclosure agreement with the Company prior to entry into
any new material contracts, but in all events will inform the Steering
Group and their respective advisors at the time of or shortly after entry
into any new material contracts.
The Board of Directors of Reorganized Hero (the “New Board”) shall
consist of seven members.
Board of Directors:
Management Incentive
Plan:
Executory Contracts
and Unexpired Leases:

“Management Incentive Plan”) to be implemented after the Effective
Date that provides some combination of cash, options, and/or other
equity-based compensation to the management of the reorganized
Debtors of up to an amount of the common equity of Reorganized Hero
to be agreed, which shall dilute all of the equity otherwise
contemplated to be issued pursuant to this Term Sheet. The terms of
the Management Incentive Plan shall be agreed by the Company and
the Steering Group prior to the confirmation date of the Plan.

chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and under similar state laws (the
“Avoidance Actions”) under a Pre-Packaged Plan and will retain all
Avoidance Actions under a Pre-Negotiated Plan only to the extent that
all pre-petition general unsecured claims are not paid in full.

Certain Closing and
Other Conditions To the
Restructuring:
The Restructuring shall be subject to the satisfaction of conditions
precedent customary for transactions of this type and the satisfaction of
such other conditions precedent agreed upon by the Steering Group
and the Debtors, including but not limited to, the following:
(a) The definitive documentation relating to the Restructuring
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the terms and conditions of any
financing(s)) shall be agreed to by the Debtors and the Steering
Group.2
(b) The Debtors shall have provided the Steering Group (and its
advisors) with full and complete access to the Debtors and their
management on reasonable notice, including without limitation,
access to all information, agreements, projections, memoranda, and
documents reasonably requested by the advisors to the Steering
Group. For the avoidance of doubt, the Steering Group’s advisors will
be provided with electronic copies of any and all documents or
agreements within the possession of the Debtors, as reasonably
requested by the Steering Group’s advisors, in sufficient time to
analyze the Restructuring and prior to the execution of the RSA by the
members of the Steering Group.
(c) The Restructuring transactions shall be structured in the most tax
efficient manner as reasonably determined by the Debtors with the
consent of the Steering Group which consent shall not unreasonably
be withheld, and all accounting treatment and other tax matters shall
be resolved by the Debtors with the consent of the Steering Group.
(d) Entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court confirming the Plan on
terms consistent with this Term Sheet and otherwise reasonably
acceptable to the Debtors and the Steering Group.

(f) The Debtors shall have publicly filed a document “cleansing” all of
the members of the Steering Group of any
2 The Debtors will obtain ratings for the new debt prior to or at the time of closing.
11
and all material non-public information shared with the members of the
Steering Group (i) on the date of the execution of the RSA and (ii) prior
to (a) in the case of the Pre-Packaged Case, the date of solicitation of
votes with regard thereto, and (b) in the case of the Pre-Negotiated
Case, the Petition Date, and such document shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group and its
advisors and consistent with the existing non-disclosure agreements.
The Debtors shall also have publicly filed a document “cleansing” all
of the members of the Steering Group of any and all material non-
public information shared with the members of the Steering Group prior
to the Effective Date (i.e. with regard to any material non-public
information shared with the members of the Steering Group during the
chapter 11 cases), and such document shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Steering Group and their advisors. For the
avoidance of doubt, and in addition to the above, the Debtors shall
comply with all requirements for “cleansing” under any non-disclosure
agreements executed with the members of the Steering Group.
(g) The timing of the Effective Date of the Plan shall be as agreed upon
by the Debtors and the Steering Group.
(h) From and after the date hereof, the Debtors shall not have
commenced an insolvency (or similar) proceeding in any foreign
jurisdiction without the consent of the Steering Group.
(i) Since the date of entry into the RSA, there shall not have been a
Material Adverse Change. For purposes of this Term Sheet, “Material
Adverse Change” means (a) any fact, event, change, effect,
development, circumstance or occurrence that, individually or together
with any other fact, event, change, effect, development, circumstance
or occurrence, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
material and adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of Hero and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (b) anything that could reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially restrict or impair
Hero and its subsidiaries party to the RSA from consummating the
transactions contemplated in this Term Sheet, the Plan and the RSA,
provided that the following shall not constitute a Material Adverse
Change and shall not be taken into account in determining whether or
not there has been, or
12
could reasonably be expected to be, a Material Adverse Change: (i)
any change after June 17, 2015 in any Law or GAAP, or any
interpretation thereof; (ii) any change after June 17, 2015 in currency,
exchange or interest rates or the financial or securities markets
generally; (iii) any change to the extent resulting from the
announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by the
RSA or this Term Sheet; and (iv) any change resulting from actions of
the Company expressly required to be taken pursuant to the RSA or
this Term Sheet; except in the cases of (i) and (ii) to the extent such
change or Event is disproportionately adverse with respect to the
Company when compared to other companies in the industry in which
the Company operates. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding the above, it shall be a Material Adverse Change if
there occurs any of the following: (i) any adverse development with
respect to the contract with Maersk Oil UK Limited with respect to the
Highlander; (ii) any adverse development with respect to any other
material contract (or contracts), including (x) the contract with a
subsidiary of Eni S.p.A. with respect to the Hercules 260 and (y) the
contracts with Saudi Aramco with respect to the Hercules 261 and
Hercules 262, that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a reduction in revenue backlog of more than
$90 million for the Company, provided that any such reduction in
revenue backlog attributable to a contract with a customer shall be
netted against any additional revenue attributable to extension,
amendment or renegotiation of an existing contract or execution of a
new contract with such customer and/or any of such customer’s
affiliates within three (3) days of the occurrence of the reduction; or (iii)
the termination, replacement, resignation, or other change in the
identity, of the CEO of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
preceding clause (ii) assumes that no Material Adverse Change has
occurred as a result of the announced modifications to the Saudi
Aramco contracts publicly disclosed on June 1, 2015.
(j) The Debtors shall own the assets related to the Highlander,
including the contracts related thereto, in the same entities that
presently own such assets so long as those entities have engaged,
and continue to engage, in no other business than the ownership of
such assets and have not incurred, and continue not to incur, any other
obligations other than those directly related to the ownership of such
other assets. The Debtors will ensure that the First Lien Exit Facility
shall be secured by both the equity in such entity, as well as the assets
owned by such entity.
13
(k) All of the Steering Group’s reasonable and documented
professional fees (including those of Blackstone Advisory Partners,
L.P. and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, LLP) and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the Restructuring in accordance
with the engagement letters for each firm including, without limitation,
those fees and expenses incurred during the Chapter 11 Cases, shall
have been paid by the Debtors on a regular (monthly) basis, and shall
be paid in full as a condition to the Effective Date. If necessary, the
Debtors will file a motion to assume such agreements on the Petition
Date of any Pre-Negotiated Case.
Steering Group Support: As set forth above, the members of the Steering Group shall execute
an RSA on or prior to June 17, 2015, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Steering Group and the Debtors. The RSA will state
that subject to the receipt of a Disclosure Statement that meets the
requirements of Bankruptcy Code section 1125, the Steering Group

and consummation of, the Plan.
The reasonable professional fees and expenses of legal counsel and
financial advisors to the Steering Group (including Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer & Feld, LLP. and Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P.) incurred
prior to the Petition Date and thereafter shall be paid by the Debtors on
the terms of and pursuant to such firms’ engagement letter agreements
entered into with the Debtors (or such other agreements).
Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission of any kind. If the
Restructuring is not consummated for any reason, the Debtors and the
Steering Group fully reserve any and all of their respective rights.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Term
Sheet shall require the Debtors or the Steering Group to take any
action or to refrain from taking any action, to the extent required to
comply with its or their obligations under applicable law, including the
Bankruptcy Code.
14
The governing law for all applicable documentation shall be New York
law. The Debtors shall file for chapter 11 in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”).
The Debtors and the Steering Group shall negotiate in good faith the
definitive documentation concerning the Restructuring that is
consistent with the terms described in this Term Sheet. Any and all
documentation necessary to effectuate the Restructuring or that is
contemplated by the Plan shall be in form and substance consistent
with this Term Sheet and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the
Debtors and the Steering Group. For the avoidance of doubt, such
documentation that shall be required to be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Steering Group shall include all motions
and other filings with the Bankruptcy Court (or that are included as part
of the solicitation of the Pre-Pack Plan and the Pre-Packaged Case)
necessary to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of any item in the
Chapter 11 Cases, including any proposed and final orders with
respect thereto (including, without limitation, the order confirming the
Plan (the “Confirmation Order”)).
In addition, from the date hereof through the consummation of the Plan
of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors shall not file any motions (i.e.,
other than those related to the Plan and Disclosure Statement), with
the Bankruptcy Court without the consent of the Steering Group which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

It is anticipated that the Restructuring described herein will take place
in accordance with the timeline set forth in Schedule 1 to this Term

Terms of Warrants
The warrants (the “Warrants”) shall entitle holders, on a pro
rata basis, to purchase up to 20.00% of the New Common
Stock (subject to dilution from, among other things, the
Management Incentive Plan) at a per share price based
upon a $1.55 billion total enterprise value of Reorganized
Hero.
The Warrants are exercisable at any time until the Warrant
Expiration Date for a per share price based upon a $1.55
billion total enterprise value. Any Warrants not exercised
by the Warrant Expiration Date shall automatically expire.
The Warrant Expiration Date will be six years from the
Effective Date subject to the earlier expiration upon the
occurrence of certain extraordinary events.
Holders of the Warrants will not be entitled to any voting
rights of holders of New Common Stock until, and then
only to the extent, they have validly exercised their
Warrants.
In connection with a change in control in Reorganized
Hero prior to the Warrant Expiration Date,

Anti-Dilution Provisions:

Transferability:
Additional Provisions:
holders of Warrants shall be given reasonable advance
written notice of such change of control such that they may
exercise their Warrants and participate in such change of
control transaction (as applicable) as holders of New
Common Stock.
The Warrants will contain provisions for the adjustment of
the exercise price and shares of New Common Stock
issuable upon exercise following organic dilutive events
such as splits, combinations, stock dividends and similar
organic dilutive events involving the Reorganized Hero’s
New Common Stock.
There will be no anti-dilution adjustment for the Warrants
upon post-exit issuance of New Common Stock at a value
below the exercise price for the Warrants.
The Warrants shall be governed by a Warrant agreement
between Reorganized Hero and the warrant agent (as
selected by the Steering Group), in form and substance
satisfactory to the Steering Group, the Debtors and
Reorganized Hero.
The Warrants shall be transferrable subject to applicable
securities laws and the terms of the Warrant Agreement.
For avoidance of doubt, the equity strike price of the
Warrants shall be calculated at emergence based on the
equity value required to equal the stipulated TEV
($1.55 billion, as set forth above), the capital structure
($450 million of debt), and the pro forma excess cash figure
at emergence. The pro forma excess cash figure will be
calculated to take into account an adjustment for the
estimated $50 million of minimum cash needed to operate
the business and $200 million in connection with the
Highlander.
The Warrants shall have limited numerical anti-dilution
protection only (e.g., no adjustment to the strike price or
number of shares as a result of the issuance of capital
stock by Reorganized Hero at a price below the warrant
strike price).

The Debtors believe that the Plan meets the feasibility requirement set forth in section 1129(a)(11) of the
Bankruptcy Code, as confirmation is not likely to be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial
reorganization of the Debtors or any successor under the Plan. In connection with the development of a plan
of reorganization and for the purposes of determining whether such plan would satisfy this feasibility
standard, the Debtors analyzed their ability to satisfy their financial obligations while maintaining sufficient
liquidity and capital resources. The Debtors prepared financial projections (the “Projections”) for the balance
of the 2015 calendar year, and for 2016 through 2018 (the “Projection Period”). The Debtors do not, as a matter
of course, publish their business plans or strategies, projections or anticipated financial position.
Accordingly, the Debtors do not anticipate that they will, and disclaim any obligation to, furnish updated
business plans or projections to holders of Claims or other parties in interest after the Confirmation Date, or
to include such information in documents required to be filed with the SEC or otherwise make such
information public, unless required to do so by the SEC or other regulatory body pursuant to the provisions
of the Plan.
In connection with the planning and development of the Plan, the Projections were prepared by the Debtors to
present the anticipated impact of the Plan. The Projections assume that the Plan will be implemented in
accordance with its stated terms. However, the Projections do not include the impact of fresh start
accounting. The Projections are based on forecasts of key economic variables and may be significantly
impacted by, among other factors, oil and natural gas prices and our expectations about future commodity
prices, the level of activity of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico and internationally, the demand and day rates for the Company’s drilling services, competition and
supply of competing rigs and liftboats, changes in the political environment of the countries where the
Company operates, regulatory changes and/or a variety of other factors, including those factors listed in
Article XI of the Disclosure Statement entitled Certain Risk Factors to be Considered. Accordingly, the
estimates and assumptions underlying the Projections are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant
business, economic and other uncertainties. Therefore, such Projections, estimates and assumptions are not
necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly less or more
favorable than set forth herein.
The Projections included herein were finalized in July 2015. The Projections should be read in conjunction
with the significant assumptions, qualifications and notes set forth below.
THE DEBTORS PREPARED THE PROJECTIONS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR PROFESSIONALS. THE
DEBTORS DID NOT PREPARE SUCH PROJECTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE GUIDELINES FOR

THE PROJECTIONS, WHILE PRESENTED WITH NUMERICAL SPECIFICITY, ARE NECESSARILY BASED ON A
VARIETY OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WHICH, THOUGH CONSIDERED REASONABLE BY THE
DEBTORS, MAY NOT BE REALIZED AND ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS,
ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY, REGULATORY, LEGAL, MARKET, AND FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTIES AND
CONTINGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE REORGANIZED DEBTORS’ CONTROL. THE DEBTORS
CAUTION THAT NO REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE MADE OR ARE MADE AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THE

SOME ASSUMPTIONS INEVITABLY WILL BE INCORRECT. MOREOVER, EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES
OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE DEBTORS PREPARED THESE PROJECTIONS MAY
BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ASSUMED, OR, ALTERNATIVELY, MAY HAVE BEEN UNANTICIPATED, AND
THUS THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE EVENTS MAY AFFECT FINANCIAL RESULTS IN A MATERIALLY
ADVERSE OR MATERIALLY BENEFICIAL MANNER. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE PLAN OR
THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS AND REORGANIZED DEBTORS, AS APPLICABLE, DO NOT
INTEND AND UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE PROJECTIONS TO
REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING OR ARISING AFTER THE DATE THE DISCLOSURE
STATEMENT IS INITIALLY FILED OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.
THEREFORE, THE PROJECTIONS MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON AS A GUARANTY OR OTHER ASSURANCE OF
THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WILL OCCUR. IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE
PLAN, HOLDERS OF CLAIMS MUST MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATIONS AS TO THE REASONABLENESS
OF SUCH ASSUMPTIONS AND THE RELIABILITY OF THE PROJECTIONS AND SHOULD CONSULT WITH
THEIR OWN ADVISORS.
The Projections should be read in conjunction with the assumptions, qualifications, and explanations set
forth in this Disclosure Statement, and the Plan in their entirety, and the historical consolidated financial
statements (including the notes and schedules thereto).
B. Assumptions to the Projections
1. General Assumptions
Overview. The Debtors and their subsidiaries are a leading provider of shallow-water drilling and marine
services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry globally. The Debtors provide these
services to national oil and gas companies, major integrated energy companies and independent oil and
natural gas operators. As of June 30, 2015, the Debtors and their subsidiaries operated a fleet of 27 jackup
rigs, including one rig under construction, and 24 liftboat vessels. The Company’s diverse fleet is capable of
providing services such as oil and gas exploration and development drilling, well service, platform
inspection, maintenance and decommissioning operations in several key shallow-water provinces around the
world.
Presentation. The Projections are presented on a consolidated basis, including estimates of operating results
for Debtor and non-Debtor entities, combined.
Methodology. In developing the Projections, the Debtors reviewed the current contracted status of their
offshore jackup rigs and liftboats and made an assessment of whether or not these contracts were likely to
continue or additional contracts were likely to be signed. The forecast was developed on a rig by rig basis
and the Debtors evaluated the likelihood of each of their rigs and liftboats being utilized over the forecast
period.
Plan Consummation. The Projections assume that a Plan will be confirmed or consummated on or about
October 1, 2015.
2. Assumptions With Respect to the Projected Income Statement
Revenues. In the Projections, Revenues are forecasted based on expected day rates and utilization for existing
contracts and expectations around additional contracts for each rig and lift boat.
Operating Costs. Operating Costs are projected based on historical daily regional operating costs and
expected utilization of each rig and liftboat based on current contracts and expectations around additional
contracts.
General and Administrative. General and Administrative Costs are primarily comprised of labor costs and
other expenses associated with the Debtors’ corporate overhead. It also includes amounts related to G&A
associated with the rigs and liftboats. Corporate G&A is based on historical G&A costs, adjusted for recent
cost reduction efforts. Expected annual growth rates were then applied over the forecast period. Rig and
liftboat segment G&A is based on historical costs with varying growth rates applied based on the market
trends by segment.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and Amortization reflects the anticipated depreciation and
amortization of the existing fleet, based on current net book values, with the inclusion of depreciation
associated with the Hercules Highlander after June 2016.
Interest Expense. Interest expense post-emergence is forecasted based on the Debtors’ proposed exit
financing as more fully described in Exhibit H of the Disclosure Statement.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax is estimated based on the jurisdictional mix of the Company’s
projected revenue.
Assumptions with Respect to the Projected Balance Sheet and Projected Statement of Cash Flows
Working Capital. Working capital assumptions are based on historical DSO and DPO for accounts receivables
and accounts payable, respectively.
Proforma Adjustments Related to Emergence and Exit Financing. The 2015 Balance Sheet included in the
Projections presents a proforma view of October 2015, assuming the effect of certain adjustments related to
the Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy and obtaining related exit financing. These adjustments primarily
relate to the conversion of the Debtors Senior Notes into equity as more fully described in Article VII.B.3. of
the Disclosure Statement and the incurrence of the Exit Financing as more fully described in Article VII.C and
Exhibit H of the Disclosure Statement. While the 2015 – 2018 Projections roll-forward the effect of such
proforma adjustments, “fresh start” accounting principles have not been applied.
Capital Expenditures. Projections for expenditures were prepared with consideration of the Debtors’ current
equipment inventory and estimates for growth. Capital Expenditures primarily relate to ongoing maintenance
of the Debtors’ existing jackup rigs and liftboats, with the exception of approximately $200 million of capital
expenditures expected to occur in 2016 related to the completion of the Hercules Highlander.
EXHIBIT E TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS
LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS
Projected as of October 1, 2015
NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS IS INTENDED TO BE OR CONSTITUTES
A CONCESSION OR ADMISSION OF THE DEBTORS. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF ALLOWED CLAIMS SET
FORTH HEREIN SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, INCLUDING ANY
DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF ANY DISTRIBUTION TO BE MADE ON ACCOUNT OF ALLOWED CLAIMS
UNDER THE PLAN. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF ALLOWED CLAIMS IN THESE CHAPTER 11 CASES COULD
DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS SET FORTH IN THE LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS.
Introduction
Often called the “best interests” test, section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that the Bankruptcy
Court find, as a condition to confirmation of the Plan, that each holder of a Claim or Interest in each Impaired
Class: (i) has accepted the Plan; or (ii) will receive or retain under the Plan property of a value, as of the
Effective Date, that is not less than the amount that such Person would receive if the Debtors were liquidated
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. To make these findings, the Bankruptcy Court must: (1) estimate the
cash proceeds (the “Net Estimated Liquidation Proceeds”) that a chapter 7 trustee would generate if each
Debtor’s Chapter 11 Case were converted to a chapter 7 case on the Effective Date and the assets of such
Debtor’s estate were liquidated; (2) determine the distribution (the “Estimated Recovery Under Liquidation”)
that each non-accepting holder of a Claim or Interest would receive from the Net Estimated Liquidation
Proceeds under the priority scheme dictated in chapter 7; and (3) compare each holder’s Estimated Recovery
Under Liquidation to the distribution under the Plan (the “Plan Recovery”) that such Holder would receive if
the Plan were confirmed and consummated.
Based on the following hypothetical Liquidation Analysis, the Debtors believe that the Plan satisfies the best
interests test and that each holder of an Impaired Claim or Equity Interest will receive value under the Plan on
the Effective Date that is not less than the value such holder would receive if the Debtors liquidated under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors believe that the Liquidation Analysis and conclusions set forth
herein are fair and represent management’s best judgment regarding the results of a liquidation of the
Debtors under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code taking into account various factors including the absence of
a robust market for the sale of the Debtors’ assets and the negative impact on values arising from a distressed
sale of a large number of rigs in a relatively short amount of time under current market conditions. The
Liquidation Analysis was prepared for the sole purpose of assisting the Bankruptcy Court and holders of
Impaired Claims or Equity Interests in making this determination, and should not be used for any other
purpose. Nothing contained in this Liquidation Analysis is intended as or constitutes a concession or
admission for any purpose other than the presentation of a hypothetical Liquidation Analysis for purposes of
the best interests test. Accordingly, asset values discussed herein may be different than amounts referred to
in the Plan. The Liquidation Analysis is based upon certain assumptions discussed herein and in the
Disclosure Statement.
Significant Assumptions
The Liquidation Analysis assumes that the Debtors’ liquidation would commence on or about October 1, 2015
(the “Conversion Date”) under the direction of a chapter 7 trustee and would continue for a period of
approximately twelve months, during which time all of the Debtors’ assets would be sold, and the cash
proceeds (net of liquidation-related costs), together with the cash on hand, would then be distributed to
Creditors in accordance with the priority
Page 1 of 9
scheme established under the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors would expect the chapter 7 trustee to retain
professionals to assist in the liquidation of the estates. It is assumed that the Debtors would continue to
operate all rigs under customer contracts at the Conversion Date in order to maximize the liquidation value.
All other operations are assumed to cease in order to minimize costs associated with the chapter 7 wind
down and liquidation. Because the Debtors own 100% of the equity interests in the non-Debtor subsidiaries,
with the exception of the Hercules Offshore (Nigeria) Limited (“Nigerian Entity”), and all management and
corporate functions reside with the Debtor entities, operations at those subsidiaries would cease as well.
Therefore, for the purposes of the Liquidation Analysis, the Debtors and their advisors have attempted to
ascribe value to each of the assets individually as they would be liquidated by a chapter 7 trustee and the
professionals retained by the trustee. For other assets, liquidation values were assessed for general classes of
assets by estimating the percentage recoveries that a trustee might achieve through an orderly disposition.
Where applicable, asset recoveries below are shown net of the costs to achieve those recoveries.
The Debtor entities are all guarantors of the Senior Notes Claims and the value of all Debtor and Non-Debtor
entities ultimately accrue directly or indirectly to one or more of the Debtor entities, therefore, for purposes of
this liquidation analysis the comparison to the chapter 11 Plan is done on a consolidated basis.
The statements in the Liquidation Analysis, including estimates of Allowed Claims, were prepared solely to
assist the Bankruptcy Court in making the findings required under section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code
and they may not be used or relied upon for any other purpose.
THE DEBTORS BELIEVE THAT ANY ANALYSIS OF A HYPOTHETICAL LIQUIDATION IS NECESSARILY
SPECULATIVE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE
LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS THAT ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND
CONTINGENCIES BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE DEBTORS OR A CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE. NEITHER THE
LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS, NOR THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON WHICH IT IS BASED, HAS BEEN
EXAMINED OR REVIEWED BY INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS
PROMULGATED BY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS. THERE CAN BE NO
ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT VARY MATERIALLY FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS
PRESENTED IN THE LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS.
Summary Notes to Liquidation Analysis
1. Dependence on assumptions. The Liquidation Analysis is based on a number of
estimates and assumptions that, although developed and considered reasonable by
management and the Debtors’ advisors, are inherently subject to significant economic,
business, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control
of the Debtors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the values reflected in this
Liquidation Analysis would be realized if the Debtors were, in fact, to undergo such a
liquidation and actual results could vary materially and adversely from those contained
herein.
2. Additional claims in a liquidation. The liquidation itself may trigger certain obligations and
priority payments that otherwise would not be due in the ordinary course of business or
would otherwise not exist under a chapter 11 plan. These priority payments would be
made in full before any distribution of proceeds to pay holders of general unsecured
claims or to make distributions in respect of Equity Interests. The liquidation would likely
prompt certain other events to occur including the rejection of executory contracts,
unexpired leases, defaults under agreements with suppliers, and severance obligations.
Such events, if triggered, would likely create a larger number of creditors and would
subject the chapter 7 estates to additional claims. As a general rule, the Company does
not enter into long-term contracts with their vendors and only maintains leases for its
corporate offices and Houma facility. As such, the amount of additional unsecured claims
is not deemed to have a material impact on the Liquidation Analysis.
Page 2 of 9
3. Preference transfers. A thorough preference analysis has not been conducted by the
Debtors or their advisors. The Company is currently paying vendors on scheduled terms
and is expected to do so through the expected Conversion Date. Therefore the amount of
preference claims are estimated at zero for the purposes of this Liquidation Analysis
4. Fraudulent transfers. No recovery or related litigation costs have been attributed to any
potential fraudulent transfer actions under the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors do not
believe that such causes of action would have a material effect on the Liquidation
Analysis for purposes of section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code.
5. Dependence on a forecasted balance sheet. This Liquidation Analysis is dependent on a
forecasted balance sheet and the Debtors’ current best estimates with respect to
forecasted balances by Debtor entity and based on the Debtors’ current legal and
financial review. Forecasted balances could vary from the Debtors’ estimates and
additional legal or financial analysis could cause the Debtors’ estimates to change.
6. Chapter 7 liquidation costs. It is assumed that it would take twelve months to complete
the wind down and liquidation of the Debtors’ estates. The fees and operating expenses
incurred during the Chapter 7 process are included in the estimate of Chapter 7
Administrative Claims. In addition, there are liquidation costs associated with most of the
Debtors’ assets. Asset recoveries are shown in the Liquidation Analysis net of such
liquidation costs.
7. Claims Estimates. Claims are estimated at the Conversion Date based on management’s
recent projections. The Company does not provide projections at the legal entity level,
and therefore when claims could not be projected, liabilities as of May 31, 2015 were
used.
8. Claim assertions. The Senior Note Claims (approximately $1.2 billion) are joint and
several obligations of each of the Debtors. As such, Senior Notes Claims, together with
Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 Administrative Claims, are represented as being asserted
against all Debtor entities. In a Chapter 7, the Senior Note Claims would share pro rata
with Allowed General Unsecured Claims in any distribution of liquidation proceeds at the
applicable Debtor. However, the Liquidation Analysis is performed on a consolidated
basis, and the consolidated net liquidation proceeds are attributed evenly across the
Senior Note Claims and consolidated General Unsecured Claims.
Conclusion: The Debtors have determined, as summarized in the following analysis, that confirmation of the
Plan will provide all impaired creditors and equity holders with a recovery (if any) that is not less than what
they would otherwise receive pursuant to a liquidation of the Debtors under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Detailed Assumptions
Asset Recovery Estimates
Asset recovery estimates presented in this Liquidation Analysis are based on the Company’s projected
consolidated Debtor balance sheet for October 1, 2015. When assets could not be projected, May 31, 2015
balances were used and noted.
(a) Cash: The Liquidation Analysis assumes current operations continue and ongoing
expenses are incurred until the Conversion Date. The book cash balance at October 1,
2015 is based on the most recent projections prepared by management. The Debtors
estimate a 100% recovery on Cash.
Page 4 of 9
(b) Accounts Receivable: Because the Company does not forecast accounts receivable at
the entity level, the balance is based on the May 31, 2015 balances for the consolidated
Debtor entities. It is not expected that the October 1, 2015 accounts receivable balance
will vary materially from this estimate. It is assumed that in a Chapter 7 certain existing
staff of the Debtors would be retained to lead an aggressive collection effort for
outstanding Accounts Receivable. In order to achieve the highest recovery of accounts
receivable, the Debtors believe that relatively senior level people will be retained. The
costs associated with such employees (excluding any retention or incentive payments
that may be required) are included in the Chapter 7 operating expenses. Due to the
contract nature of the Debtors’ business, and the assumption that contracted rig
operations will continue until the rigs are sold over the twelve-month liquidation period, it
is very likely that conversion to a Chapter 7 will disrupt operations in the middle of a
contract. Although the Debtors expect that the operating rigs would be sold and the
contracts would be assigned to the buyer, it is likely that there are certain instances
where this will not occur. As a result, the Debtors estimate a 50% - 75% recovery rate on
accounts receivable.
The line item entitled “Accounts Receivable – Other” consists primarily of a single receivable related to an
insurance claim. The Debtors estimate a 25%-50% recovery rate for this receivable in a chapter 7 scenario.
(c) Other Current Assets: Amounts in this category predominantly represent prepaid
expenses, prepaid insurance, and deferred tax assets all of which are assumed to have
no recovery in a liquidation. The Liquidation Analysis uses the book value as of May 31,
2015 for such amounts, which does not have a meaningful impact on recovery.
(d) Property, Plant & Equipment: Fixed assets primarily include rigs and related equipment,
liftboats, and miscellaneous equipment. The Debtors currently have 19 jackup rigs
primarily located in the Gulf of Mexico. 9 rigs are cold stacked, 6 are under contract and 4
are warm stacked as of June 23, 2015. All of the current rig contracts expire prior to the
end of 2015. There is currently a significant oversupply of rigs in the market, and the
average age of the Debtors’ rigs is 37 years. It is management’s view that rigs are
becoming increasingly difficult to sell in an over saturated market with decreasing
demand.
In general, contracted rigs can be sold at the highest values, and warm stacked rigs can be sold more easily
at higher values than cold stacked rigs. Based on management’s knowledge of the rigs and current market
conditions, comparable rigs sales Hercules made in 2015, and other data points, the Debtors and their
advisors assigned orderly liquidation values to each of the Debtors’ rigs by rig category (i.e., cold stacked
rigs, warm stacked rigs and contracted rigs). Given the already over saturated nature of the market and the
shortage of willing buyers in the market under present conditions, it is likely that 19 additional rigs hitting the
market at one time would significantly reduce these already depressed liquidation values. For this reason, the
Debtors applied an additional 50-75% discount to the liquidation values.
Additionally, the Debtors own 10 liftboats in various classes. The liftboats were reviewed using a
methodology similar to that used for the drilling rigs. Of the 10 liftboats, management believes 3 are
significantly more marketable due to age and class and these were ascribed a higher value. It is
management’s opinion that there are few, if any, potential buyers currently in the market for liftboats and
therefore it was assumed that an additional discount of 50-75% should be applied to reflect the incremental
reduction in value due to marketing all 10 liftboats at the same time.
For other fixed asset classes, liquidation discounts were applied based on discussions with management and
current market demand as outlined in the table below. These discounts were applied on fair market value of
the assets in question if available, and on net book value where unavailable.
Page 5 of 9
It is assumed that the Chapter 7 trustee would retain a broker to sell the fixed assets, and therefore a market
standard brokerage fee of 2% was applied.

(e) Deferred Drydock: Includes certain amortized dry-docking cost and coast guard fees.
They are assumed to have no estimated recovery.
(f) Other Assets: Includes capitalized debt cost, marketable securities related to the deferred
compensation plan and deposits. The capitalized debt issuance costs are expected to
have no value in a liquidation. The marketable securities are not protected in the event of
a Chapter 7. The recovery on cash deposits and marketable securities is estimated at 50-
100% of book balance.

(g) Intercompany Receivables – Non Debtor: Collection of Intercompany Receivables (i.e.
collections from non-Debtors) is estimated at zero. Any recoveries related to assets from
non-Debtor subsidiaries are assumed to be recovered under “Investments in Non-Debtor
Affiliates” as described below in section (h).
(h) Investment in Non-Debtor Affiliates: The Debtors have investments in certain non-debtor
foreign subsidiaries. The management team and substantially all of the administrative
functions exist at the debtor
level. For this reason, it is unlikely the non-debtor entities would be able to operate as a
Page 6 of 9
going concern and would instead be forced into a liquidation. In addition, it is assumed
that the rigs are being sold with contracts in place, and therefore it is unlikely that the
liquidation proceeds would vary substantially from the proceeds received under a
hypothetical sale of the non-Debtor entities as going concerns.
As noted previously, the Debtors own 100% of the equity interest in the non-Debtor subsidiaries with the
exception of the Nigerian entity, which is 60% owned by a local Nigerian party. While only the pro-rata portion
of the net liquidation proceeds at the Nigerian entity would go towards satisfying the Debtors’ investment in
non-Debtor affiliates, we do not expect the net recovery of the Nigerian Entity’s liquidation to have a
meaningful impact on the liquidation analysis.
Any proceeds from liquidation of non-Debtor subsidiaries must first be used to satisfy trade payables and
other expenses at the foreign entity level, prior to being returned to the Debtors. Therefore, the foreign
liquidation analysis was performed on a consolidated basis using the Asset Recovery Estimates outlined
above in sections (a) – (f).
It should be noted that all seven of the foreign rigs are either under long term contracts or being actively
marketed. Two rigs in particular, the Hercules Triumph and Hercules Resilience, have significantly more value
than the other rigs in a liquidation scenario. Both rigs were built in 2013.
In addition, the foreign entities have currently made two installment payments totaling $47.2 million toward
the building of a new rig, the Hercules Highlander, with a final installment of $188.8M due upon delivery of the
vessel, estimated in the second quarter of 2016. In a chapter 7 scenario, the company will not have the
liquidity to make the final installment payment, and therefore the payment will not be made. In this case, the
contracted customer for the Hercules Highlander has the right to purchase the rig from the shipyard at full
value resulting in a recoup of the $47.2 million (included as the high scenario). If the customer refuses the
right to purchase the rig, ownership is retained by the shipyard which will then market the rig for sale. In
current market conditions, it is assumed that the remaining rig payment will exceed the sale value of the rig
by the shipyard, resulting in no recovery of the first two installment payments (included as the low scenario).
Per the contract, no deficiency claim arises as a result of failing to make the final payment and secure delivery
of the rig.
Page 7 of 9
The table below shows the net proceeds of the consolidated non-Debtor subsidiaries in a liquidation scenario.
The amounts available to pay intercompany interests (which are bolded below, and are listed as between
$52.4 million and $268.0 million) correlate to line item “h” on the table in page 4, entitled, “Investment in Non-
Debtor Affiliates”.

(1) Value of zero indicates amount less than $50,000
(i) Estimated Preference Claims: In general the company pays its vendor to terms. As such,
the amount of preference claims was estimated at zero for purposes of this liquidation
analysis.
(j) Other Causes of Action: No material causes of action have been identified and as such
they are currently estimated at zero for purposes of this Liquidation Analysis.
Other Items
The Company has reviewed off balance sheet items for other potential recoveries in the context of a
liquidation. These could consist of assignment of large rig contracts. Although in certain instances, these
contracts are transferrable, any value reflected in the transfer of the contracts is included in the liquidation
value of the rigs under contract as of the Conversion Date.
Claims
(k) Chapter 7 Admin Claims: Amount represents the estimated chapter 7 trustee costs, costs
of the trustee’s professionals, and chapter 7 operating expenses not captured elsewhere
in the analysis. The Liquidation Analysis assumes that the Chapter 7 trustee would be
compensated in accordance with the guidelines of section 326 of the Bankruptcy Code.
In addition, we have included an estimate for legal and financial professionals assisting
the trustee in the amount of $1 million per month for the first 3 months, $500,000 per
month for the next four months, and $250,000 per month for the remaining five months of
the liquidation period.
Operating costs incurred during the liquidation period were estimated based on management projections for
the twelve months following the Conversion Date. Operating expenses were forecasted on a per rig basis.
Page 8 of 9
Rigs currently under contracts that extend past the Conversion Date were assumed to continue operating
under their current operating structure until sold. Rigs currently under contracts that expire prior to the
Conversion Date were assumed to be warm stacked until liquidated. The remaining rigs were assumed to
remain warm stacked or cold stacked based on their current status. As rigs are liquidated over the twelve
month liquidation period, their operating expenses were removed accordingly. In addition, as the company
has already made significant cuts to general and administrative expenses (“G&A”) in the months leading up
to the bankruptcy filing, it is expected that G&A will remain at current projected levels for the first three
months as the company continues to operate contracted rigs and market them for sale and to aggressively
collect outstanding receivables. As rigs and vessels are sold, G&A steps down over the twelve month period
until eventually reaching zero.
(l) Priority Tax Claims: Reflects estimated unpaid tax claims as of the Conversion Date.
(m) Chapter 11 Admin Claims: Administrative expenses would primarily include estimates for
post-petition accounts payable and unpaid professional fees after the Conversion
Date. As there is only a short period of time expected between the Chapter 11 filing and
the Conversion Date, Chapter 11 Administrative claims were estimated at $3 million.
(n) Other Priority Claims: For purposes of this Liquidation Analysis, Other Priority Claims are
estimated at zero. Such amount is an estimate and the actual claims could be higher than
this estimate.
(o) Other Secured Claims: Currently the Debtor entities assume Other Secured Claims are
zero.
(p) Senior Note Claims: These claims are estimated at $1.2 billion, the approximate
outstanding principal balance of the Senior Notes Claims as of the bankruptcy
filing. Senior Note Claims are asserted against all the Debtor entities with Hercules
Offshore, Inc. as the borrower and all other Debtor entities as Guarantors.
(q) General Unsecured Claims: Includes trade claims and other accrued liabilities. The
Debtors’ estimate of $100.7 million of General Unsecured Claims is based on the
balance of payables and accrued liabilities as reflected on the Debtors’ books and
records as of May 21, 2015. Such amount is an estimate and the actual Allowed amount
of such claims could be either higher or lower than this estimate.
(r)
Intercompany Claims: Includes all intercompany notes and payables to non-Debtor
entities. Intercompany Claims of non-Debtor entities were estimated at $480.5M. Such
amount is an estimate and the actual Allowed amount of such claims could be higher or
lower than this estimate.
(s) Intercompany Interests: Represents the equity interests of one Debtor owned by another
Debtor.
(t) HERO Equity Interests: Represents the outstanding equity interest in Hercules Offshore,
Inc.

VALUATION ANALYSIS
REORGANIZED DEBTORS VALUATION
THIS VALUATION IS PRESENTED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING “ADEQUATE INFORMATION”
UNDER SECTION 1125 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND IS FOR THE SOLE USE BY THE DEBTORS AND
SHOULD NOT BE USED OR RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OR
SALE OF SECURITIES OF, OR CLAIMS OR INTERESTS IN, THE DEBTORS.
THE VALUATION INFORMATION SET FORTH HEREIN REPRESENTS A HYPOTHETICAL VALUATION OF THE
REORGANIZED DEBTORS, WHICH ASSUMES THAT SUCH REORGANIZED DEBTORS CONTINUE AS AN
OPERATING BUSINESS. THE ESTIMATED VALUE SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION DOES NOT PURPORT TO
CONSTITUTE AN APPRAISAL OR NECESSARILY REFLECT THE ACTUAL MARKET VALUE THAT MIGHT BE
REALIZED THROUGH A SALE OR LIQUIDATION OF THE REORGANIZED DEBTORS, THEIR SECURITIES OR
THEIR ASSETS, WHICH MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ESTIMATE SET FORTH IN THIS
SECTION. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH ESTIMATED VALUE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE PRICES AT
WHICH ANY SECURITIES OF THE REORGANIZED DEBTORS MAY TRADE AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE
TRANSACTIONS SET FORTH IN THE PLAN. ANY SUCH PRICES MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN
INDICATED BY THIS VALUATION.
The Debtors have been advised by their financial advisor, Lazard Freres & Co. LLC (“Lazard”), with respect to
the estimated going concern value of the Reorganized Debtors. Lazard assisted in the analysis to determine
the value available for distribution to holders of Allowed Claims pursuant to the Plan. The estimated
theoretical total value available for distribution to holders of Allowed Claims (the “Enterprise Value”) consists
of the estimated value of the Reorganized Debtors’ operations on a going-concern basis and the value of
excess cash on the Assumed Effective Date (defined below). The valuation analysis herein is based on
information as of the date of the Disclosure Statement. The valuation analysis assumes that the reorganization
takes place on September 30, 2015 (the “Assumed Effective Date”) and is based on projections provided by
the Debtors’ management (“Financial Projections”) for 2015 to 2019.
Based on the Financial Projections and solely for purposes of the Plan, the estimated Enterprise Value of the
Reorganized Debtors falls within a range from approximately $535 million to approximately $725 million,
which is used herein as of the value of the Reorganized Debtors’ operations on a going-concern basis. For
purposes of this valuation, it has been assumed that no material changes that would affect value occur
between the date of the Disclosure Statement and the Assumed Effective Date. Based on an estimated net debt
balance of approximately $133 million1 as contemplated in the Plan as of September 30, 2015, the resulting
implied range of value for the equity of the Reorganized Debtors is approximately $402 million to
approximately $592 million. These values do not give effect to the potentially dilutive impact of any equity
issued upon exercise of any warrants or any equity under any management equity incentive program. These
estimates of Enterprise Value do not constitute an opinion as to fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration to be received under the Plan or of the terms and provisions of the Plan.

$317 million of excess cash.

THE ASSUMED ENTERPRISE VALUE AND EQUITY VALUE RANGES, AS OF THE ASSUMED EFFECTIVE
DATE, REFLECT WORK PERFORMED BY LAZARD AND THE DEBTORS AND ON THE BASIS OF
INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF JULY 2015. ALTHOUGH SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS MAY AFFECT
CONCLUSIONS, NEITHER LAZARD, NOR THE DEBTORS HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE, REVISE OR
REAFFIRM THE ESTIMATE.
Lazard assumed that the Financial Projections were reasonably prepared in good faith and on a basis
reflecting the Debtors’ most accurate currently available estimates and judgments as to the future operating
and financial performance of the Reorganized Debtors. The estimated Enterprise Value and Equity Value
ranges assume the Reorganized Debtors will achieve their Financial Projections in all material respects,
including revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and cash flows as projected. If the business performs at levels
below or above those set forth in the Financial Projections, such performance may have a materially negative
or positive impact, respectively, on Enterprise Value and Equity Value. In estimating the Enterprise Value,
Lazard: (a) reviewed certain historical financial information of the Debtors for recent years and interim
periods, which is limited; (b) reviewed certain internal financial and operating data of the Debtors, including
the Financial Projections; (c) discussed the Debtors’ operations and future prospects with the senior
management team and third-party advisors; (d) reviewed certain publicly available financial data for, and
considered the market value of, public companies that Lazard deemed generally relevant in analyzing the
value of the Reorganized Debtors; (e) considered certain economic and industry information relevant to the
operating businesses; and (f) conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as it
deemed appropriate. Lazard assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other
information furnished to it by the Debtors’ management as well as publicly available information.
In addition, Lazard did not independently verify the Financial Projections in connection with preparing
estimates of Enterprise Value and Equity Value, and no independent valuations or appraisals of the Debtors
were sought or obtained for this purpose. Such estimates were developed solely for purposes of the
formulation and negotiation of the Plan, and to provide “adequate information” pursuant to section 1125 of
the Bankruptcy Code.
The estimated Enterprise Value and Equity Value do not constitute a recommendation to any holder of
Allowed Claims as to how such person should vote or otherwise act with respect to the Plan. Lazard has not
been asked to and does not express any view as to what the trading value of the Reorganized Debtors’
securities would be on issuance at any time. The estimated Enterprise Value and Equity Value of the
Reorganized Debtors set forth herein does not constitute an opinion as to fairness from a financial point of
view to any person of the consideration to be received by such person under the Plan or of the terms and
provisions of the Plan.
Lazard’s estimate of Enterprise Value reflects the application of standard valuation techniques and does not
purport to reflect or constitute appraisals, liquidation values or estimates of the actual market value that may
be realized through the sale of any securities, which may be significantly different than the amounts set forth
herein. The value of an operating business is
2
subject to numerous uncertainties and contingencies that are difficult to predict and will fluctuate with
changes in factors affecting the financial condition and prospects of such a business. As a result, the
estimated Enterprise Value and Equity Value ranges of the Reorganized Debtors set forth herein is not
necessarily indicative of actual outcomes, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those set
forth herein. Neither the Reorganized Debtors, Lazard, nor any other person assumes responsibility for any
differences between the Enterprise Value or Equity Value ranges and such actual outcomes. Actual market
prices of any securities will depend upon, among other things, the operating performance of the Reorganized
Debtors, prevailing interest rates, conditions in the financial markets, the anticipated holding period of
securities received, developments in the Reorganized Debtors’ industry and economic conditions generally
and other factors which generally influence the prices of securities.
THE PREPARATION OF A VALUATION ESTIMATE INVOLVES VARIOUS DETERMINATIONS AS TO THE MOST
APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT METHODS OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND THE APPLICATION OF THESE
METHODS IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND, THEREFORE, SUCH AN ESTIMATE IS NOT READILY
SUITABLE TO SUMMARY DESCRIPTION. IN PERFORMING THEIR ANALYSES, LAZARD AND THE DEBTORS
MADE NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE, BUSINESS AND
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER MATTERS. THE ANALYSES PERFORMED BY LAZARD ARE NOT
NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL VALUES OR FUTURE RESULTS, WHICH MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE OR LESS FAVORABLE THAN SUGGESTED BY SUCH ANALYSES.

undergoing maintenance, repairs, upgrades and may or may not be actively marketed depending on the
length of stay in the shipyard. Rigs described as “en route” are in the process of moving to and from various
locations, and may or may not be earning revenue during this period. 
(2) Contract dayrates shown in the table above are full contract operating dayrates, which may include
estimated contractual adjustments for changes in operating costs and reimbursable cost items for operating
expenses such as crew and may also include additional services and personnel that may be requested by the
customer from time-to-time. However, the dayrates do not include certain non-recurring revenues such as
lump sum mobilizations and demobilizations. The actual dayrate over the term of the contract could be lower
and could be substantially lower and or subject to numerous risks as disclosed in the Company’s filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Lower dayrates typically apply when the rig is under contract but
not fully operating, including periods when the rig is moving, waiting on weather, on standby, down for
repairs or maintenance or during other operational delays or events of force majeure. 
(3) Estimated contract duration is an estimate based on current belief by our customers as to the remaining
days to complete the project, subject to the satisfaction of regulatory or permitting requirements that are in
effect, including those that may impact the ability of our customers to timely obtain drilling permits. 
(4) Average backlog based on rigs available for hire and actively marketed. 
(5) Dayrate recalculated quarterly and ranges from a minimum of $75,000 when Crude Oil Brent price is
$86/bbl or less, to a maximum of $125,000 when Crude Oil Brent price is $125/bbl or more. 
(6) Contract expiration between 09/30/2015 and three years post commencement of contract (04/08/2013) at
discretion of customer. 
(7) Hercules Offshore (“Hercules”) acts as operations and maintenance manager for the rig, owned by a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd (“Perisai”). Hercules will receive a daily
management fee of approximately $4,000 per rig, payable starting at the contract commencement date, and a
daily operational fee equal to 12% of the rig-based EBITDA. Hercules will be reimbursed for all operating
expenses and Perisai will pay for all capital expenditures with respect to the rig.

than $90 million for the Company; provided that any such reduction in revenue backlog attributable to a
contract with a customer shall be netted against any additional revenue attributable to extension, amendment
or renegotiation of an existing contract or execution of a new contract with such customer and/or any of such
customer’s affiliates within three (3) days of the occurrence of the reduction, or (z) the termination,
replacement, resignation, or other change in the identity, of the CEO of the Company (for the avoidance of

any such Indemnified Person may become subject arising out of or in connection with this Commitment
Letter, the First Lien Exit Facility, the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the First Lien
Exit Facility, the use of the proceeds thereof or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding (a

of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the foregoing, provided that
the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any Indemnified Person, apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities

jurisdiction to arise from (a) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person or (b) the
material breach by such Indemnified Person of its obligations under this Commitment Letter or any of the
First Lien Loan Documents. In the case of a Proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies,
such indemnity will be effective whether or not such claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought

Party or any other person or an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.
In addition, (a) all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented fees,
disbursements and other charges of one law firm acting as counsel (and any local counsel reasonably
necessary in all relevant jurisdictions and special counsel reasonably necessary) and one financial advisory

Parties selected pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above shall be Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP (“Akin
Gump”) and Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. (“Blackstone”), respectively.

Lien Exit Facility on a several, and not joint, basis with any other Commitment Party. No Indemnified Party
will have any liability (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Company or any of its affiliates or any of
their respective security holders or creditors for or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
except to the extent such liability is determined by a final, nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to arise from (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person or (b) the

Indemnified Person. None of the Indemnified Persons nor any Loan Party shall be liable for any indirect,
special, punitive or consequential damages in connection with this Commitment Letter, the First Lien Exit
Facility or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

its own or its affiliates’ account or the account of customers, and hold positions in loans, securities or
options on loans or securities of, or claims against, you, your affiliates and of other companies that may be
the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter. You also acknowledge that the
Commitment Parties and their respective affiliates have no obligation to use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, or to furnish to you, confidential information obtained from other
companies or persons. You acknowledge for United States securities law purposes that any Commitment
Party may establish an information blocking device or “Information Barrier” between, on the one hand, its

Exchange Act) and, on the other hand, its affiliates and its and their attorneys, accountants, financial or other
advisors, members, equityholders, partners, directors and employees who, pursuant to such Information
Barrier policy, are permitted to receive confidential information or otherwise participate in discussions
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby, and those of such Commitment Party’s, and its affiliates’,
other employees. You acknowledge the potential existence of any Commitment Party’s Information Barrier but
do not warrant or guarantee any Commitment Party’s compliance with United States securities law or that the
Information Barrier will operate in accordance with its intended purpose.
You further acknowledge and agree that (a) no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between you and the
Commitment Parties is intended to be or has been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Commitment Letter, irrespective of whether the Commitment Parties have advised or are advising you
on other matters, (b) the Commitment Parties, on the one hand, and you, on the other hand, have an arm’s
length business relationship that does not directly or indirectly give rise to, nor do you rely on, any fiduciary
duty to you or your affiliates on the part of the Commitment Parties, (c) you are capable of evaluating and
understanding, and you understand and accept, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by this Commitment Letter, (d) you have been advised that the Commitment Parties are engaged
in a broad range of transactions that may involve interests that differ from your interests and that the
Commitment Parties have no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to you, (e) you have
consulted your own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent you have deemed appropriate,
(f) each Commitment Party has been, is, and will be acting solely as a principal and, except as otherwise
expressly agreed in writing by it and the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an
advisor, agent or fiduciary for you, any of your affiliates or any other person or entity and (g) none of the
Commitment Parties has any obligation or duty (including any implied duty) to you or your affiliates with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein or in any
other express writing executed and delivered by such Commitment Party and you or any such affiliate.
Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Commitment Parties are advising you as to any
legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. You shall consult with your own
advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making your own independent investigation
and appraisal of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter, and the Commitment Parties shall
not have any responsibility or liability to you with respect thereto. Any review by the Commitment Parties of
the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter or other matters relating thereto will be performed
solely for the benefit of the Commitment Parties and shall not be on behalf of you or any of your affiliates.
7. Confidentiality
This Commitment Letter is delivered to you on the understanding that neither this Commitment Letter nor any
of its terms or substance shall be disclosed by you, directly or indirectly, to any other person except (a) to
your and your subsidiaries’ respective officers, directors, attorneys, accountants, agents and advisors, in
each case on a confidential and
7
need-to-know basis, (b) to the extent required in any legal, judicial or administrative proceeding or as
otherwise required by law or regulation (in which case you agree, to the extent permitted by law, to inform us
promptly in advance thereof), (c) in the Approved Plan, in the Disclosure Statement (as defined in the RSA) or
in a Bankruptcy Court filing in order to implement the transactions contemplated hereunder (provided, that at
the request of the Commitment Parties, certain parts shall be redacted and not filed publicly) , (d) upon notice
to the Commitment Parties, in connection with any public filing requirement you are legally obligated to
satisfy and agreed to by the Commitment Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and (e) with respect to the Term Sheet only, to S&P and Moody’s, on a confidential basis, in
connection with obtaining ratings for the First Lien Exit Facility.
Each of the Commitment Parties shall use all nonpublic information provided to them by you or on behalf of
you by any of your representatives hereunder solely in connection with the First Lien Exit Facility or the
Restructuring and shall treat confidentially all such information; provided that nothing herein shall prevent
any Commitment Party from disclosing any such information (i) pursuant to the order of any court or
administrative agency or in any legal, judicial or administrative proceeding, or otherwise as required by
applicable law, regulation or compulsory legal process (in which case such Commitment Party agrees to
inform you promptly thereof prior to such disclosure to the extent timely practicable and not prohibited by
law, rule, regulation or other legal process), (ii) upon the request or demand of any regulatory authority

informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information of this type
confidential, (v) for purposes of establishing a “due diligence” defense, (vi) to the extent that such information
is or was received by such Commitment Party from a third party that is not to such Commitment Party’s
knowledge subject to confidentiality obligations to you, (vii) to the extent that such information is
independently developed by such Commitment Party or (viii) to potential participants, assignees or potential
counterparties to any swap, credit insurance or derivative transaction relating to the Company or any of their
its subsidiaries or any of their respective obligations, in each case, who agree to be bound by confidentiality
and use restrictions. The provisions of this paragraph shall automatically terminate and be superseded by the
confidentiality provisions to the extent covered in the definitive documentation for the First Lien Exit Facility
upon the initial funding thereunder and shall in any event automatically terminate one year following the date
of this Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, this Commitment Letter does not limit
the disclosure of any tax strategies.
8. Exclusivity
You agree that, from the date hereof until the earliest of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Commitment Letter, you will not and you will not permit any of your affiliates to, syndicate or issue, attempt
to syndicate or issue, announce or authorize the
8
announcement of syndication or issuance of, or engage in discussions concerning the syndication or
issuance of, any debt securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities (other than the First Lien Exit
Facility) (an “Alternate Financing”) without the prior written consent of the Required Commitment Parties. You
further agree that promptly upon your receipt of any written alternative proposal for Alternate Financing
received by the Debtors after the date hereof, you will provide to Akin Gump and Blackstone a copy of any
such alternative proposal. You also agree that if you or any of your affiliates enter into any Alternate
Financing, the terms and conditions (and the documentation with regard thereto) of such Alternate Financing

Alternate Financing without the consent of the Required Commitment Parties, without limiting any other
rights and remedies of the Commitment Parties under this Commitment Letter or applicable law, you agree to
pay to each Commitment Party, the remaining put option premium of 1.00% of the principal amount of the
First Lien Exit Facility, ratably based on their commitments to fund the First Lien Exit Facility, that would
have been payable upon consummation of the Approved Plan as described in the Term Sheet at the time a
commitment is executed in connection with the Alternate Financing.
9. Miscellaneous
This Commitment Letter shall not be assignable by you without the prior written consent of each Commitment
Party (and any purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void), is intended to be solely for

to limitations under applicable law and exceptions satisfactory to the
Commitment Parties, including with respect to immaterial
subsidiaries with de minimis assets and revenue (subject to
thresholds reasonably satisfactory to the Required Commitment
Parties); provided that with respect to foreign subsidiaries formed or
acquired after the Closing Date, such foreign subsidiaries will not be
required to guarantee the obligations under the First Lien Exit
Facility to the extent such guarantees would be prohibited by
applicable law, are not within the legal capacity of the relevant
subsidiary or would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of
applicable fiduciary duties of the directors of the relevant subsidiary.2
The Borrower and the Guarantors are referred to herein as “Loan
Parties” and each, a “Loan Party”.

and (ii) the aggregate assets of such entities, as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for
which financial statements are available prior to the Closing Date, is less than or equal to 2.0%

shall be paid out to the Borrower upon satisfaction of the conditions
set forth under “Escrow Account” below. The remaining amount of
