<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 10/7 
entitled &#8220;Human rights of persons with disabilities: national frameworks for the promotion 
and protection of the human rights of persons with disabilities&#8221;. In resolution 10/7, the 
Human Rights Council decided that the next interactive debate on the rights of persons with 
disabilities would be held at its thirteenth session and that it would focus on the structure 
and role of national mechanisms for the implementation and monitoring of the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the Convention). 
</p><p>2. To support this debate, the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;to prepare a study to enhance awareness of the structure and 
role of national mechanisms for the implementation and monitoring of the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including 
States, regional organizations, civil society organizations, including organizations of 
persons with disabilities, and national human rights institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. In consulting with stakeholders in the preparation of this study, OHCHR had 
received, at the time of writing this report, 95 written submissions from States, national 
human rights institutions, civil society organizations, including organizations of persons 
with disabilities, and independent experts. OHCHR also organized a one-day open-ended 
consultation on the theme of the study on 26 October 2009 in Geneva and participated in 
relevant expert and other meetings during the year.  
</p>
<p>4. The findings and recommendations which emerged from the consultative process 
have informed the content of the study. The full texts of all submissions received and the 
informal summary of the OHCHR consultation are available on the OHCHR website.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b>5. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted by 
consensus by the General Assembly in resolution 61/106 on 13 December 2006. The 
Convention and its Optional Protocol were opened for signature on 30 March 2007 and 
entered into force on 3 May 2008 following the deposit of the twentieth instrument of 
ratification. The Optional Protocol also entered into force on the same date, following the 
deposit of the tenth instrument of ratification.  
</p>
<p>6. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the first human rights 
treaty that comprehensively details all human rights of persons with disabilities and 
clarifies the obligations of States to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. Despite being 
entitled to protection under all human rights treaties through the cross-cutting principle of 
equality and non-discrimination, persons with disabilities had by and large remained 
&#8220;invisible&#8221; in the human rights system and absent from the human rights discourse. The 
entry into force of the Convention therefore fills an important protection gap in 
international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>7. The Convention marks a paradigm shift in attitudes and approaches to persons with 
disabilities. It endorses a so-called social model that recognizes disability as the result of 
&#8220;the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental 
</p>

<p>barriers&#8221;.2 On this basis, article 1 states that the purpose of the Convention is &#8220;to promote, 
protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent 
dignity&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>8. The Convention reaffirms that persons with disabilities enjoy the same human rights 
as everyone else in the civil, cultural, economic, political and social spheres. In order to 
ensure an environment conducive to the fulfilment of the rights of persons with disabilities, 
the Convention also includes articles on awareness-raising, accessibility, situations of risk 
and humanitarian emergencies, access to justice, personal mobility, habilitation and 
rehabilitation, as well as statistics and data collection.4 
</p>
<p>9. At the time of the of submission of the present report, 76 States had ratified the 
Convention and 48 the Optional Protocol, while 143 and 87 States respectively were 
signatories to the 2 instruments.5 The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
is the first human rights treaty that is open for confirmation or accession by regional 
integration organizations. The European Community is a signatory to the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Implementation and monitoring of the Convention 
</b>10. In accordance with article 4 of the Convention, States that ratify the Convention 
agree to promote and ensure the full respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
for all persons with disabilities, without discrimination of any kind. For this, States Parties 
are required to &#8220;adopt all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the 
implementation of the rights recognized in the present Convention&#8221;.6 Implementation is 
therefore the process whereby States parties take action to ensure the realization of all 
rights contained in a given treaty within their jurisdiction.7 
11. In all human rights treaties, the implementation obligation is closely linked to a 
monitoring component. The monitoring of human rights treaties is needed to assess whether 
measures to implement the treaty are adopted and applied, but also to evaluate their results 
and therefore provide feedback for implementation. Monitoring mechanisms foster 
accountability and, over the long term, strengthen the capacity of parties to treaties to fulfil 
their commitments and obligations. 
</p>
<p>12. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides for monitoring 
of the implementation of the Convention both at the international and national level.

<p>GE.09-17748 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>13. At the international level, the Convention provides for monitoring through three 
procedures. In the first instance, the Convention regulates, on grounds similar to other 
human rights treaties, a reporting procedure. States and regional integration organizations 
which are parties to the Convention commit to periodically reporting on measures taken to 
give effect to their obligations under the Convention and on the progress made in this 
regard.  
</p>
<p>14. These reports are examined by an international committee of independent experts, 
namely the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This Committee has the 
mandate to consider the reports of parties to the Convention and make suggestions and 
recommendations to the parties for strengthening implementation of the Convention. 
Monitoring also takes place through an individual communication procedure and an inquiry 
procedure. Both these procedures are subject to ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. National level 
</b></p>
<p>15. At the national level, article 33 of the Convention requires States parties to put in 
place a structure tasked with implementing and monitoring the Convention. The inclusion 
of a norm detailing national implementation and monitoring structures and their functions 
at national level is unprecedented in a human rights treaty, with the partial exception of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which requires ratifying States to set up a national 
preventive mechanism.9 
</p>
<p>16. In the Convention, the implementation and monitoring functions are conceptually 
separated and the responsibility is assigned to distinct entities.  
</p>
<p>17. Article 33, paragraph 1, emphasizes domestic implementation, placing responsibility 
with governments. To avoid blurring of responsibility across government or uncoordinated 
action, the Convention requires States to designate one or more focal points with 
responsibility for the implementation of the Convention within government and to consider 
the establishment of a coordination mechanism.  
</p>
<p>18. Article 33, paragraph 2, on the other hand, requires States parties to have or put in 
place a framework to protect, promote and monitor the implementation of the Convention. 
The notion of independence is central to the framework, which must include an 
independent entity established and functioning on the basis of the principles relating to the 
status and functioning of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (the Paris Principles).10 
</p><p>19. Article 33, paragraph 3 requires that civil society and in particular persons with 
disabilities and their respective organizations shall be involved and participate fully in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 Through the individual communications procedure, the Committee is mandated to receive 
</p>
<p>communications (complaints) from an individual or a group of individuals alleging a violation of the 
Convention. Through the inquiry procedure, the Committee is mandated to investigate allegations of 
gross or systematic violations of the Convention.

</p>
<p>monitoring process, in line with the principle of participation of persons with disabilities 
that permeates the treaty. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. National implementation and monitoring of article 33 of the 
Convention 
</b>20. In relation to other human rights treaties, treaty bodies have often addressed issues 
concerning the implementation and monitoring of the respective conventions at national 
level in their concluding observations and recommendations on the reports of States parties 
or in general comments. Recommendations on implementation have often highlighted the 
need for the establishment or strengthening of effective national machineries and 
institutions, for coordination within government and between government and civil society, 
and rigorous monitoring of implementation which &#8220;should be built into the process of 
government at all levels but also [requires] independent monitoring by national human 
rights institutions, NGOs and others&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>21. The incorporation of provisions on national implementation and monitoring in the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been commended as a measure to 
consolidate the institutional preconditions necessary to ensure the realization of the 
Convention at domestic level.12 
</p>
<p><b> A. Focal point(s) 
</b>22. According to the Convention, the first element of the institutional structure that 
States parties need to put in place is to designate one or more focal points within 
government for matters related to the implementation of the Convention. National focal 
points on disability issues are already in place in most Governments, including as a result of 
the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons 
with Disabilities.13 As such, implementation of article 33, paragraph 1 might require a 
reconsideration of existing structures rather than the establishment of new entities.  
</p>
<p>23. While it is not helpful to attempt to describe detailed national arrangements for very 
different systems of government, some key general considerations should be taken into 
account. 
</p>
<p>24. For the effective implementation of the Convention, it might be advisable to adopt a 
two-pronged approach and appoint focal points at the level of each or most governmental 
departments/ministries as well as designate one overall focal point within government 
responsible for the implementation of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>25. The designation of disability focal points at the level of government ministries 
responds to the recognition that the full and effective implementation of the Convention

<p>GE.09-17748 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>requires action by most, if not all, government ministries. Such focal points should 
represent the respective ministry in the national coordination mechanism also provided for 
in article 33, paragraph 1. Their mandate should include promoting awareness of the 
Convention within the ministry, participation in the development of an action plan on the 
Convention, and monitoring and reporting on implementation within their functional lines.  
</p>
<p>26. The appointment of one overall focal point for the Convention within government, at 
the same time responds to the need to ensure the existence of a general oversight and 
promotion role. In this perspective, the following considerations are of relevance.  
</p>
<p>27. In the first instance, the paradigm shift endorsed by the Convention on the 
understanding of disability, away from medical and social understanding to one of human 
rights, needs to be reflected in the choice of focal point. As such, designation of the 
ministry of health as the government focal point should be avoided, as should the 
designation of special education departments within ministries of education, as is currently 
the case in some systems. Similarly, placement of the focal point within ministries of 
welfare and labour as is the practice in the majority of States parties should be reviewed 
and ministries with responsibility for justice and human rights should be preferred. 
Australia, by way of example, designated the Attorney-General&#8217;s Department as the joint 
focal point for implementing the Convention.14 
</p>
<p>28. Secondly, implementation of the Convention requires traction at the most senior 
level of government. Placing the focal point on the Convention close to the heart of 
government, such as in the Office of the President or the Prime Minister, or the Cabinet 
Office, would be ideal. Some States parties have already implemented this approach, in 
accordance with their own system of government. In South Africa, for example, the Office 
on the Status of Disabled Persons (OSDP) is one of the Directorates in the Presidency, 
alongside the Office on the Status of Women and the Office on the Rights of the Child.15 
Australia has a Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities, who reports to the Prime 
Minister.16 Where ministers in charge of disability are not part of the Cabinet, this might 
hamper the robustness of the focal points structure.  
</p>
<p>29. Thirdly, the mandate of the focal point should clearly focus on developing and 
coordinating a coherent national policy on the Convention. As such, the focal point should 
promote, guide, inform and advise government on matters related to the implementation of 
the Convention but arguably not implement it by delivering disability support services. The 
mandate of the focal point could also include coordination of government action on the 
Convention in respect of reporting, monitoring, awareness-raising and liaising with the 
independent monitoring framework designated under article 33, paragraph 2 of the 
Convention. Furthermore, the focal point should represent the channel for civil society and 
organizations of persons with disabilities to communicate with government on the 
implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>30. In the fourth instance, the focal point within government needs to be adequately 
supported in terms of technical staff and resources. Therefore maintaining the structure 
supporting the focal point within large ministries so as to take advantage of economies of

</p>
<p>scale could in some cases be helpful.17 In such cases, it might be useful to explicitly 
recognize the independence of the focal point structure from the parent ministry.18 
</p>
<p>31. Few States have so far proceeded to formally designate focal points for the 
Convention and some of the responses received for this study seemed to suggest that such 
functions would fall &#8220;implicitly&#8221; amongst the tasks carried out by existing disability focal 
points within government. However, the good practice of States, such as Guatemala or 
Slovenia, that have formally designated entities as focal points for the Convention should 
be highlighted, as well as the practice of States such as Spain that have officially revised the 
mandate of existing entities to explicitly include the focal point function.19 
</p>
<p>32. Beside functional focal points in concerned ministries, article 33, paragraph 1 should 
also be read to refer to States with multiple levels of government, so that disability focal 
points could be designated at the local, regional and national/federal level.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Coordination mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>33. In addition to the establishment of focal points, article 33, paragraph 1 also requests 
States to &#8220;give due consideration to the establishment or designation of a coordination 
mechanism within government to facilitate related action in different sectors and at 
different levels&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>34. Several States have in place coordination mechanisms on disability issues, pre-
dating in some cases the ratification of the Convention. Notwithstanding existing 
differences, coordinating committees usually include representatives from various 
ministries and organizations of persons with disabilities, and also other civil society 
organizations, the private sector and trade unions. Their mandate often focuses on policy 
development, promotion of dialogue in the disability field, awareness-raising and similar 
functions. Often these committees have a staffed secretariat, in several cases housed within 
ministries of social welfare.  
</p>
<p>35. As noted in some of the submissions received, effectiveness of existing coordination 
mechanisms is often low, according to organizations of persons with disabilities.20 Lack of 
a clear legal mandate, lack of resources made available for the functioning of the 
coordination mechanisms, limited involvement of persons with disabilities or exclusion of 
persons with certain types of disabilities, are some of the obstacles most commonly faced 
by existing structures.21 Furthermore, laws establishing coordinating structures have often 
not been operationalized through the adoptions of rules and regulations. In some cases this 
also applies to coordinating frameworks established by States upon ratification of the 
Convention, with the result that such structures are in reality not operational or functioning.

<p>36. Ratification of the Convention offers an important opportunity for the strengthening 
of existing structures where necessary or for their establishment. Where more than one 
focal point within government is appointed, it would seem appropriate that such focal 
points participate in the coordination mechanism. The mechanism should ideally be chaired 
by the focal point within government with the key responsibility for the implementation of 
the Convention. Through inter-ministerial action and participation in the mechanism, 
government agencies will be able to focus their activity and policy development on areas 
where they have an added value, avoid duplication and make the best use of limited 
resources. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Monitoring framework 
</b></p>
<p>37. Article 33, paragraph 2 of the Convention requires States to have or put in place at 
national level a framework that includes one or more independent mechanisms, to promote, 
protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. The Convention specifies that when 
designating or establishing the independent mechanism/s to be included in the framework, 
States shall take into account the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>38. Article 33 does not prescribe a unique organizational form for the national 
monitoring framework and States parties are free to determine the appropriate structure 
according to their political and organizational context. Options can range from the 
attribution of the monitoring function to a single entity, i.e. one independent mechanism; a 
framework consisting of more than one independent mechanism; or a framework consisting 
of various entities, amongst which one or more independent mechanisms are included.  
</p>
<p>39. Suitable entities are already in place in some States. In others, implementation of 
article 33, paragraph 2 requires the establishment of a new entity or the transformation of 
existing entities. 
</p>
<p>40. The experience of the States that, according to submissions received, have taken 
formal steps towards the implementation of the monitoring framework shows that they have 
all assigned the function to a single-entity framework and not to multiple entities. With 
regard to the choice of such entities, however, the approach has been diverse: for example, 
Germany and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have designated 
their existing national human rights institutions; Spain has designated the national 
federation of organizations of persons with disabilities, CERMI; and Austria has 
established a new mechanism, the Independent Monitoring Committee.22 
</p>
<p>41. Whatever the organizational structure, three key requirements need to be given 
effect in the monitoring framework: 
</p>
<p> (a) The framework must include one or more independent mechanisms that take 
into account the Paris Principles. This does not mean that only entities complying with the 
Paris Principles should be included in the framework, but that at least one mechanism that 
is established and functions on the basis of the Paris Principles must be part of the 
framework;23 
</p>
<p> (b) The framework established or designated must be capable of adequately 
carrying out its mandate to promote, protect and monitor the implementation of the

<p>Convention. This means that the framework needs to be given an adequate mandate and the 
institutional capacity required to effectively perform its functions. 
</p>
<p> (c) Civil society and in particular persons with disabilities and their 
representative organizations need to be involved and fully participate in the monitoring 
process.  
</p>
<p>42. Only a few States that have made written submissions to this study provided detailed 
information as to the process and steps taken at national level towards establishing or 
designating a monitoring framework. Formal designation has taken place only in a few 
countries such as Austria, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. On the other hand, 
several States indicated that consultations to explore options and make recommendations on 
the structure and role of the framework were ongoing at national level, such as in the 
Republic of Korea, Mexico, and Oman.24 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The independent mechanism and the Paris Principles 
</b></p>
<p>43. States that have conducted consultations have explored the suitability of existing 
entities as possible components of the monitoring framework. Entities that have been 
considered include legislative committees, national human rights institutions, organizations 
of persons with disabilities, parliamentary ombudsmen, national disability councils, 
government agencies delivering disability-related services, government agencies for 
disability policy coordination, and others. 
</p>
<p>44. While allowing States to consider their legal and administrative specificities in the 
establishment of such frameworks, article 33, paragraph 2 harnesses government 
accountability by requiring the presence of independent entities in the framework. From 
this perspective, the Paris Principles provide important guidance to identify the 
characteristics the framework should overall possess, while accepting that not all 
components of the framework need to be fully compliant with the Paris Principles. At the 
very minimum, paragraph 2 requires that the framework shall include at least one 
independent mechanism that functions on the basis of the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>45. The Paris Principles identify four main characteristics which should apply to the 
independent mechanisms under article 33 of the Convention and should be considered to 
apply to the overall framework: 
</p>
<p> (a) Competence and responsibilities: national human rights institution, and, in 
the context of article 33, the independent mechanism established under the Convention, 
shall be given as broad a mandate as possible which shall be clearly set forth in a 
constitutional or legislative text. Responsibilities shall include: reporting to the Government 
on human rights matters; harmonization of national legislation, regulations and practices 
with international human rights standards; encouraging ratification of international human 
rights instruments; contributing to report of State to United Nations treaty bodies and 
committees; cooperating with international, regional and other national human rights 
institutions; assisting in human rights education; and publicizing and promoting human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) Composition, independence and pluralism: independence is guaranteed 
through the means of: composition, which should ensure the pluralist representation of 
social forces in the country; sufficient funding and infrastructure, not to be subject to 
financial control by government; and appointment by official act, establishing the mandate; 
</p>
<p>

<p>GE.09-17748 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p> (c) Methods of operation: the Principles require that a national human rights 
institution, and the independent framework in article 33, shall freely consider any questions 
falling within its/their competence from whatever source it/they see/s fit. There is also a 
reference to maintaining consultation with the other bodies responsible for human rights 
issues and with non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (d) The fourth characteristic concerns the status of institutions with quasi-judicial 
competence, which are authorized to hear and consider complaints and petitions. In the 
exercise of these functions, institutions can conciliate or issue binding decisions, hear any 
complaints or petitions or transmit them, inform the party of remedies available and 
promote access to them. 
</p>
<p>46. On the basis of these criteria, it is apparent that some of the entities considered by 
States in the context of the establishment of the monitoring framework do not meet the 
criteria to be designated as the independent mechanism. Guarantees of independence, for 
example, would disqualify government commissions as well as some national observatories 
on disabilities that have recently been established in some countries. Similar concerns have 
been raised by some national disability secretariats that include government representatives 
on their executive boards as well as national disability councils. Non-governmental 
organizations, by definition, generally enjoy great structural independence from executive 
government. However, the degree of independence of a non-governmental organization in 
reality can vary, and generally is not legally guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>47. These entities can nevertheless make an important contribution to promoting, 
protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention, in their own right and as an 
element of the framework. The opportunities resulting from cooperation with the 
monitoring framework are well highlighted in some submissions, one of which notes, that 
&#8220;a key task in the remit to monitor implementation of the Convention is to gather and 
coordinate material from other initiatives and analyse this in relation to human rights&#8221;. 
There is ample potential for information collected by other government agencies, with 
mandates in sectors related to the Convention, to be used in the monitoring framework.25  
</p>
<p><b> 2. A role for national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>48. Existing national human rights institutions have the potential to be designated as the 
independent mechanism performing functions under paragraph 2, and in fact, it has been 
said the default setting lies in favour of National Institutions doing the heavy lifting with 
respect to the article 33.2 tasks.26 Nowadays, over a hundred national human rights 
institutions have been established worldwide, 64 of which are accredited with the 
International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC).27 
Notwithstanding existing differences, the majority of existing national human rights 
institutions can be grouped together in three broad categories: &#8220;human rights commissions&#8221;, 
&#8220;ombudsmen&#8221; and &#8220;institutes&#8221;.

</p>
<p>49. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the first human rights 
convention that includes an explicit role for national human rights institutions in promoting, 
protecting and monitoring implementation of a treaty at national level. Treaty bodies 
monitoring other human rights treaties have however often interpreted the general 
obligation to adopt all measures necessary to give effect to the treaty to include the 
establishment of a national human rights institution.28 The Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, in particular, issued a general comment on the role of national human rights 
institutions in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child in which it clarified 
that it &#8220;considers the establishment of such bodies to fall within the commitment made by 
States parties upon ratification to ensure the implementation of the Convention&#8221;29 and that 
&#8220;the role of national human rights institutions is to monitor independently the State&#8217;s 
compliance and progress towards implementation [of the Convention] and to do all it can to 
ensure full respect for children&#8217;s rights&#8221;.30 
</p>
<p>50. On the basis of the submissions received, there seems to be a fair awareness amongst 
States parties of the role their national human rights institutions can play with regard to the 
protection, promotion and monitoring of the implementation of the Convention. Several 
national human rights institutions in fact have long-established records of engagement on 
the theme which derive from their broad human rights mandate and often precede the 
ratification of the Convention in their respective countries. To illustrate this, several 
national human rights commissions such as those in Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa 
and Togo have focal points or departments on the rights of persons with disabilities. Several 
ombudsmen have similar experiences for instance in Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and 
Peru.31  
</p>
<p>51. Notwithstanding this wide engagement of national human rights institutions in the 
rights of persons with disabilities, only a few States have taken formal steps to designate 
their national human rights institutions as the independent mechanism of the framework. 
Positive examples include Germany32 which has formally designated the German Institute 
for Human Rights as the independent mechanism and the United Kingdom33 which has 
designated the Equality and Human Rights Commissions, the Scottish Human Rights 
Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights and Equality Commissions in the 
devolved administrations, in accordance with article 33, paragraph 2. Other States, such as 
Latvia, have reported that they are taking formal steps in this same direction.34  
</p>
<p>52. On the other hand, some submissions seem to implicitly assume the attribution of 
the promotion, protection and monitoring functions of the Convention to the national 
human rights institution without a formal designation. Naturally, national institutions do not 
have to wait for the Convention to be ratified to become engaged in the rights of persons 
with disabilities. However, formal designation can represent an important opportunity for 
strengthening the entity concerned and contribute to the effective implementation of its 
functions.

<p>53. The process of formally designating a national human rights institution can include a 
reflection on the adequacy of the mandate of the institution for the purpose of article 33, 
which in some cases might reveal opportunities for strengthening compliance with the Paris 
Principles. The submission of Sweden, for example, notes that the current mandate of the 
Equality Ombudsman is limited in scope and suggests its expansion.35  
</p>
<p>54. In other cases, a review of how persons with disabilities participate in existing 
national human rights institutions may highlight the need to revise the composition of the 
institution and strengthen pluralism. The German Institute for Human Rights, for example, 
upon its designation expanded the composition of its board to include an organization of 
persons with disabilities.36 
</p>
<p>55. It should also be noted that the designation of a national human rights institution as 
the independent mechanism will most likely require internal structural changes, and that 
additional financial and human resources will almost always be required. The Ombudsman 
of Azerbaijan, the Guatemalan Ombudsman, the Kenyan Human Rights Commission and 
the New Zealand Human Rights Commission all highlight in their submissions 
organizational issues and in some cases concern at the impact the designation could have on 
existing limited resources.37  
</p>
<p>56. Where no entities exist at national level in line with the Paris Principles, 
consideration should be given to establishing such an institution. The submission by the 
Netherlands, for example, states that a national human rights institution that complies with 
the Paris Principles will be established for the tasks arising from article 33, paragraph 2.38 
Similarly, the Austrian Independent Monitoring Committee on the Convention, on the basis 
of its self-assessment of non-compliance with the Paris Principles, has recommended the 
establishment of a national human rights institution that complies with the Principles.39 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Organizational form 
</b></p>
<p>57. As mentioned earlier, article 33 of the Convention does not prescribe a unique 
organizational form for the national monitoring framework. Beside appointment of a single 
independent mechanism to carry out functions under article 33, paragraph 2, the 
Convention also foresees the possibility that more than one independent mechanism be 
appointed in the framework, as appropriate, with the effect that States in fact establish a 
&#8220;mechanism of mechanisms&#8221; to promote, protect and monitor implementation. 
</p>
<p>58. This possibility seems to address States parties with multiple levels of government, 
such as federal states and analogous entities. The United Kingdom, for example, which has 
in place a system of devolved executive and legislative powers in Scotland and Northern 
Ireland, has designated as independent mechanisms institutions operating both at central 
government level and in the devolved administrations.40 Some federal states such as 
Argentina or Mexico already have in place State-level human rights commissions or 
ombudsmen which could be potentially designated as the independent mechanism. Belgium

</p>
<p>is also consulting with regions and communities with a view to designating the mechanisms 
and the structure of the framework at national and local levels.41  
</p>
<p>59. Based on the particular constitutional structure and other political and geographic 
considerations in a State, the independent mechanism of a federal State could arguably be 
either a unified federal body, or a system with multiple bodies. Furthermore, designation 
could come from either the federal government and/or the devolved administration within 
the limits of its territorial jurisdiction and competence. In all cases, it should be 
remembered that ultimate responsibility for the implementation of the treaty lies at State 
party level. While acknowledging the differences between the conventions, the experiences 
of some decentralized States in establishing or designating national preventive mechanisms 
under the Optional Protocol of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment could be a useful reference for exploring suitable 
approaches in the implementation of article 33.42  
</p>
<p>60. Article 33, paragraph 2, appears also to allow States to designate multiple 
mechanisms by thematic divisions of responsibility, so that, &#8220;conceivably, a plurality of 
such mechanisms might be engaged depending on the function to be performed&#8221;.43 In 
Northern Ireland, the Equality Commission and the Human Rights Commission have been 
jointly designated as mechanisms in the framework.44 On the one hand, it is clear that the 
scope of the Convention goes beyond anti-discrimination; on the other, the experience of 
the Equality Commission in terms of promotion and enforcement of anti-discrimination law 
on the grounds of disability appears central to the effective implementation of the 
promotion, protection and monitoring mandate assigned to the framework.  
</p>
<p>61. As noted in some submissions, a range of other entities could also play a significant 
role in the context of the framework, beside the central role played by the national human 
rights institution. The submission of New Zealand, by way of example, highlights the role 
of the Health and Disability Commissioner, the Ombudsman, the Children&#8217;s Commissioner 
and the Mental Health Commission.45 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4.  Protect, promote and monitor implementation 
</b></p>
<p>62. Besides taking into account the Paris Principle in the status and functioning of the 
independent mechanism, the monitoring framework needs also to be equipped with a 
mandate adequate to effectively perform its functions under the Convention.  
</p>
<p>63. Although the heading of article 33 uses the term monitoring, it is important to note 
that paragraph 2 actually refers to States establishing a framework to &#8220;promote, protect and 
monitor&#8221; implementation of the Convention and its Optional Protocol. An examination of 
the activities that can be considered to fall under these three general headings can help 
States parties in deciding the organizational structure of the framework and in highlighting 
opportunities for institutional strengthening. 
</p>
<p>64. Promotion of the implementation of the Convention includes a broad range of 
activities. These activities should include not only awareness-raising activities such as the 
ones highlighted in article 8 of the Convention, but also express a more strategic

<p>engagement in the promotion of the implementation of the Convention. For example, this 
could include: scrutiny for compliance of existing national legislation, regulations and 
practices, as well as draft bills and other proposals, to ensure they are consistent with the 
requirements of the Convention; and provisions of technical advice to public authorities or 
other agencies in construing and applying the Convention, including on the basis of 
observations and recommendations and general comments issued by the Committee on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>65. Human rights impact assessments, as tools that measure the impact of policies or 
other interventions on human rights, could prove particularly useful to Governments in 
assessing what measures to adopt for the purpose of promoting implementation of the 
Convention.46 By way of reference, it should be noted that some treaty bodies have 
recommended that States parties conduct human rights impact assessments in relation to 
their treaty obligations. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
recommended that human rights impact assessments &#8220;be made an integral part of every 
proposed piece of legislation or policy initiative&#8221;.47 
</p>
<p>66. Protection under the Convention can include a broad range of different activities that 
range from the investigation and examination of individual and group complaints to taking 
cases to court, to the conducting of inquiries and issuance of reports.  
</p>
<p>67. Monitoring the implementation of the Convention can be approached from multiple 
perspectives. On one hand, it can be achieved through assessing progress, stagnation or 
retrogression in the enjoyment of rights over a certain period of time. The development of 
indicators and benchmarks is a particularly effective way to monitor implementation, 
particularly with regard to the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights 
in the Convention.48  
</p>
<p>68. Another approach with which many human rights institutions are familiar is that of 
monitoring human rights violations, a common methodology of which is the collection or 
keeping of records of the complaints filed by alleged victims before relevant judicial or 
quasi-judicial complaints mechanisms. Considering the specific barriers persons with 
disabilities have traditionally faced in accessing justice, this data should be integrated with 
information on violations from other sources, such as civil society organizations and 
organizations of persons with disabilities participating in the framework. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The participation of civil society  
</b></p>
<p>69. Article 33, paragraph 3, requires the involvement and full participation of civil 
society and in particular of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations 
in the monitoring process. This requirement further specifies the general principle of 
participation of persons with disabilities in article 3 of the Convention and the general 
obligation in article 4, paragraph 3, of the Convention to closely consult with and actively 
involve persons with disabilities through their representative organizations in the

</p>
<p>development and implementation of legislation and policies to implement the Convention 
and in all decision-making processes relating to persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>70. The requirement to involve persons with disabilities applies to all parts of article 33, 
and not only to the monitoring process. In this sense, any consultation on the establishment 
of the monitoring framework should naturally involve representative organizations of 
persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>71. Article 33, paragraph 3, arguably seems to include both direct participation of 
persons with disabilities in the monitoring process, as well as indirect participation, through 
representative organizations. Direct participation of persons with disabilities in the 
monitoring process can take place for example by having experts who are persons with 
disabilities to participate in the work of the monitoring framework. Some national human 
rights institutions have commissioners who are persons with disabilities or have persons 
with disabilities on their executive boards.  
</p>
<p>72. At the same time, the requirement to ensure that organizations representing persons 
with disabilities be included in the monitoring process should also be noted. It is 
recommended that an open discussion take place with organizations of persons with 
disabilities to identify the criteria on which organizations could be considered to be 
representative of such constituencies. Various consultations held with organizations of 
persons with disabilities indicate a strong preference in favour of national umbrella 
organizations.49  
</p>
<p>73. The potential of having both national human rights institutions and organizations of 
persons with disabilities as the independent mechanism and as a participating entity of the 
monitoring framework respectively, should be duly explored. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>74. <b>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the first treaty that 
contains specific requirements on its national implementation and monitoring. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The establishment or designation of adequate implementation and monitoring 
structures, in accordance with article 33, will strengthen the implementation of the 
Convention at national level. Monitoring is particularly needed to assess the adoption 
and effective implementation of measures and their actual impact.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Convention distinguishes implementation of the Convention from 
protection, promotion and monitoring of its implementation. While implementation is 
the responsibility of government, protection, promotion and monitoring requires the 
leadership of national entities established in line with the Paris Principles and the 
participation of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations. 
According to the Convention, the two functions should not be assigned to one single 
entity.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Government agencies responsible for the implementation of the Convention 
need to be provided with effective institutional arrangements that include a focal point 
system and a coordination structure.
