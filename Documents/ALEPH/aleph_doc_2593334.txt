SEITEL ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2016 RESULTS
HOUSTON, August 10, 2016 - Seitel, Inc., a leading provider of seismic data to the oil and gas
industry, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Second Quarter Highlights -
•Total revenue was $24.3 million compared to $30.7 million in Q2 2015.
•Cash resales totaled $19.1 million compared to $15.1 million in Q2 2015.
•Cash flows from operating activities were ($5.9) million compared to $1.0 million in Q2 2015.
•Cash EBITDA was $15.0 million compared to $10.0 million in Q2 2015.
•Net loss was $9.2 million compared to $2.3 million in Q2 2015.
First Six Months Highlights -
•Total revenue was $36.3 million compared to $55.0 million in 2015.
•Cash resales totaled $21.8 million compared to $27.3 million in 2015.
•Cash flows from operating activities were $4.8 million compared to $46.0 million in 2015.
•Cash EBITDA was $13.3 million compared to $16.7 million in 2015.
•Net loss was $23.1 million compared to $9.9 million in 2015.
“We were very pleased with the $19.1 million level of cash resales achieved in the second
quarter. Some clients are beginning to take advantage of improving economics and M&A
opportunities,” commented Rob Monson, chief executive officer and president. “Although we
have begun to see some improvement in activity from our client base, the volatility and
uncertainty of crude oil prices continues to put pressure on E&P companies. Our outlook for the
remainder of the year remains cautious as we think seismic spending will continue to fluctuate
quarter to quarter.”
Total revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $24.3 million, consisting of acquisition
underwriting revenue of $4.9 million, resale licensing revenue of $19.1 million and Solutions and
other revenue of $0.4 million. This compares to total revenue of $30.7 million in the second
quarter of 2015, consisting of acquisition underwriting revenue of $10.4 million, resale licensing
revenue of $20.0 million and Solutions and other revenue of $0.3 million. The decrease in
acquisition underwriting revenue was due to a planned reduction in new data acquisition projects
as a result of the current industry environment. Our new data acquisition activity in the second
quarter of 2016 occurred in the U.S. with a focus in the Permian unconventional play as well as
activity in Northern Louisiana. Cash resales, a component of resale licensing revenue, were
$19.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to cash resales of $15.1 million in the
second quarter of 2015.
Total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $36.3 million compared to $55.0
million for the same period last year. Acquisition underwriting revenue was $9.9 million for the
first six months of 2016 compared to $22.2 million in the first six months of 2015. This decrease
was primarily attributable to the planned reduction in activity discussed above. Total resale
licensing revenue was $25.5 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $31.7 million in
the first six months of 2015. For the first six months of 2016, cash resales were $21.8 million
compared to $27.3 million in the first six months of 2015 reflecting reduced capital spending by
our E&P clients as a result of the continued low commodity price environment. Solutions and
other revenue was $0.9 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $1.1 million in the first
six months of 2015. Solutions revenue is primarily driven by the level of seismic revenue;
therefore, the decrease between the six-month periods resulted from the lower level of seismic
revenue activity.
Our net loss was $9.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $2.3
million for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in the loss between quarters was primarily
due to a reduction in revenues and higher amortization of our
(more)
seismic data library partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
expenses and higher income tax benefit. Our net loss was $23.1 million in the first six months of
2016 compared to $9.9 million in the first six months of 2015. The increase in loss between the
six month periods was primarily due to a reduction in revenues and lower income tax benefit
offset slightly by lower SG&A expenses and lower amortization of our seismic data library.
Cash flows from operating activities were ($5.9) million in the second quarter 2016 compared to
$1.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. The reduction between the periods was primarily due
to reduced collections on cash resales as a result of the low level of cash resale activity in the
first quarter of 2016. Cash flows from operating activities were $4.8 million for the first six months
of 2016 compared to $46.0 million for the first six months of 2015. The decrease between periods
was primarily due to the first six months of 2015 including significant collections from cash resale
activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the reduced level of cash resales and lower
acquisition underwriting revenue in 2016.
Cash EBITDA, generally defined as cash resales and solutions revenue less cash operating
expenses (excluding severance and various non-routine items), was $15.0 million in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to $10.0 million in the same period last year. The increase from the
second quarter of 2015 was the result of higher cash resales and lower cash SG&A expenses.
Cash EBITDA was $13.3 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $16.7 million in the
first half of last year. The decrease from the first half of 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a
reduction in cash resales partially offset by lower routine cash SG&A expenses.
SG&A expenses were $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $5.5 million in the
second quarter of last year. The decrease from the second quarter of 2015 to the second quarter
of 2016 was primarily due to savings of $0.7 million in salaries and benefits from reduced
headcount throughout 2015 and 2016 through attrition and layoffs in October 2015 and February
2016. SG&A expenses were $10.6 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to $11.9
million in the same period last year. The decrease from the first half of 2015 primarily consisted of
a $2.1 million decrease in routine overhead costs partially offset by an increase in non-routine
costs of $1.0 million. The reduction in routine overhead costs in the six month periods mainly
consisted of savings of $1.5 million in salaries and benefits from reduced headcount.
Additionally, variable compensation was lower in the first six months of 2016 by $0.2 million
resulting from lower revenue activity. Non-routine costs were primarily made up of termination
benefits of $0.9 million related to layoffs of personnel in 2016.
In August 2016, we had a further reduction of headcount in our Canadian operations as we
consolidate and centralize certain functions. Currently, we estimate that this reduction, along with
other cost saving measures implemented to date, should result in our 2016 SG&A expenses,
excluding severance and other non-routine costs, being approximately $3.0 million less than our
routine SG&A expenses for the full year of 2015.
We expect our net cash capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $4.0 million. In the
first six months of 2016, our net cash capital expenditures totaled $(0.1) million caused by
acquisition underwriting revenue being in excess of gross capital costs due to a revision to the
previous estimated costs related to one of our new data acquisition surveys, resulting in a
reduction of the gross costs of approximately $2.5 million. Gross capital expenditures for the first
six months of 2016 were $10.8 million, of which $9.0 million related to new data acquisition. Our
current backlog of capital expenditures related to acquisition programs is $11.2 million, of which
we have obtained underwriting of $11.1 million, reflecting approximately 99% underwriting. We
expect all of the work on these projects to occur in 2016.

Cash resales represent new contracts for data licenses from our library, including data currently
in progress, payable in cash. We believe cash resales are an important measure of our operating
performance and are useful in assessing overall industry and client activity. Cash resales are
likely to fluctuate quarter to quarter as they do not require the longer planning and lead times
necessary for new data creation. Cash resales were $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2016
compared to $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $21.8 million in the first six months
of 2016 compared to $27.3 million in the first six months of 2015.

Cash EBITDA represents cash generated from licensing data from our seismic library net of
recurring cash operating expenses. We believe this measure is helpful in determining the level of
cash from operations we have available for debt service and funding of capital expenditures (net
of the portion funded or underwritten by our customers). Cash EBITDA includes cash resales
plus all other cash revenues other than from data acquisitions, less cost of goods sold and cash
selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding severance and other non-routine costs).

directly comparable GAAP financial measure, cash flows from operating activities (in thousands):

Net cash capital expenditures represent total capital expenditures less cash underwriting
revenue from our clients and non-cash additions to the seismic data library. We believe this
measure is important as it reflects the amount of capital expenditures funded from our operating
cash flow. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and our estimate for the year ending December 31, 2016 and shows how
net cash capital expenditures (a non-GAAP financial measure) are derived from total capital
expenditures, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):
