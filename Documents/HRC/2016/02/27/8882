<p><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 3 April 2009, the President of the Human Rights Council established the United 
Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict with the mandate &#8220;to investigate all 
violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have 
been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza 
during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or 
after.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>2. The President appointed Justice Richard Goldstone, former judge of the Constitutional 
Court of South Africa and former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the 
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to head the Mission. The other three appointed members were: 
Professor Christine Chinkin, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics 
and Political Science, who was a member of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun 
(2008); Ms. Hina Jilani, Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and former Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, who was a 
member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (2004); and Colonel Desmond 
Travers, a former Officer in Ireland&#8217;s Defence Forces and member of the Board of Directors of 
the Institute for International Criminal Investigations.   
</p>
<p>3. As is usual practice, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) established a secretariat to support the Mission. 
</p>
<p>4. The Mission interpreted the mandate as requiring it to place the civilian population of the 
region at the centre of its concerns regarding the violations of international law.  
</p>
<p>5. The Mission convened for the first time in Geneva between 4 and 8 May 2009. 
Additionally, the Mission met in Geneva on 20 May, on 4 and 5 July, and between 1 and 4 
August 2009. The Mission conducted three field visits: two to the Gaza Strip between 30 May 
and 6 June, and between 25 June and 1 July 2009; and one visit to Amman on 2 and 3 July 2009. 
Several staff of the Mission&#8217;s secretariat were deployed in Gaza from 22 May to 4 July 2009 to 
conduct field investigations. 
</p>
<p>6. Notes verbales were sent to all Member States of the United Nations and United Nations 
organs and bodies on 7 May 2009. On 8 June 2009, the Mission issued a call for submissions 
inviting all interested persons and organizations to submit relevant information and 
documentation to assist in the implementation of its mandate.  
</p>
<p>7. Public hearings were held in Gaza on 28 and 29 June and in Geneva on 6 and 7 July 2009.  
</p>
<p>8. The Mission repeatedly sought to obtain the cooperation of the Government of Israel. After 
numerous attempts had failed, the Mission sought and obtained the assistance of the Government 
of Egypt to enable it to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing.  
</p>
<p>9. The Mission has enjoyed the support and cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and of 
the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations. Due to the lack of 
cooperation from the Israeli Government, the Mission was unable to meet members of the </p>

 <p> 
Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The Mission did, however, meet officials of the 
Palestinian Authority, including a cabinet minister, in Amman. During its visits to the Gaza 
Strip, the Mission held meetings with senior members of the Gaza authorities and they extended 
their full cooperation and support to the Mission.   
</p>
<p>10. Subsequent to the public hearings in Geneva, the Mission was informed that a Palestinian 
participant, Mr. Muhammad Srour, had been detained by Israeli security forces when returning 
to the West Bank and became concerned that his detention may have been a consequence of his 
appearance before the Mission. The Mission is in contact with him and continues to monitor 
developments.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>11. To implement its mandate, the Mission determined that it was required to consider any 
actions by all parties that might have constituted violations of international human rights law or 
international humanitarian law. The mandate also required it to review related actions in the 
entire Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to temporal scope, the Mission decided to focus primarily on events, actions or 
circumstances occurring since 19 June 2008, when a ceasefire was agreed between the 
Government of Israel and Hamas. The Mission has also taken into consideration matters 
occurring after the end of military operations that constitute continuing human rights and 
international humanitarian law violations related to or as a consequence of the military 
operations, up to 31 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>13. The Mission also analysed the historical context of the events that led to the military 
operations in Gaza between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 and the links between these 
operations and overarching Israeli policies vis-&#224;-vis the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p>14. The Mission considered that the reference in its mandate to violations committed &#8220;in the 
context&#8221; of the December&#8211;January military operations required it to include restrictions on 
human rights and fundamental freedoms relating to Israel's strategies and actions in the context 
of its military operations. 
</p>
<p>15. The normative framework for the Mission has been general international law, the Charter 
of the United Nations, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and 
international criminal law.    
</p>
<p>16. This report does not purport to be exhaustive in documenting the very high number of 
relevant incidents that occurred in the period covered by the Mission&#8217;s mandate. Nevertheless, 
the Mission considers that the report is illustrative of the main patterns of violations. In Gaza, the 
Mission investigated 36 incidents. 
</p>
<p>17. The Mission based its work on an independent and impartial analysis of compliance by the 
parties with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law in the 
context of the recent conflict in Gaza, and on international investigative standards developed by 
the United Nations.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>18. The Mission adopted an inclusive approach to gathering information and seeking views. 
Information-gathering methods included: (a) the review of reports from different sources; (b) 
interviews with victims, witnesses and other persons having relevant information; (c) site visits 
to specific locations in Gaza where incidents had occurred; (d) the analysis of video and 
photographic images, including satellite imagery; (e) the review of medical reports about injuries 
to victims; (f) the forensic analysis of weapons and ammunition remnants collected at incident 
sites; (g) meetings with a variety of interlocutors; (h) invitations to provide information relating 
to the Mission&#8217;s investigation requirements; (i) the wide circulation of a public call for written 
submissions; (j) public hearings in Gaza and in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>19. The Mission conducted 188 individual interviews. It reviewed more than 300 reports, 
submissions and other documentation either researched of its own motion, received in reply to its 
call for submissions and notes verbales or provided during meetings or otherwise, amounting to 
more than 10,000 pages, over 30 videos and 1,200 photographs. 
</p>
<p>20. By refusing to cooperate with the Mission, the Government of Israel prevented it from 
meeting Israeli Government officials, but also from travelling to Israel to meet Israeli victims 
and to the West Bank to meet Palestinian Authority representatives and Palestinian victims.  
</p>
<p>21. The Mission conducted field visits, including investigations of incident sites, in the Gaza 
Strip. This allowed the Mission to observe first-hand the situation on the ground, and speak to 
many witnesses and other relevant persons.  
</p>
<p>22. The purpose of the public hearings, which were broadcast live, was to enable victims, 
witnesses and experts from all sides to the conflict to speak directly to as many people as 
possible in the region as well as in the international community. The Mission gave priority to the 
participation of victims and people from the affected communities. The 38 public testimonies 
covered facts as well as legal and military matters. The Mission had initially intended to hold 
hearings in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank. However, denial of access to Israel and the West 
Bank resulted in the decision to hold hearings of participants from Israel and the West Bank in 
Geneva.  
</p>
<p>23. In establishing its findings, the Mission sought to rely primarily and whenever possible on 
information it gathered first-hand. Information produced by others, including reports, affidavits 
and media reports, was used primarily as corroboration.   
</p>
<p>24. The Mission&#8217;s final conclusions on the reliability of the information received were based 
on its own assessment of the credibility and reliability of the witnesses it met, verifying the 
sources and the methodology used in the reports and documents produced by others, cross-
referencing the relevant material and information, and assessing whether, in all the 
circumstances, there was sufficient credible and reliable information for the Mission to make a 
finding in fact.   
</p>
<p>25. On this basis, the Mission has, to the best of its ability, determined what facts have been 
established. In many cases it has found that acts entailing individual criminal responsibility have 
been committed. In all of these cases the Mission has found that there is sufficient information to 
establish the objective elements of the crimes in question. In almost all of the cases the Mission 
has also been able to determine whether or not it appears that the acts in question were done </p>

 <p> 
deliberately or recklessly or in the knowledge that the consequence that resulted would result in 
the ordinary course of events. The Mission has thus referred in many cases to the relevant fault 
element (mens rea). The Mission fully appreciates the importance of the presumption of 
innocence: the findings in the report do not subvert the operation of that principle. The findings 
do not attempt to identify the individuals responsible for the commission of offences nor do they 
pretend to reach the standard of proof applicable in criminal trials. 
</p>
<p>26. In order to provide the parties concerned with an opportunity to submit additional relevant 
information and express their position and respond to allegations, the Mission also submitted 
comprehensive lists of questions to the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the 
Gaza authorities in advance of completing its analysis and findings. The Mission received replies 
from the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza authorities but not from Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Facts investigated by the Mission, factual and legal findings 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Occupied Palestinian Territory: the Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The blockade 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Mission focused (chap. V) on the process of economic and political isolation imposed 
by Israel on the Gaza Strip, generally referred to as a blockade. The blockade comprises 
measures such as restrictions on the goods that can be imported into Gaza and the closure of 
border crossings for people, goods and services, sometimes for days, including cuts in the 
provision of fuel and electricity. Gaza&#8217;s economy is further severely affected by the reduction of 
the fishing zone open to Palestinian fishermen and the establishment of a buffer zone along the 
border between Gaza and Israel, which reduces the land available for agriculture and industry. In 
addition to creating an emergency situation, the blockade has significantly weakened the 
capacities of the population and of the health, water and other public sectors to respond to the 
emergency created by the military operations.  
</p>
<p>28. The Mission holds the view that Israel continues to be duty-bound under the Fourth 
Geneva Convention and to the full extent of the means available to it to ensure the supply of 
foodstuff, medical and hospital items and other goods to meet the humanitarian needs of the 
population of the Gaza Strip without qualification. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Overview of Israel&#8217;s military operations in the Gaza Strip and casualties 
</b></p>
<p>29. Israel deployed its navy, air force and army in the operation it codenamed &#8220;Operation Cast 
Lead&#8221;. The military operations in the Gaza Strip included two main phases, the air phase and the 
air-land phase, and lasted from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009. The Israeli offensive 
began with a week-long air attack, from 27 December until 3 January 2009. The air force 
continued to play an important role in assisting and covering the ground forces from 3 January to 
18 January 2009. The army was responsible for the ground invasion, which began on 3 January 
2009, when ground troops entered Gaza from the north and the east. The available information 
indicates that the Golani, Givati and Paratrooper Brigades and five Armoured Corps Brigades 
were involved. The navy was used in part to shell the Gaza coast during the operations. Chapter 
VI also locates the incidents investigated by the Mission, described in chapters VII to XV, in the 
context of the military operations.   </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>30. Statistics about Palestinians who lost their lives during the military operations vary. Based 
on extensive field research, non-governmental organizations place the overall number of persons 
killed between 1,387 and 1,417. The Gaza authorities report 1,444 fatalities. The Government of 
Israel provides a figure of 1,166. The data provided by non-governmental sources on the 
percentage of civilians among those killed are generally consistent and raise very serious 
concerns about the way Israel conducted the military operations in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>31. According to the Government of Israel, during the military operations there were four 
Israeli fatalities in southern Israel, of whom three were civilians and one a soldier. They were 
killed by rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian armed groups. In addition, nine Israeli soldiers 
were killed during the fighting inside the Gaza strip, four of whom as a result of friendly fire. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Attacks by Israeli forces on government buildings and persons  
of the Gaza authorities, including police 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Israeli armed forces launched numerous attacks against buildings and persons of the 
Gaza authorities. As far as attacks on buildings are concerned, the Mission examined the Israeli 
strikes against the Palestinian Legislative Council building and the Gaza main prison (chap. VII). 
Both buildings were destroyed and can no longer be used. Statements by Israeli Government and 
armed forces representatives justified the attacks arguing that political and administrative 
institutions in Gaza are part of the &#8220;Hamas terrorist infrastructure&#8221;. The Mission rejects this 
position. It finds that there is no evidence that the Legislative Council building and the Gaza 
main prison made an effective contribution to military action. On the information available to it, 
the Mission finds that the attacks on these buildings constituted deliberate attacks on civilian 
objects in violation of the rule of customary international humanitarian law whereby attacks must 
be strictly limited to military objectives. These facts further indicate the commission of the grave 
breach of extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out 
unlawfully and wantonly. 
</p>
<p>33. The Mission examined the attacks against six police facilities, four of them during the first 
minutes of the military operations on 27 December 2008, resulting in the death of 99 policemen 
and nine members of the public. Overall, the approximately 240 policemen killed by Israeli 
forces constitute more than one sixth of the Palestinian casualties. The circumstances of the 
attacks seem to indicate, and the Government of Israel&#8217;s July 2009 report on the military 
operations confirm, that the policemen were deliberately targeted and killed on the ground that 
the police, as an institution or a large part of the policemen individually, are, in the Government 
of Israel&#8217;s view, part of the Palestinian military forces in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>34. To examine whether the attacks against the police were compatible with the principle of 
distinction between civilian and military objects and persons, the Mission analysed the 
institutional development of the Gaza police since Hamas took complete control of Gaza in July 
2007 and merged the Gaza police with the &#8220;Executive Force&#8221; it had created after its election 
victory. The Mission finds that, while a great number of the Gaza policemen were recruited 
among Hamas supporters or members of Palestinian armed groups, the Gaza police were a 
civilian law-enforcement agency. The Mission also concludes that the policemen killed on 27 
December 2008 cannot be said to have been taking a direct part in hostilities and thus did not 
lose their civilian immunity from direct attack as civilians on this basis. The Mission accepts that 
there may be individual members of the Gaza police that were at the same time members of </p>

 <p> 
Palestinian armed groups and thus combatants. It concludes, however, that the attacks against the 
police facilities on the first day of the armed operations failed to strike an acceptable balance 
between the direct military advantage anticipated (i.e. the killing of those policemen who may 
have been members of Palestinian armed groups) and the loss of civilian life (i.e. the other 
policemen killed and members of the public who would inevitably have been present or in the 
vicinity), and therefore violated international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b>4. Obligation on Palestinian armed groups in Gaza to take feasible precautions to 
protect the civilian population and civilian objects  
</b></p>
<p>35. The Mission examined whether and to what extent the Palestinian armed groups violated 
their obligation to exercise care and take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian 
population in Gaza from the inherent dangers of the military operations (chap. VIII). The 
Mission was faced with a certain reluctance by the persons it interviewed in Gaza to discuss the 
activities of the armed groups. On the basis of the information gathered, the Mission found that 
Palestinian armed groups were present in urban areas during the military operations and 
launched rockets from urban areas. It may be that the Palestinian combatants did not at all times 
adequately distinguish themselves from the civilian population. The Mission found no evidence, 
however, to suggest that Palestinian armed groups either directed civilians to areas where attacks 
were being launched or that they forced civilians to remain within the vicinity of the attacks.  
</p>
<p>36. Although the incidents investigated by the Mission did not establish the use of mosques for 
military purposes or to shield military activities, it cannot exclude that this might have occurred 
in other cases. The Mission did not find any evidence to support the allegations that hospital 
facilities were used by the Gaza authorities or by Palestinian armed groups to shield military 
activities or that ambulances were used to transport combatants or for other military purposes. 
On the basis of its own investigations and the statements by United Nations officials, the Mission 
excludes that Palestinian armed groups engaged in combat activities from United Nations 
facilities that were used as shelters during the military operations. The Mission cannot, however, 
discount the possibility that Palestinian armed groups were active in the vicinity of such United 
Nations facilities and hospitals. While the conduct of hostilities in built-up areas does not, of 
itself, constitute a violation of international law, Palestinian armed groups, where they launched 
attacks close to civilian or protected buildings, unnecessarily exposed the civilian population of 
Gaza to danger. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Obligation on Israel to take feasible precautions to protect the civilian 
population and civilian objects in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Mission examined how the Israeli armed forces discharged their obligation to take all 
feasible precautions to protect the civilian population of Gaza, including particularly the 
obligation to give effective advance warning of attacks (chap. IX). The Mission acknowledges 
the significant efforts made by Israel to issue warnings through telephone calls, leaflets and radio 
broadcasts, and accepts that in some cases, particularly when the warnings were sufficiently 
specific, they encouraged residents to leave an area and get out of harm&#8217;s way. However, the 
Mission also notes factors that significantly undermined the effectiveness of the warnings issued. 
These include the lack of specificity and thus credibility of many pre-recorded phone messages 
and leaflets. The credibility of instructions to move to city centres for safety was also diminished 
by the fact that the city centres themselves had been the subject of intense attacks during the air </p>

 <p> 
phase of the military operations. The Mission also examined the practice of dropping lighter 
explosives on roofs (so-called roof knocking). It concludes that this technique is not effective as 
a warning and constitutes a form of attack against the civilians inhabiting the building. Finally, 
the Mission stresses that the fact that a warning was issued does not relieve commanders and 
their subordinates of taking all other feasible measures to distinguish between civilians and 
combatants. 
</p>
<p>38. The Mission also examined the precautions taken by the Israeli armed forces in the context 
of three specific attacks they launched. On 15 January 2009, the field office compound of the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in 
Gaza City came under shelling with high explosive and white phosphorous munitions. The 
Mission notes that the attack was extremely dangerous, as the compound offered shelter to 
between 600 and 700 civilians and contained a huge fuel depot. The Israeli armed forces 
continued their attack over several hours despite having been fully alerted to the risks they 
created. The Mission concludes that the Israeli armed forces violated the requirement under 
customary international law to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and method of 
attack with a view to avoiding and in any event minimizing incidental loss of civilian life, injury 
to civilians and damage to civilian objects. 
</p>
<p>39. The Mission also finds that, on the same day, the Israeli armed forces directly and 
intentionally attacked al-Quds hospital in Gaza City and the adjacent ambulance depot with 
white phosphorous shells. The attack caused fires which took a whole day to extinguish and 
caused panic among the sick and wounded who had to be evacuated. The Mission finds that no 
warning was given at any point of an imminent strike. On the basis of its investigation, the 
Mission rejects the allegation that fire was directed at the Israeli armed forces from within the 
hospital.  
</p>
<p>40. The Mission also examined the intense artillery attacks, again including white phosphorous 
munitions, on al-Wafa hospital in eastern Gaza City, a facility for patients receiving long-term 
care and suffering from particularly serious injuries. On the basis of the information gathered, 
the Mission found a violation of the prohibition of attacks on civilian hospitals in both cases. The 
Mission also highlights that the warnings given by leaflets and pre-recorded phone messages in 
the case of al-Wafa hospital demonstrate the complete ineffectiveness of certain kinds of routine 
and generic warnings. 
</p>
<p><b>6. Indiscriminate attacks by Israeli forces resulting in the loss  
of life and injury to civilians 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Mission examined the mortar shelling of al-Fakhura junction in Jabaliyah next to a 
UNRWA school, which, at the time, was sheltering more than 1,300 people (chap. X). The 
Israeli armed forces launched at least four mortar shells. One landed in the courtyard of a family 
home, killing 11 people assembled there. Three other shells landed on al-Fakhura Street, killing 
at least a further 24 people and injuring as many as 40. The Mission examined in detail 
statements by Israeli Government representatives alleging that the attack was launched in 
response to a mortar attack from an armed Palestinian group. While the Mission does not 
exclude that this may have been the case, it considers the credibility of Israel&#8217;s position damaged 
by the series of inconsistencies, contradictions and factual inaccuracies in the statements 
justifying the attack.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>42. In drawing its legal conclusions on the attack on al-Fakhura junction, the Mission 
recognizes that, for all armies, decisions on proportionality, weighing the military advantage to 
be gained against the risk of killing civilians, will present very genuine dilemmas in certain 
cases. The Mission does not consider this to be such a case. The firing of at least four mortar 
shells to attempt to kill a small number of specified individuals in a setting where large numbers 
of civilians were going about their daily business and 1,368 people were sheltering nearby 
cannot meet the test of what a reasonable commander would have determined to be an acceptable 
loss of civilian life for the military advantage sought. The Mission thus considers the attack to 
have been indiscriminate, in violation of international law, and to have violated the right to life 
of the Palestinian civilians killed in these incidents.  
</p>
<p><b>7. Deliberate attacks against the civilian population 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Mission investigated 11 incidents in which the Israeli armed forces launched direct 
attacks against civilians with lethal outcome (chap. XI). The facts in all bar one of the attacks 
indicate no justifiable military objective. The first two are attacks on houses in the al-Samouni 
neighbourhood south of Gaza City, including the shelling of a house in which Palestinian 
civilians had been forced to assemble by the Israeli armed forces. The following group of seven 
incidents concern the shooting of civilians while they were trying to leave their homes to walk to 
a safer place, waving white flags and, in some of the cases, following an injunction from the 
Israeli forces to do so. The facts gathered by the Mission indicate that all the attacks occurred 
under circumstances in which the Israeli armed forces were in control of the area and had 
previously entered into contact with or had at least observed the persons they subsequently 
attacked, so that they must have been aware of their civilian status. In the majority of these 
incidents, the consequences of the Israeli attacks against civilians were aggravated by their 
subsequent refusal to allow the evacuation of the wounded or to permit access to ambulances.  
</p>
<p>44. These incidents indicate that the instructions given to the Israeli armed forces moving into 
Gaza provided for a low threshold for the use of lethal fire against the civilian population. The 
Mission found strong corroboration of this trend in the testimonies of Israeli soldiers collected in 
two publications it reviewed.  
</p>
<p>45. The Mission further examined an incident in which a mosque was targeted with a missile 
during early evening prayers, resulting in the death of 15 people, and an attack with flechette 
munitions on a crowd of family and neighbours at a condolence tent, killing five. The Mission 
finds that both attacks constitute intentional attacks against the civilian population and civilian 
objects. 
</p>
<p>46. From the facts ascertained in all the above cases, the Mission finds that the conduct of the 
Israeli armed forces constitutes grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention in respect of 
wilful killings and wilfully causing great suffering to protected persons and, as such, give rise to 
individual criminal responsibility. It also finds that the direct targeting and arbitrary killing of 
Palestinian civilians is a violation of the right to life. 
</p>
<p>47. The last incident concerns the bombing of a house resulting in the killing of 22 family 
members. Israel&#8217;s position in this case is that there was an &#8220;operational error&#8221; and that the 
intended target was a neighbouring house storing weapons. On the basis of its investigation, the 
Mission expresses significant doubts about the Israeli authorities&#8217; account of the incident. The </p>

 <p> 
Mission concludes that, if a mistake was indeed made, there could not be said to be a case of 
wilful killing. State responsibility of Israel for an internationally wrongful act would, however, 
remain. 
</p>
<p><b>8. The use of certain weapons 
</b></p>
<p>48. Based on its investigation of incidents involving the use of certain weapons such as white 
phosphorous and flechette missiles, the Mission, while accepting that white phosphorous is not at 
this stage proscribed under international law, finds that the Israeli armed forces were 
systematically reckless in determining its use in built-up areas. Moreover, doctors who treated 
patients with white phosphorous wounds spoke about the severity and sometimes untreatable 
nature of the burns caused by the substance. The Mission believes that serious consideration 
should be given to banning the use of white phosphorous in built-up areas. As to flechettes, the 
Mission notes that they are an area weapon incapable of discriminating between objectives after 
detonation. They are, therefore, particularly unsuitable for use in urban settings where there is 
reason to believe civilians may be present. 
</p>
<p>49. While the Mission is not in a position to state with certainty that so-called dense inert 
metal explosive (DIME) munitions were used by the Israeli armed forces, it did receive reports 
from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of 
a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact. DIME weapons and 
weapons armed with heavy metal are not prohibited under international law as it currently 
stands, but do raise specific health concerns. Finally, the Mission received allegations that 
depleted and non-depleted uranium were used by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza. These 
allegations were not further investigated by the Mission. 
</p>
<p><b>9. Attacks on the foundations of civilian life in Gaza: destruction  
of industrial infrastructure, food production, water installations, 
sewage treatment plants and housing 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Mission investigated several incidents involving the destruction of industrial 
infrastructure, food production, water installations, sewage treatment plants and housing (chap. 
XIII). Already at the beginning of the military operations, el-Bader flour mill was the only flour 
mill in the Gaza Strip still operating. The flour mill was hit by a series of air strikes on 9 January 
2009, after several false warnings had been issued on previous days. The Mission finds that its 
destruction had no military justification. The nature of the strikes, in particular the precise 
targeting of crucial machinery, suggests that the intention was to disable the factory&#8217;s productive 
capacity. From the facts it ascertained, the Mission finds that there has been a violation of the 
grave breaches provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Unlawful and wanton destruction 
which is not justified by military necessity amounts to a war crime. The Mission also finds that 
the destruction of the mill was carried out to deny sustenance to the civilian population, which is 
a violation of customary international law and may constitute a war crime. The strike on the flour 
mill furthermore constitutes a violation of the right to adequate food and means of subsistence. 
</p>
<p>51. The chicken farms of Mr. Sameh Sawafeary in the Zeytoun neighbourhood south of Gaza 
City reportedly supplied over 10 per cent of the Gaza egg market. Armoured bulldozers of the 
Israeli armed forces systematically flattened the chicken coops, killing all 31,000 chickens 
inside, and destroyed the plant and material necessary for the business. The Mission concludes </p>

 <p> 
that this was a deliberate act of wanton destruction not justified by any military necessity and 
draws the same legal conclusions as in the case of the destruction of the flour mill. 
</p>
<p>52. The Israeli armed forces also carried out a strike against a wall of one of the raw sewage 
lagoons of the Gaza wastewater treatment plant, which caused the outflow of more than 200,000 
cubic metres of raw sewage onto neighbouring farmland. The circumstances of the strike suggest 
that it was deliberate and premeditated. The Namar wells complex in Jabaliyah consisted of two 
water wells, pumping machines, a generator, fuel storage, a reservoir chlorination unit, buildings 
and related equipment. All were destroyed by multiple air strikes on the first day of the Israeli 
aerial attack. The Mission considers it unlikely that a target the size of the Namar wells could 
have been hit by multiple strikes in error. It found no grounds to suggest that there was any 
military advantage to be had by hitting the wells and noted that there was no suggestion that 
Palestinian armed groups had used the wells for any purpose. Considering that the right to 
drinking water is part of the right to adequate food, the Mission makes the same legal findings as 
in the case of the el-Bader flour mill. 
</p>
<p>53. During its visits to the Gaza Strip, the Mission witnessed the extent of the destruction of 
residential housing caused by air strikes, mortar and artillery shelling, missile strikes, the 
operation of bulldozers and demolition charges. In some cases, residential neighbourhoods were 
subjected to air-launched bombing and to intensive shelling apparently in the context of the 
advance of Israeli ground forces. In others, the facts gathered by the Mission strongly suggest 
that the destruction of housing was carried out in the absence of any link to combat engagements 
with Palestinian armed groups or any other effective contribution to military action. Combining 
the results of its own fact-finding on the ground with UNOSAT satellite imagery and the 
published testimonies of Israeli soldiers, the Mission concludes that, in addition to the extensive 
destruction of housing for so-called operational necessity during their advance, the Israeli armed 
forces engaged in another wave of systematic destruction of civilian buildings during the last 
three days of their presence in Gaza, aware of their imminent withdrawal. The conduct of the 
Israeli armed forces in this respect violated the principle of distinction between civilian and 
military objects and amounted to the grave breach of &#8220;extensive destruction&#8230; of property, not 
justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly&#8221;. The Israeli armed 
forces furthermore violated the right to adequate housing of the families concerned. 
</p>
<p>54. The attacks on industrial facilities, food production and water infrastructure investigated 
by the Mission are part of a broader pattern of destruction, which includes the destruction of the 
only cement-packaging plant in Gaza (the Atta Abu Jubbah plant), the Abu Eida factories for 
ready-mix concrete, further chicken farms and the al-Wadiyah Group&#8217;s food and drinks factories. 
The facts ascertained by the Mission indicate that there was a deliberate and systematic policy on 
the part of the Israeli armed forces to target industrial sites and water installations. 
</p>
<p><b>10. The use of Palestinian civilians as human shields 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Mission investigated four incidents in which the Israeli armed forces coerced 
Palestinian civilian men at gunpoint to take part in house searches during the military operations 
(chap. XIV). The men were blindfolded and handcuffed as they were forced to enter houses 
ahead of the Israeli soldiers. In one of the incidents, Israeli soldiers repeatedly forced a man to 
enter a house in which Palestinian combatants were hiding. Published testimonies of Israeli 
soldiers who took part in the military operations confirm the continuation of this practice, despite </p>

 <p> 
clear orders from Israel&#8217;s High Court to the armed forces to put an end to it and repeated public 
assurances from the armed forces that the practice had been discontinued. The Mission 
concludes that this practice amounts to the use of Palestinian civilians as human shields and is 
therefore prohibited by international humanitarian law. It puts the right to life of the civilians at 
risk in an arbitrary and unlawful manner and constitutes cruel and inhuman treatment. The use of 
human shields also is a war crime. The Palestinian men used as human shields were questioned 
under threat of death or injury to extract information about Hamas, Palestinian combatants and 
tunnels. This constitutes a further violation of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>11. Deprivation of liberty: Gazans detained during the Israeli military  
operations of 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p>56. During the military operations, the Israeli armed forces rounded up large numbers of 
civilians and detained them in houses and open spaces in Gaza and, in the case of many 
Palestinian men, also took them to detention facilities in Israel. In the cases investigated by the 
Mission, the facts gathered indicate that none of the civilians was armed or posed any apparent 
threat to the Israeli soldiers. Chapter XV of the report is based on the Mission&#8217;s interviews with 
Palestinian men who were detained, as well as on its review of other relevant material, including 
interviews with relatives and statements from other victims submitted to it.  
</p>
<p>57. From the facts gathered, the Mission finds that numerous violations of international 
humanitarian law and human rights law were committed in the context of these detentions. 
Civilians, including women and children, were detained in degrading conditions, deprived of 
food, water and access to sanitary facilities, and exposed to the elements in January without any 
shelter. The men were handcuffed, blindfolded and repeatedly made to strip, sometimes naked, at 
different stages of their detention.  
</p>
<p>58. In the al-Atatra area in north-western Gaza, Israeli troops had dug out sandpits in which 
Palestinian men, women and children were detained. Israeli tanks and artillery positions were 
located inside the sandpits and around them and fired from next to the detainees. 
</p>
<p>59. The Palestinian men who were taken to detention facilities in Israel were subjected to 
degrading conditions of detention, harsh interrogation, beatings and other physical and mental 
abuse. Some of them were charged with being unlawful combatants. Those interviewed by the 
Mission were released after the proceedings against them had apparently been discontinued. 
</p>
<p>60. In addition to arbitrary deprivation of liberty and violation of due process rights, the cases 
of the detained Palestinian civilians highlight a common thread of the interaction between Israeli 
soldiers and Palestinian civilians which also emerged clearly in many cases discussed elsewhere 
in the report: continuous and systematic abuse, outrages on personal dignity, humiliating and 
degrading treatment contrary to fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and 
human rights law. The Mission concludes that this treatment constitutes the infliction of a 
collective penalty on these civilians and amounts to measures of intimidation and terror. Such 
acts are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and constitute a war crime. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>12. Objectives and strategy of Israel&#8217;s military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Mission reviewed available information on the planning of the Israeli military 
operations in Gaza, on the advanced military technology available to the Israeli armed forces and 
on their training in international humanitarian law (chap. XVI). According to official 
Government information, the Israeli armed forces have an elaborate legal advice and training 
system in place, which seeks to ensure knowledge of the relevant legal obligations and support to 
commanders for compliance in the field. The Israeli armed forces possess very advanced 
hardware and are also a market leader in the production of some of the most advanced pieces of 
military technology available, including unmanned aviation vehicles (UAVs). They have a very 
significant capacity for precision strikes by a variety of methods, including aerial and ground 
launches. Taking into account the ability to plan, the means to execute plans with the most 
developed technology available, and statements by the Israeli military that almost no errors 
occurred, the Mission finds that the incidents and patterns of events considered in the report are 
the result of deliberate planning and policy decisions.  
</p>
<p>62. The tactics used by the Israeli armed forces in the Gaza offensive are consistent with 
previous practices, most recently during the Lebanon war in 2006. A concept known as the 
Dahiya doctrine emerged then, involving the application of disproportionate force and the 
causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to 
civilian populations. The Mission concludes from a review of the facts on the ground that it 
witnessed for itself that what was prescribed as the best strategy appears to have been precisely 
what was put into practice.  
</p>
<p>63. In the framing of Israeli military objectives with regard to the Gaza operations, the 
concept of Hamas&#8217; &#8220;supporting infrastructure&#8221; is particularly worrying as it appears to transform 
civilians and civilian objects into legitimate targets. Statements by Israeli political and military 
leaders prior to and during the military operations in Gaza indicate that the Israeli military 
conception of what was necessary in a war with Hamas viewed disproportionate destruction and 
creating maximum disruption in the lives of many people as a legitimate means to achieve not 
only military but also political goals.  
</p>
<p>64. Statements by Israeli leaders to the effect that the destruction of civilian objects would be 
justified as a response to rocket attacks (&#8220;destroy 100 homes for every rocket fired&#8221;) indicate the 
possibility of resorting to reprisals. The Mission is of the view that reprisals against civilians in 
armed hostilities are contrary to international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>13. The impact of the military operations and of the blockade  
on the people of Gaza and their human rights 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Mission examined the combined impact of the military operations and of the 
blockade on the Gaza population and its enjoyment of human rights. The economy, employment 
opportunities and family livelihoods were already severely affected by the blockade when the 
Israeli offensive began. Insufficient supply of fuel for electricity generation had a negative 
impact on industrial activity, on the operation of hospitals, on water supply to households and on 
sewage treatment. Import restrictions and the ban on all exports from Gaza affected the industrial 
sector and agricultural production. Unemployment levels and the percentage of the population 
living in poverty or deep poverty were rising.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>66. In this precarious situation, the military operations destroyed a substantial part of the 
economic infrastructure. As many factories were targeted and destroyed or damaged, poverty, 
unemployment and food insecurity further increased dramatically. The agricultural sector 
similarly suffered from the destruction of farmland, water wells and fishing boats during the 
military operations. The continuation of the blockade impedes the reconstruction of the 
economic infrastructure that was destroyed. 
</p>
<p>67. The razing of farmland and the destruction of greenhouses are expected to further worsen 
food insecurity despite the increased quantities of food items allowed into Gaza since the 
beginning of the military operations. Dependence on food assistance increases. Levels of 
stunting and thinness in children and of anaemia prevalence in children and pregnant women 
were worrying even before the military operations. The hardship caused by the extensive 
destruction of shelter (the United Nations Development Programme reported 3,354 houses 
completely destroyed and 11,112 partially damaged) and the resulting displacement particularly 
affects children and women. The destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure (such as the 
destruction of the Namar wells and the attack against the water treatment plant described in 
chapter XIII) aggravated the pre-existing situation. Even before the military operations, 80 per 
cent of the water supplied in Gaza did not meet the World Health Organization&#8217;s standards for 
drinking water. The discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater into the sea is a further 
health hazard worsened by the military operations. 
</p>
<p>68. The military operations and resulting casualties subjected the beleaguered Gaza health 
sector to additional strain. Hospitals and ambulances were targeted by Israeli attacks. Patients 
with chronic health conditions could not be given priority in hospitals faced with an influx of 
patients with life-threatening injuries. Patients injured during the hostilities were often  
discharged quickly to free beds. The long-term health impact of these early discharges, as well as 
of weapons containing substances such as tungsten and white phosphorous, remains a source of 
concern. While the exact number of people who will suffer permanent disabilities is still 
unknown, the Mission understands that many persons who sustained traumatic injuries during 
the conflict still face the risk of permanent disability owing to complications and inadequate 
follow-up and physical rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>69. The number of persons suffering from mental health problems is also bound to increase. 
The Mission investigated a number of incidents in which adults and children witnessed the 
killing of loved ones. Doctors of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme gave 
information to the Mission on psychosomatic disorders, on a widespread state of alienation in the 
population and on &#8220;numbness&#8221; as a result of severe loss. They told the Mission that these 
conditions were in turn likely to increase the readiness to embrace violence and extremism. They 
also told the Mission that 20 per cent of children in the Gaza Strip suffer from post-traumatic 
stress disorders. 
</p>
<p>70. Children&#8217;s psychological learning difficulties are compounded by the impact of the 
blockade and the military operations on the education infrastructure. Some 280 schools and 
kindergartens were destroyed in a situation in which restrictions on the importation of 
construction materials meant that many school buildings were already in serious need of repair.  
</p>
<p>71. The Mission&#8217;s attention was also drawn to the particular manner in which women were 
affected by the military operations. The cases of women interviewed by the Mission in Gaza </p>

 <p> 
dramatically illustrate the suffering caused by the feeling of inability to provide children with the 
care and security they need. Women&#8217;s responsibility for the household and the children often 
forces them to conceal their own sufferings, resulting in their issues remaining unaddressed. The 
number of women who are the sole breadwinners increased, but their employment opportunities 
remain significantly inferior to men&#8217;s. The military operations and increased poverty add to the 
potential for conflicts in the family and between widows and their in-laws.  
</p>
<p>72. The Mission acknowledges that the supply of humanitarian goods, particularly foodstuffs, 
allowed into Gaza by Israel temporarily increased during the military operations. The level of 
goods allowed into Gaza before the military operations was, however, insufficient to meet the 
needs of the population even before hostilities started, and has again decreased since the end of 
the military operations. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission believes that Israel has 
violated its obligation to allow free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital objects, 
food and clothing (article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention). The Mission also finds that 
Israel violated specific obligations which it has as the occupying Power and which are spelled 
out in the Fourth Geneva Convention, such as the duty to maintain medical and hospital 
establishments and services and to agree to relief schemes if the occupied territory is not well 
supplied.  
</p>
<p>73. The Mission also concludes that in the destruction by the Israeli armed forces of private 
residential houses, water wells, water tanks, agricultural land and greenhouses there was a 
specific purpose of denying sustenance to the population of the Gaza Strip. The Mission finds 
that Israel violated its duty to respect the right of the Gaza population to an adequate standard of 
living, including access to adequate food, water and housing. The Mission, moreover, finds 
violations of specific human rights provisions protecting children, particularly those who are 
victims of armed conflict, women and the disabled. 
</p>
<p>74. The conditions of life in Gaza, resulting from deliberate actions of the Israeli armed forces 
and the declared policies of the Government of Israel &#8211; as they were presented by its authorized 
and legitimate representatives &#8211; with regard to the Gaza Strip before, during and after the 
military operation, cumulatively indicate the intention to inflict collective punishment on the 
people of the Gaza Strip in violation of international humanitarian law.   
</p>
<p>75. Finally, the Mission considered whether the series of acts that deprive Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip of their means of sustenance, employment, housing and water, that deny their 
freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country, that limit their access 
to courts of law and effective remedies could amount to persecution, a crime against humanity. 
From the facts available to it, the Mission is of the view that some of the actions of the 
Government of Israel might justify a competent court finding that crimes against humanity have 
been committed.  
</p>
<p><b>14. The continuing detention of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Mission notes the continued detention of Gilad Shalit, a member of the Israeli armed 
forces, captured in 2006 by a Palestinian armed group. In reaction to his capture, the Israeli 
Government ordered a number of attacks against infrastructure in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian 
Authority offices as well as the arrest of eight Palestinian Government ministers and 26 members 
of the Palestinian Legislative Council. The Mission heard testimonies indicating that, during the </p>

 <p> 
military operations of December 2008 &#8211; January 2009, Israeli soldiers questioned captured 
Palestinians about the whereabouts of Gilad Shalit. Gilad Shalit&#8217;s father, Noam Shalit, appeared 
before the Mission at the public hearing held in Geneva on 6 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>77. The Mission is of the opinion that, as a soldier who belongs to the Israeli armed forces and 
who was captured during an enemy incursion into Israel, Gilad Shalit meets the requirements for 
prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. As such, he should be protected, 
treated humanely and be allowed external communication as appropriate according to that 
Convention. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) should be allowed to visit 
him without delay. Information about his condition should also be provided promptly to his 
family.  
</p>
<p>78. The Mission is concerned by declarations made by various Israeli officials who have 
indicated the intention of maintaining the blockade of the Gaza Strip until the release of Gilad 
Shalit. The Mission is of the opinion that this would constitute collective punishment of the 
civilian population of the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p><b>15. Internal violence and targeting of Fatah affiliates by security services  
under the control of the Gaza authorities   
</b></p>
<p>79. The Mission obtained information about violence against political opponents by the 
security services that report to the Gaza authorities. These included the killing of a number of 
Gaza residents between the beginning of the Israeli military operations and 27 February. Among 
these were some detainees who had been at al-Saraya detention facility on 28 December and who 
had fled following the Israeli aerial attack. Not all those killed after escaping detention were 
Fatah affiliates, detained for political reasons, or charged with collaborating with the enemy. 
Some of the escapees had been convicted of serious crimes, such as drug-dealing or murder, and 
had been sentenced to death. The Mission was informed that the movement of many Fatah 
members was restricted during Israel&#8217;s military operations in Gaza and that many were put under 
house arrest. According to the Gaza authorities, arrests were made only after the end of the 
Israeli military operations and only in relation to criminal acts and to restore public order.     
</p>
<p>80. The Mission gathered first-hand information on five cases of Fatah affiliates detained, 
killed or subject to physical abuse by members of the security forces or armed groups in Gaza. In 
most cases those abducted from their homes or otherwise detained were reportedly not accused 
of offences related to specific incidents, but rather targeted because of their political affiliation. 
When charges were laid, these were always linked to suspected political activities. The 
testimonies of witnesses and the reports provided by international and domestic human rights 
organizations bear striking similarities and indicate that these attacks were not randomly 
executed, but constituted part of a pattern of organized violence directed mainly against Fatah 
affiliates and supporters. The Mission finds that such actions constitute serious violations of 
human rights and are not consistent with either the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the 
Palestinian Basic Law.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>The Occupied Palestinian Territory: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Mission considered developments in Gaza and the West Bank as closely interrelated, 
and analysed both to reach an informed understanding of and to report on issues within its 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>82. A consequence of Israel&#8217;s non-cooperation with the Mission was that the Mission was 
unable to visit the West Bank to investigate alleged violations of international law there. 
However, the Mission has received many oral and written reports and other relevant materials 
from Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organizations and institutions. In 
addition, the Mission has met representatives of human rights organizations, members of the 
Palestinian legislature and community leaders. It heard experts, witnesses and victims at the 
public hearings, interviewed affected individuals and witnesses, and reviewed video and 
photographic material. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli security forces,  
including use of excessive or lethal force during demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>83. Various witnesses and experts informed the Mission of a sharp rise in the use of force by 
the Israeli security forces against Palestinians in the West Bank from the beginning of the Israeli 
operations in Gaza (chap. XX). A number of protestors were killed by Israeli forces during 
Palestinian demonstrations, including in support of the Gaza population under attack, and scores 
were injured. The level of violence used in the West Bank during the time of the operation in 
Gaza was sustained also after the operation.  
</p>
<p>84. Of particular concern to the Mission were allegations of the use of unnecessary, lethal 
force by Israeli security forces, the use of live ammunitions, and the provision in the Israeli 
armed forces &#8220;open fire regulations&#8221; of different rules to deal with disturbances where only 
Palestinians are present and those where Israelis are present. This raises serious concern with 
regard to discriminatory policies vis-&#224;-vis Palestinians. Eyewitnesses also reported to the 
Mission on the use of sniper fire in the context of crowd control. Witnesses spoke of the 
markedly different atmosphere they encountered in the confrontation with the soldiers and 
border police during demonstrations in which all checks and balances had been removed. Several 
witnesses told the Mission that during the operation in Gaza, the sense in the West Bank was one 
of a &#8220;free for all&#8221;, where anything was permitted.  
</p>
<p>85. Little if any action is taken by the Israeli authorities to investigate, prosecute and punish 
violence against Palestinians, including killings, by settlers and members of the security forces, 
resulting in a situation of impunity. The Mission concludes that Israel has failed to fulfil its 
obligations to protect the Palestinians from violence by private individuals under both 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Detention of Palestinians in Israeli prisons 
</b></p>
<p>86. It is estimated that, since the beginning of the occupation, approximately 700,000 
Palestinian men, women and children have been detained by Israel. According to estimates, as at 
1 June 2009, there were approximately 8,100 Palestinian &#8220;political prisoners&#8221; in detention in 
Israel, including 60 women and 390 children. Most of these detainees are charged or convicted </p>

 <p> 
by the Israeli military court system that operates for Palestinians in the West Bank and under 
which due process rights for Palestinians are severely limited. Many are held in administrative 
detention and some under the Israeli &#8220;Unlawful Combatants Law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>87. The Mission focused on a number of issues in relation to Palestinian detainees that in its 
view are linked to the December-January Israeli military operations in Gaza or their context. 
</p>
<p>88. Legal measures since Israel&#8217;s disengagement from Gaza in 2005 have resulted in 
differential treatment for Gazan detainees. A 2006 law altered due process guarantees and is 
applied only to Palestinian suspects, the overwhelming majority of whom are from Gaza, 
according to Israeli Government sources. The ICRC Family Visits Programme in the Gaza Strip 
was suspended in 2007, barring all means of communication between Gazan prisoners and the 
outside world. 
</p>
<p>89. During the Israeli military operations in Gaza, the number of children detained by Israel 
was higher than in the same period in 2008. Many children were reportedly arrested on the street 
and/or during demonstrations in the West Bank. The number of child detainees continued to be 
high in the months following the end of the operations, accompanied by reports of abuses by 
Israeli security forces.  
</p>
<p>90. A feature of Israel&#8217;s detention practice vis-&#224;-vis the Palestinians since 2005 has been the 
arrest of Hamas affiliates. A few months before the elections for the Palestinian Legislative 
Council  in 2005, Israel arrested numerous persons who had been involved in municipal or 
Legislative Council elections. Following the capture by Palestinian armed groups of Israeli 
soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006, the Israeli armed forces arrested some 65 members of the 
Legislative Council, mayors and ministers, mostly Hamas members. All were held at least two 
years, generally in inadequate conditions. Further arrests of Hamas leaders were conducted 
during the military operations in Gaza. The detention of members of the Legislative Council has 
meant that it has been unable to function and exercise its legislative and oversight function over 
the Palestinian executive. 
</p>
<p>91. The Mission finds that these practices have resulted in violations of international human 
rights and humanitarian law, including the prohibition of arbitrary detention, the right to equal 
protection under the law and not to be discriminated based on political beliefs and the special 
protections to which children are entitled. The Mission also finds that the detention of members 
of the Legislative Council may amount to collective punishment contrary to international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Restrictions on freedom of movement in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>92. In the West Bank, Israel has long imposed a system of restrictions on movement. 
Movement is restricted by a combination of physical obstacles, such as roadblocks, checkpoints 
and the Wall, and administrative measures, such as identity cards, permits, assigned residence, 
laws on family reunification, and policies on the right to enter from abroad and the right of return 
for refugees. Palestinians are denied access to areas expropriated for the building of the Wall and 
its infrastructure, for use by settlements, buffer zones, military bases and military training zones, 
and the roads built to connect these places. Many of these roads are &#8220;Israeli only&#8221; and forbidden 
for Palestinian use. Tens of thousands of Palestinians today are subject to a travel ban imposed </p>

 <p> 
by Israel, preventing them from travelling abroad. A number of witnesses and experts invited by 
the Mission to meet in Amman and participate in the hearings in Geneva could not meet the 
Mission owing to this travel ban. 
</p>
<p>93. The Mission has received reports that, during the Israeli offensive in Gaza, restrictions on 
movement in the West Bank were tightened. Israel imposed a &#8220;closure&#8221; on the West Bank for 
several days. In addition, there were more checkpoints in the West Bank, including in East 
Jerusalem, for the duration of the operation. Most of these were so-called flying checkpoints. In 
January 2009, several areas of the West Bank between the Wall and the Green Line were 
declared &#8220;closed military areas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>94. During and following the operations in Gaza, Israel tightened its hold on the West Bank 
by increasing expropriations, house demolitions and demolition orders, granting more permits 
for homes built in settlements and intensifying the exploitation of the natural resources in the 
West Bank. Following the operations in Gaza, Israel has amended the regulations which 
determine the ability of persons with &#8220;Gaza ID&#8221; to move to the West Bank and vice versa, 
further entrenching the separation between the people of the West Bank and Gaza.  
</p>
<p>95. Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Housing and Planning is planning a further 73,000 settlement homes 
in the West Bank. The building of 15,000 of these homes has already been approved and, if all 
the plans are realized, the number of settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory will double.  
</p>
<p>96. The Mission believes that the restrictions on movement and access to which Palestinians 
in the West Bank are subject, in general, and the tighter restrictions during and, to some extent, 
after the military operations in Gaza, in particular, are disproportionate to any military objective 
served . In addition, the Mission is concerned about the steps taken recently to formalize the 
separation between Gaza and the West Bank, and as such between two parts of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Internal violence and targeting of Hamas supporters by the Palestinian  
Authority, restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>97. The Mission has received allegations of violations relevant to its mandate committed by 
the Palestinian Authority in the period under inquiry. These include violations related to the 
treatment of (suspected) Hamas affiliates by the security services, including unlawful arrest and 
detention. Several Palestinian human rights organizations have reported that practices used by 
the Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank amount to torture and cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment and punishment. There have been a number of deaths in detention to 
which it is suspected that torture and other ill-treatment may have contributed  or which they 
may have caused. Complaints of such practices have not been investigated.  
</p>
<p>98. Allegations were also received about the use of excessive force and the suppression of 
demonstrations by Palestinian security services &#8211; particularly those in support of the population 
of Gaza during the Israeli military operations. On these occasions Palestinian Authority security 
services have allegedly arrested many individuals and prevented the media from covering the 
events. The Mission also received allegations of harassment by Palestinian security services of 
journalists who expressed critical views.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>99. The disabling of the Palestinian Legislative Council following the arrest and detention by 
Israel of several of its members has effectively curtailed parliamentary oversight over the 
Palestinian Authority executive. The executive has passed decrees and regulations to enable it to 
continue its day-to-day operations.  
</p>
<p>100. Other allegations include the arbitrary closure of charities and associations affiliated with 
Hamas and other Islamic groups or the revocation and non-renewal of their licences, the forcible 
replacement of board members of Islamic schools and other institutions, and the dismissal of 
Hamas-affiliated teachers. 
</p>
<p>101. The Palestinian Authority continues to discharge a large number of civil and military 
service employees, or suspend their salaries, under the pretext of &#8220;non-adherence to the 
legitimate authority&#8221; or &#8220;non-obtainment of security approval&#8221; on their appointments, which has 
become a pre-requirement for enrolment in public service. In effect, this measure excludes 
Hamas supporters or affiliates from public sector employment. 
</p>
<p>102. The Mission is of the view that the reported measures are inconsistent with the Palestinian 
Authority&#8217;s obligations deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the 
Palestinian Basic Law.   
</p>
<p><b>Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Impact on civilians of rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian  
armed groups on southern Israel 
</b></p>
<p>103. Palestinian armed groups have launched about 8000 rockets and mortars into southern 
Israel since 2001 (chap. XXIV). While communities such as Sderot and Nir Am kibbutz have 
been within the range of rocket and mortar fire since the beginning, the range of rocket fire 
increased to nearly 40 kilometres from the Gaza border, encompassing towns as far north as 
Ashdod, during the Israeli military operations in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>104. Between 18 June 2008 and 18 January 2009, rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups in 
Gaza have killed three civilians inside Israel and two civilians in Gaza when a rocket landed 
short of the border on 26 December 2008. Reportedly, over 1000 civilians inside Israel were 
physically injured as a result of rocket and mortar attacks, 918 of whom were injured during the 
time of the Israeli military operations in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>105. The Mission has taken particular note of the high level of psychological trauma suffered 
by the civilian population inside Israel. Data gathered by an Israeli organization in October 2007 
found that 28.4 per cent of adults and 72&#8211;94 per cent of children in Sderot suffered from post-
traumatic stress disorder. During the military operations in Gaza 1596 people were reportedly 
treated for stress-related injuries while afterwards over 500 people were treated. 
</p>
<p>106. Rockets and mortars have damaged houses, schools and cars in southern Israel. On 5 
March 2009, a rocket struck a synagogue in Netivot. The rocket and mortar fire has adversely 
affected the right to education of children and adults living in southern Israel. This is a result of 
school closures and interruptions to classes by alerts and moving to shelters but also the </p>

 <p> 
diminished ability to learn that is witnessed in individuals experiencing symptoms of 
psychological trauma.  
</p>
<p>107. The rocket and mortar fire has also had an adverse impact on the economic and social life 
of the affected communities. For communities such as Ashdod, Yavne, Beersheba, which 
experienced rocket strikes for the first time during the Israeli military operations in Gaza, there 
was a brief interruption to their economic and cultural activities brought about by the temporary 
displacement of some residents. For towns closer to the Gaza border, which have been under 
rocket and mortar fire since 2001, the recent escalation has added to the exodus of residents.  
</p>
<p>108. The Mission has determined that the rockets and, to a lesser extent, the mortars fired by 
the Palestinian armed groups are incapable of being directed towards specific military objectives 
and have been fired into areas where civilian populations are based. The Mission has further 
determined that these attacks constitute indiscriminate attacks upon the civilian population of 
southern Israel and that, where there is no intended military target and the rockets and mortars 
are launched into a civilian population, they constitute a deliberate attack against a civilian 
population. These acts would constitute war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity. 
Given the seeming inability of the Palestinian armed groups to direct the rockets and mortars 
towards specific targets and given that the attacks have caused very little damage to Israeli 
military assets, the Mission finds that there is significant evidence to suggest that one of the 
primary purposes of the rocket and mortar attacks is to spread terror among the Israeli civilian 
population, a violation of international law. 
</p>
<p>109. Noting that some of the Palestinian armed groups, among them Hamas, have publicly 
expressed their intention to target civilians in reprisal for the civilian fatalities in Gaza as a result 
of Israeli military operations, the Mission is of the view that reprisals against civilians in armed 
hostilities are contrary to international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>110. The Mission notes that the relatively few casualties sustained by civilians inside Israel is 
due in large part to the precautions put into place by Israel. This includes an early warning 
system, the provision of public shelters and fortifications of schools and other public buildings at 
great financial cost &#8211; a projected US$ 460 million between 2005 and 2011 &#8211; to the Government 
of Israel. The Mission is greatly concerned, however, about the lack of an early warning system 
and a lack of public shelters and fortifications for the Palestinian Israeli communities living in 
unrecognized and in some of the recognized villages that are within the range of rocket and 
mortars being fired by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Repression of dissent in Israel, the right of access to information  
and treatment of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>111. The Mission received reports that individuals and groups, viewed as sources of criticism 
of Israel&#8217;s military operations were subjected to repression or attempted repression by the 
Government of Israel. Amidst a high level of support for the Israeli military operations in Gaza 
from the Israeli Jewish population, there were also widespread protests against the military 
operations inside Israel. Hundreds of thousands &#8211; mainly, but not exclusively, Palestinian 
citizens of Israel &#8211; protested. While, in the main, the protests were permitted to take place, there 
were occasions when, reportedly, protesters had difficulty in obtaining permits &#8211; particularly in 
areas populated mainly by Palestinian Israelis. In Israel and in occupied East Jerusalem 715 </p>

 <p> 
people were arrested during the protests. There appear to have been no arrests of counter-
protesters and 34 per cent of those arrested were under 18 years of age. The Mission notes that a 
relatively small proportion of those protesting were arrested. The Mission urges the Government 
of Israel to ensure that the police authorities respect the rights of all its citizens, without 
discrimination, including freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, as 
guaranteed to them by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>112. The Mission notes with concern the reported instances of physical violence committed by 
members of the police against protesters, including the beating of protesters and other 
inappropriate conduct such as subjecting Palestinian citizens of Israel who were arrested to racial 
abuse and making sexual comments about female members of their families. Article 10 of the 
Covenant requires that those deprived of their liberty be treated with humanity and respect for 
the inherent dignity of the human person. 
</p>
<p>113. Of the protesters brought before the Israeli courts, the Palestinian Israelis were 
disproportionately held in detention pending trial. The element of discrimination and differential 
treatment between Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel by the judicial authorities, as 
indicated in the reports received, is a substantial cause for concern.  
</p>
<p>114. The interviews of political activists by the Israeli General Security Services were cited as 
the actions contributing most significantly to a climate of repression inside Israel. The Mission is 
concerned about activists being compelled to attend interviews with Shabak (also known as Shin 
Bet), without there being any legal obligation on them to do so, and in general at the alleged 
interrogation of political activists about their political activities. 
</p>
<p>115. The Mission received reports concerning the investigation by the Government of Israel 
into New Profile on allegations that it was inciting draft-dodging, a criminal offence, and reports 
that the Government was seeking to terminate funding from foreign Governments for Breaking 
the Silence, following its publication of testimonies of Israeli soldiers concerning the conduct of 
the Israeli armed forces in Gaza in December 2008 and January 2009. The Mission is concerned 
that the Government of Israel&#8217;s action with regard to these organizations may have an 
intimidating effect on other Israeli human rights organizations. The so-called United Nations 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders guarantees the right &#8220;to solicit, receive and utilize 
resources for the express purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms through peaceful means&#8221;. If motivated by reaction to the organization&#8217;s exercise of its 
freedom of expression, lobbying foreign Governments to terminate funding would be contrary to 
the spirit of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>116. The Government of Israel imposed a ban on media access to Gaza following 
5 November 2008. Furthermore, access was denied to human rights organizations and the ban 
continues for some international and Israeli organizations. The Mission can find no justification 
for this. The presence of journalists and international human rights monitors aids the 
investigation and wide public reporting of the conduct of the parties to the conflict, and can 
inhibit misconduct. The Mission observes that Israel, in its actions against political activists, 
non-governmental organizations and the media, has attempted to reduce public scrutiny of both 
its conduct during its military operations in Gaza and the consequences that these operations had 
for the residents of Gaza, possibly seeking to prevent investigation and public reporting thereon.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Proceedings and responses by Israel to allegations of violations  
by its armed forces against Palestinians  
</b></p>
<p>117. Investigations and, if appropriate, prosecutions of those suspected of serious violations are 
necessary if respect for human rights and humanitarian law is to be ensured and to prevent the 
development of a climate of impunity. States have a duty under international law to investigate 
allegations of violations. 
</p>
<p>118. The Mission reviewed public information and reports from the Government of Israel 
concerning actions taken to discharge its obligation to investigate alleged violations 
(chap. XXVI). It addressed to Israel a number of questions on this issue, but it did not receive a 
reply. 
</p>
<p>119. In response to allegations of serious violations of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, the Military Advocate General ordered some criminal investigations that were 
closed two weeks later concluding that allegations &#8220;were based on hearsay&#8221;. The Israeli armed 
forces also released the results of five special investigations carried out by high-ranking military 
officers, which concluded that &#8220;throughout the fighting in Gaza, the IDF operated in accordance 
with international law&#8221;, but the investigations reportedly revealed a very small number of errors. 
On 30 July 2009 the media reported that the Military Advocate General had ordered the military 
police to launch criminal investigations into 14 cases out or nearly 100 complaints of criminal 
conduct by soldiers. No details were offered. 
</p>
<p>120. The Mission reviewed the Israeli internal system of investigation and prosecution 
according to its national legislation and in the light of practice. The system comprises: 
(a) disciplinary proceedings; (b) operational debriefings (also known as &quot;operational 
investigations&quot;); (c) special investigations, performed by a senior officer at the request of the 
chief of staff; and (d) military police investigations, carried out by the Criminal Investigation 
Division of the military police. At the heart of the system lies the so-called operational 
debriefing. The debriefings are reviews of incidents and operations conducted by soldiers from 
the same unit or line of command together with a superior officer. They are meant to serve 
operational purposes.  
</p>
<p>121. International human rights law and humanitarian law require States to investigate and, if 
appropriate, prosecute allegations of serious violations by military personnel. International law 
has also established that such investigations should comply with standards of impartiality, 
independence, promptness and effectiveness. The Mission holds that the Israeli system of 
investigation does not comply with all those principles. In relation to the &#8220;operational 
debriefing&#8221; used by the Israeli armed forces as an investigative tool, the Mission holds the view 
that a tool designed for the review of performance and to learn lessons can hardly be an effective 
and impartial investigation mechanism that should be instituted after every military operation 
where allegations of serious violations have been made. It does not comply with internationally 
recognized principles of impartiality and promptness in investigations. The fact that proper 
criminal investigations can start only after the &#8220;operational debriefing&#8221; is over is a major flaw in 
the Israeli system of investigation.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>122. The Mission concludes that there are serious doubts about the willingness of Israel to 
carry out genuine investigations in an impartial, independent, prompt and effective way as 
required by international law. The Mission is also of the view that the Israeli system overall 
presents inherently discriminatory features that make the pursuit of justice for Palestinian victims 
very difficult.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Proceedings by Palestinian authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Proceedings related to actions in the Gaza Strip  
</b></p>
<p>123. The Mission found no evidence of any system of public monitoring or accountability for 
serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law set up by the Gaza 
authorities. The Mission is concerned with the consistent disregard for international 
humanitarian law with which armed groups in the Gaza Strip conduct their armed activities, 
through rocket and mortar fire, directed against Israel. Despite some media reports, the Mission 
remains unconvinced that any genuine and effective initiatives have been taken by the authorities 
to address the serious issues of violation of international humanitarian law in the conduct of 
armed activities by militant groups in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>124. Notwithstanding statements by the Gaza authorities and any action that they may have 
taken, of which the Mission is unaware, the Mission also considers that allegations of killings, 
torture and mistreatment within the Gaza Strip have gone largely without investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Proceedings related to actions in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>125. With regard to relevant violations identified in the West Bank, it appears that, with few 
exceptions, there has been a degree of tolerance towards human rights violations against political 
opponents, which has resulted in a lack of accountability for such actions. The Ministry of 
Interior has also ignored the High Court&#8217;s decisions to release a number of detainees or to reopen 
some associations closed by the administration. 
</p>
<p>126. In the circumstances, the Mission is unable to consider the measures taken by the 
Palestinian Authority as meaningful for holding to account perpetrators of serious violations of 
international law and believes that the responsibility for protecting the rights of the people 
inherent in the authority assumed by the Palestinian Authority must be fulfilled with greater 
commitment  
</p>
<p><b>3. Universal jurisdiction 
</b></p>
<p>127. In the context of increasing unwillingness on the part of Israel to open criminal 
investigations that comply with international standards, the Mission supports the reliance on 
universal jurisdiction as an avenue for States to investigate violations of the grave breach 
provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, prevent impunity and promote international 
accountability (chap. XXVIII). 
</p>
<p><b>4. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>128. International law also establishes that, whenever a violation of an international obligation 
occurs, an obligation to provide reparation arises. It is the view of the Mission that the current </p>

 <p> 
constitutional structure and legislation in Israel leaves very little room, if any, for Palestinians to 
seek compensation. The international community needs to provide for an additional or 
alternative mechanism of compensation for damage or loss incurred by Palestinian civilians 
during the military operations (chap. XXIX). 
</p>
<p><b>E. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>129. The Mission draws general conclusions on its investigations in chapter XXX, which also 
includes a summary of its legal findings.   
</p>
<p>130. The Mission then makes recommendations to a number of United Nations bodies, Israel, 
the responsible Palestinian authorities and the international community on: (a) accountability for 
serious violations of international humanitarian law; (b) reparations; (c) serious violations of 
human rights law; (d) the blockade and reconstruction; (e) the use of weapons and military 
procedures; (f) the protection of human rights organizations and defenders ; (g) follow-up to the 
Mission&#8217;s recommendations. The recommendations are detailed in chapter XXXI.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>PART ONE: METHODODOGY, CONTEXT AND APPLICABLE LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>131. On 3 April 2009, the President of the Human Rights Council established the United 
Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict with the mandate &#8220;to investigate all 
violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have 
been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza 
during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or 
after.&#8221; The appointment of the Mission followed the adoption on 12 January 2009 of resolution 
S-9/1 on the grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly 
due to the recent Israeli military attacks against the occupied Gaza Strip, by the United Nations 
Human Rights Council at the end of its ninth special session.   
</p>
<p>132. The President appointed Justice Richard Goldstone, former judge of the Constitutional 
Court of South Africa and former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the 
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to head the Mission. The other three appointed members were: 
Professor Christine Chinkin, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics 
and Political Science, who was a member of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun 
(2008); Ms. Hina Jilani, Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and former Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, who was a 
member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (2004); and Colonel Desmond 
Travers, a former Officer in Ireland&#8217;s Defence Forces and member of the Board of Directors of 
the Institute for International Criminal Investigations.   
</p>
<p>133. As is usual practice, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) established a secretariat to support the Mission. 
</p>
<p>134. Between the adoption of resolution S-9/1 in January and the establishment of the Mission 
at the beginning of April, a broad cross section of actors, including domestic and international 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and United Nations agencies and bodies, had already 
conducted numerous investigations and produced reports on the military operations in Gaza, all 
of which were taken into account by the Mission in its work of fact-finding and analysis.  
</p>
<p>135. Bearing in mind that the resolution of the Council had called for the urgent dispatch of the 
Mission and given the 11-week delay in its establishment, the Mission agreed to be bound by a 
short time frame (about three months) to complete its work and report to the Council at the 
earliest opportunity. 
</p>
<p>136. The Mission interpreted the mandate as requiring it to place the civilian population of the 
region at the centre of its concerns regarding the violations of international law. Accordingly, the 
Mission has made victims its first priority and it will draw attention to their plight in the context 
of the events under investigation. The members of the Mission hope that their situation will not 
be neglected by any political agenda for the region. 
</p>
<p>137. The Mission considered it crucial for the implementation of its mandate to meet with the 
widest possible range of stakeholders relevant to the facts under inquiry. During the three months 
of its work in Geneva, Gaza, Amman and elsewhere, the Mission met representatives of civil </p>

 <p> 
society, including domestic and international NGOs; women&#8217;s organizations; bar associations; 
military analysts; medical doctors; mental health experts; representatives of the business/private 
sector, including agriculture and fishery; representatives of associations of persons with 
disabilities; journalists and other representatives of domestic and international media outlets; 
representatives of United Nations organs and bodies as well as other international organizations: 
the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights; the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace 
Process, the Head of the United Nations Board of Inquiry into incidents in Gaza; diplomatic 
representatives of Member States of the United Nations in Geneva and in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory; members of the Palestinian Legislative Council from both Gaza and the 
West Bank; ministers and officials of the Palestinian Authority; senior members of the Gaza 
authorities;<b>1</b> former Government and military officials of the Government of Israel (see annex I).   
</p>
<p>138. The Mission convened for the first time in Geneva between 4 and 8 May 2009, when it 
established its methods of work and a three-month programme of activities. It also had initial 
briefings and consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. The Mission met the diplomatic 
community in Geneva, including the President of the Human Rights Council, members of the 
Council and sponsors of resolution S-9/1. 
</p>
<p>139. Additionally, the Mission met in Geneva on 20 May, on 4 and 5 July, and between 1 and 
4 August 2009. The Mission conducted three field visits: two to the Gaza Strip between 30 May 
and 6 June, and between 25 June and 1 July 2009; and one visit to Amman on 2 and 3 July 2009. 
Several staff of the Mission&#8217;s secretariat were present in Gaza from 22 May to 4 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>140. On 7 May, notes verbales were sent to all United Nations organs and bodies and Member 
States of the United Nations. Egypt, Lebanon, Romania, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) on behalf of the 1612 Working Group on Grave Violations against Children 
established for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory,<b>2</b> the World Health Organization 
(WHO), and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) replied to the notes verbales. 
Documentation was also made available by other specialized agencies and other organizations in 
the United Nations system, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNRWA, and the Operational Satellite 
Applications Programme (UNOSAT) of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research 
(UNITAR). On 8 June 2009, the Mission issued a call for submissions inviting all interested 
persons and organizations to submit relevant information and documentation to assist in the 
implementation of its mandate. In response, the Mission received 31 submissions from 
individuals and organizations. Throughout its work, the Mission received or had access to a 
variety of documents from multiple sources (see chap. I). 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1</b> The term &#8220;Gaza authorities&#8221; is used to refer to the de facto Hamas-led authorities established in Gaza since 
June 2007.  See chap. II for details.  
<b>2</b> This Working Group was set up following the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of resolution 
1612/2005) establishing a monitoring and reporting mechanism to ensure the protection of children affected by 
armed conflict.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>141. Public hearings were held in Gaza on 28 and 29 June and in Geneva on 6 and 7 July 2009.  
</p>
<p>142. Upon appointment on 3 April 2009, the Head of the Mission held a press conference in 
Geneva together with the President of the Human Rights Council. The Mission issued a press 
release on 8 May, at the end of its first official meeting, and on 29 May, before travelling to 
Gaza. Additionally, the Mission held press conferences in Gaza on 4 June, at the end of its first 
visit, and on 7 July 2009, at the end of the public hearings in Geneva. The Head of the Mission 
was interviewed several times by the international media<b>3</b>.  
</p>
<p><b>Cooperation with the parties 
</b></p>
<p>143. Since its inception, the Mission has requested the cooperation of all relevant authorities to 
enable it to visit and meet victims in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.   
</p>
<p>144. Immediately upon appointment, the Head of the Mission sought to consult the Permanent 
Representative of Israel to the United Nations Office at Geneva, who unfortunately declined to 
meet him. Following an exchange of letters between 3 and 7 April, the Permanent Representative 
of Israel informed the Head of the Mission that his Government would not be able to cooperate 
with the Mission. On 29 April, an additional invitation to the Permanent Representative of Israel 
to meet the Mission was also unsuccessful. On 4 May, the Mission wrote to the Prime Minister 
of Israel, reiterating its request for cooperation, in particular by providing access to Gaza, the 
West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. During a meeting on 6 May 2009 with the 
President of Israel, the United Nations Secretary-General referred to and supported the Mission&#8217;s 
request for cooperation from the Government of Israel. In a letter dated 20 May 2009, the 
Mission attempted again to obtain the cooperation of the Israeli Government, especially in view 
of its planned visit to the Gaza Strip. In view of the refusal of cooperation from the Government 
of Israel, in order to be able to fulfil the mandate entrusted by the Human Rights Council within 
the aforementioned time frame, the Mission sought and obtained the assistance of the 
Government of Egypt to enable it to enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. The Mission had 
additional written exchanges with the Permanent Representative of Israel in Geneva between 2 
and 17 July 2099. (See annex II.) 
</p>
<p>145. Upon appointment, the Head of the Mission consulted the Permanent Observer of 
Palestine to the United Nations Office at Geneva, who promptly extended the cooperation of the 
Palestinian Authority to the Mission. The Mission has remained in contact with the Permanent 
Observer Mission of Palestine, and has enjoyed the support and cooperation of the Palestinian 
Authority. Due to the lack of cooperation from the Israeli Government, the Mission was unable 
to meet members of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The Mission did, however, meet 
officials of the Palestinian Authority, including a cabinet minister, in Amman. A Palestinian 
minister was prevented from travelling to meet the Mission in Amman (see chap. I). During its 
visits to the Gaza Strip, the Mission held meetings with senior members of the Gaza authorities 
and they extended their full cooperation and support to the Mission.   
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>3</b> The webpage of the Mission can be found at: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/ 
9/FactFindingMission.htm.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Protection of persons cooperating with the Mission 
</b></p>
<p>146. In the implementation of its mandate the Mission has called for the protections that are 
required under the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, better known as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, to be 
accorded to all who gave testimony at the public hearings. The Mission also was guided by 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/9 which &#8220;urges Governments to refrain from all 
acts of intimidation or reprisal against (a) those who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with 
representatives of United Nations human rights bodies, or who have provided testimony or 
information to them&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>147. Subsequent to the public hearings in Geneva, the Mission was informed that a Palestinian 
participant, Mr. Muhammad Srour, had been detained by Israeli security forces when returning 
to the West Bank and became concerned that his detention may have been a consequence of his 
appearance before the Mission. The Mission wrote to the Permanent Representative of Israel in 
Geneva expressing its concern. In response, the Permanent Representative informed the Mission 
that the detention of the person concerned was unrelated to his appearance at the public hearing. 
Mr. Srour was subsequently released on bail. The Mission is in contact with him and continues 
to monitor developments.  
</p>
<p>148. The Mission is also concerned about anonymous calls and messages received on private 
phone numbers and e-mail addresses by some of those who provided information to it or assisted 
in its work in the Gaza Strip. The contents seemed to imply that the originators of these 
anonymous calls and messages regarded those who cooperated with the Mission as potentially 
associated with armed groups. One of the recipients conveyed to the Mission apprehensions 
about personal safety and a feeling of intimidation. The Mission also wishes to record that there 
are others who have declined to appear before it or to provide information or, having cooperated 
with the Mission, have asked that their names should not be disclosed, for fear of reprisal. 
</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgments 
</b></p>
<p>149. The Mission is deeply grateful to the numerous Palestinians and Israelis, especially 
victims and witnesses of violations, who have shared with it their stories and views.  It is equally 
grateful to the many Palestinian and Israeli civil society and NGOs, and to the Palestinian 
Independent Commission for Human Rights. They are at the forefront of the protection and 
promotion of human rights in the region and carry out their work with courage, professionalism 
and independence in very difficult circumstances. The Mission is also grateful to all the domestic 
and international NGOs that have supported its mandate and have provided a vast amount of 
relevant and well-documented information. Without the support and the assistance of United 
Nations agencies, programmes and other bodies, and particularly of the United Nations staff in 
Gaza, the Mission would have not been able to complete its work. Heartfelt thanks go to all of 
them. The Mission wishes to especially acknowledge the invaluable support received by the 
dedicated staff of UNRWA. The Mission expresses its gratitude to the United Nations security 
personnel and interpreters, who have professionally and sensitively accomplished their difficult 
tasks. In addition to the secretariat of the Mission appointed by OHCHR, a multinational team 
with a broad range of professional experience, the gratitude of the Mission goes also to the staff 
of OHCHR in Geneva, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and New York. A particular mention </p>

 <p> 
goes to all those who assisted with the daunting task of organizing at very short notice the public 
hearings in Gaza and in Geneva. The Mission wishes to formally thank the Government of Egypt 
and in particular the Permanent Mission of Egypt in Geneva. The Mission wishes to formally 
thank the Governments of Jordan and of Switzerland for facilitating the issuance of entry visas at 
short notice. The Mission also wishes to acknowledge the continued support received from the 
United Nations Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>150. Finally, the Mission wishes to thank the people of Gaza for their warm welcome, their 
humanity and their hospitality in spite of such difficult and painful circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>I. METHODOLOGY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Mandate and terms of reference 
</b></p>
<p>151. In his letter appointing the members of the Mission, the President of the Council entrusted 
the Mission with the following mandate: &#8220;to investigate all violations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the 
context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 
December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>152. To implement its mandate, the Mission determined that it was required to consider any 
actions by all parties that might have constituted violations of international human rights law or 
international humanitarian law. The mandate also required it to review related actions in the 
entire Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. 
</p>
<p>153. With regard to temporal scope, the Mission&#8217;s broad mandate includes violations before, 
during and after the military operations that were conducted in Gaza between 27 December 2008 
and 18 January 2009. The Mission considered that, while the Gaza events must be seen in the 
context of the overall conflict and situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in view of the 
limited time and resources available, it would be beyond its abilities to focus on conduct or 
actions that took place long before the military operation of December&#8211;January. The Mission 
therefore decided to focus primarily on events, actions or circumstances occurring since 19 June 
2008, when a ceasefire was agreed between the Government of Israel and Hamas. The Mission 
has also taken into consideration matters occurring after the end of military operations that 
constitute continuing human rights and international humanitarian law violations related to or as 
a consequence of the military operation, up to 31 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>154. The Mission considered that the reference in its mandate to violations committed in the 
context of the December&#8211;January military operations required it to go beyond violations that 
took place directly as part of the operations. Thus violations within its mandate include those that 
are linked to the December&#8211;January military operations in terms of time, objectives and targets, 
and include restrictions on human rights and fundamental freedoms relating to Israel's strategies 
and actions in the context of its military operations. 
</p>
<p>155. The normative framework for the Mission has been general international law, the Charter 
of the United Nations, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and 
international criminal law.    </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>156. The Mission reviewed all allegations raised in connection with issues under its mandate. 
The review included analysis of material in the public domain, including the many reports 
produced after the military operations concluded, information provided to the Mission through 
additional documentation and a series of meetings with experts who had been to the area or 
studied matters of interest to the Mission.   
</p>
<p>157. In view of the time frame within which it had to complete its work, the Mission 
necessarily had to be selective in the choice of issues and incidents for investigation. The report 
does not purport to be exhaustive in documenting the very high number of relevant incidents that 
occurred in the period covered by the Mission&#8217;s mandate and especially during the military 
operations in Gaza. Nevertheless, the Mission considers that the report is illustrative of the main 
patterns of violations. The Mission also stresses that the exclusion of issues or incidents from the 
report in no way reflects on the seriousness of the relevant allegations.   
</p>
<p>158. The Mission based its work on an independent and impartial analysis of compliance by 
the parties with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law in the 
context of the recent conflict in Gaza, and on international investigative standards developed by 
the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>159. The Mission adopted an inclusive approach to receiving information and views on matters 
within its mandate. Information-gathering methods included: 
</p>
<p>(a) The review of reports of international organizations, including the United Nations; 
reports and other documentation, including affidavits, produced by non-governmental and civil 
society organizations (Palestinian, Israeli and international); media reports; and writings of 
academics and analysts on the conflict; 
</p>
<p>(b) Interviews with victims, witnesses and other persons having relevant information. In 
keeping with established human rights methodology and in order to ensure both the safety and 
privacy of the interviewees and the integrity of the information provided, such interviews were 
conducted in private. The Mission decided not to interview children. The Mission conducted 
188 individual interviews.  Most interviews were conducted in person. If the Mission was unable 
to meet the relevant persons, interviews were conducted by telephone. Also in keeping with 
normal practice for this type of report and to continue to protect their safety and privacy, the 
names of the victims, witnesses and other sources are generally not explicitly referred to in the 
report and codes are used instead. The names of individuals who publicly testified at the hearings 
held by the Mission or who have explicitly agreed to be named (see below) are, however, 
identified; 
</p>
<p>(c) Site visits to specific locations in Gaza where incidents had occurred. The Mission 
investigated 36 incidents in Gaza; 
</p>
<p>(d) The analysis of video and photographic images, including satellite imagery provided 
by UNOSAT, and expert analysis of such images; 
</p>
<p>(e) The review of medical reports about injuries to victims; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(f) The forensic analysis of weapons and ammunition remnants collected at incident 
sites; 
</p>
<p>(g) Meetings with a variety of interlocutors, including members of the diplomatic 
community, representatives of the parties concerned, NGOs, professional associations, military 
analysts, medical doctors, legal experts, scientists, United Nations staff; 
</p>
<p>(h) Invitations, through notes verbales, to United Nations Members States and United 
Nations agencies, departments and bodies to provide information relating to the Mission&#8217;s 
investigation requirements;  
</p>
<p>(i) The wide circulation of a public call for written submissions from NGOs and other 
organizations and individuals interested in bringing information to the attention of the Mission. 
As a result, it received numerous submissions from organizations and individuals from Israel, the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and elsewhere in the world; 
</p>
<p>(j) Public hearings in Gaza and in Geneva<b>4</b> to hear: (i) victims and witnesses of 
violations; and (ii) individuals with specialized knowledge and expertise on the context and 
impact of the hostilities.  
</p>
<p>160. The Mission reviewed more than 300 reports, submissions and other documentation either 
researched of its own motion, received in reply to its call for submissions and notes verbales or 
provided during meetings or otherwise, amounting to more than 10,000 pages, over 30 videos 
and 1,200 photographs. 
</p>
<p>161. The methods adopted to gather and verify information and reach conclusions were for the 
most part guided by best practice methodology developed in the context of United Nations 
investigations. In the case of Israel and the West Bank, adjustments were required in view of the 
Mission&#8217;s inability to access those areas due to lack of cooperation from Israel.   
</p>
<p>162. The Mission&#8217;s preferred option would have been to visit all areas covered by its mandate 
and undertake on-site investigations in all. The Government of Israel, however, refused to 
cooperate with the Mission at three levels: (a) it refused to meet the Mission and to provide 
access to Government officials, including military, and documentation; (b) it precluded the 
Mission from travelling to Israel in order to meet with Israeli victims, witnesses, members of 
civil society and NGOs; and (c) it prevented the Mission from travelling to the West Bank, 
including East Jerusalem, to meet members of the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian victims, 
witnesses, non-governmental or civil society organizations living or located in the West Bank. 
</p>
<p>163. Accordingly, the Mission conducted field visits, including investigations of incident sites, 
in the Gaza Strip. This allowed the Mission to observe first-hand the situation on the ground, and 
speak to many witnesses and other relevant persons. The Mission considered this particularly 
important to form an understanding of the situation, the context, impact and consequences of the 
conflict on people, and to assess violations of international law. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>4</b> The public hearings are webcast by the United Nations and can be viewed by visiting the webcast archive at: 
http://www.un.org/webcast/unhrc/archive.asp?go=090628.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>164. The Mission gathered first-hand information with regard to the situation in Israel and in 
the West Bank by conducting telephone interviewees with victims, community representatives, 
local authorities, members of NGOs and experts; by hearing testimonies from victims, witnesses 
and experts from Israel and from the West Bank at the public hearings in Geneva; and by holding 
meetings and private interviews both in Amman and in Geneva.    
</p>
<p>165. The Mission&#8217;s efforts in this regard were partially thwarted because of restrictions on the 
freedom of movement of some of the people that the Mission wished to interview. The Mission 
was not able to meet as planned the Palestinian Minister of Justice, Dr. Ali al-Khashan, in 
Amman, as he was not allowed by Israel to leave the West Bank. The Mission was also unable to 
meet Ms. Khalida Jarrar, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, who is subject to a 
travel ban by Israel (see chap. XXII). It held a teleconference with her. A Palestinian witness at 
the Geneva public hearings, Mr. Shawan Jabarin, had to be heard by videoconference as he is 
also subject to a travel ban by Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>A note on the public hearings 
</b></p>
<p>166. The purpose of the public hearings, which were broadcast live, was to enable victims, 
witnesses and experts from all sides to the conflict to speak directly to as many people as 
possible in the region as well as in the international community. The Mission is of the view that 
no written word can replace the voice of victims. While not all issues and incidents under 
investigation by the Mission were addressed during the hearings, the 38 public testimonies 
covered a wide range of relevant facts as well as legal and military matters. The Mission had 
initially intended to hold hearings in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank. However, denial of access 
to Israel and the West Bank resulted in the decision to hold hearings of participants from Israel 
and the West Bank in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>167. Participants in the hearings were identified in the course of the Mission&#8217;s investigations, 
and had either first-hand experience or information or specialized knowledge of the issues under 
investigation and analysis. In keeping with the objectives of the hearings, the Mission gave 
priority to the participation of victims and people from the affected communities. Participants 
took part in the hearings on a voluntary basis. Some individuals declined to participate for fear of 
reprisal. The Mission received expressions of gratitude from participants, as well as members of 
the affected communities, for having provided an opportunity to speak publicly of their 
experiences. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Assessment of information 
</b></p>
<p>168. In establishing its findings, the Mission sought to rely primarily and whenever possible on 
information it gathered first-hand, including through on-site observations, interviews and 
meetings with relevant persons. Information produced by others, including reports, affidavits and 
media reports, was used primarily as corroboration.   
</p>
<p>169. The section of the report on the Gaza Strip is based on first-hand information gathered and 
verified by the Mission. To assess the situation in Israel and in the West Bank, the Mission had 
to make comparatively greater use of information produced by others for the reasons explained 
above. These sections too, however, include first-hand information directly gathered and verified 
by the Mission. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>170. The Mission met or spoke with witnesses, listened to what they had to say and questioned 
them wherever necessary. Taking into account the demeanour of witnesses, the plausibility of 
their accounts and the consistency of these accounts with the circumstances observed by it and 
with other testimonies, the Mission was able to determine the credibility and reliability of those 
people it heard. Regarding the large amount of documentary information the Mission received or 
had access to as documents in the public domain, it tried as far as possible to speak with the 
authors of the documents in order to ascertain the methodologies used and to clarify any doubts 
or problems.   
</p>
<p>171. The final conclusions on the reliability of the information received were made taking all 
of these matters into consideration, cross-referencing the relevant material and information, and 
assessing whether, in all the circumstances, there was sufficient information of a credible and 
reliable nature for the Mission to make a finding in fact.   
</p>
<p>172. On the basis set out above, the Mission has, to the best of its ability, determined what facts 
have been established. In many cases it has found that acts entailing individual criminal 
responsibility have been committed. In all of these cases the Mission has found that there is 
sufficient information to establish the objective elements of the crimes in question. In almost all 
of the cases the Mission has also been able to determine whether or not it appears that the acts in 
question were done deliberately or recklessly or in the knowledge that the consequence that 
resulted would result in the ordinary course of events, that is, the Mission has referred in many 
cases to the relevant fault element (mens rea). The Mission fully appreciates the importance of 
the presumption of innocence: the findings in the report do not subvert the operation of that 
principle. The findings do not attempt to identify the individuals responsible for the commission 
of offences nor do they pretend to reach the standard of proof applicable in criminal trials. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Consultation with the parties 
</b></p>
<p>173. The Mission received documentation related to its mandate from the Palestinian 
Authority. During its visits in Gaza, the Mission was provided with significant material and 
documentation by the Gaza authorities. On 29 July, it received, through UN Watch, a paper<b>5</b> on 
the military operations in Gaza that sets out the Government of Israel&#8217;s position on many issues 
investigated by the Mission.  
</p>
<p>174. During its meetings in Gaza, Amman and Geneva, the Mission discussed matters within 
its mandate with Palestinian counterparts. While no cooperation was received from the 
Government of Israel, the Mission met a number of Israeli citizens formerly in senior 
Government positions.  
</p>
<p>175. In order to provide the parties concerned with an opportunity to submit additional relevant 
information and express their position and respond to allegations, the Mission also submitted 
comprehensive lists of questions to the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the

Gaza authorities in advance of completing its analysis and findings. The Mission received replies 
from the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza authorities but not from Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>II. CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>176. The Mission is of the view that the events that it was mandated to investigate should not 
be considered in isolation. They are part of a broader context, and are deeply rooted in the many 
years of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territory and in the political and violent 
confrontation that have characterized the history of the region. A review of the historical, 
political and military developments between the Six-Day War in 1967 and the announcement of 
the &#8220;period of calm&#8221; (<i>Tahdiyah)</i> in June 2008,<b>6</b> and of Israeli policies towards the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory is necessary to consider and understand the events that fall more directly 
within the scope of the Mission&#8217;s mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Historical context 
</b></p>
<p>177. The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip were captured by Israel 
following the Six-Day War of June 1967. The two non-contiguous areas had been administered 
by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, since the establishment of the &#8220;Green Line&#8221; along the 1949 
Armistice demarcation, separating the newly founded State of Israel and its neighbours. After 
1967, the two areas were administered directly by military commanders until 1981 and since 
then through a &#8220;Civil Administration&#8221; established by the Israeli armed forces. &#8220;Military orders&#8221; 
were used to rule the civil affairs of the Palestinian population superimposing and often revoking 
pre-existing Jordanian laws in the West Bank and Egyptian laws in the Gaza Strip. East 
Jerusalem was annexed to the Israeli municipality of the city and in 1980 the Knesset passed a 
law which declared that &quot;Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel&#8221;. With Security 
Council resolution 478 (1980), the United Nations declared this law &#8220;null and void&#8221;, 
condemning any attempt to &#8220;alter the character and status of Jerusalem&#8221;.<b>7</b> No member of the 
United Nations, apart from Israel, recognizes the annexation of East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>178. After the Likud party won the 1977 Israeli elections, the establishment of settlements 
within the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip dramatically accelerated, and 
the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the construction of settlements have continued 
unabated to this day. Many years of growing tension and violence concerning the unresolved 
status of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel ensued. In 1987 a widespread popular 
uprising &#8211; the intifada &#8211; was forcefully repressed by the Israeli security forces but lasted until 
1993, when the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Government

<b>6</b> Due to obvious space limitations, the historical context does not make reference to the numerous important events 
that took place during this period (such as the 1973 War, the Camp David Accords, the peace treaty with Jordan, the 
2006 Lebanon War and many others).

 <p> 
of Israel agreed to recognize each other and signed the &#8220;Declaration of Principles on Interim 
Self-Government Arrangements&#8221; also known as the &#8220;Oslo I Accord&#8221;.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>179. In 1994 the Palestinian Authority was established following the Oslo I Accord and in 
1995 &#8220;the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip&#8221;, also 
known as &#8220;Oslo II&#8221;,<b>9</b> detailed practical steps to be implemented by the parties in view of the 
negotiations on the final status of the territory. The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin by an Israeli extremist in 1995 dealt a lethal blow to the peace process. 
Successive Israeli Governments and the Palestinian political leadership failed to reach an 
agreement on the final status at the United States-sponsored Camp David summit in 2000 and 
during direct talks in Taba (Egypt) in 2001.  
</p>
<p>180. A second popular uprising erupted in September 2000, after the then opposition leader 
Ariel Sharon conducted a controversial visit to the Temple Mount/al-Haram al-Sharif in 
Jerusalem.<b>10</b> This second intifada set off an unprecedented cycle of violence.  
</p>
<p>181. According to independent sources, while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict claimed the lives 
of 1,549 Palestinians and 421 Israelis between 1987 and 2000,<b>11</b> between September 2000 and 
December 2008, 5,500 Palestinians were killed (593 as result of intra-Palestinian violence) as 
well as 1,062 Israelis and 64 foreigners.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>182. According to Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 154 suicide bomb attacks against Israeli 
civilians and military personnel took place between 1993 and 2007. They killed 542 individuals, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>8</b> The Agreement contained a specific provision for the establishment of a &#8220;strong police force&#8221; to &#8220;guarantee public 
order and internal security for the Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip&#8221;. See http://www.reliefweb.int/ 
rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MHII-62DANP?OpenDocument.  
<b>9</b> The Agreement defined three areas of jurisdiction in Gaza and the West Bank: area &#8220;A&#8221;, in which Palestinians 
would have full administrative and security responsibilities; area &#8220;B&#8221;, in which Palestinians would have 
administrative responsibilities, but Israelis would retain security control; and area &#8220;C&#8221;, where Israelis would 
maintain administrative and security responsibilities. See http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MHII-
62DAP5?OpenDocument.  
<b>10</b> Situated at the heart of the Old City in East Jerusalem, the site is of religious significance to both Muslims and 
Jews. The Temple Mount/al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) is the location of al-Aqsa and the Dome of the 
Rock mosques, the third most sacred place in Islam. It is also believed to be the location of the two ancient Jewish 
temples. The southern section of its western external perimeter is what is known as the Western Wall. Haram al-
Sharif is administered by an Islamic trust (Waqf) and religious rituals performed there by non-Muslims are 
forbidden.

with a peak in 2002 of 220 individuals killed in 55 suicide attacks.<b>13</b> The last recorded suicide 
attack took place in February 2008 in the Israeli city of Dimona.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>183. The firing of rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel began in 2001.<b>15</b> Israeli sources 
report that as many as 3,455 rockets and 3,742 mortar shells were fired into Israel from Gaza 
until mid-June 2008.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>184. After his election as Prime Minister in 2001, the Likud leader Ariel Sharon discontinued 
any direct contacts with the Palestinian leadership, in effect putting an end to talks on the final 
status.  
</p>
<p>185. In June 2002, the beginning of the construction of the separation Wall, which encroached 
on Palestinian land to encompass most Israeli settlement areas in the West Bank as well as East 
Jerusalem, left almost half a million Palestinians on the western side of the divide, cutting 
historical, social, cultural and economic ties with the rest of the Palestinians in the West Bank.<b>17</b> 
In 2004, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on the legality of the Wall 
being built by Israel, at the request of the United Nations General Assembly. The Court stated 
that Israel must cease construction of the barrier, dismantle the parts of the barrier that were built 
inside the West Bank, revoke the orders issued relating to its construction and compensate the 
Palestinians who suffered losses as a result of the barrier.<b>18</b> Israel disregarded the views of the 
Court and construction of the Wall continued. In 2004 and 2005, the Israeli Supreme Court, 
sitting as the High Court of Justice (see sect. D below), ruled that some parts of the route of the 
Wall violated the principle of &#8220;proportionality&#8221;in both Israeli and international law, causing 
harm to an &#8220;occupied population&#8221; and that the construction of the structure should be done in a 
way to lessen the prejudicial impact on the rights of the resident Palestinians. The Israeli Court

</p>
<p>186. In 2002, the so-called Quartet (the United States, the European Union, the Russian 
Federation and the United Nations) proposed a plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The plan came to be known as the &#8220;road map to peace.&#8221;<b>21</b> The road map envisaged that the 
Palestinians would engage in democratic reforms and renounce violent means and that Israel 
would accept a Palestinian Government and cease settlement activities. Fulfilment of the road 
map&#8217;s commitments would lead to negotiations on the final status. The road map remains 
unimplemented. The same year, the League of Arab States adopted a proposal that Saudi Arabia 
presented at the Beirut Summit in which its members pledged to establish normal relations with 
Israel in the context of a comprehensive peace that would establish a Palestinian State within the 
border of 1967.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>187. On 6 June 2004, the Israeli Cabinet adopted a &#8220;disengagement plan&#8221; providing for the 
unilateral removal from the Gaza Strip of Israeli security forces and Israeli civilians living in 
settlements. The plan was endorsed by the Knesset on 26 October of the same year. With the 
evacuation of all Israeli residents and associated security personnel from the Gaza Strip 
completed on 12 September 2005, Israel declared that &#8220;there will be no basis for claiming that 
the Gaza Strip is occupied territory&#8221; (on the continued occupation, see chapter IV). Under the 
disengagement plan, however, the Israeli armed forces continued to maintain control over Gaza&#8217;s 
borders, coastline and airspace, and Israel reserved &#8220;its inherent right of self-defence, both 
preventive and reactive, including where necessary the use of force, in respect of threats 
emanating from the Gaza Strip.&#8221; Israel removed both settlements and military bases protecting 
the settlers from the Gaza Strip, redeploying on Gaza&#8217;s southern border and repositioning its 
forces to other areas just outside the Gaza Strip. In addition to controlling the borders, coastline 
and airspace, after the implementation of the disengagement plan, Israel continued to control 
Gaza&#8217;s telecommunications, water, electricity and sewage networks, as well as the population 
registry, and the flow of people and goods into and out of the territory while the inhabitants of 
Gaza continued to rely on the Israeli currency.<b>23</b>

2006. The List of Change and Reform, of which Hamas represented the main component, won 
the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council and formed a Government. Shortly 
thereafter, the international community redirected international aid from the Palestinian 
Authority to international organizations and humanitarian agencies, isolating the new Palestinian 
executive in a stated effort to put pressure on it to accept the so-called Quartet Principles. The 
Quartet had already announced that, to be recognized by the international community, any 
Palestinian Government should adhere to three &#8220;Principles&#8221;: (i) recognition of the State of Israel, 
(ii) recognition of previous agreements and (iii) renunciation of violence.<b>24</b> Israel also imposed 
economic sanctions on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority Government, including by 
withholding tax revenues it collected on imports and introducing additional restrictions on the 
movement of goods to and from the Gaza Strip. Israel declared that sanctions would be lifted 
only when the new Palestinian Government would abide by the Quartet Principles.<b>25</b>  
</p>
<p>189. In June 2006, a squad drawn from three groups &#8211; the Popular Resistance Committees, 
al-Qassam Brigades and the until then unknown Army of Islam &#8211; excavated a tunnel under the 
Gaza-Israel border and attacked the military base of Kerem Shalom inside Israel, blowing up a 
tank, killing two soldiers and capturing a third, Corporal Gilad Shalit. In reaction to the capture, 
the Israeli Government conducted a number of targeted assassinations of alleged militants 
belonging to Hamas and other groups; arrested Palestinian Authority cabinet ministers, Hamas 
parliamentarians and other leaders in the West Bank; attacked key civilian infrastructure in the 
Gaza Strip, such as the main power plant, the main bridge in central Gaza and Palestinian 
Authority offices; tightened the economic isolation; and carried out major armed thrusts into the 
Gaza Strip for the first time since August 2005.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>190. After the refusal of the politically defeated Fatah movement to cede the control of 
Palestinian Authority institutions and specifically security institutions to the new Government, 
armed clashes erupted between the two political groups both in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank. In February 2007, Palestinian leaders assembled in Mecca signed an agreement sponsored 
by Saudi Arabia that led to the formation of a coalition Government that was approved by the 
Palestinian Legislative Council in March.<b>27</b> The coalition Government was headed by Hamas and 
included members of other political movements, including Fatah, as well as independents. After 
only four months, violent clashes erupted again between armed and security forces loyal to Fatah 
and Hamas. By 14 June 2007, Hamas forces and armed groups had seized all Palestinian

Authority security installations and government buildings in the Gaza Strip.<b>28</b> The President of 
the Palestinian Authority dismissed the Hamas-led Government (hereinafter called the Gaza 
authorities), declared a state of emergency and established an emergency Government based in 
the West Bank, which was largely recognized by the international community.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>191. In November 2007, the United States of America sponsored the organization of a new 
comprehensive peace conference. At the Conference &#8211; held in Annapolis, Maryland, United 
States of America &#8211; the Palestinian President and the Israeli Prime Minister agreed to resume 
negotiations by the end of 2007. In addition, they agreed to work continuously to reach a 
two-State solution by the end of 2008. 
</p>
<p>192. On 19 September 2007, the Government of Israel declared Gaza &#8220;hostile territory.&#8221;<b>30</b> This 
was followed by the imposition of further severe reductions in the transfer of goods and supplies 
of fuel and electricity to the Strip. Since then, Israel has only sporadically allowed the opening of 
all the crossings into the Gaza Strip, at times completely closing them.<b>31</b> (See also chapter V.)  
</p>
<p>193. Israeli military operations in Gaza and the West Bank started well before the so-called 
disengagement of 2005. &#8220;Operation Defensive Shield&#8221; in 2002 was the largest military operation 
in the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War. It began with an incursion into Ramallah, placing 
the then President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, under siege in his offices, and was 
followed by incursions into the six largest cities in the West Bank and their surrounding 
localities. During the three weeks of the military incursions in areas that were under the direct 
control of the Palestinian Authority, 497 Palestinians were killed.<b>32</b> The siege on the half 
destroyed Ramallah <i>Muqataa </i>compound of President Arafat was lifted only at the end of 2004 
when he was flown to Paris to undergo medical treatment. He later died there. 
</p>
<p>194. &#8220;Operation Rainbow&#8221; of 2004 targeted the Rafah area of the Gaza Strip and left about 
50 Palestinians dead. &#8220;Operation Days of Penitence&#8221; was carried out between September and 
October 2004. According to the Israeli Government, it was launched in retaliation for the firing 
of rockets against the town of Sderot and Israeli settlements inside the Gaza Strip. It targeted the 
towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia and the Jabaliyah refugee camp and resulted in the deaths 
of more than 100 Palestinians and 5 Israelis. 
</p>
<p>195. From the disengagement until November 2006, the Israeli armed forces fired 
approximately 15,000 artillery shells and conducted more than 550 air strikes into the Gaza 
Strip. Israeli military attacks killed approximately 525 people in Gaza. Over the same period, at

least 1,700 rockets and mortars were fired into Israel by Palestinian militants, injuring 
41 Israelis. The conflict culminated, in 2006, in the Israeli military incursions into Gaza, 
codenamed &#8220;Summer Rains&#8221; and &#8220;Autumn Clouds&#8221;, the latter focusing on the north of the Strip 
around the town of Beit Hanoun, where shortly after the end of the military operations in 
November, 19 people, of whom 18 of the same family, were killed by artillery fire in one 
incident.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>196. In February 2008, a rocket attack from Gaza hit the Israeli city of Ashkelon causing light 
injures. The Israeli armed forced launched an operation codenamed &#8220;Hot Winter&#8221; during which 
the air force conducted at least 75 air strikes on different targets within the Gaza Strip. As a 
result of the military operation, more than 100 Palestinians and 2 Israelis were killed in Gaza.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>197. In June 2008, an informal &#8220;period of calm&#8221; (<i>Tahdiyah</i>) of six months was agreed through 
Egypt&#8217;s mediation. (For more details, see chapter III.)  
</p>
<p><b>B. Overview of Israel&#8217;s pattern of policies and conduct relevant to  
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and links between the situation  
in Gaza and in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>198. Since1967, Israel has built hundreds of settlements in the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Such settlements were recognized by its Ministry of Interior as 
Israeli &#8220;communities&#8221; subjected to Israeli law. The above-mentioned Advisory Opinion by the 
International Court of Justice advisory opinion and &#8220;a number of United Nations resolutions 
have all affirmed that Israel&#8217;s practice of constructing settlements &#8211; in effect, the transfer by 
an occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies &#8211; 
constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention&#8221;<b>35</b> (on the position of the Israeli High 
Court of Justice on the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, see chapter IV). Sixteen settlements in the Gaza Strip and three in the 
northern West Bank were dismantled in 2005 during the implementation of the so-called Israeli 
disengagement plan, but the establishment of new settlements continued. In 2007, there were 
more than 450,000 Israeli citizens living in 149 settlements in the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem. According to United Nations sources, almost 40 per cent of the West Bank is now 
taken up by Israeli infrastructure associated with the settlements, including roads, barriers, buffer 
zones and military bases. Data released by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics showed that 
construction in these settlements has increased in 2008 by a factor of 1.8 in comparison with the 
same period in 2007. The number of tenders in East Jerusalem has increased by 3,728 per cent 
(1,761 housing units, compared with 46 in 2007). Until the end of the 1970s, the Government of 
Israel claimed that the settlements were established on the grounds of military necessity and 
security, but it has since abandoned this position.<b>36</b>

 <p> 
199. It is estimated that 33 per cent of the settlements have been built on private land owned by 
Palestinians, much of it expropriated by the State of Israel on asserted grounds of military 
necessity. Following a ruling of the Israeli High Court of Justice in 1979, the Government of 
Israel changed its policy of land confiscation on the asserted ground of military necessity and 
started having recourse to civil laws relating to land confiscation in place under Ottoman rule. 
According to these laws, land may be seized either because no one can prove ownership in 
accordance with the required standard of evidence or because the area in which it is situated is 
declared a closed military zone which farmers are prohibited from entering.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p>200. &#8220;Since 1967, the Israeli authorities have demolished thousands of Palestinian-owned 
structures in the [Occupied Palestinian Territory], including an estimated 2,000 houses in East 
Jerusalem.&#8221;<b>38</b> During the first quarter of 2008, the Israeli authorities demolished 124 structures 
in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, for lack of permits. Of those, 61 were residential 
buildings whose demolition caused the displacement of many Palestinians, including children. 
Demolition of structures and residential buildings has been a feature of the Israeli policy that has 
displaced Palestinians mainly in the Jordan Valley and in East Jerusalem, but also in other areas 
of the West Bank. The Israeli authorities justify the majority of these demolitions by claiming 
that the structures or buildings lack the necessary permits. The relevant Israeli authorities rarely 
issue building permits for Palestinians, frequently refusing them on the basis that the 
construction is in violation of the mandatory regional outline plans approved by the British 
Mandate Government of Palestine in the 1940s.<b>39</b> Areas in East Jerusalem face the prospect of 
mass demolitions. Carrying out pending demolition orders would affect a combined total of more 
than 3,600 persons.<b>40</b> The combined effects of the Israeli policies of expanding and establishing 
new settlements, the demolition of Palestinian-owned properties, including houses, the restrictive 
and discriminatory housing policies as well as the Wall have been described as a way of 
&#8220;actively pursuing the illegal annexation&#8221; of East Jerusalem.<b>41</b>

<p>201. The route of the Wall weaves between Palestinian villages and neighbourhoods and has 
contributed to the fragmentation of the West Bank into a series of enclaves separated from one 
another (see map<b>42</b> below). The Wall encircles settlements built around Jerusalem and within the 
West Bank and connects them to Israel. Eighty per cent of Israeli inhabitants of these settlements 
reside to the west of the Wall. The route of the Wall, which has created a demarcation, is to a 
great degree determined by the objective of incorporating settlements into the Israeli side and to 
exclude Palestinians from these areas.<b>43</b> If completed, 85 per cent of the Wall will be located 
inside the West Bank, and 9.5 per cent of West Bank territory, including East Jerusalem, will be 
cut off from the rest of the West Bank. It is estimated that 385,000 Israeli citizens in 
80 settlements out of the total of 450,000 Israeli citizens in 149 settlements and 260,000 
Palestinians, including in East Jerusalem, will be located between the Wall and the Green Line. 
In addition, approximately 125,000 Palestinians in 28 communities will be surrounded on three 
sides and 26,000 Palestinians in eight communities will be surrounded on four sides.<b>44</b> A number 
of surveys compiled by United Nations agencies<b>45</b> found that many Palestinian communities cut 
off by the Wall do not enjoy full access to emergency health services, posing severe challenges 
in medical emergencies and for expectant mothers. In addition the Wall cuts off residents in 
closed areas from schools and universities, also having an impact on social relations and 
especially on traditional marriage patterns. The Wall isolates the land and water resources of a 
large number of Palestinians, having a negative impact on agricultural practices and on rural 
livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>202. Despite the claim by Israel that restrictions of movement within the West Bank are 
imposed on Palestinian residents for security purposes, most of those internal restrictions appear 
to have been designed to guarantee unobstructed travel to the Israeli inhabitants of the 
settlements. None of these restrictions applies to Israeli citizens travelling throughout the West 
Bank.<b>46</b>

</p>
<p>203. A two-tiered road system has been established throughout the West Bank in which main 
roads are reserved for the exclusive use of Israeli citizens while Palestinians are confined to a 
different (and inferior) road network. The Israeli-built roads in the West Bank form a network 
linking Israeli settlements with one another and to Israel proper. Palestinians are denied free 
access to approximately 1,500 km of roads within the West Bank.<b>47</b> Travel on these roads by

<b>47</b> Most prohibited roads comprise the major north-south and east-west routes in the West Bank. These are reserved 
for settlers, Israeli security forces and non-Palestinian international passport holders, including international United 
Nations staff. </p>

 <p> 
Palestinians is completely forbidden. Partially prohibited roads are those for which a special 
permit is required, while restricted roads are those on which individuals travelling on such roads 
who are not from the local area must have a permit.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>204. The policy of &#8220;closure&#8221;, i.e. closures of entire areas and restrictions on the movement for 
goods and people on the basis of alleged security threats to Israeli citizens, has been a 
characteristic of the Israeli control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since 1996 and has 
dramatically affected the lives of Palestinians. &#8220;Perhaps the most devastating effect of the 
heightened closure has been a dramatic rise in unemployment levels in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Because the closure restricts the movement of all people (and goods) in and out of the 
Gaza Strip and West Bank, as well as movement within the West Bank itself, workers from these 
territories have been unable to reach their places of employment. According to the Palestinian 
Ministry of Labour, unemployment in Gaza has increased from 50 per cent to 74 per cent (and 
from 30 per cent to 50 per cent in the West Bank). Before the heightened closure, 22,000 Gazans 
(down from 80,000 in 1987) and 26,000 West Bankers had permits to work in Israel.&#8221; &#8220;Losses 
from unemployment amount to $1.04 million daily for the Gaza Strip alone &#8211; $750,000 from lost 
wages in Israel and $290,000 from lost wages in local sectors. The Palestinian Bureau of 
Statistics (PBS) estimates that from February 25 to April 4, the Gaza Strip and West Bank lost 
$78.3 million in wages and income.&#8221;<b>49</b> In June 2009, more than 40 United Nations and other 
humanitarian agencies urged Israel to lift its blockade of Gaza, where nearly everyone depends 
on international humanitarian assistance, and indiscriminate sanctions are affecting the entire 
population of 1.5 million<b>50</b> (see also chap. V). 
</p>
<p>205. A number of Israeli policies and measures especially since 1996 have contributed to 
effectively separating Gaza from the West Bank, despite the commitments contained in the Oslo 
I Accord by which &#8220;the two sides view the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a single territorial 
unit, whose integrity will be preserved during the interim period.&#8221; The imposition of tight 
closures and limitations on movement has chiefly contributed to this separation.<b>51</b> With the 
implementation of the &#8220;disengagement plan&#8221; and after Hamas secured control of the Gaza Strip, 
the imposition of an almost total closure has meant that direct contact is no longer possible with 
Palestinians from the West Bank. The arrest by Israel of members of the Palestinian Legislative 
Council and other Palestinian Authority officials has also resulted in the inability of many 
institutions to function properly and prevented Palestinians from the two areas to work together. 
In the past few years a new permit system has been imposed on Palestinians of the Gaza Strip 
living in the West Bank. Without such a permit they can be declared &quot;illegal aliens&quot;. In addition, 
the Israeli authorities &#8211; who are in control of the population registry &#8211; have stopped updating the 
addresses of Palestinians who have moved from Gaza to the West Bank. The new requirement

 <p> 
for a permit is based on a person's registered address, enabling Israel to bar Palestinians whose 
registered address is in Gaza from moving to the West Bank. This measure has also retroactively 
turned many Palestinians who already live in the West Bank into illegal residents. These policies 
have had a devastating impact on many families that were effectively forced to live apart or, in 
order to live together, move to the Gaza Strip with no possibility of returning to the West Bank.<b>52</b> 
Israel has bureaucratically and logistically effectively split and separated not only Palestinians in 
the occupied territories and their families in Israel, but also Palestinian residents of Jerusalem 
and those in the rest of the territory and between Gazans and West Bankers/Jerusalemites.<b>53</b> </p>
<p>206. Despite prohibitions under international humanitarian law (IHL),<b>54</b> Israel has applied its 
domestic laws throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 1967. Notably, existing 
planning and construction laws were annulled and replaced with military orders, and related civil 
powers transferred from local authorities to Israeli institutions, with ultimate discretion resting 
with military commanders.<b>55</b> The application of Israeli domestic laws has resulted in 
institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the 
benefit of Jewish settlers, both Israeli citizens and others. Exclusive benefits reserved for Jews 
derive from the two-tiered civil status under Israel&#8217;s domestic legal regime based on a &#8220;Jewish 
nationality,&#8221; which entitles &#8220;persons of Jewish race or descendency&#8221;<b>56</b> to superior rights and 
privileges, particularly in land use, housing, development, immigration and access to natural 
resources, as affirmed in key legislation.<b>57</b> Administrative procedures qualify indigenous 
inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory as &#8220;alien persons&#8221; and, thus, prohibited from 
building on, or renting, large portions of land designated by the Government of Israel as &#8220;State 
land&#8221;.<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>207. The two-tiered civil status under Israeli law, favouring &#8220;Jewish nationals&#8221; (<i>le&#8217;om yehudi</i>) 
over persons holding Israeli citizenship (<i>ezrahut</i>), has been a subject of concern under the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, particularly those forms of 
discrimination carried out through Israel&#8217;s parastatal agencies (World Zionist 
Organization/Jewish Agency, Jewish National Fund and their affiliates), which dominate land 
use, housing and development.<b>59</b> The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also

<b>59</b> In 1998, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights observed &#8220;with grave concern that the Status 
Law of 1952 authorizes the World Zionist Organization/Jewish Agency and its subsidiaries, including the Jewish 
 </p>

 <p> 
has recognized that Israel&#8217;s application of a &#8220;Jewish nationality&#8221; distinct from Israeli citizenship 
institutionalizes discrimination that disadvantages all Palestinians, in particular, refugees.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>208. In 2007, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination highlighted another 
discriminatory policy imposed by the Israeli authorities on Palestinian residents of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory as well as those who are Israeli citizens (but denied a legal &#8220;nationality&#8221; 
status).<b>61</b> The &#8220;Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order)&#8221; of 31 May 2003 bars 
the possibility of granting Israeli citizenship and residence permits in Israel, including through 
family reunification, to residents of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Committee noted 
that such measures have a disproportionate impact on Arab Israeli citizens who marry 
Palestinians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and wish to live together with their families 
in Israel. While noting the State party&#8217;s legitimate objective of guaranteeing the safety of its 
citizens, the Committee expressed concern about the fact that these &#8220;temporary&#8221; measures have 
systematically been renewed and have been expanded to citizens of &#8220;enemy States&#8221;.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>209. Since 1967, about 750,000 Palestinians have been detained at some point by the 
Government of Israel, according to Palestinian human rights organizations. Currently, there are 
approximately 8,100 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons and detention centres, roughly 550 of 
whom are administrative detainees.<b>63</b> Administrative detention is detention without charge or 
trial, authorized by an administrative order rather than by judicial decree. The conditions of 
Palestinians in Israeli detention facilities have been the subject of considerable international 
criticism, including concerns of torture and other ill-treatment. Palestinian detainees can 
normally be visited only by first-degree relatives (see chapter XXI). However, following Hamas&#8217; 
seizure of full control in the Gaza Strip in June 2007, the Israeli authorities suspended visits from 
family members travelling from Gaza to Palestinian detainees in Israel, depriving more than 
900 detainees of direct contact with their relatives.<b>64</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                             
National Fund, to control most of the land in Israel, since these institutions are chartered to benefit Jews exclusively. 
[&#8230;] large-scale and systematic confiscation of Palestinian land and property by the State and the transfer of that 
property to these agencies constitute an institutionalized form of discrimination because these agencies by definition 
would deny the use of these properties to non-Jews. Thus, these practices constitute a breach of Israel's obligations 
under the Covenant.&#8221; (E/C.12/1/Add.27, para. 11). 
<b>60</b> In its 2003 review, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also observed with particular concern 
that &#8220;the status of &#8216;Jewish nationality,&#8217; which is a ground for exclusive preferential treatment for persons of Jewish 
nationality under the Israeli Law of Return, granting them automatic citizenship and financial government benefits, 
thus resulting in practice in discriminatory treatment against non-Jews, in particular Palestinian refugees.&#8221; 
(E/C.12/1/Add.90, para. 18). 
<b>61</b> The &#8220;Or&#8221; Commission, a panel appointed by the Israeli Government in 2000, found that Arab citizens suffer 
discrimination in Israel and levelled criticism at the Government for failing to give fair and equal attention to the 
needs of Arab citizens of Israel. See its full report at: http://elyon1.court.gov.il/heb/veadot/or/inside_index.htm (in

<p><b>C. Relevant political and administrative structures in  
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>210. The Palestinian Legislative Council is the legislature of the Palestinian Authority; a 
unicameral body with 132 members, elected from 16 electoral districts in the West Bank and 
Gaza. Its initial composition, whose normal cycle is four years, was 88 members. In accordance 
with the Oslo Accords, the first Palestinian elections took place in 1996 under the supervision of 
international monitors. In 2000, a second round of planned elections did not take place due to the 
flaring-up of the second intifada. In January 2006, the second general polls took place. The 
elections resulted in a majority for the List of Change and Reform.<b>65</b> On 29 June, days after the 
capture of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli armed forces in the West Bank arrested eight Palestinian 
Government ministers and 26 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council.<b>66</b> The Council has 
been unable to operate since, as the continued detention of its members means it cannot achieve 
a quorum. 
</p>
<p>211. The Palestinian Basic Law was developed to function as a temporary constitution for the 
Palestinian Authority until the establishment of an independent State and a permanent 
constitution for Palestine can be drawn up. The Basic Law was passed by the Palestinian 
Legislative Council in 1997 and ratified by the President of the Palestinian Authority in 2002. It 
has been amended twice: in 2003, the political system was changed to introduce a prime minister 
and, in 2005, it was amended to conform to the new Election Law.<b>67</b> The legal system comprises 
a body of laws and decrees which include those remaining from previous centuries &#8211; Ottoman, 
British, Jordanian (in the West Bank), Egyptian (in the Gaza Strip) and Israeli &#8211; and legislation 
introduced by presidential decrees and laws passed by the Palestinian Legislative Council.<b>68</b> 
</p>
<p>212. In the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, the court system comprises Magistrate 
Courts, dealing with misdemeanours; Courts of First Instance, dealing with more serious crimes 
and appeals against judgements handed down by Magistrate Courts; Appeal Courts, which hear 
appeals against judgements of the Courts of First Instance; and the High Court, which provides 
the highest level of appeal. A Supreme Criminal Court was set up in 2006 to try crimes such as 
murder, abduction, rape, so-called honour crimes and attacks on national security. Military 
Courts hear cases involving members of the security forces and apply the 1979 PLO 
Revolutionary Code. The Attorney General and the prosecutors investigate and prosecute crimes, 
oversee the legality of detentions and investigate complaints by detainees. The Attorney General 
and the judges are nominated by the Higher Judicial Council, which is headed by the President of 
the High Court, but appointed by the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s President.<b>69</b> Since June 2007, the 
Gaza authorities have restructured the judiciary in violation of Palestinian laws. To replace

officials who had left their jobs under instruction of the Palestinian Authority, the Gaza 
authorities appointed judges and prosecutors generally lacking experience and independence.<b>70</b>  
</p>
<p>213. Before June 2007, there were about 12,600 Palestinian police officers in Gaza and 
6,500 in the West Bank under a unified command. Palestinian civil police were operating from 
10 district headquarters (including the one in Ramallah, which is also its main central command). 
After Hamas seized full control of the Gaza Strip, official data about police numbers are 
available only for the West Bank, where there are 78 police facilities, including district 
headquarters, general stations and posts, public order compounds, prisons and detention centres, 
training centres and stations for border police, tourist police, criminal investigation police and 
traffic police.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p>214. In 2005 various security forces were consolidated into three branches: National Security, 
Internal Security and General Intelligence, each comprising several forces. General Intelligence 
includes Military Intelligence and the Military Police, and is under the direct control of the 
Palestinian Authority&#8217;s President, as is the Presidential Guard/Force 17. National Security and 
Internal Security are under the jurisdiction of the Ministers of National Security and the Interior, 
respectively, but their heads are appointed by the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s President. In 2006, the 
then Hamas Interior Minister established the Executive Force, mainly composed of members of 
al-Qassam Brigades and Hamas supporters.<b>72</b> Since Hamas seized control in June 2007, law and 
order and other security functions have been performed by Hamas security organizations.<b>73</b> The 
Gaza authorities announced a series of new bodies or mechanisms to replace the Palestinian 
Authority&#8217;s security forces and judicial institutions that have refused to operate under or 
alongside the Hamas administration.<b>74</b> In September 2007, the Internal Security Force was 
established with most of its personnel coming from al-Qassam Brigades. In October 2007, 
Hamas dissolved the Executive Force and absorbed its personnel into the police. Both the 
Internal Security Force and the police report to the minister of interior.<b>75</b> (See chapter X.)

stated aim of conducting armed resistance to Israeli occupation.<b>77</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Relevant political and administrative structures in Israel 
</b></p>
<p>216. In Israel, a largely ceremonial President is elected by the 120-seat Knesset for a seven-
year, non-renewable term. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the largest party or 
coalition in the Knesset, whose members are elected by party-list, proportional representation for 
four-year terms. The three main parties are the centre-left Labour Party, the centrist Kadima and 
the right-wing Likud.<b>78</b>  
</p>
<p>217. Following legislative elections, the President assigns a Knesset member &#8211; traditionally the 
leader of the largest party &#8211; the task of forming a governing coalition. 
</p>
<p>218. Israel has no formal constitution; some of the functions of a constitution are fulfilled by 
the Declaration of Establishment (1948), the Basic Laws of the parliament (Knesset) and the 
Israeli Citizenship Law. 
</p>
<p>219. The court system comprises Magistrates&#8217; Courts, which are courts of first instance in 
criminal and civil matters; District Courts, which are courts of first instance with jurisdiction 
over serious criminal offences which carry the death penalty or more than seven years&#8217; 
imprisonment and act as appellate courts for the judgments of the Magistrates' Court; and the 
Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial instance of the country.<b>79</b> The Supreme Court hears 
direct petitions from Israeli citizens. It also hears cases related to Palestinian residents of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip sitting as the High Court of Justice.<b>80</b> Palestinian civilians charged 
with security-related and other criminal offences are, however, commonly tried in the Israeli 
military court system. Since 1967, more than 200,000 cases have been brought before military 
courts, where Palestinian civilians have been prosecuted and judged by the military authorities. 
About half the prisoners currently being held in Israel have been sentenced to prison terms by 
military courts.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>220. The Israeli police is a civilian force mandated to fight crime, control traffic and maintain 
public safety. The border police (<i>Magav</i>) is the military branch of the Israeli police, with combat, 
counter-terrorism and riot-control units.

<b>80</b> &#8220;As the High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding 
the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and 
persons performing public functions under the law. It rules on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant 
relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal.&#8221; See The State

 <p> 
</p><p>221. Branches of the military are the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Israeli Naval Forces (INF) 
and the Israeli Air Force (IAF). The Israeli military is headed by the Chief of General Staff under 
the Minister of Defense. The structure of the Israeli army comprises four regional commands: 
(a) the Northern Command; (b) the Central Command; (c) the Southern Command; and (d) the 
Home Front Command. The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) &#8211; 
formerly known as the &#8220;Civil Administration&#8221; &#8211; is a unit in the Israeli Ministry of Defense that 
administers areas of the West Bank and coordinates with international organizations operating in 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p>222. The Israeli intelligence services are: (a) the Institute for Intelligence and Special 
Operations (<i>Mossad</i>); (b) the Israeli Security Agency (formerly the General Security Services) or 
the Israeli internal security service (<i>Shin Bet</i> or <i>Shabak</i>); and (c) the Military Intelligence 
(<i>Aman</i>).

<p><b>III. EVENTS OCCURRING BETWEEN THE &#8220;CEASEFIRE&#8221; OF  
18 JUNE 2008 BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE GAZA AUTHORITIES  
AND THE START OF ISRAEL&#8217;S MILITARY OPERATIONS IN GAZA  
ON 27 DECEMBER 2008 
</b></p>
<p>223. As mentioned in chapter I, in order to implement its mandate the Mission decided to focus 
primarily on events, actions or circumstances that had occurred since 19 June 2008, when a 
ceasefire was agreed between the Government of Israel and Hamas.  Accordingly, both in the 
context of its mandate and in order to be informed about the environment in which the Israeli 
military operations in the Gaza Strip took place, the Mission reviewed incidents relevant to the 
ceasefire that were reported to have taken place between 19 June 2008 and the start of Israel&#8217;s 
military operations in the Gaza Strip. Information about these incidents, which are recorded in 
chronological order, was gathered primarily from documents in the public domain and may not 
represent all incidents that occurred during this period.<b>82</b>  
</p>
<p>224. On 18 June 2008, the Gaza authorities and Israel announced a six-month ceasefire in an 
agreement brokered by Egypt.<b>83</b>  The ceasefire came into effect on 19 June 2008 at 6 a.m.<b>84</b>   
</p>
<p>225. The terms of the ceasefire agreement were not set out in any formal, written document 
and, according to recent analysis, the Gaza authorities&#8217; and Israel&#8217;s understanding of the terms

<b>82</b> Sources include public statements issued by the Gaza authorities, Palestinian armed groups and Israel, reports of 
the United Nations, national and international NGOs and the media.  
<b>83</b> The ceasefire was officially termed &#8220;a period of calm&#8221; (Tahdiyah in Arabic). It has also been referred to as 
&#8220;security calm&#8221; and &#8220;lull&#8221;.

 <p> 
differed substantially.<b>85</b> According to information reported by OCHA, the agreement included a 
commitment by the Gaza authorities to halt attacks by Palestinian armed groups against Israel 
immediately and a commitment by Israel to cease its military operations in Gaza. Israel also 
reportedly agreed to ease its blockade of Gaza and gradually lift its ban on the import of a large 
number of commodities.<b>86</b> According to Egyptian sources quoted by the International Crisis 
Group,<b>87</b> after three weeks the two sides were to commence negotiations for a prisoner exchange 
and the opening of the Rafah crossing. 
</p>
<p>226. The agreement was made in respect to the territory of the Gaza Strip only, but Egypt 
reportedly undertook to work to expand the ceasefire to the West Bank after the initial six-month 
ceasefire had elapsed.<b>88</b> 
</p>
<p>227. The first incident relevant to the ceasefire reportedly took place on 23 June 2008, when a 
67-year-old Palestinian civilian was injured when the Israeli military stationed at the border 
north-west of Beit Lahia opened fire on a group of Palestinians trying to collect fire wood near 
the border. Also on 23 June, two mortar shells were reportedly fired from central Gaza. One 
landed near the Nahal Oz crossing and the other in the Negev desert; no injuries were reported.<b>89</b>  
</p>
<p>228. Between 18 and 24 June 2008, the Karni (al-Mintar) crossing conveyor belt was opened 
for four days for wheat and animal feed but was closed to all other imports and exports.  The 
Erez crossing was open for six days to allow the movement of diplomats, international 
humanitarian workers and critical medical cases. OCHA indicated that senior Palestinian 
businessmen were also allowed to cross. The Sufa crossing was open for five days during the 
week ending 24 June 2008, while the Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings remained closed. The 
Nahal Oz energy pipelines were open on the six scheduled operating days.<b>90</b>

229. Shortly after midnight on 24 June 2008, a mortar fired from Gaza landed in the Negev 
near the Karni checkpoint, causing no injuries or damage.<b>91</b> No group claimed responsibility for 
the attack.<b>92</b> 
</p>
<p>230. At dawn on 24 June 2008, the Israeli armed forces launched a raid in the West Bank town 
of Nablus in which an Islamic Jihad activist and another Palestinian man were killed.<b>93</b> 
According to statements reportedly made by the Palestinian armed group Islamic Jihad, it 
responded by firing three Qassam rockets into Israel, which landed in the western Negev 
desert.<b>94</b> It added: &#8220;We cannot keep our hands tied when this is happening to our brothers in the 
West Bank&#8221;, while a Gaza authorities spokesman was quoted as saying  that the rocket attack 
came as a result of &#8220;Israeli provocation&#8221; but that Hamas, as the Gaza authorities, was 
&#8220;committed to the security calm&#8221;.<b>95</b> In Israel, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson termed the 
rocket attacks &#8220;a grave violation of the ceasefire&#8221;<b>96</b> and said it would consider reimposing

sorts of aggression must stop&#8221;.<b>101</b> The Israeli Foreign Minister commented, &#8220;I do not care which 
organization fired the rocket, Israel must respond militarily and immediately.&#8221;<b>102</b> 
</p>
<p>233. On 27 June 2008, the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades claimed responsibility for firing mortar 
shells into Israel, one of which landed near Sderot. The head of the Gaza authorities, Ismail 
Haniyah, called on all the Palestinian factions to adhere to the ceasefire, stating that &#8220;the factions 
and the people accepted the lull in order to secure two interests &#8211; an end to aggression and the 
lifting of the siege&#8221;.<b> </b> A spokesman for the Gaza authorities was quoted as saying that it 
considered the rocket attacks to be &#8220;unpatriotic&#8221; and that Hamas was considering the possibility 
of taking action against those perpetrating the attacks against Israel.<b>103</b> 
</p>
<p>234. On 28 June 2008, mortar shells were reportedly fired at the Karni crossing but no group 
claimed responsibility. On 29 June 2008, the crossings into Gaza were closed,<b> 104</b> save for the 
delivery of fuel. 
</p>
<p>235. On 30 June 2008, Israel reported that a rocket fired from Gaza fell near the kibbutz of 
Miflasim. No group claimed responsibility and Israel confirmed that as of 1 July 2008 no rocket 
fragments had been located. Israel closed the crossings which had been reopened the day before. 
The Gaza authorities rejected the assertion that a rocket had in fact been fired and called the 
closure of the crossings &#8220;unjustified&#8221;.<b>105</b> 
</p>
<p>236. On several occasions during the last two weeks of June, the Israeli navy fired at 
Palestinian fishermen off the Gaza coast, forcing them to return to shore.<b>106</b> 
</p>
<p>237. During the month of June, the number of truckloads of goods allowed into Gaza 
represented only 17 per cent of the number that entered Gaza in May 2007, before Hamas seized 
control of the Gaza Strip. No exports had been allowed out of Gaza by Israel since December 
2007.<b>107</b>

 <p> 
238. On 1 July 2008, a spokesman for the Gaza authorities accused the Israeli armed forces of 
shooting a 65-year-old Palestinian woman who was living near the border. Israel said that it was 
investigating the claim.<b>108</b>  
</p>
<p>239. On 2 July 2008, Israel reopened the Sufa and Karni crossings to allow passage of goods 
into Gaza, while 45 medical evacuations were allowed through the Erez crossing.<b>109</b>  
</p>
<p>240. Also on 2 July 2008, several thousand Palestinians attempted to break into the Rafah 
terminal and cross into Egypt. Egyptian security forces responded with water cannons and tear 
gas to force them back into Gaza.<b>110</b> 
</p>
<p>241. On 3 July 2008, a rocket launched from Gaza struck north of Sderot and Israel closed the 
crossings into Gaza for the day on 4 July 2008 in response.<b>111</b> 
</p>
<p>242. On 7 July 2008, a mortar shell fired from Gaza landed near the Karni crossing, on the 
Gaza side.<b>112</b> On the same day, Israeli forces began raids on institutions in Nablus that it believed 
to be linked to Hamas. Over the following four days, a mosque, a newspaper and other offices 
were raided, and a medical centre and the Nafha Prisoners&#8217; Association were closed down.<b>113</b> 
</p>
<p>243. On 8 July 2008, two mortars were fired from Gaza,<b> 114</b> one landing at the Sufa crossing 
and the other inside the Gaza Strip. Israel closed the crossings briefly. Following the firing of 
another mortar shell into Israel, the crossing was again closed.  
</p>
<p>244. On 9 July 2008, Israeli forces shot dead a Hamas member near the West Bank city of 
Jenin. This led Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to warn that the Israeli 
military actions in the West Bank were undermining the Palestinian Authority and its efforts to 
improve security.<b>115</b> 
</p>
<p>245. On 10 July 2008, the Israeli armed forces shot and killed a member of al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; 
Brigades near the Kissufim crossing. The Israeli armed forces stated that warning shots had been 
fired. In response, the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades fired two rockets into Israel which landed in an 
open area. Sources inside Gaza said that the Gaza authorities had arrested those responsible for

by Hamas.<b>116</b>  
</p>
<p>246. According to Israeli sources, on 12 July 2008 a rocket launched from the Gaza Strip 
struck an open area in Sha&#8217;ar Hanegev and on 13 July 2008 two mortar shells fired fell short 
inside the Gaza border. This led to Israel closing the Nahal Oz and Sufa crossings. On 15 July 
2008, a mortar shell struck territory inside Israel, while three rockets misfired and landed inside 
the Gaza Strip, in separate incidents on 25, 29 and 31 July 2008.<b>117</b> 
</p>
<p>247. On 29 July, a 10-year-old boy was shot in the head and killed by the Israeli Border Police 
during a demonstration against the wall in Ni&#8217;lin in the West Bank. During a clash with Israeli 
Border Police the following day, after the funeral in Ni&#8217;lin, a 17 year-old boy was shot in the 
head and died on 4 August.<b>118</b> 
</p>
<p>248. During July 2008, the amount of commodities allowed into Gaza by Israel was assessed 
by OCHA as remaining &#8220;far below the actual needs&#8221; and was &#8220;restricted to certain selected 
essential humanitarian items&#8221;. The imports were 46 per cent of those entering Gaza in May 2007, 
prior to the Hamas&#8217; seizing control of the Gaza Strip. As a result of the restriction on imports and 
total ban on exports, 95 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s industries remained closed.<b>119</b> 
</p>
<p>249. In August 2008, according to Israeli sources, three mortars and eight rockets were fired 
into Israel from the Gaza Strip. They included a rocket which struck Sderot on 11 August 
2008,<b>120</b> prompting Israel&#8217;s closure of the crossings, as well as a rocket fired on 20 August 2008, 
which once again led to the closure of the border crossings.<b>121</b> 
</p>
<p>250. During August, there was a reduction in the number of truckloads carrying goods into 
Gaza. August imports represented 70 per cent of the July 2008 imports and 23 per cent of the 
May 2007 level.<b>122</b>  
</p>
<p>251. In September 2008, three mortars and one rocket were fired into Israel from the Gaza 
Strip, according to Israeli sources.<b>123</b>

 <p> 
252. During September, the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza through the 
crossing increased, with levels of imports at 37 per cent of the May 2007 level. The Sufa 
crossing closed on 13 September 2008 and goods were redirected through Kerem Shalom, as 
Israel stated that it intended to have only one goods crossing open at any one time.<b>124</b> 
</p>
<p>253. In October 2008, Israeli sources stated that only one rocket and one mortar were fired into 
Israel from the Gaza Strip.<b>125</b> There was a 30 per cent decline in imports allowed into Gaza by 
Israel as compared to September 2008, partly due to the closure of the crossings during the 
Jewish holidays. Imports were at 26 per cent of the level of May 2007. Tunnels under the Rafah 
border reportedly proliferated during this period and allowed the entry of otherwise unavailable 
goods. Collapsing tunnels continued to cause casualties.<b>126</b> 
</p>
<p>254. After two months in which few incidents were reported, the ceasefire began to founder on 
4 November 2008 following an incursion by Israeli soldiers into the Gaza Strip, which Israel 
stated was to close a cross-border tunnel that in Israel&#8217;s view was intended to be used by 
Palestinian fighters to kidnap Israeli soldiers. The soldiers attacked a house in the Wadi al-Salqa 
village, east of Deir al-Balah, which was alleged to be the starting point of the tunnel, killing a 
member of the al-Qassam Brigades. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded. In response, the al-
Qassam Brigades fired more than 30 Qassam rockets into Israel. Israel responded with an air 
strike that left a further five members of the al-Qassam Brigades dead. Both sides blamed the 
other for the escalation of violence. Hamas also accused Israel of trying to disrupt talks between 
Hamas and Fatah that were scheduled for the following week in Cairo.<b>127</b> Israel closed the 
crossings into the Gaza Strip on 5 November 2008 and they remained closed until 24 November 
2008, when they were opened briefly to allow humanitarian supplies to enter.<b>128</b> 
</p>
<p>255. According to the Israeli internal intelligence service (known as <i>Shin Bet</i> or <i>Shabak</i>), 
22 rockets and nine mortars were fired into Israel between 5 and 12 November 2008.<b>129</b> The 
crossings into the Gaza Strip remained closed during this time. On 14 November 2008, Amnesty

 <p> 
International issued a press release calling on Israel to allow humanitarian aid and medical 
supplies to enter.<b>130</b> 
</p>
<p>256. On 17 November 2008, Amnesty International issued another press release, noting that on 
that day Israel had allowed a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian assistance to enter 
Gaza. Amnesty International also noted that an additional ten members of Palestinian armed 
groups had been killed by Israeli air strikes since the killing of six members of Palestinian armed 
groups by Israel on 4 November 2008.<b>131</b> 
</p>
<p>257. Palestinian armed groups fired rockets and mortars into Israel throughout November 2008. 
According to Israeli sources, 125 rockets were fired into Israel during November 2008 
(compared to one in October) and 68 mortars shells were fired (also compared to one in 
October).<b>132</b> On 14 November 2008, a resident of Sderot was lightly injured by shrapnel. 
</p>
<p>258. Israel closed the crossings into Gaza for most of November 2008, although 42 trucks of 
humanitarian aid were permitted to cross on 24 November 2008 and about 60 on 26 November 
2008.<b>133</b> According to OCHA, the number of trucks allowed into Gaza in November 2008 was 
81 per cent lower than in October 2008. Shortages forced most of Gaza&#8217;s bakeries to close and 
UNRWA suspended food distribution for five days to 750,000 Gazans owing to a lack of food 
supplies.<b>134</b>  
</p>
<p>259. Rocket and mortar fire by Palestinian armed groups continued unabated throughout 
December 2008.<b>135</b> According to Israeli sources, 71 rockets and 59 mortars were fired into Israel 
between 1 and 18 December.<b>136</b> The number of rockets and mortars fired from the Gaza Strip 
into Israel spiked,<b>137</b> following the killing by the Israeli armed forces of an Islamic Jihad

commander in the West Bank on 15 December 2008.<b>138</b> One of the rockets launched from the 
Gaza Strip on 17 December 2008 struck the car park of a shopping centre in Sderot, injuring 
three people and causing significant damage to property.<b>139</b>  
</p>
<p>260. On 2 December 2008, the Israeli air force killed two Palestinian children and seriously 
injured two others when one of its aircraft fired a missile at a group of Palestinian children who 
were sitting in a street near Rafah. An Israeli military spokesman admitted responsibility for the 
attack and claimed that it was targeting members of Palestinian armed groups. Eyewitnesses 
informed the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) that the victims were civilians.<b>140</b> 
</p>
<p>261. On 5 December 2008, an Israeli aircraft fired a missile at members of what PCHR 
described as &#8220;activists of the Palestinian resistance&#8221; in Jabaliyah refugee camp in the northern 
Gaza Strip, seriously wounding one person.<b>141</b> On 18 December, an Israeli air strike killed a man 
in Beit Lahia.<b>142</b> The same day, Israeli aircraft attacked a car maintenance workshop in the city 
of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. The workshop was destroyed and a number of nearby 
houses were damaged.<b>143</b> 
</p>
<p>262. On 18 December 2008, the Gaza authorities declared that the truce was at an end and 
would not be renewed on the grounds that Israel had not abided by its obligations to end the 
blockade on Gaza.<b>144</b> 
</p>
<p>263. On 21 December 2008, a rocket hit a house in Sderot and a foreign worker was injured as 
a result of a rocket striking Ashkelon.<b>145</b> Israel responded with air strikes into Gaza City, 
wounding a Palestinian infant in her home.<b>146</b> Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister and Defense Minister

 <p> 
264. On 22 December 2008, a 24-hour ceasefire was declared at Egypt&#8217;s request. Three rockets 
and one mortar were launched from Gaza that day. Israel opened the border to allow a limited 
amount of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.<b>148</b>  
</p>
<p>265. By 23 December 2008, rocket and mortar fire was again increasing significantly; 
30 rockets and 30 mortars were fired into Israel on 24 December 2008.<b>149</b> The Israeli armed 
forces continued to conduct air strikes on positions inside Gaza and the crossings into Israel 
remained closed. On 26 December 2008, a rocket launched from Gaza fell short and hit a house 
in northern Gaza killing two girls, aged 5 and 12.<b>150</b> 
</p>
<p>266. The intensified closure regime on the Gaza crossings which began in November continued 
in December, with imports restricted to very basic food items and limited amounts of fuel, 
animal feed and medical supplies. According to OCHA, many basic food items were no longer 
available and negligible amounts of fuel were allowed to enter Gaza. This resulted in the health 
sector in Gaza deteriorating further into a critical condition, with hospitals continuing to face 
problems as a result of power cuts, low stocks of fuel to operate back-up generators, lack of 
spare parts for medical equipment and shortages of consumables and medical supplies.<b>151</b> On 
18 December 2008, UNRWA once again suspended its food distribution programme for the rest 
of the month, owing to shortages.<b>152</b>  
</p>
<p>267. On 27 December 2008, Israel started its military operations in Gaza.<b>153</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. APPLICABLE LAW 
</b></p>
<p>268. The Mission&#8217;s mandate covers all violations of international human rights law (IHRL) and 
international humanitarian law (IHL) that might have been committed at any time, whether 
before, during or after, in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza 
during the period from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009. The Mission has therefore carried 
out its task within the framework of general international law, in particular IHRL and IHL.  
</p>
<p><b>A. Self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>269. A fundamental element in the legal framework is the principle of self-determination of 
peoples, derived from the Charter of the United Nations, Article 1, accepted as constituting

 <p> 
customary international law, and set out as a right of peoples in the two International Covenants 
on Human Rights (common article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)). 
The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination has been affirmed by the General 
Assembly and the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal 
Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>.<b>154</b> Self-
determination has special prominence in the context of the recent events and military hostilities 
in the region, because they are but one episode in the long occupation of the Palestinian territory. 
The right to self-determination has an <i>erga omnes</i> character whereby all States have the duty to 
promote its realization. This is also recognized by the United Nations General Assembly, which 
has declared that peoples who resist forcible action depriving them of their right to self-
determination have the right to seek and receive support from third parties.<b>155</b> Those who take 
action amounting to military force must comply with IHL.   
</p>
<p><b>B. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>270. All parties to the armed conflict are bound by relevant rules of IHL, whether of 
conventional or customary character. International humanitarian law comprises principles and 
rules applicable to the conduct of military hostilities and provides for restraints upon the conduct 
of military action so as to protect civilians and those that are <i>hors de combat.</i> It also applies to 
situations of belligerent occupation.  
</p>
<p>271. Israel is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, but has not ratified 
their Additional Protocols I or II on the protection of victims of armed conflict. In addition, 
Israel is a party to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain 
Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have 
Indiscriminate Effects, as well as its Protocol I on Non-Detectable Fragments, both of 
10 October 1980. 
</p>
<p>272. Many of the rules contained in the Fourth Hague Convention respecting the Laws and 
Customs of War on Land and the Regulations annexed to it, and the four Geneva Conventions 
and their Additional Protocols are now part of customary international law. Israel&#8217;s High Court 
of Justice has confirmed that Israel must adhere to those rules and principles reflected in the 
Fourth Geneva Convention, the Regulations annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention and the 
customary international law principles reflected in certain provisions of Additional Protocol I to 
the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The Government of Israel accepts that, although it is not a 
party to the Additional Protocol I, some of its provisions accurately reflect customary 
international law.<b>156</b> Under the rules of State responsibility, Israel is responsible for any 
violations of international law attributable to it. Specifically, under the Fourth Geneva 
</p>

<b>154</b> Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion of 9 
July 2004, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 135, paras. 149, 155 and 159.  
<b>155</b> Ibid., para. 156; Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation 
among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 
24 October 1970).

 <p> 
Convention, article 29, &#8220;the Party to a conflict in whose hands protected persons may be, is 
responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents, irrespective of any individual 
responsibility which may be incurred.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>273. The legal framework applicable to situations of occupation includes provisions contained 
in the Hague Regulations (especially articles 42&#8211;56), the Fourth Geneva Convention (especially 
articles 47&#8211;78) and Additional Protocol I, and customary international law. The successive steps 
in the development of that legal framework represent attempts by the international community to 
protect human beings better from the effects of war while giving due account to military 
necessity.  
</p>
<p>274. Article 42 of the Hague Regulations, regarded as customary international law,<b>157</b> 
prescribes that &#8220;territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of 
the hostile army&#8221;. The occupying authority so established shall take all measures in its power 
&#8220;to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety&#8221; in the occupied area (art. 43). 
These provisions call for an examination of whether there was exercise of authority by Israel in 
the Gaza Strip during the period under investigation.  
</p>
<p>275. While the drafters of the Hague Regulations were as much concerned with protecting the 
rights of the State whose territory is occupied as with protecting the inhabitants of that territory, 
the drafters of the Fourth Geneva Convention sought to guarantee the protection of civilians 
(&#8220;protected persons&#8221;<b>158</b>) in times of war regardless of the status of the occupied territories.<b>159</b> 
That the Fourth Geneva Convention contains requirements in many respects more flexible than 
the Hague Regulations and thus offering greater protections was recognized by the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Naletelic case, where the Trial Chamber 
applied the test contained in article 6 of the Fourth Geneva Convention: the protections provided 
for in the Fourth Geneva Convention become operative as soon as the protected persons fall &#8220;in 
the hands&#8221; of a hostile army or an occupying Power, this being understood not in its physical 
sense but in the broader sense of being &#8220;in the power&#8221; of a hostile army. The Trial Chamber 
concluded that: &#8220;the application of the law of occupation as it effects &#8216;individuals&#8217; as civilians 
protected under Geneva Convention IV does not require that the occupying Power have actual 
authority&#8221;.<b>160</b>  
</p>
<p>276. Israel has without doubt at all times relevant to the mandate of the Mission exercised 
effective control over the Gaza Strip. The Mission is of the view that the circumstances of this 
control establish that the Gaza Strip remains occupied by Israel. The provisions of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention therefore apply at all relevant times with regard to the obligations of Israel 
towards the population of the Gaza Strip.  
</p>

<b>158</b> Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, protected persons are those who, at a given moment and in any manner 
whatsoever, find themselves in the hands of a party to the conflict or occupying Power of which they are not 
nationals.

 <p> 
277. Despite Israel&#8217;s declared intention to relinquish its position as an occupying Power by 
evacuating troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip during its 2005 &#8220;disengagement&#8221;,<b>161</b> the 
international community continues to regard it as the occupying Power.<b>162</b>  
</p>
<p>278. Given the specific geopolitical configuration of the Gaza Strip, the powers that Israel 
exercises from the borders enable it to determine the conditions of life within the Gaza Strip. 
Israel controls the border crossings (including to a significant degree the Rafah crossing to 
Egypt, under the terms of the Agreement on Movement and Access<b>163</b>) and decides what and 
who gets in or out of the Gaza Strip. It also controls the territorial sea adjacent to the Gaza Strip 
and has declared a virtual blockade and limits to the fishing zone, thereby regulating economic 
activity in that zone. It also keeps complete control of the airspace of the Gaza Strip, inter alia, 
through continuous surveillance by aircraft and unmanned aviation vehicles (UAVs) or drones. It 
makes military incursions and from time to time hit targets within the Gaza Strip. No-go areas 
are declared within the Gaza Strip near the border where Israeli settlements used to be and 
enforced by the Israeli armed forces. Furthermore, Israel regulates the local monetary market 
based on the Israeli currency (the new sheqel) and controls taxes and custom duties. 
</p>
<p>279. The ultimate authority over the Occupied Palestinian Territory still lies with Israel. Under 
the law and practice of occupation, the establishment by the occupying Power of a temporary 
administration over an occupied territory is not an essential requirement for occupation, although 
it could be one element among others that indicates the existence of such occupation.<b>164</b> In fact, 
as shown in the case of Denmark during the Second World War, the occupier can leave in place 
an existing local administration or allow a new one to be installed for as long as it preserves for 
itself the ultimate authority. Although Israel has transferred to the Palestinian Authority a series 
of functions within designated zones, it has done so by agreement, through the Oslo Accords and 
related understandings, keeping for itself &#8220;powers and responsibilities not so transferred&#8221;.<b>165</b> 
When Israel unilaterally evacuated troops and settlements from the Gaza Strip, it left in place a 
Palestinian local administration. There is no local governing body to which full authority has 
been transferred. In this regard, the Mission recalls that the International Court of Justice, in its 
Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i>, regards the transfer of powers and responsibilities by Israel under various 
agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as having &#8220;done nothing&#8221; to alter 
the character of Israel as an occupying Power.<b>166</b>

 <p> 
</p><p>280. Although the essential elements of occupation are present in the Gaza Strip, account must 
be taken of the fact that inside Gaza there is a de facto local administration, which carries out the 
functions and responsibilities in various areas transferred to the Palestine Authority under the 
Oslo Accords, to the extent that it is able to do so in the light of the closures and blockade 
imposed by Israel. 
</p>
<p>281. The developments that have taken place in the past two decades, in particular through the 
jurisprudence of international tribunals, have led to the conclusion that the substantive rules 
applicable to either international or non-international armed conflicts are converging. The 
Mission nonetheless recognizes that certain differences exist in relation to the regime of 
enforcement established by treaty law, in particular the regime of &#8220;grave breaches&#8221; contained in 
the Geneva Conventions. 
</p>
<p>282. Military hostilities took place between the Israeli armed forces  and the military wing of 
Hamas (al-Qassam Brigades) and of other Palestinian factions, including the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; 
Brigades, loosely affiliated with the Fatah movement in control of the Palestine Authority. The 
Israeli Supreme Court has seen the confrontation between Israeli armed forces and what it calls 
&#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221; active in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as an international armed 
conflict on two grounds: the existing context of the occupation and the cross-border nature of the 
confrontation.<b>167</b> Nonetheless, as the Government of Israel suggests, the classification of the 
armed conflict in question as international or non-international, may not be too important as 
&#8220;many similar norms and principles govern both types of conflicts&#8221;.<b>168</b>  
</p>
<p>283. It is common for armed conflicts to present elements of an international as well as of a 
non-international character. The rules contained in article 3 common to the four Geneva 
Conventions, regarded as customary international law, are the baseline rules applicable to all 
conflicts.<b>169</b> The concern for the protection of civilians and those <i>hors de combat</i> in all kinds of 
conflicts has led to an increasing convergence in the principles and rules applicable to 
international and non-international armed conflicts, as was authoritatively held by the Appeals 
Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the <i>Tadi</i>&#263; case. 
Indeed, &#8220;what is inhumane, and consequently proscribed, in international wars, cannot but be 
inhumane and inadmissible in civil strife.&#8221;<b>170</b> This relates not only to the protection of civilians 
but also to both methods and means of warfare.  
</p>
<p>284. A convergence between human rights protections and humanitarian law protections is also 
in operation. The rules contained in article 75 of Additional Protocol I, which reflect customary 
law, define a series of fundamental guarantees and protections, such as the prohibitions against 
torture, murder and inhuman conditions of detention, recognized also under human rights law. 
</p>

jurisdiction of 2 October 1995, para. 119. See also para. 96 ff. </p>

 <p> 
These protections apply to all persons in the power of a party to the conflict &#8220;who do not benefit 
from more favourable treatment&#8221; under the Geneva Conventions and its Protocols.  
</p>
<p>285. The foregoing customary and conventional humanitarian rules are relevant to the 
investigation of the events that occurred in connection with the military operations of December 
2008 and January 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>C. International criminal law 
</b></p>
<p>286. International criminal law has become a necessary instrument for the enforcement of IHL 
and IHRL. Criminal proceedings and sanctions have a deterrent function and offer a measure of 
justice for the victims of violations. The international community increasingly looks to criminal 
justice as an effective mechanism of accountability and justice in the face of abuse and impunity. 
The Mission regards the rules and definitions of international criminal law as crucial to the 
fulfilment of its mandate to look at all violations of IHL and IHRL by all parties to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>287. Crimes under international law are defined in treaties and also in customary international 
law. Violations of fundamental humanitarian rules applicable in all types of conflict entail 
individual criminal responsibility under customary law.<b>171</b> They encompass crimes against 
humanity, war crimes and genocide. Other crimes not necessarily committed as a war crime or 
crime against humanity are torture and enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>288. The four Geneva Conventions of 1949 establish a regime of enforcement through the 
definition of grave breaches of some of their provisions relating to protected persons. Grave 
breaches are premised on the importance of the value under attack and the seriousness of the act 
or omission that constitutes the breach. Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention defines 
grave breaches as:  
</p>
<p>&#8230; those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property 
protected by the present Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, 
including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to 
body or health, unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected 
person, compelling a protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power, or wilfully 
depriving a protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the present 
Convention, taking of hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, 
not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. 
</p>
<p>289. Article 146 requires States parties to enact any legislation necessary to provide effective 
penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed, any of the listed grave 
breaches. They are under the obligation &#8220;to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to 
have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of 
their nationality, before its own courts.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>171</b> Ibid., paras. 128 ff. In paragraph 134, the Appeals Chamber stated: &#8220;All of these factors confirm that customary 
international law imposes criminal liability for serious violations of common article 3, as supplemented by other 
general principles and rules on the protection of victims of internal armed conflict, and for breaching certain 
fundamental principles and rules regarding means and methods of combat in civil strife.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
290. These and other crimes are also listed in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court, article 8 (2) (a) (&#8220;grave breaches&#8221;) and 8 (2) (b) (&#8220;other serious violations of the laws and 
customs applicable in international armed conflict&#8221;).<b>172</b> 
</p>
<p>291. War crimes are serious breaches of international humanitarian law that apply to armed 
conflicts and entail individual criminal responsibility under treaty or customary law. War crimes 
can be committed in the context of armed conflicts of an international character as well as those 
of a non-international character. This category of crimes includes and/or overlaps with the grave 
breaches as defined in the four Geneva Conventions.  
</p>
<p>292. War crimes comprise crimes against protected persons (including wilful killing, torture or 
other inhuman acts, taking hostages, and collective punishments); crimes against property 
(including extensive destruction of property not justified by military necessity and carried out 
unlawfully and wantonly, destroying or seizing property of the enemy, pillaging, and declaring 
abolished, suspended or inadmissible in a court of law the rights and actions of the nationals of 
the hostile party); crimes relating to the use of prohibited methods and means of warfare 
(including directing an attack against civilians or civilian objects, launching an attack directed 
against legitimate targets if such attack causes excessive incidental civilian casualties or damage 
to the environment, improper use of the protective emblems, the use of starvation of civilians as 
a method of warfare, use of human shields and acts of terror). In addition, article 8 (2) (b) (iii) of 
the Rome Statute defines as a war crime the direct attack against protected personnel, 
installations, material, units or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping 
mission. 
</p>
<p>293. Crimes against humanity are crimes that shock the conscience of humanity. The Statutes 
of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda provided for the prosecution of crimes against humanity. These 
crimes comprise murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape, 
persecutions and other inhuman acts when they are part of a widespread or systematic attack 
against any civilian population.<b>173</b> Although under the Statute of the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia crimes against humanity must be committed in armed 
conflict, such a requirement is not part of the customary law definition of the crime. 
</p>
<p><b>D. International human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>294. Israel has ratified several of the most important international human rights treaties, 
including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, ICCPR, ICESCR, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>172</b> The possible application of the Rome Statute to the conflict in Gaza is still being discussed. The validity under its 
article 12 (3) of the Palestinian declaration accepting the International Criminal Court&#8217;s jurisdiction is being 
evaluated by the Office of the Tribunal&#8217;s Prosecutor. 
<b>173</b> See International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, <i>Prosecutor</i> v. <i>Kunarac</i>, case No. IT-96-23, 
Judgement of 12 June 2002, para. 85. </p>

 <p> 
295. It is now widely accepted that human rights treaties continue to apply in situations of 
armed conflict. In its Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>, the International Court of Justice considered that &#8220;the 
protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save 
through the effect of provisions for derogation&#8230;.&#8221;<b>174</b>  
</p>
<p>296. In its Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i>, the 
International Court of Justice held that, in the context of armed conflict, IHL is <i>lex specialis</i> in 
relation to human rights. It is today commonly understood that human rights law would continue 
to apply as long as it is not modified or set aside by IHL. In any case, the general rule of human 
rights law does not lose its effectiveness and will remain in the background to inform the 
application and interpretation of the relevant humanitarian law rule. For instance, the preamble to 
Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions recalls the protection of international human 
rights for the human person, supporting the view that IHL and IHRL are operative in situations 
of conflict.   
</p>
<p>297. The human rights treaties ratified by Israel are also binding in relation to Israeli conduct in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Article 2 of ICCPR obliges each State party to respect and to 
ensure to all individuals &#8220;within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction&#8221; the rights recognized 
within it. In the words of the Human Rights Committee, &#8220;a State party must respect and ensure 
the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the power or effective control of that State 
party, even if not situated within the territory of the State party&#8221;.<b>175</b> 
</p>
<p>298. The International Court of Justice has also held that ICCPR applies &#8220;in respect of acts 
done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory&#8221;.<b>176</b> Accordingly, the 
Human Rights Committee has considered that ICCPR also applies to the benefit of people within 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory.<b>177</b> The Committees established to monitor compliance with 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women by their States parties have equally determined that Israel&#8217;s human rights 
obligations extend to the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.<b>178</b>  
</p>
<p>299. The Mission also notes that Israel has not derogated from its obligations under article 4 of 
ICCPR. Israel&#8217;s declaration made upon ratification of the Covenant only concerns derogations to 
article 9 of ICCPR, regarding deprivation of liberty. The state of emergency in Israel has been in 
force ever since it was proclaimed in 1948. ICESCR does not explicitly allow for derogations in 
time of public emergency or war.

300. Contemporary interpretation of the Hague Regulations has taken a progressive view on 
the scope of their application. The International Court of Justice, when concluding that Uganda 
was the occupying Power in the Ituri region in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, also held 
that Uganda&#8217;s obligation to &#8220;restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety&#8221; 
included &#8220;the duty to secure respect for the applicable rules of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law&#8221;.<b>179</b> 
</p>
<p>301. In relation to the application of human rights law during the military operations and to the 
connected events, the Mission wishes to briefly address four issues of legal significance.  
</p>
<p>302. The first is the impact of the inauguration in 1995 of limited Palestinian self-government 
and the evacuation of the Gaza Strip by Israel in 2005 on Israel&#8217;s international obligations. 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies have continued to hold Israel responsible for 
implementing its human rights treaty obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory after the 
establishment of Palestinian self-government bodies.<b>180</b> Those bodies have not drawn any 
distinction between Gaza and the West Bank in this regard, the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
being regarded as a single unit. In its Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the 
Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>, the International Court of Justice 
succinctly addressed the question by noting that, under the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, Israel is &#8220;under an obligation not to raise any obstacle to the exercise of 
such rights in those fields where competence has been transferred to Palestinian authorities&#8221;.<b>181</b> 
In a recent report about Gaza, nine special procedures of the Human Rights Council considered 
that the unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip does not relieve Israel &#8220;from complying 
with its human rights obligations towards the population of that territory; Israel remains bound to 
the extent that the measures it adopts affect the enjoyment of human rights of the residents of the 
Gaza Strip.&#8221;<b>182</b>  
</p>
<p>303. Israel most recently argued before the Committee against Torture that it no longer had 
human rights obligations under the Convention with regard to Gaza due to the effect of the 2005 
&#8220;disengagement&#8221;. In rejecting the argument, the Committee stated &#8220;the State party maintains 
control and jurisdiction in many aspects on the occupied Palestinian territories.&#8221;<b>183</b> The Mission 
agrees that transferring powers and functions to self-governing bodies does not exempt Israel 
from its obligations to guarantee human rights to people within its jurisdiction or under its 
effective control. Israel would also have a duty to refrain from actions that obstruct efforts by 
Palestinian self-governing bodies to guarantee the enjoyment of human rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and should facilitate that action. 
</p>
<p>304. A second issue relates to the human rights obligations of the Palestinian Authority, the de 
facto authority in the Gaza Strip and other political and military actors. As non-State actors, the 
                                                 
<b>179</b> Case concerning Armed Activities&#8230;, para. 178. 
<b>180</b> For instance, in its 2003 concluding observations, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
reiterated &#8220;its regret at the State party's refusal to report on the occupied territories&#8221; (E/C.12/1/Add.90, para. 15). 
<b>181</b> Legal Consequences&#8230;, para. 112. 
<b>182</b> A/HRC/10/22, para. 20. 
<b>183</b> &#8220;Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture&#8221; (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 11). </p>

 <p> 
question of their human rights obligations must be addressed. It should be noted that the same 
issue does not arise with regard to IHL obligations, the question being settled some time ago. As 
the Special Court for Sierra Leone held, &#8220;it is well settled that <i>all</i> parties to an armed conflict, 
whether States or non-State actors, are bound by international humanitarian law, even though 
only States may become parties to international treaties.&#8221;<b> 184</b>  
</p>
<p>305. The relationship between IHL and IHRL is rapidly evolving, in particular in relation to 
non-State actors&#8217; obligations, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the protection of people and to 
enable them to enjoy their human rights in all circumstances. In the context of the matter within 
the Mission&#8217;s mandate, it is clear that non-State actors that exercise government-like functions 
over a territory have a duty to respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>306. The Mission notes that the Palestinian Authority, through its public undertakings as well 
as those of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Legislative Council, 
has declared its commitment to respect international human rights law in several instances, 
including in the context of international agreements. This commitment is also contained in the 
Palestinian Basic Law.<b>185</b>  
</p>
<p>307. The obligations of the Gaza authorities may be viewed through a different lens but leading 
to the same result. The Gaza authorities also reiterated to the Mission their commitments to 
respect human rights. Hamas has also made a series of unilateral declarations of respect for 
human rights. Furthermore, the Palestinian Basic Law with its many human rights provisions 
also applies in the Gaza Strip.<b>186</b>  
</p>
<p>308. A third issue to be addressed here relates to the right to self-determination and its 
application to the definition of combatant status and its impact on the principle of distinction. 
Armed conflicts opposing national liberation movements and/or resistance movements against 
colonialism and occupation are regarded as international armed conflicts by Additional Protocol 
I, article 1 (4). Under international law, notably Additional Protocol I to the Geneva 
Conventions, any action of resistance pursuant to the right to self-determination should be 
exercised with full respect of other human rights and IHL. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>184</b> See for instance, Prosecutor v. Sam Hinga Norman, case SCSL-2004-14-AR72(E), Decision on preliminary 
motion based on lack of jurisdiction (child recruitment) (31 May 2004), para. 22.

http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/2002-basic-law. See also &#8220;Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the implementation on Human Rights Council resolution 7/1&#8221; (A/HRC/8/17, para. 8). 
<b>186</b> Meeting and correspondence with the Mission. In this respect nine special procedures mandate holders have 
stated: &#8220;non-State actors that exercise government-like functions and control over a territory are obliged to respect 
human rights norms when their conduct affects the human rights of the individuals under their control&#8221; (A/HRC/10/22, 
para. 21). This view follows the statement in the same line by four other special procedures mandate holders who 
visited Lebanon in the aftermath of the 2006 war: &#8220;Although Hezbollah, a non-State actor, cannot become a party to 
these human rights treaties, it remains subject to the demand of the international community, first expressed in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that every organ of society respect and promote human rights &#8230; It is 
especially appropriate and feasible to call for an armed group to respect human rights norms when it exercises 
significant control over territory and population and has an identifiable political structure.&#8221; (A/HRC/2/7, para. 19). 
See also A/HRC/10/22, para. 9.  </p>

 <p> 
309. Finally, it is also useful to briefly recall that States not party to an armed conflict have 
responsibilities and a crucial role to play for the protection of civilians and those <i>hors de combat</i> 
and for the protection of their rights. Under article 1 common to the Geneva Conventions 1949, the 
&#8220;High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention 
in all circumstances.&#8221; This provision entails obligations not only in relation to actors and conduct 
within the jurisdiction of each State but also in relation to the international enforcement of the 
Conventions. States parties to the Geneva Conventions also have the obligation to facilitate the 
passage of humanitarian relief and a role to play in the provision of such assistance for the 
protected population in case of need (articles 23 and 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention). 
</p>
<p>310. To conclude, the Mission wishes to emphasize that all parties to an armed conflict have 
the obligation to respect the enjoyment of human rights by all. </p>

</p>
<p><b>PART TWO: OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORY  
</b></p>
<p><b>THE GAZA STRIP 
</b></p>
<p><b>SECTION A: MILITARY OPERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>V. THE BLOCKADE: INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW 
</b></p>
<p>311. The military operations of 28 December to 19 January 2009 and their impact cannot be 
fully evaluated without taking account of the context and the prevailing living conditions at the 
time they began. In material respects, the military hostilities were a culmination of the long 
process of economic and political isolation imposed on the Gaza Strip by Israel, which is 
generally described as a blockade. This chapter provides an overview of the blockade, while 
chapter XVII provides a detailed analysis of the cumulative impact of the blockade and the 
military operations on the people in Gaza and their human rights. 
</p>
<p>312. The series of economic and political measures imposed against the Gaza Strip began 
around February 2006 with the Hamas electoral victory in the legislative elections. This was also 
accompanied by the withholding of financial support for the Gaza Strip by some donor countries 
and actions of other countries that amounted to open or tacit support of the Israeli blockade. 
Hamas took over effective power in the Gaza Strip on 15 June 2007. Shortly thereafter Israel 
declared the Gaza Strip a &#8220;hostile territory,&#8221;<b>187</b> enacting a series of economic, social and military 
measures purportedly designed to isolate and strangle Hamas. These have made a deep impact on 
the population&#8217;s living standards. 
</p>
<p>313. The blockade comprises measures such as the closure of border crossings, sometimes 
completely for a number of days, for people, goods and services, and for the provision of fuel 
and electricity. The closure has had severe effects on trade and general business activity, 
agriculture and industry in the Gaza Strip. Electricity and fuel that are provided from Israel are 
essential for a broad range of activities from business to education, health services, industry and 
agriculture. Further limits to the fishing area in the sea adjacent to the Gaza Strip were fixed and 
enforced by Israel, negatively impacting on fishing activities and the livelihood of the fishing 
community. Israel also established a buffer zone of variable and uncertain width along the 
border, together with a sizeable no-go area in the northern part of the Gaza Strip where some 
Israeli settlements used to be situated. This no-go area is in practice an enlarged buffer zone in 
the northern part of the Gaza Strip where people cannot go. The creation of the buffer zone has 
forced the relocation of a number of factories from this area closer to Gaza City, causing serious 
environmental concerns and potential health hazards for the population. People&#8217;s movements 
have also been drastically restricted, with only a few businesspeople allowed to cross on a very 
irregular and unpredictable basis. 
</p>
<p>314. Because of the occupation, which created so many ties of dependence, and for other 
geographic, political and historical reasons, the availability of goods and services as well as the 
carrying-on of daily life in the Gaza Strip are highly dependent on Israel and its policies 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>187</b> http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2007/Security+Cabinet+declares+Gaza+hostile 
+territory+19-Sep-2007.htm.  </p>

 <p> 
regarding the area. Food and other consumable items as well as fuel, electricity, construction 
materials and other items are traded from or through Israel. Israel also serves as the 
communication channel for the population of Gaza with the rest of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory and the world, including for purposes of education and exchange programmes. There 
are five crossing points between Israel and the Gaza Strip: Erez (basically dedicated to the transit 
of people), Nahal Oz (for fuel), Karni (for grains), Kerem Shalom (for goods) and Sufa (for 
goods). Israeli control of these crossings has always been restrictive for the Gaza population. 
Since the beginning of the blockade, and particularly during and after the military operation, not 
only has the measure of restriction increased, but control has been exercised arbitrarily, resulting 
in uncertainty of access even for those items purportedly allowed entry by Israel.   
</p>
<p>315. Movement of people through the Erez crossing to Israel and the Rafah crossing to Egypt 
has been almost completely blocked. Exceptions include unpredictable and irregular permission 
for emergency medical evacuations, access to diplomats and international humanitarian staff and 
only limited access to some businesspeople.  
</p>
<p>316. The movement of goods has been restricted to imports of basic humanitarian supplies 
through the Kerem Shalom crossing point as well as to a limited quantity of fuel. The quantities 
of goods allowed into the Gaza Strip have not only been insufficient to meet local demands, they 
also exclude several items essential for the manufacturing of goods and the processing of food 
products, as well as many other goods that are needed. This is compounded by the unpredictable 
way in which crossings are managed. Neither the list of items allowed into the Gaza Strip nor the 
criteria for their selection are made known to the public.  
</p>
<p>317. Before the military operation, the blockade had resulted in a significant reduction in the 
number of trucks allowed through the crossings. The number of trucks is considered a fair 
measure of the amount of imports into or exports from the Gaza Strip. This number increased 
slightly during the period of calm between June and November 2008, but declined sharply again 
in November, due to the resumption of hostilities following the Israeli military incursion. The 
daily average of truckloads crossing the border in November&#8211;December 2008 was between 
23 and 30, but it increased after the start of military hostilities to up to five times that number 
during January 2009.<b>188</b> However, at no time was it close to what it had been prior to June 2007 
or to the amount actually necessary to meet the needs of the population.  
</p>
<p>318. The 2005 Agreement of Movement and Access called for a daily flow of some 400 trucks 
in and out of Gaza by the end of 2006, which was already lower than before the second intifada, 
but not even that level was ever reached.<b>189</b> Information supplied to the Mission reveals that 
imports into and exports from the Gaza Strip before the closure in 2007 reached a monthly 
average of 10,400 and 1,380 truckloads, respectively. This declined to about 2,834 truckloads of 
imports and no exports after the recent military operations. Immediately after the operations, 
there was only one isolated instance in which exports of flowers were allowed from the Gaza

Strip in March 2009. Some 134 truckloads of cash crops were exported in total between June 
2007 and May 2009.<b>190</b>  
</p>
<p>319. In effect, economic activity in the Gaza Strip was severely affected because of the 
blockade. Since the military operation, the economy has almost come to a standstill. The private 
sector, particularly the manufacturing industry, has suffered irreparable damage. 
</p>
<p>320. The blockade and freeze on the movement of goods imposed by Israel have spurred a 
black market economy in the Gaza Strip that provides basic consumables but is unreliable and 
unaffordable for the majority of the people. The tunnels built under the Gaza-Egypt border have 
become a lifeline for the Gaza economy and the people. Increasing amounts of fuel (benzine and 
diesel) come through those tunnels as well as consumables. While for the Gaza population this is 
a necessary means of survival in the circumstances, the black market is likely to hold back 
economic recovery and sustainability, even when the blockade is lifted.  
</p>
<p>321. The blockade has also included measures relating to access to the sea and airspace. Under 
the Oslo Accords, the fishing zone limit was set at 20 nautical miles. However, Israel set the 
limit unilaterally at 6 nautical miles and maintained this limit from October 2006 to January 
2009, when it further restricted it to 3 nautical miles. The only airfield in Gaza has been closed 
and a project to rebuild the small airport was suspended after the seizure of power by Hamas. 
Israel keeps total control over Gaza&#8217;s airspace. 
</p>
<p>322. In mid-December 2008, following an Israeli military incursion into the Gaza Strip and 
rockets fired into Israel by Hamas, all the crossings were totally closed for eight days.<b>191</b> Other 
military or militant activities in areas near the crossings have also led to total closures over 
certain periods of time. Total and partial closures have significantly contributed to an emergency 
situation that became a full-fledged humanitarian crisis after the military operations of December 
2008&#8211;January 2009. During December 2008, UNRWA had to suspend its delivery of food 
assistance due to the total depletion of its food stocks. Other humanitarian agencies had to reduce 
or postpone delivery of food and other forms of assistance. The unavailability of banknotes as a 
result of an Israeli prohibition also prevented humanitarian agencies from implementing &#8220;cash 
for work&#8221; or similar programmes over lengthy periods of time.<b>192</b>  
</p>
<p>323. The implementation of the restrictive measures as part of the blockade of the Gaza Strip 
created not only an emergency situation but also significantly weakened the capacities of the 
health, water and emergency sectors in Gaza to adequately respond to a worsening situation.<b>193</b> 
The impact on the local economy further reduced the resilience and coping capacities of the local 
population and has aggravated the effects of the war on livelihoods and living standards 
(see below, chap. XVII). 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>190</b> Information submitted by PalTrade, &#8220;Gaza private sector status&#8221;, 18 June 2009. The Mission also acknowledges 
the information provided by the Palestinian Authority in its reply to questions from the Mission, 5 august 2009. 
<b>191</b> The Humanitarian Monitor, No. 32. 
<b>192</b> The Humanitarian Monitor, No. 32, p. 5. 
<b>193</b> This impact was noted and analysed in &#8220;Report of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun established 
under Council resolution S-3/1&#8221; (A/HRC/9/26, paras. 55 ff). </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>324. The Mission asked the Government of Israel to provide information in relation to the 
blockade on the Gaza Strip.  It requested information on the criteria applied to determine which 
good are or are not allowed to enter the Gaza Strip, the reasons for restricting or preventing cash 
and bank transfers, the reasons for imposing restrictions on the ability of Gazans to leave the 
Gaza Strip, including for urgent medical reasons, the reasons for the highly restrictive policy 
permit applied to international donors, humanitarian and human rights organizations wishing to 
enter the Gaza Strip, and the reasons and legal basis for establishing a limited fishing zone. 
No reply was received on any of these questions.   
</p>
<p>325. The legality of some of the measures imposed by the Government of Israel (the reduction 
in the supply of electricity and fuel) was the subject of a petition to the Supreme Court of 
Israel.<b>194</b> The petitioners comprised a group of NGOs operating within Israel together with 
Palestinian citizens and groups who argued that the planned cuts in the supply of fuel and 
electricity were inconsistent with the obligations of Israel under the Fourth Geneva Convention 
relating to the protection of civilians.<b>195</b> The Court&#8217;s ruling recognizes that Israel has obligations 
under humanitarian law vis-&#224;-vis the Gaza Strip under which the intended supply of fuel and 
electricity was considered &#8220;capable of satisfying the essential humanitarian needs of the Gaza 
Strip at the present&#8221;. The Court, however, did not indicate what would constitute &#8220;essential 
humanitarian needs&#8221; and appears to have left those details for the authorities to determine.  
</p>
<p>326. The Mission holds the view that Israel continues to be duty-bound under the Fourth 
Geneva Convention and to the full extent of the means available to it to ensure the supply of 
foodstuff, medical and hospital items and others to meet the humanitarian needs of the 
population of the Gaza Strip without qualification. Furthermore, the Mission notes the 
information it received regarding the lack of compliance by the Government of Israel even with 
the minimum levels set by the Israeli Court, and in this regard observes that the Government 
retains wide discretion about the timing and manner of delivering fuel and electricity supplies to 
the Gaza Strip, and that this discretion appears to have been exercised capriciously and 
arbitrarily.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. The parties relevant to the conduct of military activities in Gaza  
between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>328. The information available shows that Israel deployed its navy, air force and army in the 
operation it codenamed &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>329. The navy was used in part to shell the Gaza coast during the military operations. 
</p>
<p>330. The air force was also used throughout the military operations in a way that appears in its 
own view to have been innovative. Having been responsible for the vast majority of operational 
activities in the first week, it continued to play an important role in assisting and covering the 
ground forces from 3 January to 18 January 2009.<b>196</b> 
</p>
<p>331. The army was responsible for the ground invasion, which began on 3 January 2009. The 
available information indicates that the Golani, Givati and Paratrooper Brigades and five 
Armoured Corps Brigades were involved. Assaults on three fronts with combined armour and 
infantry brigades were also augmented by specialist Arabic-language, intelligence and, in 
particular, combat engineer troops. The engineer troops equipped with armoured D-9 bulldozers 
were also trained in operations to counter improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Forward 
elements of these attack formations could rely on direct support from the air force to call air 
strikes or to direct them, to call in helicopter missile attacks and to direct their own attached 
missile-mounted UAVs.<b>197</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>332. The Palestinian armed factions operating in the Gaza Strip, and claiming responsibility for 
the majority of the rocket and mortar launchings, are the Hamas&#8217; Izz ad-Din al-Qassam 
Brigades,<b>198</b> the al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades, the Islamic Jihad, the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades,199 
which are the military wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and al-
Naser Salah ad-Din Brigades, which are the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees 
(PRC).200 PRC is a coalition of different armed factions that oppose what they perceive as the 
Palestinian Authority&#8217;s and Fatah&#8217;s conciliatory approach towards Israel.

</p>
<p><b>B. The phases of the hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Air phase201 
</b></p>
<p>333. The Israeli armed forces began the military operations with a week-long air attack, from 
27 December until 3 January 2009. One study suggests that they had drawn up a list of 
603 targets to be hit as they belonged to Hamas suspects or were part of what Israel viewed as 
the Hamas infrastructure. The study claims that a senior Israeli officer reported that all 603 
targets had been hit before the end of the fourth day of the aerial operations in the first week. 
Officially, the spokesman of the Israeli forces claimed that 526 targets had been hit by 31 
December 2008.<b>202</b> 
</p>
<p>334. An analysis of the strikes in a report of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights gives the 
following breakdown.  
</p>
<p>335. &#8220;IOF [Israeli occupation forces] have launched at least 300 air and sea strikes against the 
Gaza Strip. These strikes have targeted 37 houses; 67 security and training sites; 20 workshops; 
25 public and private institutions; seven mosques; and three educational institutions. The public 
institutions that have been bombarded are: the compound of ministries, the building of the 
Palestinian Legislative Council, the building of the cabinet in Gaza City; the buildings of the 
agricultural control department and the Municipality of Bani Suhaila in Khan Yunis; the 
buildings of Rafah Municipality and Governorate. The air strikes have targeted also four money 
exchange shops, a clinic, three fishing harbours, the Islamic University and two schools.&#8221;<b>203</b> 
</p>
<p>336. Of the incidents addressed in detail in this report, the following occurred during this 
phase: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The attack on Arafat City Police Station; 
&#8226; Attacks on four other police stations, one in Deir al-Balah and three in Gaza City; 
&#8226; The attack on the Palestinian Legislative Council building and the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice; 
&#8226; The attack on Gaza main prison in the al-Sarayah complex, Gaza City. 
</p>
<p>337. Israeli air force activities continued throughout the military operations. In total, it has been 
suggested that between 2,300 and 3,000 sorties were flown.<b>204</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>201</b> Although principally recognized as an aerial phase, there was a significant contribution from the Israeli navy not 
only in the first week.

http://www.pchrgaza.org/files/W_report/English/2008/pdf/weekly%20report%2051.pdf.  
<b>204</b> Cordesman, op. cit., p. 41. He cites Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi saying that the air force flew 2,300 successful air strikes 
but notes other senior officials told him the real number was closer to 3,000. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. The air-land phase 
</b></p>
<p>338. Around 3 January 2009 Israeli ground troops entered Gaza from the north and east. One 
study suggests that &#8220;the war was fought largely by the southern Command using brigade teams 
that operated with a high degree of independence and freedom to adapt and innovate&#8221;.<b>205</b> 
</p>
<p>339. One of the key initial objectives described by one soldier involved was to divide the Gaza 
Strip into two parts, i.e. to split and fragment it, with Nitzarim constituting the midpoint.<b>206</b> The 
division therefore ran from the Karni crossing point to the coast in a south-westerly direction.<b> 
</b>After creating the split, the Israeli armed forces concentrated all of their ground forces in the 
north. Targets in the south were hit from the air, such as in Rafah. 
</p>
<p>340. At least in the initial phase it appears forces from the Givati Brigade entered from the east 
and approached Gaza City from the south. It is understood that forces from the Armoured  
</p>
<p>341. Corps Brigade also operated in this area but probably at a later stage.<b>207</b> Zeytoun, on the 
southern outskirts of Gaza, took the brunt of these brigade operations, with incidents of attacks 
on the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>342. It appears that those with primary responsibility in the north of Gaza, especially around 
Beit Lahia and al-Atatra, included forces from the Golani Brigade. 
</p>
<p>343. The forces focusing on the area between Gaza City and the northern section, especially in 
Jabaliyah, appear to have been drawn largely from the Paratrooper Brigade. 
</p>
<p>344. The movement into the south of Gaza City reached at least as far as Zeytoun on 3 January 
2009. Some of the troops entering there on that day appear to have been brought in by helicopter 
rather than arriving by land. Israeli armed forces maintained a presence in Zeytoun until the final 
withdrawal.<b>208</b> It is understood that the original forces that entered Zeytoun were at least partially 
replaced by other troops at some point, but it is not known if any of the original forces remained 
in the area throughout the period.<b>209</b> 
</p>
<p>345. In the other brigade areas regular troops were augmented or replaced by reservists who 
were called up after the initial ground attacks. 
</p>

 <p> 
346. Zeytoun<b> </b>was an area of particularly intense action by Israeli forces, yet there are almost no 
indications of armed resistance in the area at the time.<b>210</b> 
</p>
<p>347. Among the issues of particular concern to the Mission in Zeytoun are the killings of the 
Samouni family, the mass destruction in the area, including the systematic demolition of the 
Sawafeary chicken farms, and the air strike that killed 22 members of the al-Daya family. 
</p>
<p>348. The forces in Zeytoun also appear to have been responsible for the push towards the area 
around Tal el-Hawa and Rimal in the south-west of Gaza City, about three kilometres from 
Zeytoun. The Mission has information that indicates that tanks took up positions in and around 
Tal el-Hawa around 4 and 5 January. Sources indicate that there was a presence there throughout 
the hostilities, as also evidenced by the artillery fire from around this area on 14 and 15 January 
on the compound of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the 
Near East (UNRWA) and al-Quds hospital, both of which the Mission addresses in detail. 
</p>
<p>349. The forces responsible for the execution of the Israeli plan in the north-east of the Gaza 
Strip included the Golani Brigade. Among the areas of special concern in this regard are al-
Atatra and Beit Lahia. Various witnesses indicate that in the past there has at times been some 
armed presence in the area. Information taken from websites apparently belonging to Palestinian 
armed groups indicates that these were areas of some resistance. The Mission heard from several 
witnesses about the scale of the destruction that occurred there as a result of artillery fire after the 
ground phase began on 3 January. Information indicates a sustained attack with aerial and 
artillery fire from 3 to 8 January. The Mission addresses a number of particular cases that 
occurred in this context, such as the alleged use of human shields, the alleged widespread 
mistreatment of civilians, including detentions, and transfers of large numbers to Israeli prisons 
in unlawful circumstances.  
</p>
<p>350. In the Jabaliyah area, located between Beit Lahia and Gaza City, the Mission understands 
that at least for part of the time there was a significant presence of the Paratrooper Brigade.<b>211</b> At 
the beginning of the ground phase it is noted that an Israeli projectile struck the al-Maqadmah 
mosque, killing at least 15 civilians. A few days later the al-Fakhura Street incident occurred in 
the same area when a series of mortars fired by the Israeli armed forces killed at least 35 people.  
</p>
<p>351. Around 15 January the Israeli armed forces began withdrawing from their positions in the 
main areas described above. As they did so, there appeared to be a practice of systematically 
demolishing a large number of structures, including houses, water installations, such as tanks on 
the roofs of houses, and of agricultural land. A renewed aerial phase in Rafah was also 
conducted in the last few days of the military operations. Whereas the strikes in the first week 
appear to have been relatively selective, the last few days saw an increase in the number of

strikes with several hundred targets hit, causing not only very substantial damage to buildings 
but also, according to some, underground structural damage.<b>212</b>   
</p>
<p><b>C. Data on casualties during the Israeli military operations in Gaza  
from 28 December 2008 to 17 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Palestinian casualties 
</b></p>
<p>352. The Mission received statistics on the fatalities of the military operations from the Gaza 
authorities, specifically from the Central Commission for Documentation and Pursuit of Israeli 
War Criminals (TAWTHEQ),<b>213</b> as well as from PCHR,<b>214</b> Al Mezan<b>215</b> and B&#8217;Tselem.<b>216</b> The 
first three also provided lists of all the persons killed in the military operations, with their names, 
sex, age, address, occupation, and place and date of the fatal attack. Another NGO, Defence for 
Children International &#8211; Palestine Section,<b>217</b> provided a list of all the children killed. 
</p>
<p>353. The three lists give different numbers. According to TAWTHEQ, 1,444 persons were 
killed. The two Palestinian NGOs provide a lower number, 1,417 victims according to PCHR 
and 1,409 according to Al Mezan, while B&#8217;Tselem mentions 1,387 victims. The Mission has not 
cross-checked the three lists. TAWTHEQ, PCHR, Al Mezan and B&#8217;Tselem also provide 
disaggregated data.  
</p>
<p>354. TAWTHEQ reports that 341 of those killed were children (under 18), 248 members of the 
police, 11 members of the Internal Security Service and 5 members of the National Security 
Service. It provides no figures for the number of combatants killed.   
</p>
<p>355. PCHR divides the overall 1,417 victims into 926 civilians, 255 police<b>218</b> and 
236 combatants.<b>219</b> It reports that 313 of the dead were children and 116 women.  
</p>
<p>356. Al Mezan reports that overall 1,409 persons were killed during the military operations, of 
whom 237 were combatants (including 13 under-age combatants) and 1,172 non-combatants, 
including 342 children, 111 women and 136 members of the police.<b>220</b> Thus, according to PCHR

<b>213</b> These lists were prepared by the Gaza authorities&#8217; Ministry of Justice, TAWTHEQ, The Central Commission for 
Documentation and Pursuit of Israeli War Criminals and submitted to the Mission.

 <p> 
and Al Mezan, fewer than 17 per cent of the Palestinians killed during the military operations 
were combatants.  
</p>
<p>357. B&#8217;Tselem states that, of the 1,387 Palestinians who were killed, 773 did not take part in 
the hostilities, including 320 minors and 109 women over the age of 18. Of those killed, 
330 took part in the hostilities and 248 were Palestinian police officers, most of whom were 
killed in aerial bombings of police stations on the first day of the operations. For 36 people 
B&#8217;Tselem could not determine whether they had participated in the hostilities or not. 
</p>
<p>358. According to Defence for Children International, 348 children were killed during the 
military operations.<b>221</b>   
</p>
<p>359. The Israeli armed forces claim that 1,166 Palestinians were killed during the military 
operations &#8220;according to the data gathered by the Research Department of the Israel Defense 
Intelligence&#8221;. They allege that &#8220;709 of them are identified as Hamas terror operatives&#8221;, 295 are 
&#8220;uninvolved Palestinians&#8221;, while the remaining 162 are &#8220;men that have not yet been attributed to 
any organization&#8221;.<b>222</b> Of the 295 &#8220;uninvolved Palestinians&#8221;, 89 were children under the age of 16 
and 49 women. According to these figures, at least 60 per cent, and possibly as many as three out 
of four, of those killed were combatants. The Mission notes, however, that the Israeli 
Government has not published a list of victims or other data supporting its assertions, nor has it, 
to the Mission&#8217;s knowledge, explained the divergence between its statistics and those published 
by three Palestinian sources, except insofar as the classification of policemen as combatants is 
concerned.<b>223</b> 
</p>
<p>360. The Mission, not having investigated all incidents involving loss of life in the Gaza Strip, 
will not make findings regarding the overall number of persons killed nor regarding the 
percentage of civilians among those killed. The incidents it did investigate, and on which it will 
make findings based on the information it gathered, involve the death of more than 220 persons, 
at least 47 of them children and 19 adult women. 
</p>
<p>361. The Mission notes that the statistics from non-governmental sources are generally 
consistent. Statistics alleging that fewer than one out of five persons killed in an armed conflict 
was a combatant, such as those provided by PCHR and Al Mezan as a result of months of field 
research,<b>224</b> raise very serious concerns about the way Israel conducted the military operations in 
Gaza. The counterclaims published by the Government of Israel fall far short of international law 
standards.  
                                                 
<b>221</b> Defence for Children International confirmed the deaths of another five children caused indirectly by the military 
operations. 
<b>222</b> IDF spokesperson, &#8220;Majority of Palestinians killed in operation cast lead: Terror operatives&#8221;, 26 March 2009, 
available at http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/03/2602.htm; see also <i>The Jerusalem Post</i>, &#8220;IDF releases 
cast lead casualty number&#8221;, 26 March 2009. 
<b>223</b> On the question of whether Gaza policemen were civilians or combatants, see chap. VII. 
<b>224</b> The Mission notes that the figures from B&#8217;Tselem, which distinguish between casualties who took part in the 
hostilities and those who did not, lead to similar results. If the policemen were added to those who did not take part 
in hostilities (as Al Mezan and PCHR do in adding the policemen to the civilians killed), the B&#8217;Tselem statistics 
would indicate that approximately one in four Palestinians killed was taking part in hostilities. </p>

 <p> 
362. The Mission also notes that &#8211; as the Government of Israel argues at length<b>225</b> &#8211; there are 
circumstances under international humanitarian law in which military actions resulting in the 
loss of civilian life would not be unlawful. These include attacks directed against military 
objectives that comply with the principles of discrimination and proportionality, but nonetheless 
kill civilians. They also include the killing of persons who, though not members of an armed 
group, participate directly in the hostilities. The reportedly exceedingly high percentage of 
civilians among those killed raises concerns about the precautions taken by Israel in launching 
attacks as well as the legality of many of the attacks, as elaborated further in this report with 
regard to the specific incidents investigated by the Mission.  
</p>
<p>363. The Mission finally notes that it cannot entirely discount the possibility that Palestinian 
civilians may have been killed as a result of fire by Palestinian armed groups in encounters with 
the Israeli armed forces, as argued in a submission to the Mission,<b>226</b> although it has not 
encountered any information suggesting that this was the case.<b>227</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Israeli casualties 
</b></p>
<p>364. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that, during the military operations from 
27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009, there were four Israeli casualties<b>228</b> in southern Israel 
(all adults), of whom three were civilians and one was a soldier.<b>229</b> In addition, nine Israeli 
soldiers were killed during the fighting inside the Gaza Strip,<b> </b> four of whom by friendly fire.<b>230</b> 
B&#8217;Teslem<b>231</b> confirmed these numbers, stating that during the operations Palestinians killed nine 
Israelis, of whom three civilians, who were reportedly killed by Qassam and Grad rocket fire, 
and six members of the security forces, while another four soldiers were killed by friendly fire.<b>232</b>

<b>232</b> Al-Qassam Brigades&#8217; website reports that, during the conflict, they killed 102 Israeli soldiers (&#8220;The outcome

discrepancy in the data confirms the Mission&#8217;s observations below in the report about the reliability of the 
information about the Gaza military operations posted on websites of al-Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VII. ATTACKS ON GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AND POLICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Deliberate attacks on Gaza government infrastructure</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Overview of damage to Gaza government buildings 
</b></p>
<p>365. In its early recovery and reconstruction plan for Gaza, the Palestinian Authority states that 
&#8220;seven government institutions were either completely or partially levelled (including the 
Government Palace, the Archives building, the General Personnel Council, and the Presidential 
Compound), and the Ministries of Interior, Justice and Culture were either partially or entirely 
destroyed, along with their associated compounds. In addition, 19 municipal facilities were 
damaged and 11 were totally destroyed, including commercial centres such as markets, 
slaughterhouses and stores.&#8221;<b>233</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2. The Israeli air strikes on the Gaza main prison and on  
the Palestinian Legislative Council building 
</b></p>
<p>366. The Mission visited two locations where government buildings were destroyed by Israeli 
air strikes: the Palestinian Legislative Council building and the main prison in the al-Saraya 
complex in Gaza City. In addition, the Mission visited six police stations, which will be 
discussed separately below.  
</p>
<p>367. The Mission visited the remains of the Gaza City main prison and interviewed two senior 
police officers who were, according to their testimony, eyewitnesses to the attack. The Mission 
also reviewed reports on the attack from other sources based on the testimony of prisoners. It 
furthermore addressed questions to the Government of Israel regarding the military advantage 
pursued in attacking the Palestinian Legislative Council building and the main prison in Gaza 
City, but received no reply. 
</p>
<p>368. The main prison was located in a densely built-up area of Gaza City in the al-Saraya 
complex of buildings occupied by government departments, including the Ministries of 
Education, Transport and the Interior. The prison itself was an old building, several stories high, 
reportedly used as a prison by successive authorities in charge of Gaza during the previous and 
present centuries. It held both common offenders and political detainees.  
</p>
<p>369. While there were some discrepancies in the different accounts of this incident, the Mission 
was able to ascertain that the complex was attacked at 11 a.m. on 28 December 2008, on the 
second day of the air strikes by Israel. At the time of the attack between 200 and 300 prisoners 
were held in the facility, most of the almost 700 prisoners having been released in the days 
before the strike.<b>234</b> The accounts given by officials regarding the number of fatalities and injured

<b>233</b> Palestinian National Authority, Palestinian National Early Recovery and Reconstruction Plan for Gaza 
2009-2010, March 2009, p. 41. 
<b>234</b> According to statements by the police to the Mission, around 400 minor offenders had been released by the 
authorities to reduce overcrowding, so that when the hostilities started about 300 prisoners remained there. 
According to a NGO report based on the testimony of prisoners, &#8220;authorities released about 580 of the prisoners 
after the bombings started [i.e. on 27 December 2008], but kept in custody roughly 115 alleged collaborators with 
Israel, about 70 Fatah supporters held on various charges, and some persons convicted of criminal offences who had

 <p> 
among the prisoners are contradicted by NGO reports and the Mission heard allegations of 
extrajudicial executions of escaping prisoners by, or at the behest of, the Gaza authorities, which 
the Mission deals with in chapter XIX. Police officials told the Mission that one prison guard 
was killed and several injured by the Israeli strike, as the first missile hit the guards&#8217; quarters, 
and that no prisoners were seriously injured. The guards had opened the prison doors 
immediately after the first strike. Others reported that &#8220;some prisoners were killed in the 
bombing, while others escaped the destroyed building.&#8221;<b>235</b> A number of prisoners injured in the 
attack went to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City for treatment after escaping from the prison.  
</p>
<p>370. Despite the limited number of casualties that may have occurred, the high probability of 
more serious loss of life and of injuries in an attack on a populated prison facility could not have 
been discounted by the Israeli forces. The Mission has taken note of the assessment of the Israeli 
air force that 99 per cent of the strikes it carried out were accurate.<b>236</b> In the light of this claim 
and in the absence of explanations to the contrary from the Israeli Government, it can only be 
concluded that the prison was the intended target of the strike. There is no indication from the 
information gathered on the incident and an inspection of the site that there was any cause for 
considering the prison building a &#8220;military objective&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>371. The Palestinian Legislative Council building in central Gaza City was, according to 
information provided by the Israeli armed forces on their official web site, attacked on 31 
December 2008. Mr. Ahmad Bahr, then Acting Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council in 
Gaza, stated to the Mission that it was hit by three missiles launched from fighter planes. The 
Mission visited the damaged assembly room. It also saw the rubble of the severely damaged 
three-storey building of the Parliament, which had been completed two years before. It was 
explained to the Mission that the new building contained a videoconferencing room which 
allowed the Gazan parliamentarians to hold joint sessions with the members of Parliament based 
in Ramallah. No casualties as a result of the strike on the Legislative Council building were 
reported to the Mission. 
</p>
<p>372. The Mission notes that the Israeli armed forces acknowledged in their &#8220;Summary of 
overnight events&#8221; of 1 January 2009 that:  
</p>
<p>The IAF and Israel Naval Forces struck around 20 Hamas targets throughout the Gaza 
Strip during late night and early morning hours (Dec. 31). 
</p>
<p>Among the sites targeted were. 
</p>
<p>The buildings housing Hamas' Ministry of Justice and Legislative Assembly, both located 
in the Tel El-Hawwa government complex. Hamas Government sites serve as a critical 
component of the terrorist groups&#8217; infrastructure in Gaza.<b>237</b> 
</p>
<p>

2009), p. 11.

<b>236</b> See also chapter XVI. 
<b>237</b> http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/opcast/op/press/0101.htm. </p>

 <p> 
373. The Israeli army spokesperson further elaborated: &#8220;The attack on strategic government 
objectives, which constitute part of Hamas&#8217;s mechanism of control, is a direct response to the 
continued firing on communities in southern Israel by the Hamas terrorist organization.&#8221;<b>238</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. The position of the Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>374. The Mission observes that the Government of Israel is not alleging that any Hamas 
military activity, such as launching of rockets, storage of weapons or planning of operations, was 
carried out in the Legislative Council building, the Ministry of Justice or the main prison. The 
justification of the Government of Israel for the strike on the Palestinian Legislative Council is 
that it is a &#8220;Hamas Government site&#8221;, and that such sites &#8220;serve as a critical component of the 
terrorist groups&#8217; infrastructure in Gaza&#8221; and &#8220;constitute part of Hamas&#8217;s mechanism of control&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>375. This explanation posted on the Israeli armed forces&#8217; official website is integrated and 
elaborated on by numerous statements made by current and former senior Government officials 
to the media. Major Avital Leibovich, a spokesperson of the Israeli armed forces, reportedly 
argued &#8220;anything affiliated with Hamas is a legitimate target.&#8221;<b>239</b> The deputy chief of staff, Maj. 
Gen. Dan Harel, reportedly told a meeting with heads of local authorities in southern Israel that:  
</p>
<p>This operation is different from previous ones. We have set a high goal which we are 
aiming for. We are hitting not only terrorists and launchers, but also the whole Hamas 
government and all its wings. [&#8230;] We are hitting government buildings, production 
factories, security wings and more. We are demanding governmental responsibility from 
Hamas and are not making distinctions between the various wings. After this operation 
there will not be one Hamas building left standing in Gaza, and we plan to change the 
rules of the game.<b>240</b> 
</p>
<p>376. Israeli armed forces&#8217; spokesman Captain Benjamin Rutland reportedly stated: &#8220;Our 
definition is that anyone who is involved with terrorism within Hamas is a valid target. This 
ranges from the strictly military institutions and includes the political institutions that provide the 
logistical funding and human resources for the terrorist arm.&#8221;<b>241</b> 
</p>
<p>377. Mr. Matti Steinberg, a former senior adviser to the Israeli General Security Services, 
argued that &#8220;Hamas&#8217;s civilian infrastructure is a very, very sensitive target. If you want to put 
pressure on them, this is how&#8221;.<b>242</b> Less than three months before the hostilities in Gaza began, 
Col. Gabriel Siboni similarly argued that: 
</p>

<b>242</b> &#8220;All-out war&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8230; the IDF will be required to strike hard at Hamas and to refrain from the cat and mouse 
games of searching for Qassam rocket launchers. The IDF should not be expected to stop 
the rocket and missile fire against the Israeli home front through attacks on the launchers 
themselves, but by means of imposing a ceasefire on the enemy.<b>243</b>  
</p>
<p>378. The Mission understands all these statements to imply that, in the view of their authors, in 
order to be effective, military operations have to be directed not only against military targets but 
also against the non-military infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>379. The Israeli Government&#8217;s discussion of the &#8220;targeting of Hamas terrorist infrastructure&#8221; 
asserts that, &#8220;consistent with the principle of distinction, IDF forces attacked military targets 
directly connected to Hamas and other terrorist organizations&#8217; military activities against Israel.&#8221; 
This statement is followed by a list of examples of objectives, such as command posts of al-
Qassam Brigades, alleged weapons storage sites and training camps, rocket and mortar launch 
sites, and tunnels. The list also refers twice to a location identified as the office of Ismail 
Haniyah, &#8220;head of the Hamas administration&#8221;. This list is followed, however, by a statement 
reiterating and elaborating the argument that there is really no distinction to be made between 
military and civilian objectives as far as government and public administration in Gaza are 
concerned:  
</p>
<p>While Hamas operates ministries and is in charge of a variety of administrative and 
traditionally governmental functions in the Gaza Strip, it still remains a terrorist 
organization. Many of the ostensibly civilian elements of its regime are in reality active 
components of its terrorist and military efforts. Indeed, Hamas does not separate its 
civilian and military activities in the manner in which a legitimate government might. 
Instead, Hamas uses apparatuses under its control, including quasi-governmental 
institutions, to promote its terrorist activity.<b>244</b>  
</p>
<p><b>4. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>380. From the facts gathered by it, the Mission finds that Israel launched direct attacks against 
the main prison in Gaza City on 28 December 2008 and against the Palestinian Legislative 
Council building in Gaza City on 31 December 2008. The attacks substantially damaged the 
buildings, making them unfit for use. At least one person was killed in the attack on the prison, 
while there were apparently no casualties in the attack on the Legislative Council building.  
</p>
<p>381. The factual question of whether these two institutions and their buildings served a military 
purpose must be considered with regard to the legal definition of military objectives. It is 
addressed in the following section. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Legal analysis 
</b></p>
<p>382. In assessing the Israeli strikes against the Legislative Council building and the main 
prison, the Mission first of all notes that Hamas is an organization with distinct political, military 
and social welfare components.<b>245</b>  
</p>
<p>383. Since July 2007 Hamas has been the de facto government authority in Gaza. As 
recognized by the Israeli Government,<b>246</b> the Hamas-led authorities in Gaza have been 
responsible for the civilian administration of Gaza. For instance, they employ civil servants and 
workers, run schools, hospitals, traffic police and the administration of justice. The fact that 
these institutions and the buildings housing them have been administered by authorities led by 
Hamas since July 2007, and no longer by a government composed of both Hamas and Fatah 
members has, in the view of the Mission, no bearing on the continued civilian character of these 
institutions. Regarding the prison, the Mission finds the consequences of the attack aptly 
described in the answer to its questions received from the Gaza authorities: &#8220;As a result of this 
targeting, great numbers of those who were detained pending trial in criminal cases and of those 
convicted of major crimes such as murder escaped. This has caused disorder and chaos, 
encouraged &#8216;family revenge&#8217; cases and people taking the law into their own hands.&#8221;<b>247</b> As far as 
the Palestinian Legislative Council building is concerned, it served representatives from all 
Palestinian parties who won seats in the 2006 elections (which were recognized as free and fair 
by international observers).  
</p>
<p>384. The Mission met with Gaza-based Legislative Council members belonging to Hamas, to 
Fatah and to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.<b>248</b> While Hamas constitutes the de 
facto authority in Gaza, the buildings attacked and destroyed served a public purpose that cannot 
be regarded as &#8220;promoting Hamas terrorist activity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>385. The fundamental rule of international humanitarian law applicable to attacks against 
buildings and infrastructure is enshrined in article 52 of Additional Protocol I (&#8220;General 
Protection of civilian objects&#8221;). This provision is generally recognized as codifying customary 
law applicable to both international and non-international armed conflicts:<b>249</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>245</b> This situation is recognized also by Governments which have listed Hamas&#8217; military component as &#8220;terrorist&#8221;. 
The Australian Government&#8217;s listing of al-Qassam Brigades as a terrorist organization (last updated 14 September 
2007), for instance, explains: &#8220;The functions of the Hamas organization, which has distinct civilian and military 
wings, include legitimate political and social activities. Its welfare and mosque networks act as a base for its 
recruitment and propaganda activities. Its terrorist operations are conducted by its military wing, the Izz ad-Din 
al-Qassam Brigades.&#8221;

<b>247</b> Reply from the Gaza authorities to the Mission&#8217;s list of questions (July 2009). 
<b>248</b> The Mission also spoke with West Bank-based Legislative Council members. 
<b>249</b> International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i>, vol. I, Jean-
Marie Henckaerts and Louise Doswald-Beck, eds. (Cambridge University Press, 2005), rules of customary law 7&#8211;9. 
The Israeli Government recognizes this principle. See &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 95. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>1. Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects 
are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2. 
</p>
<p>2. Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objects are 
concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, 
location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and 
whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances 
ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. 
</p>
<p>3. In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian 
purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is 
being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be 
presumed not to be so used. 
</p>
<p>386. The statement by the Israeli Government concerning the attack on the Legislative Council 
building and the Ministry of Justice does not suggest any &#8220;effective contribution to military 
action&#8221; that the buildings might have been making. No reference is made to any &#8220;definite 
military advantage&#8221; that their destruction would offer. Instead, the explanation is that 
government buildings constitute &#8220;part of Hamas&#8217;s mechanism of control&#8221;, that they &#8220;serve as a 
critical component of the terrorist groups&#8217; infrastructure in Gaza&#8221; and that &#8220;ostensibly civilian 
elements of [the Hamas] regime are in reality active components of its terrorist and military 
efforts.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>387. The Mission observes that there is nothing unique in the fact that in Gaza ministries and 
prisons are part of the government&#8217;s &#8220;mechanism of control&#8221; and that the legislature&#8217;s assembly 
hall and administrative buildings are a critical component of the government infrastructure. That 
is not, however, the test applied by international humanitarian law and accepted State practice to 
distinguish between civilian and military objects. The Mission reviewed, for instance, the 
tentative list of military objectives drawn up by Major General A.P.V. Rogers, a former Director 
of the British Army Legal Services, and a proposed list of military objectives drawn up by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). There is nothing in this comprehensive list of 
military objectives that comes close to a legislative assembly&#8217;s building or a prison. As far as 
ministries are concerned, both lists limit the definition of military objective to &#8220;war 
ministries&#8221;.<b>250</b> 
</p>
<p>388. The Mission further notes that international humanitarian law also recognizes a category 
of civilian objects which may nonetheless be targeted in the course of armed conflict to the 
extent that they have a &#8220;dual use&#8221;. Examples often made for such dual-use objects, which serve 
both civilian and military purposes, are civilian infrastructures such as telecommunications, 
power-generating stations or bridges, <i>in so far as they are used by the military in addition to 
their civilian use</i>. There is no indication, nor any allegation of any such dual use of the 
Legislative Council building or of the Gaza main prison. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>250</b> &#8220;Final report to the Prosecutor by the Committee established to review the NATO bombing campaign against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&#8221;, paras. 38&#8211;39, available at: http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/ 
nato061300.htm#IVA64d.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>389. There is an absence of evidence or, indeed, any allegation from the Israeli Government 
and armed forces that the Legislative Council building, the Ministry of Justice or the Gaza main 
prison &#8220;made an effective contribution to military action.&#8221; On the information available to it, the 
Mission finds that the attacks on these buildings constituted deliberate attacks on civilian objects 
in violation of the rule of customary international humanitarian law whereby attacks must be 
strictly limited to military objectives.  
</p>
<p>390. In the Mission's view these facts further indicate the commission of the grave breach of 
extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully 
and wantonly, as defined in article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p>391. The Mission rejects the analysis of present and former senior Israeli officials that, because 
of the alleged nature of the Hamas government in Gaza, the distinction between civilian and 
military parts of the government infrastructure is no longer relevant in relation to Israel&#8217;s conflict 
with Hamas. This analysis is accompanied, in the statements of Col. Gabriel Siboni and Mr. 
Matti Steinberg, by an explicit argument that Israel should &#8220;put pressure&#8221; on Hamas by targeting 
civilian infrastructure to attain its war aims. 
</p>
<p>392. The Mission is of the view that this is a dangerous argument that should be vigorously 
rejected as incompatible with the cardinal principle of distinction. International humanitarian law 
prohibits attacks against targets that do not make an effective contribution to military action. 
Attacks that are not directed against military (or dual use) objectives are violations of the laws of 
war, no matter how promising the attacker considers them from a strategic or political point of 
view. As a recent academic contribution to the discussion on whether &#8220;new wars&#8221; require &#8220;new 
laws&#8221; has noted, &#8220;if this argument [that attacks against political, financial or psychological 
targets may prove more effective than those against military or dual-use objectives] was 
decisive, in some societies &#8211; in particular in democracies &#8211; it may be hospital maternity wards, 
kindergartens, religious shrines, or homes for the elderly whose destruction would most affect 
the willingness of the military or of the government to continue the war.&#8221;<b>251</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B. Deliberate attacks on the Gaza police</b> 
</p>
<p>393. Information received by the Mission indicates that 248 members of the Gaza police were 
killed in the course of Israel&#8217;s military operations.<b>252</b> In other words, more than one out of every 
six casualties was a member of the Gaza police. 
</p>
<p>394. The Mission visited the &#8220;Arafat City&#8221; police headquarters in Gaza City and five police 
stations: the Abbas police station (central Gaza City), three police stations in neighbourhoods in 
the east and south of Gaza City (Zeytoun, al-Shujaeiyah and al-Tuffah) and the Deir al-Balah 
investigative police station. The Mission interviewed the Director of Police, the police 
spokesman, station commanders at the stations visited and other persons knowledgeable about

the Gaza police. The Mission also reviewed allegations about the Gaza internal security forces 
made by the Israeli Government and also mentioned in a report (in Hebrew) by the Orient 
Research Group Ltd., an Israeli organization commissioned by the then Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Olmert to produce this report.<b>253</b> 
</p>
<p>395. The attacks investigated by the Mission were all directed against facilities used by the 
police force called <i>shurta</i> (police) in official documents of the Gaza authorities and referred to as 
&#8220;civil police&#8221; in many English reports. 
</p>
<p>396. The Arafat City police headquarters and three of the five police stations visited were 
attacked during the first minutes of the Israeli military operations in Gaza, between 11.20 and 
11.35 a.m. on 27 December 2009. According to witnesses, the attacks were carried out primarily 
with bombs and missiles launched from fighter jets. Missiles launched by naval forces might also 
have been used.  
</p>
<p>397. According to the information received by the Mission from TAWTHEQ, 29 other police 
stations were targeted by the Israeli armed forces in addition to the five police stations visited by 
the Mission. Twenty-four were targeted on 27 December 2008 (mostly during the first minutes 
of the attack), the first day of the military operations, nine on the following day and one on 14 
January 2009.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Information regarding the attacks on the police headquarters  
and police stations visited by the Mission 
</b></p>
<p>398. Arafat City police headquarters occupy a large compound in central Gaza. They are used 
by the civil police (<i>shurta</i>), one of the police forces operating in Gaza, as office space and for 
training courses. The Mission visited three sites in the compound in which missiles or bombs had 
struck. In one large yard, three missiles struck the participants of a police training course. Forty-
eight policemen were killed on the spot, five more were wounded, two of whom subsequently 
succumbed to their injuries. 
</p>
<p>399. While it appears that all the policemen killed in this location were taking part in a training 
course, there is conflicting information on the details. Most reports by NGOs are to the effect 
that these were police &#8220;cadets&#8221; in the midst of a graduation ceremony. The Gaza police 
spokesperson, however, told the Mission that they were serving policemen, who had been taking 
a three-week course and who were, at the time of the strike, doing &#8220;morning sport exercise&#8221;.<b>254</b> 
The contents of the training course reportedly were &#8220;protocol&#8221;, i.e. how to deal with 
                                                 
<b>253</b> See Lt. Col. (res.) Jonathan Dahoah-Halevi, &#8220;Fatal casualties of the Palestinian security forces &#8211; Myth vs. 
Reality&#8221; (Orient Research Group Ltd., 2009). Its author is a former adviser to the Policy Planning Division of the 
Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs and current researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and co-founder 
of the Orient Research Group Ltd. In a letter to the Mission, the author stated that the report had been commissioned 
&#8220;to identify the police officers killed and the extent of their affiliation with Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and 
other terrorist organizations.&#8221; As to the sources and methodology employed, he explained that he had examined 
materials in the public domain, including official lists of policemen who were killed published by the Palestinian 
Police and the Gaza authorities, NGO reports and material published by Palestinian armed groups. &#8220;The operation 
in Gaza&#8230;&#8221; relies on this report, referring to it as &#8220;a recent study&#8221; (para. 247).

representatives of foreign Governments and international delegations, and rescue operations. An 
obituary of one of the policemen killed, published on the website of al-Qassam Brigades, claims 
that he was attending &#8220;a military refreshing course.&#8221;<b>255</b>  
</p>
<p>400. The police gave the Mission small cube-shaped (4x4x4 mm3 and 2x4x4 mm3) metal 
fragments allegedly from the missiles fired at this location. Information provided by NGOs that 
visited the site soon after the strike and collected samples of the munitions fragments confirm 
that they were found there. Laboratory analysis of the cubes establishes that they are made of 
tungsten.<b>256</b>   
</p>
<p>401. In a second location at Arafat City police headquarters, two projectiles fired by Israeli 
fighter jets left two craters. No one was present in the area at the time of the strike. The third 
location visited by the Mission was near the north gate of the police headquarters where a 
projectile, most likely a missile, killed police chief Tawfiq Jabr. Reports indicate that other sites 
at the police headquarters, not visited by the Mission, were also targeted.  
</p>
<p>402. A second police training course targeted was reportedly attended by around 50 policemen. 
Twenty-eight of them were killed in the strike. According to the police spokesperson, the 
training course was designed to instruct police officers on how to deal with police officers who 
abused their power as well as on cultural and economic issues relevant to police work.<b>257</b> 
Moreover, as the survivors were trying to flee through the western gate of the police city, they 
were reportedly targeted by two anti-personnel missiles, which caused deaths and injuries. While 
the Mission did not receive official information from the Gaza authorities on the number of 
policemen killed at the police headquarters on 27 December 2008, a report by an NGO submitted 
to the Mission states that 89 policemen died as a result of this attack. 
</p>
<p>403. Abbas police station in central Gaza City was, according to the station commander, hit by 
three missiles on 27 December 2008 at 11.35 a.m.<b>258</b> Officials at the police station had just been 
informed of the attack on Arafat City police a few minutes earlier and immediate evacuation of 
the station had begun. Nine policemen were killed, 20 more reportedly injured. There were, 
according to the station commander, five detainees (common criminal suspects) in the police 
cells, who were released before the attack. There were members of the public going about their 
normal business at the police station at the time of the strike, including women and children. 
TAWTHEQ estimates the material damage caused by the attack at US$ 80,000.

been developed for operations in urban areas.&#8221; See also Human Rights Watch, Precisely Wrong: Gaza Civilians 
Killed by Israeli Drone-Launched Missiles (June 2009), where it is stated that the fragments are likely to have been

<b>258</b> Interview with station commander, Maj. Iyad Jabr el Horani, 9 June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
404. The police station in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, a recently completed 
three-storey building, was struck by three missiles around 11.30 a.m. on 27 December 2009.<b>259</b> 
Also according to the station commander, no policemen were killed, as it had been possible to 
evacuate the police station very rapidly after another target in the neighbourhood had been hit. 
Many civilian bystanders were, however, allegedly injured. The station was hit again in the 
course of the hostilities. TAWTHEQ estimates the material damage caused by the attack at US$ 
150,000. 
</p>
<p>405. The Deir al-Balah investigative police station was attacked between 11.30 and 11.45 a.m. 
on 27 December 2008. According to a police officer interviewed by the Mission,<b>260</b> the police 
station was hit by a missile fired from an F-16. Other witnesses interviewed by the Mission 
recalled several explosions, the first of them most likely on a plot adjacent to the police station. 
Police officers who were inside the station at the time of the attack<b>261</b> reported that routine police 
activities were taking place. Suspects were being interrogated (there were four or five persons 
held in the station&#8217;s jail) and residents of the area were filing complaints. One police officer, 
Ashraf Hamadah Abu Kuwaik, was killed in the strike, and five other officers and one civilian 
were also injured. 
</p>
<p>406. The attack on the Deir al-Balah investigative police station cost the lives of six members 
of the public, who were in the vicinity. As a result of the explosions at the police station and of 
the debris, walls at the house of the al-Burdini family next to the police station collapsed, killing 
the 10-year-old Kamelia al-Burdini<b>262</b> and injuring several other members of the family. At a 
wholesale fruit and vegetable market next to the police station on Salah ad-Din Street, where 
between 50 and 100 persons were trading at the time, debris from the police station killed five 
persons, among them Abd al-Hakim Rajab Muhammad Mansi, 32, and his son, Uday Hakim 
Mansi, and injured many others.<b>263</b> 
</p>
<p>407. The strikes on al-Shujaeiyah and Zeytoun police stations, on 28 December 2008 and 
14 January 2009, did not result in the deaths of any policemen, as after the 27 December attacks 
the police stations had been evacuated.<b>264</b> In the attack on al-Shujaeiyah police station, however, 
two women, a man and a child, standing on the opposite side of the road, were reportedly killed 
by debris. TAWTHEQ estimates the material damage caused by the attacks on al-Shujaeiyah and 
Zeytoun police stations at US$ 210,000 and US$ 900,000, respectively.

</p>
<p><b>2. Conflicting characterizations of the Gaza security forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The approach of the Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>408. The position of the Government of Israel is that &#8220;due to their military functions, these 
internal security forces were not accorded the immunity from attack generally granted to 
civilians.&#8221; It alleges that, in May 2006, Hamas formed the Executive Force as a loyal militia, 
&#8220;[drawing] this paramilitary force largely from its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam 
Brigades, and armed the members with anti-tank missiles, mortars, machine guns and grenades. 
The newly recruited commanders and subordinates were not obliged to give up their military 
wing affiliation, and continued to operate simultaneously in both functions.&#8221; It further alleges 
that after the June 2007 seizure of full control over Gaza, Hamas restructured the Executive 
Force and subdivided it into several units, including the police, who &#8220;assumed many traditional 
law enforcement functions&#8221;. It goes on to say that its members, however, remained members of 
Hamas&#8217; military wing and their weaponry continued to include machine guns and anti-tank 
weapons. &#8220;[&#8230;] the former Executive Force continued to be closely integrated with &#8212; although 
not formally part of &#8212; the al-Qassam Brigades. [&#8230;] many members of the internal security 
services also served directly in the al-Qassam Brigades.&#8221; Regarding the military operations, the 
Israeli Government alleges that &#8220;Hamas intended to, and did, in fact, employ its internal security 
forces for military activities during the Gaza Operation.&#8221; It further alleges that the &#8220;collective 
role of the Gaza &#8216;police&#8217; as an integral part of Hamas armed forces is further evidenced by the 
fact that many Gaza &#8216;policemen&#8217; were also members of the al-Qassam Brigades.&#8221; To support this 
allegation, an Israeli Government paper shows pictures of four men killed during the military 
operations. Each of the men is shown in two pictures purportedly downloaded from Palestinian 
websites, one identifying the man as a policeman, the other as a member of al-Qassam Brigades. 
Finally, the paper refers to the above-mentioned study of the Orient Research Group Ltd., stating 
that it found that &#8220;more than nine out of every ten alleged &#8216;civilian police&#8217; were found to be 
armed terrorist activists and combatants directly engaged in hostilities against Israel.&#8221;<b>265</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) The approach of the Gaza authorities 
</b></p>
<p>409. The characterization of the Gaza internal security forces by the Government of Israel 
differs sharply from the tasks of the police as they are described on the official website of the 
Gaza Ministry of Interior, in orders to the police issued by the Minister of Interior which the 
Mission has reviewed, and in the interviews with the Director of Police and the police 
spokesman conducted by the Mission.  
</p>
<p>410. The Director of Police, Gen. Jamal al-Jarrah, also known as Abu Obeidah, stated that &#8220;the 
role of the police is to solve problems of the population, combat drug trafficking, arrest 
criminals.&#8221; He reported that they are equipped with Kalashnikov firearms and batons, as the 
authorities have not been able to obtain other police equipment, such as tear gas and small guns. 
Gen. Abu Obeidah acknowledged that there were complaints about the &#8220;harsh&#8221; methods of the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>265</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 237, 239, 241-242 and 245-247. </p>

 <p> 
Gaza police, but showed pride in their success in reducing lawlessness in the Gaza Strip.<b>266</b> This 
assessment was shared by many whom the Mission interviewed in the course of its 
investigations. The police orders and the Ministry&#8217;s website similarly describe the police as a 
law-enforcement agency. As to allegations that the police and al-Qassam Brigades were 
&#8220;interchangeable&#8221;, the Director of Police asserted that they were &#8220;absolutely not true&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>411. According to the police spokesperson, during the military operations the mandate of the 
police was firstly to &#8220;protect the internal front&#8221;, i.e. ensure that the relationship between the 
civilian population and the authorities stayed &#8220;intact&#8221;. Secondly, the police were to monitor the 
distribution of humanitarian goods to the civilian population. Thirdly, they were to continue 
regular law-enforcement duties, with a particular focus on combating looting and speculation on 
prices.<b>267</b>  
</p>
<p><b>3. The Mission&#8217;s assessment of the role and composition of the police </b></p>
<p>412. In order to shed some light on where the truth might lie between these two conflicting 
descriptions of the police, the Mission finds it necessary to examine the development of the 
security forces linked to Hamas after its election victory in January 2006. When Mr. Said Seyam, 
a senior Hamas representative,<b>268</b> took office as the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s Minister of Interior in 
April 2006, he found that he had little or no control over the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s security 
forces, which were put under the control of the President of the Palestinian Authority and of 
officials loyal to him.<b>269</b> On 20 April 2006, he announced the formation of a new security force 
reporting directly to him. This was the Security Forces Support Unit, also known as the 
Executive Force (<i>al-Quwwa al-Tanfiziyya</i>). The new security force appears to have had a double 
function as both a law-enforcement agency and, at least potentially, a military force. It was 
officially charged with enforcing public security and protecting property. At the same time, he 
appointed Mr. Jamal Abu Samhadana, commander of the Popular Resistance Committees, as the 
head of the Executive Force<b>270</b> and announced that it would be composed of 3,000 new recruits 
</p>

<b>267</b> Mission meeting with Gaza authorities&#8217; police spokesperson, 9 June 2009. According to the International Crisis 
Group, during the hostilities, &#8220;the Qassam Brigades and some civil police members (still referred to locally as the 
&#8220;Executive Forces&#8221;) patrolled streets in civilian clothes; some wore badges to establish their official status. They 
continued to arrest lawbreakers, detaining them in ordinary apartments since prisons have been destroyed; this helps 
explain why thus far there has been no report of looting or increase in crime. Likewise, security personnel 
maintained order in breadlines that sometimes stretched to hundreds of people and prevented unrest at the 
overburdened hospitals, where tempers easily flare.&#8221; &#8220;Ending the war&#8230;&#8221;, p. 8). 
<b>268</b> Said Seyam was killed by an Israeli air strike on 15 January 2009 together with several members of his family 
(TAWTHEQ documents submitted to the Mission; see also International Crisis Group, &#8220;Gaza&#8217;s unfinished 
business&#8221;, Middle East Report N&#176;85, 23 April 2009, p. 5.)

from various Palestinian armed groups, including al-Qassam Brigades.<b>271</b> The newly appointed 
commander reportedly declared: &#8220;[The Executive Force] will be the nucleus of the future 
Palestinian army. The resistance must continue. We have only one enemy. &#8230; I will continue to 
carry the rifle and pull the trigger whenever required to defend my people. We are also a force 
against corruption. We are against thieves, corrupt officials and law breakers.&#8221;<b> 272</b> 
</p>
<p>413. In August 2007, following the June 2007 Hamas seizure of full control over Gaza, the 
current Director of the Gaza authorities&#8217; civil police, then head of the Executive Force, Gen. Abu 
Obeidah, described the planned reorganization of the security services in Gaza. Executive Force 
members were to be integrated into the civil police. He reportedly stated that Hamas was 
&#8220;working hard to retrain Executive Force members to perform police duties&#8221; and that the &#8220;Force 
will be in charge of chasing drug dealers and lawless residents&#8221;. At the same time, he stated that 
&#8220;members of the Force are religious, and are resistance fighters.&#8221;<b>273</b> 
</p>
<p>414. In October 2007, the security services operating in Gaza were reorganized. The previous 
Palestinian Authority&#8217;s police agencies in Gaza were merged with the Executive Force.<b>274</b> The 
security forces under the control of the Ministry of Interior emerging from this reorganization 
comprise the Civil Police, the Civil Defence, the Internal Security (an intelligence agency) and 
the National Security. Their mandates, according to the Gaza authorities&#8217; Ministry of Interior&#8217;s 
website,<b>275</b> are differentiated.  
</p>
<p>415. The National Security force is given specific military tasks, such as &#8220;the protection of the 
State from any foreign aggression&#8221; and &#8220;responsibility for the defence of the Palestinian 
homeland in the face of external and internal threats&#8221;. It is thus plainly a military force whose 
members are, under international humanitarian law, combatants.<b>276</b> The functions of the police 
have been outlined above.  
</p>
<p>416. On 1 January 2009, during the Israeli military operations in Gaza, the police 
spokesperson, Mr. Islam Shahwan, informed the media that the police commanders had managed 
to hold three meetings at secret locations since the beginning of the armed operations. He added 
that &#8220;an action plan has been put forward, and we have conducted an assessment of the situation

 <p> 
and a general alert has been declared by the police and among the security forces in case of any 
emergency or a ground invasion. Police officers received clear orders from the leadership to face 
(&#8220;&#1607;&#1580;&#1575;&#1608;&#1610; _&#8221; in Arabic) the enemy, if the Gaza Strip were to be invaded.&#8221;<b>277</b> Confirming to the 
Mission that he had been correctly quoted, Mr. Shahwan stated that the instructions given at that 
meeting were to the effect that in the event of a ground invasion, and particularly if the Israeli 
armed forces were to enter urban settlements in Gaza, the police was to continue its work of 
ensuring that basic food stuffs reached the population, of directing the population to safe places, 
and of upholding public order in the face of the invasion. Mr. Shahwan further stated that not a 
single policeman had been killed in combat during the armed operations, proving that the 
instructions had been strictly obeyed by the policemen. 
</p>
<p>417. The Mission notes that there are no allegations that the police as an organized force took 
part in combat during the armed operations. On the basis of the information provided by the 
Gaza authorities and of the above-mentioned study of the Orient Research Group Ltd., it would 
appear that 75 per cent of its members killed in the course of the military operations died as a 
result of the air strikes carried out during the first minutes of the Israeli attack. These men had 
not engaged in combat with the Israeli armed forces.<b>278</b>  
</p>
<p>418. The Mission also notes that while the then commander of the Executive Forces and now 
Director of Police did reportedly say in August 2007 that members of the Executive Force were 
&#8220;resistance fighters&#8221;, he stressed in the same interview the authorities&#8217; intention to develop it into 
a law enforcement force.<b> </b>The Mission notes that a situation in which a recently constituted 
civilian police force integrates former members of armed groups would not be unique to Gaza. 
That prior membership in itself would not be sufficient to establish that the police in Gaza is a 
part of al-Qassam Brigades or other armed groups. 
</p>
<p>419. Except for the statements of the police spokesperson, the Israel Government has presented 
no other basis on which a presumption can be made against the overall civilian nature of the 
police in Gaza. It is true that the police and the security forces created by Hamas in Gaza may 
have their origins in the Executive Force. However, while the Mission would not rule out the 
possibility that there might be individuals in the police force who retain their links to the armed 
groups, it believes that the assertion on the part of the Government of Israel that &#8220;an 
overwhelming majority of the police forces were also members of the Hamas military wing or 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>277</b> His statements are reported in the Arabic original on a website of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, at 
http://www.ikhwanonline.com/Article.asp?ArtID=43756&amp;SecID=450. The journalist states that in spite of the 
Israeli air attacks against police stations, the police continued to do law enforcement work and to direct the traffic: 
&#8220;members of the Criminal Investigation and the Internal Security caught a quantity of drugs in some of the targeted 
areas, and at the entrances of some of the crossroads and cities within the Strip, where one can observes members of 
the police in civilian clothes monitoring the traffic&#8221;.  
<b>278</b> In &#8220;Fatal casualties&#8230;&#8221;, the Orient Research Group Ltd, however, identifies 31 policemen who it alleges were 
killed in combat in Gaza during the period from 3 to 18 January. In a few cases the information is rather specific, 
such as &#8220;killed on 4 January in Jabalya after launching rockets&#8221; or &#8220;killed on 6 January while fighting the IDF in 
Deir al-Balah&#8221;. In other cases it is more generic, such as &#8220;killed while fighting the IDF&#8221;. The Mission accepts that 
this might indicate that some individual members of the Gaza police were at the same time members of armed 
groups. The Mission is also mindful, as explained below, that the claims of armed groups that a person killed during 
the armed operations was one of their members have to be treated with care. </p>

 <p> 
activists of Hamas or other terrorist organizations&#8221;,<b>279</b> appears to be an overstatement that has led 
to prejudicial presumptions against the nature of the police force that may not be justified.   
</p>
<p>420. In his meeting with the Mission, the Director of Police was very open in acknowledging 
that many of his men were Hamas supporters, but insisted at the same time there are others who 
supported other Palestinian factions.<b>280</b> Police station commanders interviewed by the Mission 
stated that most of their men (70 per cent according to the estimates of one station commander, 
95 per cent in another station) had joined the police after June 2007.<b>281</b> The Mission understands 
that most, if not all, of the post-June 2007 recruits into the civil police, will have been recruited 
from the Executive Force, which was strongly loyal to Hamas. 
</p>
<p>421. The Mission also notes, however, that in senior positions in the police, the representation 
of non-Hamas men appears to have been broader. The Director of Police killed on 27 December 
2008, Mr. Tawfiq Jabr, was generally known as not being affiliated with Hamas. Several of the 
station commanders interviewed by the Mission were also not Hamas affiliates but men who had 
joined the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s police after the Oslo Accords allowed the Palestinians to 
constitute their own law-enforcement agencies. They had thus served in the Palestinian police in 
Gaza for more than 10 years before Hamas seized control of it in June 2007. 
</p>
<p>422. The Mission further notes that the study conducted by the Orient Research Group Ltd. 
names policemen killed during the attack, whom it identifies as members of Hamas, al-Qassam 
Brigades, other armed Palestinian groups or &#8220;terror operatives&#8221; whose affiliation is not known. 
In 78 out of 178 cases the policemen are alleged to be members of al-Qassam Brigades on the 
sole basis that they were allegedly Hamas members.  
</p>
<p>423. Furthermore, it appears from the response to the Mission from the Orient Research Group 
Ltd. describing its methodology that its information on police members&#8217; alleged affiliation with 
armed groups was based to a large extent on the websites of the armed groups. In this respect, 
the Mission is mindful of a recent report by a Palestinian human rights NGO drawing attention to 
the &#8220;issue of the &#8216;adoption&#8217; of killed persons by resistance groups; i.e. declaration by a political 
or armed group that the person killed was one of their members. Often, when persons, including 
children, are killed by actions of the Israeli armed forces , political and/or armed groups &#8216;adopt&#8217; 
them as &#8216;martyrs&#8217; placing their photographs on their websites and commending their contribution 
to resisting occupation. This does not mean that those persons killed were involved in resistance 
activities in any way. The families accept this &#8216;adoption&#8217; of deceased family members for 
various reasons including the willingness of resistance groups to provide financial support to the 
families and pay for funeral costs of the persons killed.&#8221;<b> </b> As the NGO concludes, &#8220;these cases 
require in-depth investigation on a case-by-case basis in order to determine every person&#8217;s status 
according to his actual affiliation&#8221;.<b>282</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>424. From the facts gathered by it, the Mission estimates that 99 policemen and nine members 
of the public were killed in the attacks on the police headquarters and the five police stations 
inspected by the Mission. The Gaza authorities state that overall 248 policemen were killed by 
the Israeli armed forces during the military operations. The study by the Orient Research Group 
Ltd. identifies 345 men allegedly belonging to the Gaza internal security forces killed by Israeli 
attacks during the military operations. It identifies 240 of the 345 alleged members of the 
internal security forces as members of the police. This is very close to the number provided by 
the Gaza authorities.<b>283</b>  
</p>
<p>425. The facts gathered by the Mission indicate that the policemen were the intended targets of 
the attacks. The Israeli Government<b>284</b> is quite clear on this, and has not suggested that the 
attacks on the police were not intended. The type of ammunition used at the Arafat City police 
headquarters is designed to kill or incapacitate people in the area of impact and has little or no 
effect on buildings or other infrastructure. In other locations at the civil police headquarters in 
Gaza City the munitions used were such that the damage to infrastructure was minimal compared 
to the cost in lives among the policemen. With regard to the other police stations visited by the 
Mission, damage to the buildings was extensive but the number of policemen killed was limited, 
with the exception of Abbas police station in central Gaza City, where nine policemen were 
killed. There is no question that the approximately 100 policemen who died in the attacks on the 
stations visited by the Mission were deliberately targeted and killed by the Israeli armed forces.  
</p>
<p>426. The attacks on the police headquarters and five police stations visited by the Mission were 
carried out during the first minutes of the surprise air bombing campaign launched by the Israeli 
armed forces against Gaza shortly before 11.30 a.m. on 27 December.  
</p>
<p>427. From the facts gathered by it, the Mission finds that there is insufficient information to 
conclude that the Gaza police as a whole had been &#8220;incorporated&#8221; into the armed forces of the 
Gaza authorities. The statement by the police spokesperson on 1 January 2009 (after the attacks 
of 27 December 2008 had been carried out) cannot, on its own, justify the assertion that the 
police were part and parcel of the armed forces. 
</p>
<p>428. The Mission could not verify the allegations of membership of armed groups of 
policemen. In half the cases, moreover, the allegations appear to be based merely on an equation 
of membership in Hamas (in itself alleged on the basis of unverifiable information) with 
membership in al-Qassam Brigades, which in the view of the Mission is not justified. Finally, 
even according to the study referred to by the Israeli Government, 34 policemen without any 
affiliation to Hamas or a Palestinian armed group were killed in the armed operations, the great 
majority of them in the bombardment of police stations on the first day of the military 
operations. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p><p>429. An &#8220;obituary&#8221; published on a website of al-Qassam Brigades states that one of the training 
courses at the police headquarters in Gaza on 27 December 2008 was a &#8220;military refresher 
course&#8221;. That is, however, contradicted by the police spokesperson and a number of the reports 
received by the Mission from NGOs. It is also not suggested by the Israeli Government that that 
was a reason for attacking it. As a distinct probability, the Mission finds that the policemen 
killed there were neither engaged in any military activity at the time of the attacks nor carrying 
out preparations for combat. At the other police stations, the police were engaged in a range of 
routine tasks, including questioning detainees and handling issues for members of the public who 
were present in police facilities in the middle of an ordinary day. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Legal analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The applicable rules of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>430. The general rule of international humanitarian law is that members of law-enforcement 
agencies are considered part of the civilian population, unless they have been incorporated into 
the armed forces of a party to the conflict.<b>285</b> This principle is accepted by the Israeli 
Government.<b>286</b> The obligation to distinguish at all times between the civilian population and 
combatants and to direct attacks only against military objectives<b>287</b> (the principle of distinction) 
therefore generally prohibits attacks against members of the law-enforcement agencies. In its 
Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 on the<i> Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i>, the 
International Court of Justice recognized the principle of distinction as an &#8220;intransgressible&#8221; 
principle of customary international law.  
</p>
<p>431. There are three situations in which direct attacks against members of police forces would 
not constitute a violation of the principle of distinction. First, if the law-enforcement agency or 
the unit to which the policeman belongs has been &#8220;incorporated&#8221; into the armed forces, thus 
conferring combatant status upon its members. Second, if individual members of the law-
enforcement agency are at the same time members of an armed group, they would be 
combatants.<b>288</b> Thirdly, individual members of the law-enforcement agency, like any civilians, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>285</b> Article 43 (3) of Additional Protocol I provides: &#8220;Whenever a party to a conflict incorporates a paramilitary or 
armed law enforcement agency into its armed forces it shall so notify the other parties to the conflict.&#8221;  
<b>286</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221; (para. 238) states that &#8220;whereas members of a civilian police force that is solely a 
civilian police force, who have no combat function are not considered combatants under the Law of Armed Conflict, 
international law recognizes that this principle does not apply where police are part of the armed forces of a party.&#8221; 
<b>287</b> Article 48 of Additional Protocol I expresses the principle in the following terms: 
</p>
<p>In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict 
shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and 
military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.  
<b>288</b> The ICRC Commentary to Additional Protocol I argues that &#8220;any interpretation which would allow combatants 
as meant in article 43 to &#8220;demobilize&#8221; at will in order to return to their status as civilians and to take up their status 
as combatants once again, as the situation changes or as military operations may require, would have the effect of 
cancelling any progress that this article has achieved. &#8230; [Article 44] does not allow this combatant to have the 
status of a combatant while he is in action, and the status of a civilian at other times&#8221; (pp. 515-516). </p>

 <p> 
may not be targeted &#8220;unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.&#8221;<b>289</b> Finally, 
as with civilians generally, policemen might be indirectly injured or killed in an attack which is 
directed at a military objective, as long as the attack complies with the principle of 
proportionality.  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>432. The Mission will now draw conclusions with regard to each of these grounds potentially 
justifying the attacks against the police. 
</p>
<p>433. First, as already noted above, the Mission finds that there is insufficient information to 
conclude that the Gaza police as a whole had been &#8220;incorporated&#8221; into the armed forces of the 
Gaza authorities. Accordingly, the policemen killed cannot be considered to have been 
combatants by virtue of their membership in the police.  
</p>
<p>434. Second, the Mission finds that the policemen killed on 27 December 2008 cannot be said 
to have been taking a direct part in hostilities. Thus, they did not lose their civilian immunity 
from direct attack as civilians on this ground.<b>290</b> 
</p>
<p>435. Third, the Mission examined whether the attacks on the police stations could be justified 
on the basis that there were, allegedly, members of Palestinian armed groups among the 
policemen. The question would thus be one of proportionality. The principle of proportionality is 
reflected in Additional Protocol I, which prohibits launching attacks &#8220;which may be expected to 
cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a 
combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military 
advantage anticipated.&#8221;<b>291</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>289</b> Pursuant to article 51 (3) of Additional Protocol I, civilians enjoy immunity from attack &#8220;unless and for such time 
as they take a direct part in hostilities.&#8221; According to ICRC, this rule also reflects customary international law: 
&#8220;Civilians are protected against attack unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities&#8221; (rule 6). 
<i>Customary International Humanitarian Law&#8230;</i>. The Mission is aware that Israel is not a party to Additional Protocol 
I and reportedly does not accept the qualifying phrase &#8220;and for such time&#8221; as reflective of customary law (see Y. 
Dinstein, &#8220;The ICRC customary international humanitarian law study&#8221;, <i>Israel Yearbook on Human Rights</i>, vol. 36 
(2006), p. 11). In its report on the military operations, the Government of Israel refers to a definition of direct 
participation in hostilities by Israel&#8217;s High Court of Justice as &#8220;involving all persons that perform the function of 
combatants, including &#8220;a civilian bearing arms (openly or concealed) who is on his way to the place where he will 
use them against the army, at such place, or on his way back from it,&#8221; as well as &#8220;a person who collected 
intelligence on the army, whether on issues regarding the hostilities &#8230; or beyond those issues&#8230;; a person who 
transports unlawful combatants to or from the place where the hostilities are taking place; a person who operates 
weapons which unlawful combatants use, or supervises their operation, or provides service to them, be the distance 
from the battlefield as it may.&#8221; (&#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 120). 
</p>
<p>The Mission is of the view that, for the purposes of the legal analysis of the attacks on the police stations 
considered here, it is not decisive whether the rule binding Israel is that &#8220;civilians are protected against attack unless 
and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities&#8221; or only &#8220;unless they take direct part in hostilities&#8221;. 
<b>290</b> This finding does not apply to those policemen who were members of al-Qassam Brigades, who were therefore 
combatants and not civilians. 
<b>291</b> Israel recognizes that &#8220;customary international law bars military attacks that are anticipated to harm civilians 
excessively in relation to the expected military advantage.&#8221; &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 120. </p>

 <p> 
436. The Mission has earlier accepted that there may be individual members of the Gaza police 
that were at the same time members of al-Qassam Brigades or other Palestinian armed groups 
and thus combatants. Even if the Israeli armed forces had reliable information that some 
individual members of the police were also members of armed groups, this did not deprive the 
whole police force of its status as a civilian law-enforcement agency.<b>292</b>  
</p>
<p>437. From the facts available to it, the Mission finds that the deliberate killing of 99 members 
of the police at the police headquarters and three police stations<b>293</b> during the first minutes of the 
military operations, while they were engaged in civilian tasks inside civilian police facilities, 
constitutes an attack which failed to strike an acceptable balance between the direct military 
advantage anticipated (i.e. the killing of those policemen who may have been members of 
Palestinian armed groups) and the loss of civilian life (i.e. the other policemen killed and 
members of the public who would inevitably have been present or in the vicinity). The attacks on 
the Arafat City police headquarters and the Abbas Street police station, al-Tuffah police station 
and the Deir al-Balah investigative police station constituted disproportionate attacks in violation 
of customary international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>438. From the facts available to it, the Mission further believes that there has been a violation 
of the inherent right to life of those members of the police killed in the attacks of 27 December 
2007 who were not members of armed groups by depriving them arbitrarily of their life in 
violation of article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  OBLIGATION ON PALESTINIAN ARMED GROUPS IN GAZA TO TAKE 
FEASIBLE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 
</b></p>
<p>439. An assessment of the events occurring during the military operations in Gaza in December 
2008 - January 2009 requires an investigation of the tactics used both by the Israeli armed forces 
and by the Palestinian armed groups in the context of their obligations under international 
humanitarian law to take constant care to minimize the risk of harm to the civilian population 
and to civilian objects. The Mission examines the extent to which the Israeli armed forces took 
all feasible precautions in chapter IX, as well as in the examination of individual incidents. In 
this chapter, the Mission examines allegations that the conduct of the Palestinian armed groups 
placed the civilian population of Gaza and civilian objects at risk of attack. 
</p>
<p>440. In its efforts to gather more direct information on the subject, during its investigations in 
Gaza and in interviews with victims and witnesses of incidents and other informed individuals, 
the Mission raised questions regarding the conduct of Palestinian armed groups during the 
hostilities in Gaza. The Mission notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak 
about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups. Whatever the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>292</b> &#8220;The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians 
does not deprive the population of its civilian character&#8221; (Additional Protocol I, art. 50 (3)). 
<b>293</b> These are the policemen killed at the police headquarters and police stations visited by the Mission. The overall 
number of policemen killed on 27 December 2008 is around 180, according to the Orient Research Group Ltd. See 
&#8220;Fatal casualties&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
reasons for their reluctance, the Mission does not discount that the interviewees&#8217; reluctance may 
have stemmed from a fear of reprisals.<b>294</b>  
</p>
<p>441. The Mission also addressed questions regarding the tactics used by Palestinian armed 
groups to the Gaza authorities. They responded that they had nothing to do, directly or indirectly, 
with al-Qassam Brigades or other armed groups and had no knowledge of their tactics.<b>295</b>  To 
gather first-hand information on the matter, the Mission requested a meeting with representatives 
of armed groups. However, the groups were not agreeable to such a meeting. The Mission, 
consequently, had little option but to rely upon indirect sources to a greater extent than for other 
parts of its investigation. 
</p>
<p>442. In forming an opinion on the subject, the Mission did use information it had gathered in 
the course of investigating certain incidents during the December-January military operations. 
However, the Mission mostly reviewed the allegations made in reports by the Government of 
Israel, by private individuals and organizations,<b>296</b> and by NGOs.<b>297</b> 
</p>
<p>443. The Mission focused on allegations that Palestinian fighters had launched attacks from 
within civilian areas and from protected sites (such as schools, mosques and medical units); used 
civilian and protected sites as bases for military activity; misused medical facilities and 
ambulances; stored weapons in mosques; failed to distinguish themselves from the civilian 
population and, in so doing, used the Gazan civilian population as a shield against Israeli attack. 
The Mission further sought information concerning allegations that Palestinian armed groups had 
booby-trapped civilian property.<b>298</b>  
</p>
<p>444. The significance of these allegations is twofold. First, the alleged conduct might constitute 
a violation by the Palestinian armed groups of their obligation of care to prevent harm to the 
civilian population or the prohibition against the deliberate use of civilians to shield from 
military activity. Second, the Government of Israel and others argue that certain attacks by 
Israeli armed forces on civilian objects or protected sites were justified by the unlawful use that 
Palestinian armed groups made of them. In the words of a report by the Israeli armed forces on 
its shelling of a United Nations compound in which at least 600 Palestinian civilians had taken 
refuge, such attacks were &#8220;the unfortunate result of the type of warfare that Hamas forced upon

with international organizations.&#8221;<b>299</b> 
</p>
<p>445. The Mission will address the justifications put forward by the Government of Israel for 
attacks on protected sites that it alleged were being used by Palestinian armed groups and that 
are investigated in this report.  
</p>
<p><b>A. Launching attacks from within civilian areas and from within  
or in the immediate vicinity of protected sites 
</b></p>
<p>446. The Mission investigated two incidents in which the Government of Israel alleged that 
Palestinian combatants had fired on the Israeli armed forces from within a United Nations 
protected site or its immediate vicinity in densely populated urban areas. In the case of the 
shelling in al-Fakhura Street by the Israeli armed forces on 6 January 2009 (chap. X), the 
Mission accepted, on the basis of information in the reports it had seen, the possibility of  mortar 
attacks from Palestinian combatants in the vicinity of the school.  
</p>
<p>447. In the incident at the UNRWA compound in the neighbourhood of Rimal, in the centre of 
Gaza City, senior international UNRWA staff indicate that they were unaware of any sustained 
fire at the relevant time from anywhere in the nearby areas (chap. IX). In that case the Mission 
was unable to make a finding as to whether any combat activity was being conducted by 
Palestinian armed groups against the Israeli armed forces in that area at that time. 
</p>
<p>448. The Mission spoke with two witnesses who testified to the launching of rockets from 
urban areas. One witness stated seeing rockets being launched from a narrow street and from a 
square in Gaza City without providing further details as to when this occurred.<b>300</b> A second 
witness told the Mission that rockets may have been fired from within the Sheikh Radwan 
neighbourhood north of Gaza City during the military operations in Gaza.<b>301</b> 
</p>
<p>449. The Mission found corroboration of these witness accounts in a number of reports from 
international NGOs. In reports issued following Israel&#8217;s military operations in Gaza, Amnesty 
International, the International Crisis Group and Human Rights Watch each determined that the 
rocket units of the Palestinian armed groups operated from within populated areas.<b>302</b>  Human 
Rights Watch and the International Crisis Group gathered reports from civilians about instances 
in which armed groups had launched or had attempted to launch rockets near residential areas. 
Human Rights Watch quoted a resident of northern Gaza as stating that, on 1 January 2009, 
residents of the area prevented Palestinian fighters, who they believed were preparing to launch

<b>299</b> http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/opcast/postop/press/2202.htm. According to the Israeli Government, &#8220;when a 
party to an armed conflict uses civilian and protected spaces for military purposes, those spaces become legitimate 
targets for the opposing side, thereby placing civilian lives and infrastructure in great danger&#8221; (&#8220;The operation in 
Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 153).

 <p> 
rockets, from entering a garden next to the building in which they lived.<b>303</b> The International 
Crisis Group interviewed a resident of Beit Lahia who stated that fighters used his land to fire 
rockets, which he did not dare to resist, as his father had previously been shot in the leg by a 
member of such an armed group when he had tried to prevent them from using his land as a 
rocket launching site.<b>304</b> Amnesty International conducted interviews with residents of Gaza 
who stated that they had observed Palestinian fighters firing a rocket from a courtyard of a 
Government school in Gaza City at a time when the schools were closed. In another area of 
Gaza City, another resident reportedly showed an Amnesty International researcher a place 
from which a rocket had been launched, 50 metres from a residential building.<b>305</b> Amnesty 
International also reported, however, that it had seen no evidence that rockets had been 
launched from residential houses or buildings while civilians were still in them. 
</p>
<p>450. Both the International Crisis Group and Human Rights Watch found that the practice of 
firing close to or within populated areas became more prevalent as the Israeli armed forces took 
control of the more open or outlying areas.<b>306</b> 
</p>
<p>451. The Mission reviewed the pictures allegedly showing the launching of rockets &#8220;from 
within or near residential buildings, including schools, mosques and hospitals&#8221; in the Israeli 
Government&#8217;s paper<b>307</b> and in several of the submissions it received.<b>308</b> The Mission notes that it 
is not reasonably possible to determine whether those photographs show what is alleged. As the 
Israeli Government concedes,<b>309</b> many of them refer not to the December 2008-January 2009 
period, but to previous alleged instances of firing of rockets from Gaza.<b>310</b> 
</p>
<p>452. In view of the information communicated to it and the material it was able to review, the 
Mission believes that there are indications that Palestinian armed groups launched rockets from 
urban areas. In those instances in which Palestinian armed groups did indeed fire rockets or 
mortars from urban areas the question remains whether this was done with the specific intent of 
shielding the combatants from counter-attack. The Mission has not been able to obtain any direct 
evidence on this question; nor do reports from other observers provide a clear answer.  
</p>
<p>453. According to the International Crisis Group, for instance, a fighter for Islamic Jihad stated 
in an interview that &#8220;the most important thing is achieving our military goals. We stay away 
from the houses if we can, but that&#8217;s often impossible&#8221;, which suggests the absence of intent. 
The same NGO also reports an interview with three Palestinian combatants in January 2009 in

<b>310</b> The following video, referred to in a submission to the Mission by B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith International, appears to show the 
launching of rockets from within an urban area, allegedly from within a school, on 8 January 2009: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN9WzUc7iB0 </p>

 <p> 
which the fighters reportedly stated that rockets and mortars were launched in close proximity to 
homes and alleyways &#8220;in the hope that nearby civilians would deter Israel from responding&#8221;.<b>311</b>  
</p>
<p>454. The Mission now turns to the related but distinct question of whether and to what extent 
Palestinian armed groups made use of residential housing and of protected sites, such as schools, 
hospitals, mosques and United Nations facilities, in their engagements with Israeli ground forces.  
</p>
<p>455. The Mission also examined the question of the presence and activities of members of 
Palestinian armed groups in chapter XI. As already mentioned, Palestinian witnesses were 
generally reluctant to speak to the Mission about the activity of Palestinian armed groups in their 
neighbourhoods. For the present purposes, it suffices to say that, in some of the cases, there was 
evidence of the presence of Palestinian armed groups in residential areas.<b>312</b>  
</p>
<p>456. The Mission received a submission from a colonel of the reserve of the Israeli armed 
forces that seeks to illuminate the &#8220;combat principles&#8221; of Palestinian armed groups. His report is 
based on material published by Palestinian armed groups on their websites. The report describes 
alleged tactics such as &#8220;seizing houses as military positions for the purpose of staging ambushes 
against IDF forces&#8221; and &#8220;deploying explosive charges of various types (IEDs, penetrating, 
bounding, anti personnel etc.) in the vicinity of residences and detonating them&#8221;, &#8220;booby-
trapping houses &#8230; and detonating the charges&#8221;, and &#8220;conducting fighting and sniper fire at IDF 
forces operating in the built-up areas&#8221;.<b>313</b> 
</p>
<p>457. This submission provides useful information. It tends to show, for instance, that ground 
engagements between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups were most intense in areas of 
mixed urban-rural character on the outskirts of Gaza City, Jabaliyah and Beit Lahia.  
</p>
<p>458. The Mission notes, however, that the one incident described in the submission which it 
has investigated itself illustrates the unreliability of some of the sources the report relies on. In 
this incident, the source claimed that three Palestinian combatants had laid an ambush in a house 
in Izbat Abd Rabbo, hurled explosives at the Israeli armed forces and managed to drag a 
wounded Israeli soldier into the house. From the facts it has itself gathered, the Mission can 
exclude that in this incident the Palestinian combatants managed to capture an Israeli soldier. 
This example suggests that some websites of Palestinian armed groups might magnify the extent 
to which Palestinians successfully attacked Israeli forces in urban areas. 
</p>
<p>459. Other sources reviewed by the Mission confirm scepticism about the intensity of attacks 
on the Israeli armed forces by Palestinian armed groups in built-up areas. The Mission notes that 
a thread running through many of the Israeli soldiers&#8217; testimonies collected by the Israeli NGO 
Breaking the Silence is that they had no encounters with Palestinian combatants.<b>314</b> According to 
another NGO report, &#8220;Hamas fighters plainly were frustrated by their inability to engage in street 
</p>

battles&#8221;.<b> 315</b> Generally, the Mission received relatively few reports of actual crossfire between the 
Israeli armed forces and Palestinian armed groups. This would also appear to be reflected in the 
low number of Israeli soldiers killed or injured during the ground offensive.<b>316</b> The Mission also 
notes that in none of the incidents it investigated was there any indication that civilians were 
killed in crossfire between Palestinian armed groups and the Israeli armed forces. 
</p>
<p>460. While the Mission is unable to form an opinion on the exact nature or the intensity of 
combat activities carried out by the armed groups in urban residential areas that would have 
placed the civilian population and civilian objects at risk of attack, their presence in these areas 
as combatants is established from the information that has come to the attention of the Mission. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Booby-trapping of civilian houses 
</b></p>
<p>461. In chapter XIV the Mission will report on different incidents in which witnesses have 
described the circumstances in which they had been used by the Israeli armed forces during 
house searches and forced at gunpoint to enter houses ahead of the Israeli soldiers. These 
witnesses testified that they had been used in this way to enter several houses. None of them 
encountered a booby trap or other improvised explosive devices during the house searches. The 
Mission is also mindful of other incidents it has investigated that involved entry into civilian 
houses by Israeli soldiers in different areas in Gaza. None of these incidents showed the use of 
booby traps.   
</p>
<p>462. The Mission, however, recalls the allegations levelled in the reports that it has reviewed. 
The Government of Israel alleges that Hamas planted booby traps in &#8220;homes, roads, schools and 
even entire neighbourhoods&#8221;. It adds, &#8220;in essence, the Hamas strategy was to transform the urban 
areas of the Gaza Strip into a massive death trap for IDF forces, in gross disregard for the safety 
of the civilian population.&#8221;<b>317</b>  The Mission notes that the existence of booby-trapped houses is 
mentioned in testimonies of Israeli soldiers collected by Breaking the Silence. One soldier 
recounts witnessing the detonation of a powerful explosion inside a house as a bulldozer 
approached it. A second soldier stated &#8220;many explosive charges were found, they also blew up, 
no one was hurt. Tank Corps or Corps of Engineers units blew them up. Usually they did not 
explode because most of the ones we found were wired and had to be detonated, but whoever 
was supposed to detonate them had run off. It was live, however, ready&#8230;&#8221;.<b>318</b> Also the reports 
published by Palestinian armed groups, on which the submission to the Mission on the tactics of 
Palestinian combatants by the Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs is based, suggest that booby-

<p>                                                 
<b>315</b> According to the International Crisis Group, Hamas &#8220;tried to draw Israeli troops into densely populated urban 
areas, especially Hamas strongholds that had been prepared for counter-attack. A fighter described battles as a lethal 
&#8216;game of hide and seek&#8217; in which Israel sought to lure fighters into open space, while Hamas attempted to bring 
Israeli troops onto their preferred terrain. The soldiers refused the bait, Hamas fighters plainly were frustrated by 
their inability to engage in street battles.&#8221; (&#8220;Gaza&#8217;s unfinished business&#8230;&#8221;, p. 3). 
<b>316</b> Israeli armed forces reportedly lost 10 soldiers in combat between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, with 
dozens of soldiers wounded. Four of the Israeli dead appear to have been killed by friendly fire (Cordesman, op. cit., 
p. 57).

trapped civilian houses were a frequently used tactic.<b>319</b> According to the Israeli Government, 
&#8220;because roads and buildings were often mined, IDF forces had to target them to protect 
themselves&#8221;.<b>320</b> 
</p>
<p>463. While, in the light of the above reports, the Mission does not discount the use of booby 
traps by the Palestinian armed groups, it has no basis to conclude that civilian lives were put at 
risk, as none of the reports record the presence of civilians in or near the houses in which booby 
traps are alleged to have been set.   
</p>
<p><b>C. Use of mosques to launch attacks against the Israeli armed  
forces or to store weapons 
</b></p>
<p>464. The Israeli Government alleges that &#8220;Hamas abused the protection accorded to places of 
worship, making a practice of storing weapons in mosques&#8221;. This assertion is supported by 
pictures of Israeli soldiers in a room amid weaponry, including anti-tank weapons, which are 
alleged to have been taken upon discovery of a weapons cache in a Jabaliyah mosque during the 
military operations.<b>321</b> The Mission notes that Israeli soldiers speaking at the Rabin Academy 
&#8220;Fighters&#8217; Talk&#8221; recount coming under fire from Palestinian combatants positioned in a 
mosque.<b>322</b>  
</p>
<p>465. Although the Mission was not able to investigate the allegation of the use of mosques 
generally by Palestinian groups for storing weapons, it did investigate the incident of a missile 
attack by the Israeli armed forces against al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabaliyah 
camp, in which at least 15 people were killed and 40 injured on 3 January 2009 (see chap. XI). 
The Mission found no evidence that this mosque was used for the storage of weapons or any 
military activity by Palestinian armed groups. As far as this mosque is concerned, therefore, the 
Mission found no basis for such an allegation. However, the Mission is unable to make a 
determination regarding the allegation in general nor with respect to any other mosque that was 
attacked by the Israeli armed forces during the military operations.  
</p>
<p><b>D. Misuse of medical facilities and ambulances 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Use of hospitals for military purposes 
</b></p>
<p>466. The Government<b> </b>of Israel alleges that 
</p>
<p>Hamas systematically used medical facilities, vehicles and uniforms as cover for 
terrorist operations, in clear violation of the Law of Armed Conflict. This included the 
extensive use of ambulances bearing the protective emblems of the Red Cross and

</p>
<p>Crescent &#8230; and the use of hospitals and medical infrastructure as headquarters, situation 
rooms, command centres and hiding places.<b>323</b>  
</p>
<p>467. As described in detail in chapter IX, the Mission investigated the attacks against al-Quds 
hospital in Tal el-Hawa, one of the hospitals which were allegedly used for military purposes by 
Palestinian armed groups. This hospital was directly hit by white phosphorous shells and at least 
one high explosive shell on 15 January 2009. The Mission conducted extensive interviews with 
al-Quds hospital staff and others who were in the area at the time of the attack and concluded 
that it was unlikely that there was any armed presence in any of the hospital buildings at that 
time. The Mission also investigated the attacks against al-Wafa Hospital in eastern Gaza City. As 
in the case of al-Quds hospital, after hearing credible testimony from doctors at that hospital, the 
Mission excluded the possibility that there were combatants inside the hospital at the time of the 
attack. However, the Mission did not make any findings with respect to the possible presence of 
Palestinian combatants in the surroundings of the hospital. 
</p>
<p>468. In its report, the Government of Israel states that Hamas used two units and a ground-floor 
wing of al-Shifa hospital, the largest in the Gaza Strip, as a military base.<b>324</b> As its sources, it 
cites an interview with a &#8220;Hamas activist&#8221; captured by Israel and an Italian newspaper<b> </b>article,<b>325</b> 
which in turn bases this assertion on a single anonymous source. The Mission did not investigate 
the case of al-Shifa hospital and is not in a position to make any finding with regard to these 
allegations. 
</p>
<p>469. On the basis of the investigations it has conducted, the Mission did not find any evidence 
to support the allegations made by the Israeli Government.   
</p>
<p><b>2. Ambulances 
</b></p>
<p>470. The Government of Israel alleges that &#8220;Hamas made particular use of ambulances, which 
frequently served as an escape route out of a heated battle with IDF forces.&#8221;<b>326</b>  
</p>
<p>471. The Mission investigated cases in which ambulances were denied access to wounded 
Palestinians. Three cases in particular are described in chapter XI: the attempts of the Palestinian 
Red Crescent Society (PRCS) to evacuate the wounded from the al-Samouni neighbourhood 
south of Gaza City after the attack on the house of Ateya al-Samouni and after the shelling of the 
house of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni; the attempt of an ambulance driver to rescue the daughters of Khalid 
and Kawthar Abd Rabbo in Izbat Abd Rabbo; and the attempt of an ambulance driver to 
evacuate Rouhiyah al-Najjar after she had been hit by an Israeli sniper. In all three cases the 
Mission found, on the facts it gathered, that the Israeli armed forces must have known that there 
were no combatants among the people to be rescued or in the immediate vicinity.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>323</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 171. 
<b>324</b> Ibid., para. 172. &#8220;Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, located his Southern Command centre in 
one of the Shifa Hospital units, while the senior leaders of Hamas stationed themselves in another unit.&#8221;

<b>326</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 176.  </p>

 <p> 
472. The Mission is aware of an interview reportedly given by an ambulance driver to an 
Australian newspaper, in which he describes how Palestinian combatants unsuccessfully tried to 
force him to evacuate them from a house in which they were apparently trapped.<b> </b>The same driver 
reportedly told the journalist that &#8220;Hamas made several attempts to hijack the ambulance fleet of 
al-Quds Hospital&#8221;. He also describes how the PRCS ambulance teams managed to avert this 
misuse of ambulances. According to this report, relied on by the Israeli Government, the 
attempts of Palestinian combatants to exploit ambulances as shield for military operations were 
not successful in the face of the courageous resistance of the PRCS staff members.<b>327</b> 
</p>
<p>473. This is consistent with the statements of representatives of the Palestinian Red Crescent 
Society in Gaza who, in interviews with the Mission, denied that their ambulances were used at 
any time by Palestinian combatants. Finally, in a submission to the Mission, Magen David Adom 
stated that &#8220;there was no use of PRCS ambulances for the transport of weapons or ammunition 
&#8230; [and] there was no misuse of the emblem by PRCS.&#8221;<b>328</b>  
</p>
<p>474. While it is not possible to say that no attempts were ever made by any armed groups to 
use ambulances during the military operations, the Mission has substantial material from the 
investigations it conducted and the enquiries it made to convince it that, if any ambulances were 
used by Palestinian armed groups, it would have been the exception, not the rule. None of the 
ambulance drivers that were directly interviewed by the Mission reported any attempt by the 
armed groups to use the ambulances for any ulterior purpose. Moreover, of the ambulance staff 
members and their volunteer assistants that were killed or injured in the course of their duties, 
none was a member of any armed groups, so far as the Mission is aware. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Forcing civilians to remain in an area for the specific purpose  
of sheltering that area or forces in that area from attack 
</b></p>
<p>475. As discussed in more detail in other parts of the report, the Mission asked numerous 
witnesses in Gaza why they had stayed in their homes in spite of the shelling, bombing and 
Israeli ground invasion. They stated that they had decided to stay put either because they had 
experienced previous incursions and, based on past experience, did not think they would be at 
risk as long as they remained indoors<b>329</b> or because they had no safe place to go.<b>330</b> In additional, 
some witnesses stated that they had chosen to stay because they wished to watch over their 
homes and property.<b>331</b> The Mission did not find any evidence of civilians being forced to remain 
in their houses by Palestinian armed groups. 
</p>

<b>327</b> Ibid., para. 177-179. 
<b>328</b> Communication by Magen David Adom to the Mission, 9 August 2009. Magen David Adom is Israel&#8217;s national 
emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service. It is a member of the International Federation of 
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and has a long-standing cooperation with the Palestinian Red Crescent 
Society. That no PRCS ambulances had been used to transport weapons or fighters was also stated forcefully by a 
Magen David Adom representative to representatives of the Mission in Geneva on 22 July 2009.

<b>330</b> See chap. IX. 
<b>331</b> Interview with Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa, 3 June 2009 (see chap. XIV on the case of Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim 
Halawa).  </p>

 <p> 
476. The Mission&#8217;s attention has been drawn to a well-known incident in which women and 
children followed calls to gather on the roof of the house of a Palestinian man who had been 
informed by the Israeli authorities that his house would be targeted. This incident has been 
documented in video footage in the public domain<b>332</b> and is referred to in submissions received 
by the Mission as evidence of the use of human shields. The Mission notes, however, that the 
incident occurred in 2007. No such incidents are alleged by the Israeli Government with regard 
to the military operations that began on 27 December 2008. The Mission received no reports of 
such incidents from other sources. On the contrary, in one case investigated by the Mission,<b>333</b> 
a Hamas official received a phone call from the Israeli armed forces to the effect that his house 
would soon be targeted. He evacuated the house with his family and alerted the neighbours to the 
imminent threat so that they, too, were able to leave their homes before the missile did indeed 
strike. 
</p>
<p>477. The Mission is also aware of the public statement by Mr. Fathi Hammad, a Hamas 
member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, on 29 February 2009, which is adduced as 
evidence of Hamas&#8217; use of human shields. Mr. Hammad reportedly stated that  
</p>
<p>&#8230; the Palestinian people has developed its [methods] of death seeking. For the Palestinian 
people, death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: 
the elderly excel, the mujahideen excel and the children excel. Accordingly, [Hamas] 
created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the mujahideen, against the 
Zionist bombing machine.<b>334</b>  
</p>
<p>478. Although the Mission finds this statement morally repugnant, it does not consider it to 
constitute evidence that Hamas forced Palestinian civilians to shield military objectives against 
attack. The Government of Israel has not identified any such cases. 
</p>
<p><b>F. Mingling with the civilian population to shield combatants against attack 
</b></p>
<p>479. When military operations take place in areas in which civilians are present, the importance 
of military dress and distinctive signs to distinguish combatants from civilians is all the greater. 
The Mission notes that only one of the incidents it investigated clearly involved the presence of 
Palestinian combatants. In that incident, the witness told the Mission that three fighters trapped 
in his neighbour&#8217;s house were &#8220;wearing military camouflage and headbands of the al-Qassam 
Brigades&#8221;.<b>335</b> 
</p>
<p>480. Reports on the military operations by NGOs suggest that in general members of 
Palestinian armed groups did not wear military uniforms. One report states that after the 
destruction caused by the Israeli air strikes at the start of the military operations, members of al-

<b>335</b> See the case of Mr. Majdi Abd Rabbo in chapter XIV.   </p>

 <p> 
Qassam Brigades abandoned military dress and patrolled streets &#8220;in civilian clothes&#8221;.<b>336</b> A 
second report states that members of the Palestinian armed groups &#8220;also mixed with the civilian 
population, although this would be difficult to avoid in the small and overcrowded Gaza Strip, 
and there is no evidence that they did so with the intent of shielding themselves&#8221;.<b>337</b> 
</p>
<p>481. Finally, on this issue, it is relevant to mention that the Israeli Government has produced 
no visual or other evidence to support its allegation that Palestinian combatants &#8220;mingle 
routinely with civilians in order to cover their movements&#8221;.<b>338</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>482. On the basis of the information it gathered, the Mission finds that there are indications that 
Palestinian armed groups launched rockets from urban areas. The Mission has not been able to 
obtain any direct evidence that this was done with the specific intent of shielding the rocket 
launchers from counterstrokes by the Israeli armed forces. The Mission also notes, however, that 
Palestinian armed groups do not appear to have given Gaza residents sufficient warning of their 
intention to launch rockets from their neighbourhoods to allow them to leave and protect 
themselves against Israeli strikes at the rocket launching sites. The Mission notes that, in any 
event, given the densely populated character of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, once Israeli 
forces gained control of the more open or outlying areas during the first days of the ground 
invasion, most -- if not all -- locations still accessible to Palestinian armed groups were in urban 
areas.  
</p>
<p>483. The Mission finds that the presence of Palestinian armed fighters in urban residential 
areas during the military operations is established. On the basis of the information it gathered, 
the Mission is unable to form an opinion on the exact nature or the intensity of their combat 
activities in urban residential areas that would have placed the civilian population and civilian 
objects at risk of attack. While reports reviewed by the Mission credibly indicate that members 
of Palestinian armed groups were not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from 
civilians, the Mission found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian 
population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack.<b>339</b> 
</p>
<p>484. From the information it gathered, the Mission does not discount the use of booby traps by 
the Palestinian armed groups. The Mission has no basis to conclude that civilian lives were put at 
risk, since none of the reports records the presence of civilians in or near the houses that were 
allegedly booby-trapped. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>336</b> &#8220;Gaza&#8217;s unfinished business&#8230;&#8221;, p. 8. This report also appears to suggest that members of al-Qassam Brigades 
were at least in part engaged in law enforcement and internal security functions rather than in combat with the 
Israeli armed forces.

<b>338</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 186. 
<b>339</b> It has also been reported that specialist Israeli troops operated in Gaza during the military operations in civilian 
attire to liaise with informants and as <i>francs-tireurs;</i> Jane&#8217;s Sentinel Services, Country Risk Assessments &#8211; Israel, 
30 January 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>485. On the basis of its own investigations and statements by United Nations officials, the 
Mission excludes that Palestinian armed groups engaged in combat activities from United 
Nations facilities that were used as shelters during the military operations. The Mission cannot 
discount the possibility that Palestinian armed groups were active in the vicinity of such 
facilities. 
</p>
<p>486. The Mission is unable to make any determination on the general allegation that 
Palestinian armed groups used mosques for military purposes. It notes that, in the one incident it 
investigated of an Israeli attack on a mosque, it found no indication that the mosque was so used.  
</p>
<p>487. On the basis of the investigations it has conducted, the Mission did not find any evidence 
to support the allegations that hospital facilities were used by the Gaza authorities or by 
Palestinian armed groups to shield military activities and that ambulances were used to transport 
combatants or for other military purposes.   
</p>
<p>488. On the basis of the information it gathered, the Mission found no indication that the 
civilian population was forced by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups to remain in areas under 
attack from the Israeli armed forces. 
</p>
<p><b>H. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>489. Customary international humanitarian law establishes that all &#8220;parties to the conflict must 
take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their 
control against the effects of attacks.&#8221;<b>340</b> 
</p>
<p>490. Each party to the conflict must, to the extent feasible, avoid locating military objectives 
within or near densely populated areas.<b>341</b> Each party to the conflict must, to the extent feasible, 
remove civilian persons and objects under its control from the vicinity of military objectives.<b>342</b> 
</p>
<p>491. These rules of customary international law are reflected in article 57 (1) of Additional 
Protocol I: &#8220;In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the 
civilian population, civilians and civilian objects.&#8221; The following paragraphs of article 57 set 
forth the specific precautions to be taken by a party launching an attack.<b>343</b> 
</p>
<p>492. In addition to the general duty to take constant care to spare the civilian population in the 
conduct of military operations, international humanitarian law establishes a specific prohibition 
against the use of civilians as human shields. Article 28 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
specifically addresses this issue: &#8220;The presence of a protected person may not be used to render 
certain points or areas immune from military operations&#8221;. This is reinforced by article 51 (7) of 
Additional Protocol I:  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>340</b> <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law&#8230;</i>, rule 22. 
<b>341</b> Ibid., rule 23. 
<b>342</b> Ibid., rule 24. 
<b>343</b> See chap. IX.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall 
not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in 
particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or 
impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of 
the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military 
objectives from attacks or to shield military operations. 
</p>
<p>These provisions reflect rules of customary law.<b>344</b> 
</p>
<p>493. The Mission finds it useful to clarify what is meant, from a legal perspective, by using 
civilians or a civilian population as a human shield. Parties to a conflict are not permitted to use a 
civilian population or individual civilians in order to render certain points or areas immune from 
military operations. It is not in dispute that both Palestinian armed groups and Israeli forces were 
fighting within an area populated by civilians. Fighting within civilian areas is not, by itself, 
sufficient for a finding that a party is using the civilian population living in the area of the 
fighting as a human shield. As the words of article 57 (1) show (&#8220;shall not be used to render&#8221;, 
&#8220;in order to attempt to shield&#8221;), an intention to use the civilian population in order to shield an 
area from military attack is required. 
</p>
<p>494. From the information available to it, the Mission found no evidence to suggest that 
Palestinian armed groups either directed civilians to areas where attacks were being launched or 
forced civilians to remain within the vicinity of the attacks.  
</p>
<p>495. The reports received by the Mission suggest that it is likely that the Palestinian armed 
groups did not at all times adequately distinguish themselves from the civilian population among 
whom the hostilities were being conducted. Their failure to distinguish themselves from the 
civilian population by distinctive signs is not a violation of international law in itself, but would 
have denied them some of the legal privileges afforded to combatants. What international law 
demands, however, is that those engaged in combat take all feasible precautions to protect 
civilians in the conduct of their hostilities. The Mission found no evidence that members of 
Palestinian armed groups engaged in combat in civilian dress. It can, therefore, not find a 
violation of the obligation not to endanger the civilian population in this respect. 
</p>
<p>496. The conduct of hostiliti<b>e</b>s in built-up areas does not, of itself, constitute a violation of 
international law. However, launching attacks - whether of rockets and mortars at the population 
of southern Israel or at the Israeli armed forces inside Gaza - close to civilian or protected 
buildings constitutes a failure to take all feasible precautions. In cases where this occurred, the 
Palestinian armed groups would have unnecessarily exposed the civilian population of Gaza to 
the inherent dangers of the military operations taking place around them. This would have 
constituted a violation of the customary rules of international humanitarian law referred to 
above. It would also have constituted a violation of the right to life and physical integrity of the 
civilians thereby endangered. 
</p>
<p>497. Although the situations investigated by the Mission did not establish the use of mosques 
for military purposes or to shield military activities, the Mission cannot exclude that this might 
                                                 
<b>344</b> <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law&#8230;</i>, rule 97. </p>

 <p> 
have occurred in other cases. As far as hospitals and United Nations facilities are concerned, 
the Mission found that it could not exclude that Palestinian armed groups engaged in combat 
activities in the vicinity of these protected sites. The Mission wishes to emphasize that the 
launching of attacks from or in the vicinity of civilian buildings and protected areas are serious 
violations of the obligation on the armed groups to take constant care to protect civilians from 
the inherent dangers created by military operations. 
</p>
<p>498. The Mission asked the Gaza authorities to provide information on the sites from where the 
Palestinian armed groups had launched attacks against Israel and against the Israeli armed forces 
in Gaza. The Mission similarly asked whether, to their knowledge, civilian buildings and 
mosques had been used to store weapons. In their response, the Gaza authorities stated that they 
had no information on the activities of the Palestinian armed groups or about the storage of 
weapons in mosques and civilian buildings. The Mission does not find this response to be 
entirely plausible. The Mission notes, more importantly, that, whether the answer reflects the 
reality or not, the Gaza authorities are obliged under international law to control the activities of 
armed groups operating on the territory under their control.<b>345</b> If they failed to take the necessary 
measures to prevent the Palestinian armed groups from endangering the civilian population by 
conducting hostilities in a manner incompatible with international humanitarian law, they would 
bear responsibility for the damage done to the civilians living in Gaza.  
</p>
<p><b>IX.  OBLIGATION ON ISRAEL TO TAKE FEASIBLE PRECAUTIONS TO  
PROTECT CIVILIAN POPULATION AND CIVILIAN OBJECTS IN GAZA 
</b></p>
<p>499. This chapter focuses on incidents where the Mission considered compliance by Israel with 
its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention and customary rules of international law in 
relation to taking feasible precautions. In particular, it considers whether everything feasible was 
done to verify that objectives to be attacked were neither civilians nor civilian objects and were 
not subject to special protection, whether all feasible precautions were taken in respect of the 
choice of weapons used and whether the military advantage sought was excessive in relation to 
the expected loss of civilian life or civilian objects. Before entering into specific incidents, it 
considers the obligation to provide warnings in relation to attacks. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Warnings 
</b></p>
<p>500. The Israeli Government has stated that it took the following steps to warn the civilian 
population of Gaza:<b>346</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Israeli armed forces made 20,000 calls on 27 December and 10,000 
on 29 December 2008; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 300,000 warning notes were dropped over the whole of the Gaza Strip 
on 28 December; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 80,000 leaflets were dropped in Rafah on 29 December; 
                                                 
<b>345</b> See chap. IV. 
<b>346</b> http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2009/IDF_warns_Gaza_population_7-Jan-2009.htm.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the context of the beginning of ground operations on 3 January, 
300,000 leaflets were dropped in the entire Gaza Strip, especially in the 
northern and eastern parts;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 5 January, 300,000 leaflets were dropped in Gaza City, Khan Yunis 
and Rafah; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In total some 165,000 telephone calls were made throughout the military 
operations;<b>347</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In total some 2,500,000 leaflets were dropped.<b>348</b> 
501. In addition to these measures, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the 
telephone calls were both direct calls and pre-recorded messages, that it made radio broadcasts, 
and that it developed a practice of dropping apparently light explosives on rooftops (referred to 
by some as &#8220;roof-knocking&#8221;).<b>349</b>  
</p>
<p>502. The Mission has reviewed the text of several of the leaflets dropped by the Israeli armed 
forces and listened to all of the messages recorded on the website of the Israeli Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.<b>350</b> It accepts that Israel dropped leaflets, made phone calls, left recorded 
messages and dropped smaller explosives on roofs as stated by the Israeli Government. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Telephone calls 
</b></p>
<p>503. The Mission received first-hand information about some of these methods in its interviews 
with witnesses in Gaza. In the report on the attack at al-Fakhura Street junction (see chap. X), the 
Mission notes the credible account of Mr. Abu Askar of the telephone warning he received as a 
result of which he was able to evacuate up to 40 people from his and other houses. He received 
that call at around 1.45 a.m. and Israeli forces destroyed his house with a missile strike seven 
minutes later.  
</p>
<p>504. The Mission is also aware of circumstances in which telephone warnings may have 
caused fear and confusion. Al-Bader Flour Mills Co. (see chap. XIII) received two recorded 
messages indicating the mill was to be destroyed, but neither of these was acted upon. Five days 
later the mill was struck in the early hours of the morning with no warning whatsoever. The 
owners of the business and their staff suffered anxiety by having to evacuate the premises on two 
occasions as a result of receiving such messages when no strikes took place.

.With regard to roof-knocking, see, for instance, Cordesman, op. cit., p. 13 (the Israeli armed forces &#8220;developed 
small 10-20 kilogram bombs that could be used as both warning shots &#8211; sometimes referred to as knocking on the 
roof&#8221;&#8230;). 
<b>350</b> http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2009/IDF_warns_Gaza_population_7-Jan-2009.htm. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>505. Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that more than 165,000 telephone calls were 
made issuing warnings. The Mission has received information that there were at least two types 
of telephone calls. One was a direct and specific warning, as was received by Mr. Abu Askar. 
The other was a more generic, recorded message, such as the type received by al-Bader Flour 
Mills. The Mission does not know and, as far as it can determine, Israel has not indicated what 
proportion of the 30,000 telephone calls was pre-recorded and more generic and what proportion 
was specific.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Roof-knocking 
</b></p>
<p>506. The Israeli Government describes that in certain circumstances its armed forces fired 
&#8220;warning shots from light weapons that hit the roofs of the designated targets&#8221;&#8212;a practice 
referred to as roof-knocking. The Israeli Government indicates that this practice was used when 
it appeared that people had remained in their houses despite being given some previous 
warning.<b>351 </b>It is not clear whether this was the only circumstance in which this method was 
employed. The Mission heard that in the al-Daya incident (see chap. XI) the Israeli Government 
claims to have made such a warning shot, albeit to the wrong house.<b>352</b> The Mission also saw in 
the Sawafeary house (see chap. XIII) that a missile had penetrated the rear of the house on the 
wall near the ceiling, gone through an internal wall and exited through the wall at the front of the 
house near the windows. At the time (around 10 p.m. on 3 January 2009) there were several 
family members in the house, who happened to be lying down. The Mission cannot say what size 
of weapon was used on this occasion, although it was sufficiently powerful to penetrate three 
walls, or whether it was intended as a warning.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Radio broadcasts and leaflet dropping 
</b></p>
<p>507. The radio broadcasts that the Mission listened to appeared to be generic. For example, on 
3 January 2009 a radio broadcast made the following points: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Gaza residents are welcome to receive food and medical supplies, 
delivered via the Rafah, Karni and Kerem Shalom passages, at the 
UNRWA centres throughout the Gaza Strip;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Israel calls on the population to move to city centres for its own 
safety.<b>353</b>  
</p>
<p>This warning preceded the ground phase of the military operations. Its language clearly indicates 
that UNRWA centres should be regarded as places of safety and civilians may collect food from 
them. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>351</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 264.  
<b>352</b> Note that a witness has indicated that an elderly man was killed when struck by a missile some 10 minutes before 
the al-Daya house was struck. The Mission has also noted significant doubts on the version of events presented by 
the Israeli Government on this case, including on the issue of the warning shot. 
<b>353</b> http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2009/IDF_warns_Gaza_population_7-Jan-2009.htm.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>508. Leaflets dropped appear to fall into a number of categories. One leaflet did not deal with 
attacks on a particular place but on the storage of weapons and ammunition: 
</p>
<p>To the residents of the Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The IDF will act against any movements and elements conducting 
terrorist activities against the residents of the State of Israel; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The IDF will hit and destroy any building or site containing ammunition 
and weapons; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As of the publication of this announcement, anyone having ammunition 
and/or weapons in his home is risking his life and must leave the place 
for the safety of his own life and that of his family; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; You have been warned.<b>354</b> 
509. In some areas specific warnings were sometimes given. One example of a sufficiently 
specific warning is that issued to the residents of Rafah: 
</p>
<p>Because your houses are used by Hamas for military equipment smuggling and 
storing, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) will attack the areas between Sea Street and till 
the Egyptian border&#8230; 
</p>
<p>All the Residents of the following neighbourhoods: Block O &#8211; al-Barazil 
neighbourhood &#8211; al-Shu&#8217;ara&#8217;- Keshta- al-Salam neighbourhood should evacuate their 
houses till beyond Sea Street. The evacuation enters into force from now till tomorrow at 
8 a.m. 
</p>
<p>For your safety and for the safety of your children, apply this notice.<b>355</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>510. Whether a warning is deemed to be effective is a complex matter depending on the facts 
and circumstances prevailing at the time, the availability of the means for providing the warning 
and the evaluation of the costs to the purported military advantage. 
</p>
<p>511. Israel was in a strong position to prepare and issue effective warnings. The preparations 
for its military operations were &#8220;extensive and thorough.&#8221;<b>356</b> Israel had intimate knowledge and 
</p>
<p>

States (30 April 2009), p. 241. Note a similarly specific kind of warning issued to the residents of al-Shujaeiyah 
(&#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, footnote 225). 
<b>356</b> Prime Minister Olmert, press conference on 27 December 2008, available at: http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/

 <p> 
sophisticated up-to-date intelligence in its planning. It had the means to use the landlines and 
mobile telephone networks. It had complete domination of Gaza&#8217;s airspace. In terms of the 
practical capabilities of issuing warnings, it is perhaps difficult to imagine more propitious 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>512. The Mission accepts that the element of surprise that was sought in the initial strikes 
might well have provided a degree of justification for not giving any advance notice of the time 
the strikes would take place or the buildings that would be struck.<b>357</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(a) The question of whether civilians could be expected to respond to the warnings to 
leave their homes 
</b></p>
<p>513. The Mission recognizes that leaflets dropped from the air can have some direct benefit in 
assisting the civilian population to get out of harm&#8217;s way. The effectiveness will depend on three 
considerations: the clarity of the message, the credibility of the threat and the possibility of those 
receiving the warning taking action to escape the threat.  
</p>
<p>514. The Mission has already cited one kind of leaflet which referred to the likelihood of 
attacks on locations storing weapons and ammunitions. At the beginning of the land-air phase 
of the operations, the Israeli armed forces also dropped leaflets and made broadcasts advising 
people to move towards city centres.  
</p>
<p>515. There had been an intense aerial campaign from 27 December 2008 until 3 January 2009 
that had seen hundreds of buildings destroyed in built-up areas of city centres. Civilians not 
living in city centres were being asked to leave their homes to go to places that as far as they 
could reasonably assess were already in much more danger than they were in their own homes. 
In order for the warning to be effective there had to be an objective basis to believe that they 
would be safer elsewhere. The Mission does not consider that such an objective evaluation could 
reasonably have been made by civilians in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>516. During its meetings with people in Gaza the Mission was told on several occasions of the 
sense that there was &#8220;nowhere to go&#8221;. The nature of the attacks in the first week had caused deep 
shock. The widespread attacks created a dilemma not only about where to go but about whether 
it was safe to leave at all. 
</p>
<p>517. Even if in the minds of the Israeli armed forces it would have been safer, from 3 January 
onwards, for civilians to go to city centres, nothing that had happened in the preceding week 
could lead those civilians to the same conclusion given the widespread destruction of areas and 
buildings. The events that occurred in those locations after 3 January appear to support the view 
that going to the city centres offered little guarantee of safety. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>357</b> The recognition of a legitimate element of surprise does not necessarily mean that the Mission accepts the targets 
chosen were legally justifiable in the circumstances. That matter is dealt with in different parts of this report. </p>

 <p> 
<b>(b) Events in the city centre after the warning to go there was issued 
</b></p>
<p>518. On 3 January 2009 the attack on al-Maqadmah mosque took place in a built-up area in 
central Jabaliyah. Three days after the 3 January warning was given to move to central locations 
and attend United Nations centres there was the Israeli mortar attack immediately outside a large 
United Nations shelter killing at least 35 people in Jabaliyah at al-Fakhura Street.<b>358</b>  
</p>
<p>519. Following the attack in al-Fakhura Street, the Director of Operations in Gaza of UNRWA, 
John Ging, stated in a press conference on 7 January 2009: &#8220;There is nowhere safe in Gaza. 
Everyone here is terrorized and traumatized.&#8221;<b>359</b>  
</p>
<p>520. On 15 January the UNRWA compound in Tal el-Hawa (Gaza City) was seriously 
damaged when it was struck by white phosphorous. Between 600 and 700 civilians were 
sheltering there at the time and were put in grave danger. The same day the nearby al-Quds 
hospital was struck directly by a number of missiles, including white phosphorous shells, again 
putting staff and patients in great danger (see sect. C below). 
</p>
<p>521. The day after the UNRWA compound was hit, John Ging repeated that what had 
happened there had happened throughout Gaza. He said that the United Nations and the civilian 
population were &#8220;all in the same boat&#8221; and that nobody could be said to be safe in Gaza.<b>360</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) The inference that those who did not go to the city centres must be combatants </b></p>
<p>522. The warning to go to city centres came at the start of the ground invasion. In the Mission&#8217;s 
view it was unreasonable to assume, in the circumstances, that civilians would indeed leave their 
homes. As a consequence, the conclusion that allegedly formed part of the logic of soldiers on 
the ground that those who had stayed put had to be combatants was wholly unwarranted.<b>361</b> 
There are many reasons why people may not have responded. In several cases the Mission heard 
from witnesses about people who were physically disabled, too frail or deaf so that it was 
difficult or impossible to respond to the warning. In other cases, as outlined above, civilians who 
                                                 
<b>358</b> The Mission concludes elsewhere that this attack was indiscriminate in nature (see chap. X).

<b>361</b> See, for example, statements made by soldiers in a seminar in Tel Aviv: &#8220;At first we were told to break into a 
house&#8230; Go upstairs and shoot every person we see&#8230; The upper echelons said this was allowed because anyone 
remaining in this area, inside Gaza City, is incriminated, a terrorist, who did not escape.&#8221;

Testimonies from Operation Cast Lead, Gaza 2009</i>, available at: http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/oferet 
/ENGLISH_oferet.pdf. Throughout the report soldiers indicate that the rules of engagement employed meant that no 
consideration was given to the idea that there may be &#8220;innocents&#8221; and that in the case of any doubt whatsoever 
soldiers were to shoot. (&#8220;That too was mentioned, that if we see something suspect and shoot, better to hit an 
innocent that hesitate to target an enemy&#8221;, p. 50; &#8220;if anything arouses our suspicion, we mustn&#8217;t hesitate because the 
enemy hides among civilians&#8221;, p. 51.) Note also the discussion on &#8220;wet entry&#8221; and &#8220;dry entry&#8221; (pp. 14-15. This 
discussion indicates that, in approaching a house, missiles, tank fire, grenades and machine gun fire would be used. 
This method of approach is borne out in the case of the Juha family. Family members were fired upon when 
congregating in a room downstairs in their house in Zeytoun. See chap. XI. </p>

 <p> 
could have responded may have had legitimate reasons not to do so. The issuance of warning is 
one measure that should be taken wherever possible. The fact that a warning was issued does 
not, however, relieve a commander or his subordinates from taking all other feasible measures to 
distinguish between civilians and combatants.<b>362</b> 
</p>
<p>523. Israeli armed forces had created the circumstances in which civilians could not reasonably 
believe the city centres were safe. An effective warning had to make clear why, even in those 
circumstances, it was better for civilians to leave than to stay in their homes. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Israel&#8217;s review 
</b></p>
<p>524. According to press reports,<b>363</b> military sources, including representatives from the military 
prosecution's international law department, have agreed that more specific information, such as 
more accurate timetables for strikes to be carried out and escape routes, should be given in 
warnings. The press report goes on to say: &#8220;Fliers distributed by the IDF from now on will also 
be more detailed in order to make it clear to civilians that their lives are in danger and give them 
a chance to flee. It was also determined in the hearing that the military made multiple efforts to 
prevent civilian casualties in January's offensive.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>525. The Mission cannot confirm if such press reports are accurate but notes two things. 
Firstly, any improvements in practice in this regard are to be welcomed. Secondly, the changes, 
if reported correctly, appear to address the matters that have been touched on in this section. 
Those were matters that could not be considered in any way as unforeseeable in the 
circumstances at the time the warnings were in fact issued. While improvements are welcome in 
this case, it would also appear to indicate that circumstances almost certainly permitted much 
better warnings to be given than was the case.  
</p>
<p><b>6. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>526. Chapter IV of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions addresses the issue of 
precautionary measures that must be taken. Article 57 (1) states that &#8220;in the conduct of military 
operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian 
objects.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>527. Article 57 (2) (c) requires that &#8220;effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which 
may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>528. The Mission regards both these provisions to be norms of customary international law.<b>364</b> 
In addition, Israel appears to consider itself bound by the obligation to provide effective 
warnings under customary law. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>362</b> Note in particular the testimony of Prof. Michael Newton to the Mission at the Geneva public hearings on 
7 July 2009. See http://www.un.org/webcast/unhrc/archive.asp?go=090707.  
<b>363</b> See <i>Ynetnews</i>, &#8220;IDF to give better warnings before attacks&#8221;, 29 September 2007. 
<b>364</b> According to ICRC, article 57 (1) codifies the principle of precautions in attack and article 57 (2) (c) is a rule of 
customary international law applicable to international and non-international armed conflict. <i>Customary 
International Humanitarian Law&#8230;</i>, pp. 51 and 62. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>529. The determination of whether the circumstances permit a warning must be made in the 
context of a good-faith attempt to adhere to the underlying duty to minimize death and injury to 
civilians or damage to civilian objects. The key limitation on the application of the rule is if the 
military advantage of surprise would be undermined by giving a warning. The same calculation 
of proportionality has to be made here as in other circumstances. The question is whether the 
injury or damage done to civilians or civilian objects by not giving a warning is excessive in 
relation to the advantage to be gained by the element of surprise for the particular operation. 
There may be other circumstances when a warning is simply not possible.  
</p>
<p>530. Article 57 (2) (c) requires the warning to be effective. The Mission understands by this 
that it must reach those who are likely to be in danger from the planned attack, it must give them 
sufficient time to react to the warning, it must clearly explain what they should do to avoid harm 
and it must be a credible warning. The warning also has to be clear so that the civilians are not in 
doubt that it is indeed addressed to them. As far as possible, warnings should state the location to 
be affected and where the civilians should seek safety. A credible warning means that civilians 
should be in no doubt that it is intended to be acted upon, as a false alarm of hoax may 
undermine future warnings, putting civilians at risk. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Pre-recorded generic telephone calls </b></p>
<p>531. As regards the generic nature of some pre-recorded phone messages, the Mission finds 
that these lacked credibility and clarity, and generated fear and uncertainty. In substance, there is 
little difference between telephone messages and leaflets that are not specific. The Mission takes 
the view that pre-recorded messages with generic information may not be considered generally 
effective. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Warning shots delivered to roofs 
</b></p>
<p>532. The Mission is doubtful whether roof-knocking should be understood as a warning as 
such.<b>365</b> In the context of a large-scale military operation including aerial attacks, civilians cannot 
be expected to know whether a small explosion is a warning of an impending attack or part of an 
actual attack. In relation to the incident at the Sawafeary house recounted above, the Mission 
cannot say for certain if this missile was meant to warn or to kill. It notes that, if this was meant 
as a warning shot, it has to be deemed reckless in the extreme. 
</p>
<p>533. The legal requirement is for an effective warning to be given. This means that it should 
not require civilians to guess the meaning of the warning. The technique of using small 
explosives to frighten civilians into evacuation, even if the intent is to warn, may cause terror 
and confuse the affected civilians.  
</p>
<p>534. The Mission does not have sufficient information to assess the accuracy of the Israeli 
Government&#8217;s claim that the warning shot method was used only when previous warnings 
(leaflets, broadcasts or telephone calls) had not been acted upon. However, in many 
circumstances it is not clear why another call could not be made if it had already been possible to 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>365</b> The Mission notes and agrees with a similar position set out by Diakonia in its report on Operation Cast Lead of 
30 June 2009, p. 9. </p>

 <p> 
call the inhabitants of a house. The Mission notes that these warnings all took place in situations 
where the view appears to have been reached that those in the house are civilians or 
predominantly civilians. If the choice is between making another call or firing a light missile that 
carries with it a significant risk of killing those civilians, the Mission is not convinced that it 
would not have been feasible to make another call to confirm that a strike was about to be made. 
</p>
<p>535. Finally, apart from the issue of fear and ambiguity, there is the question of danger. The 
idea that an attack, however limited in itself, can be understood as an effective warning in the 
meaning of article 57 (2) (c) is rejected by the Mission. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Leaflets 
</b></p>
<p>536. The leaflets and radio broadcasts that told people to leave their homes and head towards 
city centres were in most cases lacking in specificity and clarity: people could not be certain that 
the warnings were directed at them in particular, since they were being issued as far as they 
could tell to almost everyone, and they could not tell when they should leave since there was 
rarely an indication of when attacks would take place. Furthermore, in the circumstances created 
by the Israeli armed forces, people could not reasonably be expected to flee to what appeared to 
be even less safe places on the basis of such non-specific warnings. Therefore, the Mission does 
not consider such warnings to have been the most effective possible in the circumstances and, 
indeed, doubts that many were effective at all. 
</p>
<p><b>7. Conclusions </b></p>
<p>537. While noting the statements of the significant efforts made by the Israeli armed forces to 
issue warnings, the sole question for the Mission to consider at this point is whether the different 
kinds of warnings issued can be considered as sufficiently effective in the circumstances to 
constitute compliance with article 57 (2) (c).  
</p>
<p>538. The Mission accepts that the warnings issued by the Israeli armed forces in some cases 
encouraged numbers of people to flee and get out of harm&#8217;s way in respect of the ground 
invasion, but this is not sufficient to consider them as generally effective.  
</p>
<p>539. The Mission considers that some of the leaflets with specific warnings, such as those that 
Israel indicates were issued in Rafah and al-Shujaeiyah, may be regarded as effective. However, 
the Mission does not consider that general messages telling people to leave wherever they were 
and go to city centres, in the particular circumstances of this military campaign, meet the 
threshold of effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>540. The Mission regards some specific telephone calls to have provided effective warnings 
but treats with caution the figure of 165,000 calls made. Without sufficient information to know 
how many of these were specific, it cannot say to what extent such efforts might be regarded as 
effective. 
</p>
<p>541. The Mission does not consider the technique of firing missiles into or on top of buildings 
as capable of being described as a warning, much less an effective warning. It is a dangerous 
practice and in essence constitutes a form of attack rather than a warning.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>542. The Mission is also mindful of several incidents it has investigated where civilians were 
killed or otherwise harmed and met with humiliation and degrading treatment by Israeli soldiers, 
while fleeing from locations about which some form of warning was issued. The effectiveness of 
the warnings has to be assessed in the light of the overall circumstances that prevailed and the 
subjective view of conditions that the civilians concerned would take in deciding upon their 
response to the warning.  
</p>
<p><b>B. UNRWA compound, Gaza City 
</b></p>
<p>543. The field office compound of UNRWA is situated in the southern Rimal area of Gaza 
City. On the morning of 15 January 2009 it came under sustained shelling from the Israeli armed 
forces. At least three high explosive shells and seven white phosphorous container shells struck 
the workshop and warehouse area of the compound causing massive damage as a result of 
ensuing fires. Five of the shells exploded in the compound including all three high explosive 
shells. Two complete container shells of white phosphorous were retrieved. Five additional white 
phosphorous shells were retrieved but not in their complete form. These five shells deposited 
large amounts of the phosphorus wedges contained in the shells into the compound, if not in fact 
all of the wedges. At least three shells hit the Gaza Training Centre and caused light injuries to 
one staff member. At the time of the attack there were between 600 and 700 civilians sheltering 
in the compound. The remaining shells hit the area in and around the fuel depot and workshop. 
</p>
<p>544. The Mission has inspected the site and interviewed several of the people who were present 
at the time. It has also had access to detailed written materials produced by the UNRWA office 
in relation to its inquiries into the incident. It has furthermore addressed questions to the 
Government of Israel regarding the use of white phosphorous munitions to strike within the 
UNRWA compound and the direct military advantage pursued by their use under the 
circumstances, but has received no reply. 
</p>
<p>545. The Mission will not here repeat all of the details of the attack that are recounted 
accurately in a number of other reports.<b>366</b> It will, however, join with others in noting the bravery 
of two staff members in particular in dealing with the white phosphorous in close proximity to 
thousands of litres of fuel stored in tankers. Had the fuel depot exploded, it would have caused 
untold deaths and damage. The swift and courageous actions of these two people at huge 
personal risk may have prevented a disaster of gigantic proportions and their efforts should be so 
recognized. 
</p>
<p>546. In this particular case, the Mission&#8217;s interest lay in what was known by the Israeli armed 
forces at the time, what steps were feasible to reduce the massive risk to civilian life and why 
were these steps not taken. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>366</b> For instance, Secretary-General&#8217;s summary of the Report of the United Nations Headquarters Board of Inquiry 
into certain incidents in the Gaza Strip between 27 December 2008 and 19 January 2009 and reports by Human 
Rights Watch (<i>Rain of Fire: Israel&#8217;s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorous in Gaza</i> (March 2009), pp. 41 ff) and 
Amnesty International (<i>Israel/Gaza: Operation &#8220;Cast Lead&#8221;: 22 days of death and destruction</i> (London, 2009), p. 31). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. The immediate context 
</b></p>
<p>547. Shelling had been ongoing since the night of 14 January. The areas of Tal el-Hawa and 
southern Rimal had come under attack. There had been shelling close to the UNRWA compound 
at various points during the night. In the morning of 15 January staff in the UNRWA compound 
were instructed to remain inside as much as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>2. The risks 
</b></p>
<p>548. The UNRWA compound contained, among other things, a substantial fuel depot. The 
depot has an underground storage facility, which at the time had about 120,000 litres of fuel. 
Fuel tankers parked above ground had around 49,000 litres of fuel in them. In addition to the 
obvious and immediate risk of fire in these circumstances, the compound also stored large 
quantities of medical supplies, food, clothing and blankets in the warehouses. 
</p>
<p>549. Conservative estimates suggest that between 600 and 700 civilians were taking shelter in 
the compound at that time.  
</p>
<p>550. The principal and immediate risk was, therefore, of what might have been a catastrophic 
fire caused by the ignition of the fuel in the direct vicinity of the site where hundreds of civilians 
had sought shelter directly in response to the Israeli warnings of 3 January 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>3. The strikes 
</b></p>
<p>551. The Mission considers the witnesses it interviewed about this incident to be reliable 
and credible. After careful analysis of the information it received, the Mission finds that the 
following can be established with a high degree of certainty: 
</p>
<p>552. Three high explosive shells hit the compound. Two landed on the Gaza Training Centre 
and one landed in the car park. Complete or substantial parts of seven white phosphorous 
container shells landed in the compound. The wedges in these container shells were either 
discharged totally or very substantially in the compound. One shell, which was seen directly by 
a senior international staff member with many years&#8217; of active military service, detonated on 
impact or only a very short distance from the ground.  
</p>
<p>553. One high explosive shell struck the Gaza Training Centre&#8217;s yard and was witnessed by at 
least two guards and left a crater. 
</p>
<p>554. Two high explosive shells landed on the roof of the education building. There are two 
large holes in the roof and shrapnel all around. 
</p>
<p>555. A white phosphorous container shell struck the Project and Logistics Division Building. 
</p>
<p>556. One white phosphorous container shell hit the back of a vehicle in the spare parts store, 
coming through a wall on the south side at a high point. This is believed to have caused the fire 
to start in the workshop area. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>557. One white phosphorous container shell or a substantial part thereof came through a wire 
fence at the top of the southern boundary of the compound near the spare parts and workshop 
area, causing damage to a vehicle there. 
</p>
<p>558. One white phosphorous container shell landed in the workshop embedding itself in the 
concrete. 
</p>
<p>559. One white phosphorous container shell or a substantial part thereof came through the roof 
of the painting bay. 
</p>
<p>560. One white phosphorous container shell or a substantial part thereof struck a manhole 
cover near small warehouses storing food. 
</p>
<p>561. One white phosphorous container shell struck near a generator on concrete ground. 
</p>
<p>562. Seven of the ten strikes occurred in an area smaller than a standard football pitch. The 
whole area, including the three other strikes on or near the Gaza Training Centre, would be no 
more than two football pitches. 
</p>
<p>563. The precise moment when each of the strikes occurred cannot be stated with certainty but 
all occurred between 8 a.m. and 12 noon. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Communications and responses 
</b></p>
<p>564. For the purposes of liaison with the Israeli authorities, the counterpart of the United 
Nations Department of Safety and Security (DSS) is the Coordinator of Government Activities 
in the Territories (COGAT). This is a unit within the Israeli Ministry of Defense. In Gaza the 
day-to-day liaison and coordination activity with COGAT is carried out by the Coordination and 
Liaison Administration (CLA), located on the Israeli side of the Erez crossing. CLA is the 
military unit responsible for the coordination of access to and from Gaza in connection with the 
facilitation of civilian and humanitarian needs. DSS at the time routinely liaised with COGAT 
through CLA. 
</p>
<p>565. From 27 December until 2 January DSS communicated with COGAT/CLA by telephone 
and by e-mail. The Mission is in possession of the names of the Israeli officers with whom such 
contact was established and maintained. In the second phase of the conflict, COGAT 
intervention increased and new personnel added to their capacity. Two new contacts were added 
to those already established. 
</p>
<p>566. The most comprehensive list of relevant data was forwarded to COGAT/CLA on 3 April 
2008, including all United Nations installations. As of 29 December 2008 COGAT/CLA had 
been provided with an updated list of the coordinates of all United Nations offices, international 
residences and pre-identified possible emergency shelters. Throughout the military operations 
DSS was in almost daily communication, providing detailed information on coordinates of 
relevant emergency shelters and distributions centres. The Mission has been shown the relevant 
log of all such communications. 
</p>
<p>567. On the day in question DSS made at least seven phone calls to COGAT/CLA counterparts 
between 8.14 a.m. and 1.45 p.m. These conversations addressed, for instance, the proximity of </p>

 <p> 
Israeli fire, the damage done to UNRWA installations, requests that fire be redirected or 
withdrawn, and coordination for the removal of fuel tankers.  
</p>
<p>568. Despite calls beginning at 8.14 a.m., it does not appear that COGAT/CLA was able to 
confirm that contact had been established with the relevant brigade until 11.06 a.m. 
</p>
<p>569. Other information available to the Mission shows that the Deputy Director of Operations 
of UNRWA, who was in Jerusalem at the time was engaged in frequent calls to senior Israeli 
officials. He had received a call at 9 a.m. from John Ging, the Director of Operations at 
UNRWA, advising him of the shelling near the compound and had been asked to demand that 
the shelling be stopped by calling the Israeli armed forces&#8217; Humanitarian Coordination Centre 
(HCC) in Tel Aviv. He made a total of 26 calls to the head of HCC or to his assistant as well as 
to members of COGAT/CLA. He was assured on a number of occasions by the head of HCC that 
shelling had stopped, but it was clear when he relayed this message back to Gaza that shelling 
was continuing. The Deputy Director had warned of the immediate risk to the fuel depot and 
those seeking shelter. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Weapons used 
</b></p>
<p>570. Analysis of the shells used in the strikes that hit the UNRWA compound indicates clearly 
that at least seven shells were white phosphorous shells, three of which were complete and four 
of which were very substantial components of the shells. Military experts indicate that in all 
probability these shells were fired from a 155 mm Howitzer. 
</p>
<p>571. Three other missiles were determined clearly by UNRWA military experts to have been 
high explosive missiles. 
</p>
<p><b>6. The Israeli response 
</b></p>
<p>572. On 15 January the Israeli Defence Minister, Ehud Barak, said the attack had been a &#8220;grave 
error&#8221; and apologized, according to the United Nations Secretary&#8211;General, who had spoken with 
him earlier in a meeting in Tel Aviv. The same day the Israeli Prime Minister said that it was 
&#8220;absolutely true that we were attacked from that place, but the consequences are very sad and we 
apologize for it&#8221;. The Israeli Welfare and Social Services Minister made subsequent statements 
suggesting there had been gunfire directed at Israeli troops from adjacent premises. He said it 
was shrapnel from the return fire that entered the UNRWA compound causing the blaze.<b>367</b> 
</p>
<p>573. On 22 April the summary of the conclusions of the Israeli armed forces&#8217; investigations 
reported as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8230; the IDF deployed a smoke screen in order to protect a tank force operating in 
the neighbourhood from Hamas anti-tank crews who had positioned themselves 
adjacent to the UNRWA headquarters. The smoke screen was intended to block 
the terrorists' field of view. Information received by the IDF shows that the smoke 
screen did assist in protecting the force and prevented precise anti-tank fire against 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>367</b> http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1232292898771&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FShowFull.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>IDF forces. The smoke projectiles were fired at an area a considerable distance 
from the UNRWA headquarters, and were not intended to cause damage to either 
person or property. However, it appears that fragments of the smoke projectiles did 
hit a warehouse located in the headquarters, causing it to catch fire.  
</p>
<p>During the incident, claims were also made that an explosive shell or 
shrapnel hit the UNRWA headquarters. The investigation showed that these were 
shells, or shell fragments that were fired at military targets within the battle zone. 
</p>
<p>The damage caused to the UNRWA headquarters during the fighting in the 
Tel El-Hawwa neighbourhood is the unfortunate result of the type of warfare that 
Hamas forced upon the IDF, involving combat in the Gaza Strip's urban spaces 
and adjacent to facilities associated with international organizations. These results 
could not be predicted.  
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is clear that the forces did not intend, at any stage, to hit a 
UN facility. Following UN complaints that an explosive shell had hit the 
headquarters, the forces were ordered to cease firing explosive shells in the region 
in question. Following the receipt of reports about the fire in the warehouse, all 
firing in the area was stopped. The entry of fire-fighting trucks to the area was 
coordinated with the IDF in order to assist in extinguishing the fire.<b>368</b> 
</p>
<p>574. In its report of July 2009 on the military operations, the Israeli Government explains that 
the &#8220;primary rationale&#8221; for firing white phosphorous was to &#8220;produce a smokescreen to protect 
Israeli forces from the Hamas anti-tank crews operating adjacent to the UNRWA headquarters&#8221;. 
The report goes on to assert: 
</p>
<p>The IDF sought to maintain a safety distance of several hundred metres from 
sensitive sites, including the UNRWA compound. Despite the maintenance of a 
safety distance, some felt wedges and other components of the projectiles 
apparently landed in the compound after the release of felt wedges in the air. The 
IDF neither anticipated not intended this outcome.<b>369</b> 
</p>
<p>575. The Mission has a number of observations about the conclusions of the Israeli 
Government. First, it does not share the circumspect or indeed understated representation of the 
nature and extent of the strikes in the compound. There were ten strikes: three high explosive 
shells landed and exploded in the compound; seven white phosphorous container shells 
discharged completely or very substantially in the confines of a very limited space around 
particularly vulnerable areas of the UNRWA compound. This is not a matter of a limited number 
of wedges falling inside the compound or shrapnel or parts of shells landing in the compound as 
the shells exploded elsewhere. It is important to emphasize that we are dealing with shells 
exploding or discharging inside the compound in areas where hazardous material was stored. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>368</b> http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/opcast/postop/press/2202.htm.  
<b>369</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 344 and 346. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>576. Secondly, the claim that this result was neither intended nor anticipated has to be 
reviewed carefully. In the first place the Mission affirms the result to be reviewed is not 
fragments and wedges landing in the compound but ten shells landing and exploding inside the 
compound. It is difficult to accept that the consequences were not appreciated and foreseen by 
the Israeli armed forces. 
</p>
<p>577. Those in the Israeli army who deploy white phosphorous, or indeed any artillery shells, 
are expertly trained to factor in the relevant complexities of targeting, including wind force and 
the earth&#8217;s curvature. They have to know the area they are firing at, possible obstacles in hitting 
the target and the other environmental factors necessary to ensure an effective strike. It is also 
clear that, having determined that it was necessary to establish a safety distance, the presence of 
the UNWRA installations was a factor present in the minds of those carrying out the shelling. 
</p>
<p>578. The question then becomes how specialists expertly trained in the complex issue of 
artillery deployment and aware of the presence of an extremely sensitive site can strike that site 
ten times while apparently trying to avoid it. 
</p>
<p>579. The Mission&#8217;s scepticism that the result was not anticipated is confirmed by the fact that 
from around 8 a.m. on 15 January UNRWA officials began a series of calls to a number of 
officials explaining precisely what was going on. These calls were made to the appropriate 
people at COGAT/CLA as a result of prearranged coordination and further reinforced by the 
numerous calls by the Deputy Director of UNRWA to senior Israeli military officials in Tel 
Aviv. 
</p>
<p>580. In particular, the Israeli military officials were informed that shells had indeed struck 
inside the compound by the series of phone calls made by UNRWA officials. 
</p>
<p>581. The Mission is in possession of information that indicates a senior UNRWA official 
called the head of HCC in Tel Aviv and a number of his immediate subordinates several times. 
In particular a call was made at 10.31 a.m. by the official to the Israeli armed forces to explain 
that white phosphorous had landed in the compound and had set fire to the warehouse. He was 
told &#8220;by Tel Aviv&#8221; that the firing had stopped. To be clear, this means that by 10.30 a.m. at the 
latest channels of communication had been opened between Tel Aviv and those on the ground in 
Gaza City responsible for the firing of the shells, albeit not necessarily directly, but sufficient to 
be receiving reports of what was going on from Israeli troops on the ground. 
</p>
<p>582. At 10.30 a.m. staff at the UNRWA compound noted five white phosphorous container 
shells had discharged in the confines of the compound. At 10.40 a.m. the UNRWA official was 
again in direct communication with Tel Aviv explaining specifically that &#8220;the targeting is taking 
place in the vicinity of the workshop&#8221; and requiring that the Israeli armed forces desist 
immediately. In particular, he pointed out that what was required was a cessation of the firing for 
a sustained period of time to allow staff to bring the fire under control. 
</p>
<p>583. At 11.17 a.m. the same senior UNRWA official was informed in a phone call from 
UNRWA staff in the compound that a further two rounds had impacted &#8220;within the last ten 
minutes&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>584. At 11.53 a.m., in a further telephone call, the senior UNRWA official indicated to the 
COGAT/CLA contact person that the firing had been unforgivable and unacceptable. He noted 
that efforts had been made since 09.30 a.m. to get the firing to stop and that UNRWA had been 
told in several calls that the firing had been ordered to be stopped at higher levels, yet it 
continued. The UNRWA official noted that it was incomprehensible that, with the amount of 
surveillance and geographic positioning system (GPS) information, the most vulnerable part of 
the compound had been repeatedly struck. 
</p>
<p>585. In all the circumstances the Mission rejects the Israeli armed forces&#8217; assertion to the effect 
that it was not anticipated that the shells would land in the compound. The Israeli armed forces 
were told what was happening. It no longer had to anticipate it. The Israeli armed forces&#8217; 
responses in Tel Aviv and in COGAT/CLA indicate quite clearly that they understood the nature 
and scale of what was happening. Their responses in particular indicate that orders had been 
given to stop the firing.  
</p>
<p><b>7. Factual and legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>586. The Mission considers that Israeli armed forces had all of the information necessary to 
appreciate the danger they were creating as a result of their firing at the UNRWA installations, in 
particular the fuel depot, and to the civilians gathered there. Orders were said to have been issued 
to cease firing in the vicinity of the UNWRA premises. 
</p>
<p>587. The Israeli Government&#8217;s report cites with approval a passage from the report to the 
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in relation to the 
bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) in 1998. The Mission has also considered that report. On the issue of intent it states:  
</p>
<p>Attacks which are not directed against military objectives (particularly attacks 
directed against the civilian population) and attacks which cause disproportionate civilian 
casualties or civilian property damage may constitute the actus reus for the offence of 
unlawful attack under article 3 of the ICTY Statute. The mens rea for the offence is 
intention or recklessness, not simple negligence. In determining whether or not the mens 
rea requirement has been met, it should be borne in mind that commanders deciding on an 
attack have duties:  
</p>
<p>(a) To do everything practicable to verify that the objectives to be attacked are 
military objectives; 
</p>
<p>(b) To take all practicable precautions in the choice of methods and means of 
warfare with a view to avoiding or in any event to minimizing incidental civilian 
casualties or civilian property damage; and  
</p>
<p>(c) To refrain from launching attacks which may be expected to cause 
disproportionate civilian casualties or civilian property damage.<b>370</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>370</b> &#8220;Final report to the Prosecutor&#8230;&#8221;, para. 28. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>588. The Mission agrees that this passage correctly reflects both the nature of the intent 
required and the relevant duties of a commander.  
</p>
<p>589. Even if the Israeli armed forces were under fire from anti-tank missiles from Palestinian 
armed groups at the time, all of the information referred to above indicates that the commanders 
in question did not take all feasible precautions in the choice of methods and means of warfare 
with a view to avoiding or, in any event, to minimizing incidental civilian casualties or civilian 
property damage. 
</p>
<p>590. The Mission is not attempting to second-guess with hindsight the decisions of 
commanders. The fact is that the events in question continued over a period of some three hours. 
In these circumstances the Israeli armed forces were not confronted by surprise fire to which 
they had to respond with whatever materiel was available to them at the time. If they were faced 
with anti-tank missiles, that was hardly something of which they had been unaware for an 
appreciable time.  
</p>
<p>591. Statements made to the Mission by senior UNRWA international staff indicate that they 
were unaware of any sustained fire at the relevant time from anywhere in the nearby areas. The 
Mission notes that official statements made on 15 January by Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister had 
indicated with complete certainty that firing by Palestinian armed groups had occurred from 
within the UNRWA compound.<b>371</b> This was later contradicted and corrected to state that the 
armed groups occupied positions near to but outside the compound.<b>372</b> The Mission considers it 
important to record that the initial allegation was incorrect and this appears now to be accepted 
as such by the Israeli.  
</p>
<p>592. The Mission concludes that the Israeli commanders knew of the location of the UNRWA 
premises and indeed of the layout of the compound in terms of the most vulnerable areas and 
especially the fuel depot before the shelling took place around 8 a.m. 
</p>
<p>593. Even if the Israeli Government&#8217;s position regarding the position of Palestinian armed 
groups is taken at face value, the Mission concludes that, given the evident threat of substantial 
damage to several hundred civilian lives and to civilian property in using white phosphorous in 
that particular line of fire, the advantage gained from using white phosphorous to screen Israeli 
armed forces&#8217; tanks from anti-tank fire from armed opposition groups could not be deemed 
proportionate. 
</p>
<p>594. Having been fully alerted not to the risks but to the actual consequences of the course of 
action, Israeli armed forces continued with precisely the same conduct as a result of which 
further shells hit the compound. Such conduct, in the Mission&#8217;s view, reflects a reckless 
disregard for the consequences of the choice of the means adopted in combating the anti-tank fire 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>371</b> Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, told the United Nations Secretary-General that troops shelled the building 
in response to Hamas gunfire coming from within, but nonetheless said it should not have happened. Israeli troops 
&#8220;were attacked from there and the response was harsh&#8221;, Olmert said. &#8220;It is absolutely true that we were attacked from 
that place, but the consequences are very sad and we apologize for it&#8221;, he added. See http://www.guardian.co.uk/ 
world/2009/jan/15/israel-gaza-offensive-truce-talks. The same quotation is reported in multiple sources. 
<b>372</b> &#8221;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 347. </p>

 <p> 
the Israeli authorities claim they were facing. The decision to continue using the same means in 
the face of such knowledge compounds that recklessness. It deprived the UNRWA staff of the 
ability to contain the fires that had been caused and led to millions of dollars worth of damage 
that could have been avoided. It also put in danger some 700 lives, including staff and sheltering 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>595. The Mission, therefore, concludes on the basis of the information it received and in the 
absence of any credible refuting evidence that Israeli armed forces violated the customary 
international law requirement to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and method 
of attack with a view to avoiding and in any event minimizing incidental loss of civilian life, 
injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects as reflected in article 57 (2) (a) (ii) of 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Al-Quds hospital, Tal el-Hawa, Gaza City 
</b></p>
<p>596. Al-Quds hospital belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). It consists of 
three buildings facing west towards the sea and occupying the corner of Jami&#8217;at ad-Duwal 
al-Arabiyah Street and al-Abraj Street in the area of Tal el-Hawa. The building nearest the corner 
is seven storeys high. Its principal purposes were administrative and cultural rather than medical. 
It stored a huge quantity of PRCS archives. The middle building contains the accident and 
emergency treatment area as well as other offices. The building furthest from the corner is the 
main medical building with operating theatres in the basement. About 200 metres eastwards on 
al-Abraj Street is the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance depot. These buildings all suffered 
significant damage in the course of an Israeli bombardment on 15 January 2009, which included 
the use of white phosphorous. The attacks endangered the lives of the staff and more than 
50 patients in the hospital. There was no warning given for any of the attacks. 
</p>
<p>597. The Mission met staff from the hospital on six separate occasions, three of them on site 
visits. Two extended site visits included inspections not only of the hospital premises, but also of 
the ambulance depot, of the damage done to apartment buildings on that street and of the area 
opposite the hospital to assess the damage done by fighting in that area. Three long interviews 
were carried out with one doctor individually, another was carried out with two doctors together 
and there were two group meetings with four and five doctors, respectively. The Mission also 
received a considerable body of photographs and digital video footage of the events of the day in 
question. It furthermore addressed questions to the Government of Israel regarding the use of 
white phosphorous munitions against al-Quds hospital and the direct military advantage pursued 
by their use under the circumstances, but received no reply. 
</p>
<p>598. The doctors with whom the Mission spoke all occupied senior positions but also 
witnessed the events that occurred throughout that day. The Mission was impressed with their 
objectivity and the genuine distress several of them showed at being unable to help or protect the 
sick and wounded who had come to the hospital. Throughout that day many of the staff, 
including the doctors, took exceptional risks to stop fire spreading, including by removing white 
phosphorous wedges from near diesel tanks. One doctor in particular showed remarkable 
courage. He left the hospital to drive an ambulance through artillery shelling as he sought to 
bring an eight-year-old girl to al-Shifa hospital for treatment which he was no longer able to 
provide in al-Quds. Having taken the girl there, he drove back to the hospital in the same 
conditions to continue assisting the efforts to fight the fires. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. The facts 
</b></p>
<p>599. When the Israeli air offensive began on 27 December a government building opposite the 
al-Quds administrative building on al-Abraj Street was almost totally destroyed. The building 
had previously served as a criminal detention centre and is still referred to locally by that 
designation although it had recently been used for other purposes, including customs 
administration. The same building was reportedly struck on a number of other occasions after 
27 December. When the Mission visited in June 2009, the site was completely demolished. 
</p>
<p>600. Diagonally opposite al-Quds Hospital on Jami&#8217;at ad-Duwal al-Arabiyah Street was 
another building rented to the Government and used primarily for public registry functions. 
Today only the ground floor of the building remains. Witnesses indicate that the upper floors had 
been destroyed, probably by artillery fire, around 6 and 7 January. 
</p>
<p>601. Three senior doctors at the hospital and two residents from al-Abraj Street indicated that 
at some point between 3 and 6 January several tanks were stationed several hundred metres east 
of al-Quds hospital, visible from the ambulance depot. Throughout the days of 5, 6, 7 and 
8 January there was significant artillery fire on a number of civilian apartment buildings on 
al-Abraj Street. On 8 January 2009 the seventh-floor apartment of Dr. Jaber Abu al-Naja was 
struck. His wife and son-in-law were killed immediately as they sat on the balcony of the 
apartment eating pastries. His wife was cut in half by the explosion and his son-in-law was 
thrown from the balcony on to the street below. His daughter, Ihsan, was seriously injured and 
taken to al-Quds hospital for treatment. Dr. Jaber Abu al-Naja is the former Ambassador of the 
PLO to Senegal and a well-known Fatah politician.<b>373</b> 
</p>
<p>602. By 15 January the area immediately to the south of al-Quds hospital (the customs building 
and the registry building) had been totally or very substantially destroyed. The area to the east on 
al-Abraj Street had been significantly attacked by artillery fire. 
</p>
<p>603. By this time a large number of civilians (several hundreds) had also gathered in the 
hospital buildings seeking safety. 
</p>
<p>604. During the night of 14 January Israeli armed forces began an extended barrage of artillery 
fire over the area. It continued into the morning of 15 January. Between 8 and 9 a.m. doctors in 
the main building were in the principal meeting room when shells landed on either side of the 
building. They saw white phosphorous wedges burning near a container of diesel and efforts 
were successfully made to move those away. The initial explosions had blown out the office 
windows. At about the same time it became apparent that the administrative building on the 
corner had also been hit. The hospital building next to it has a large timber-built component. The 
risk of fire spreading was immense and a witness described how hospital staff, including senior 
doctors, all sought to break, by hand, the wooden bridge way that linked the administrative 
building to the hospital building to prevent the fire from spreading.  
</p>
<p>605. Shortly after the initial explosions and fire were observed, a tank shell directly penetrated 
the rear of the middle hospital building. That part of the building is made of corrugated iron and 
                                                 
<b>373</b> Interview with Dr. Jaber Abu al-Naja, 4 July 2009. </p>

 <p> 
the entry point of the shell is easily detectable. The shell then penetrated the inner concrete wall 
of the hospital where the pharmacy was located. The pharmacy was completely destroyed as a 
result. An eyewitness described that, through the holes made in the corrugated iron, he observed 
a tank on a road between two buildings about 400 metres eastwards. Although he could not say 
whether it was this tank that had struck the hospital directly, it was in a direct line in relation to 
the entry point of the shell. 
</p>
<p>606. Throughout the day the hospital was unable to procure the assistance of civil defence 
forces or other fire-fighting support. As a result, the staff of the hospital were almost entirely 
consumed with the task of saving the buildings and ensuring the safety of patients. 
</p>
<p>607. It was not until around 4 p.m. that it was possible to coordinate an evacuation of hospital 
patients with the assistance of ICRC, which made clear upon arrival that it would be able to carry 
out this procedure only once. Those not evacuated at this point were relocated to the operating 
theatres of the hospital. 
</p>
<p>608. At around 8 p.m. another fire broke out causing serious damage to the main hospital 
building. As a result of this fire it was decided to carry out a total evacuation of the remaining 
patients as well as a number of local residents who had sought refuge in the hospital. It was at 
this stage that one of the senior doctors took an eight-year-old girl who had been struck by a 
bullet in the jaw and was critically ill to al-Shifa hospital, where she later died. At that point he 
says he felt that there was very heavy fire in the area and that there appeared to be some attempts 
to aim directly at or near to the ambulance.  
</p>
<p>609. Meanwhile, 200 metres to the east in al-Abraj Street the PRCS ambulance depot had also 
been severely damaged. One of its principal buildings was entirely destroyed. The Mission also 
saw the remnants of three PRCS ambulances that had been parked at the entrance to the depot. 
Two had been crushed by tanks but not burned out. The other ambulance showed signs of having 
been struck directly in the front below the windscreen by a missile of some description and 
having been burned out. 
</p>
<p>610. The devastation caused to both the hospital buildings, including the loss of all archives in 
the administrative building, and the ambulance depot was immense, as was the risk to the safety 
of the patients.  
</p>
<p>611. The Mission examined a number of the shells retrieved by the hospital staff and reviewed 
footage taken at the time as well as still photographs.  
</p>
<p><b>2. The Israeli position 
</b></p>
<p>612. The Israeli authorities did not specifically mention the incident at al-Quds hospital in the 
conclusions of their investigations on 22 April 2009.<b>374</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>374</b> Annex B addresses some allegations regarding the use of ambulances, but not the attack on the hospital. See 
http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/Press+Releases/09/4/2202.htm.  </p>

 <p> 
613. In its report of July 2009 (para. 173) the Israeli Government quotes part of an article from 
<i>Newsweek</i> magazine: 
</p>
<p>One of the most notorious incidents during the war was the Jan. 15 shelling 
of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society buildings in the downtown Tal-al Hawa 
part of Gaza City, followed by a shell hitting their Al Quds Hospital next door; 
the subsequent fire forced all 500 patients to be evacuated. Asked if there were 
any militants firing from the hospital or the Red Crescent buildings, hospital 
director general Dr. Khalid Judah chose his words carefully. &#8216;I am not able to say 
if anyone was using the PRCS buildings [the two Palestine Red Crescent Society 
buildings adjacent to the hospital], but I know for a fact that no one was using the 
hospital.&#8217; In the Tal-al Hawa neighborhood nearby, however, Talal Safadi, an 
official in the leftist Palestinian People's Party, said that resistance fighters were 
firing from positions all around the hospital. He shrugged that off, having a 
bigger beef with Hamas. &#8216;They failed to win the battle.&#8217; Or as his fellow PPP 
official, Walid al Awad, put it: &#8216;It was a mistake to give Israel the excuse to come 
in.&#8217;<b>375</b> 
</p>
<p>While the Israeli Government does not comment further on the specific attack, it would 
appear to invoke these comments to justify the strikes on the hospital and surrounding 
area. 
</p>
<p>614. The Mission understands that the Israeli Government may consider relying on journalists&#8217; 
reporting as likely to be treated as more impartial than reliance on its own intelligence 
information. The Mission is nonetheless struck by the lack of any suggestion in Israel&#8217;s report of 
July 2009 that there were members of armed groups present in the hospital at the time. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>615. The Mission finds that on the morning of 15 January the hospital building and the 
administrative building were struck by a number of shells containing white phosphorous and by 
at least one high explosive shell. The fires these caused led to panic and chaos among the sick 
and wounded, necessitated two evacuations in extremely perilous conditions, caused huge 
financial losses as a result of the damage and put the lives of several hundred civilians including 
medical staff at very great risk. 
</p>
<p>616. The Mission also notes that, as a result of the conditions the attack created, the hospital 
was unable to provide the necessary care for an eight-year-old girl. Despite heroic attempts to 
save her, she died later in another hospital. The girl had been shot by an Israeli sniper. The 
Mission finds the Israeli armed forces responsible for her death. 
</p>
<p>617. On the issue of armed groups being present in the hospital buildings, the Mission does not 
agree that anything in the extract cited above from <i>Newsweek</i> magazine justifies the conclusion 
that the hospital premises were being used by armed groups. The fact that Dr. Judah spoke with 
certainty about matters within his knowledge cannot be presumed to mean that he believed other 
                                                 
<b>375</b> &#8220;Hamas and its discontents&#8221;, 20 January 2009. </p>

 <p> 
parts of the hospital premises were being used by armed groups. That may be journalistic gloss 
and is tantamount to putting words in the mouth of Dr. Judah. The comments attributed to 
Mr. Safadi that &#8220;resistance fighters were firing from positions all around the hospital&#8221; can mean 
either that people were inside the hospital firing or were in positions outside but near to the 
hospital. The journalist did not clarify precisely what was meant. 
</p>
<p>618. The Mission, having carried out over eight hours of interviews with senior and junior 
staff, and having sought to verify the matter with others, including journalists who were in the 
area at that time, has concluded that it is unlikely there was any armed presence in any of the 
hospital buildings at the time of the attack. 
</p>
<p>619. The Mission finds that no warning was given at any point of an imminent strike and at no 
time has the Israeli Government suggested such a warning was given.<b>376</b>  
</p>
<p>620. Reviewing the scene at the time of the strikes on al-Quds hospital, it is important to bear 
in mind that a great deal of destruction had already occurred and that buildings with an apparent 
connection to the local government had been attacked and largely destroyed. As such, Israeli 
tanks had a relatively clear view of the area immediately to the south of the hospital. The 
Mission also notes that as a result of the attacks on al-Abraj Street by tanks for several days, the 
scope for resistance, if any, from that particular quarter had been significantly reduced. 
</p>
<p>621. The Mission is aware of reports that there was significant resistance from Palestinian 
armed groups in the Tal el-Hawa area on the night of 14January.<b>377</b> Information available alleges 
that on the night of 14 January Israeli troops had entered buildings on al-Abraj Street, used 
human shields to check if there was any presence of enemy combatants or explosive devices and 
found none. Reports do not specify the nature, scale or precise location of resistance in Tal 
el-Hawa. The Mission notes that in the buildings directly opposite al-Quds hospital on Jami&#8217;at 
ad-Duwal al-Arabiyah Street there is very little sign of damage to any of the buildings on that 
side of the street, and certainly nothing that compares to the damage to the buildings on al-Abraj 
Street. 
</p>
<p>622. The Mission takes into account the damage that had already occurred between 
27 December and 8 January on al-Abraj and Jami&#8217;at ad-Duwal al-Arabiyah Streets, and the lack 
of apparent damage to the buildings directly opposite the hospital on Jami&#8217;at ad-Duwal al-
Arabiyah Street. It also takes account of the sighting of at least one tank whose direct line of fire, 
bearing in mind that it was surrounded by tall buildings on both sides, was the hospital itself. It 
also notes the credible sightings of Israeli aircraft in the area at various points throughout the 
day. It further notes the extensive damage to the ambulance depot at the same time as the strikes 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>376</b> In its conclusions of its investigations published on 22 April, the Israeli armed forces highlight the fact, in 
connection with its investigation into allegations of attacks on medical services, that they gave warnings. One 
related to an ambulance and another to a clinic. There is no mention of al-Quds hospital. See 
http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/Press+Releases/09/4/2202.htm.  
<b>377</b> The Mission has noted a witness account in relation to Israeli armed forces&#8217; use of human shields on al-Abraj 
Street on the night of 14 January, thus indicating that there was indeed a very active Israeli presence on the ground. 
See Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, &#8220;Hiding behind civilians: April 2009 update report&#8221;, p. 8. </p>

 <p> 
on the hospital occurred and the apparently unexplainable crushing of ambulances parked 
outside the depot. 
</p>
<p>623. In the light of all these considerations, the Mission finds that there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that the hospital and the ambulance depot, as well as the ambulances themselves, were 
the object of a direct attack by the Israeli armed forces in the area at the time and that the 
hospital could not be described in any respect at that time as a military objective. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>624. Article 18 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that civilian hospitals may in no 
circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected by the 
parties to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>625. Article 19 provides that the protection to which civilian hospitals are entitled shall cease 
&#8220;only after due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit 
and after such warning has remained unheeded.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>626. Even in the unlikely event that there was any armed group present on hospital premises, 
there is no suggestion even by the Israeli authorities that a warning was given to the hospital of 
an intention to strike it. As such the Mission finds on the information before it that Israeli armed 
forces violated articles 18 and 19 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p>627. On considering the information before it, the Mission takes the view that there was intent 
to strike the hospital, as evidenced in particular by the high explosive artillery shell that 
penetrated the rear of the hospital and destroyed the pharmacy. 
</p>
<p>628. Even if it is suggested that there was no intent to directly strike the hospital but that 
Palestinian armed groups had taken up positions near al-Quds hospital, the Israeli armed forces 
would still have been bound to ensure that risk of death, injury or damage to the people in the 
hospital or the hospital itself would not be excessive in relation to the military advantage 
anticipated in attacking the hospital.  
</p>
<p>629. Taking into account the weapons used, and in particular the use of white phosphorous in 
and around a hospital that the Israeli armed forces knew was not only dealing with scores of 
injured and wounded but also giving shelter to several hundred civilians, the Mission finds, 
based on all the information available to it, that in directly striking the hospital and the 
ambulance depot the Israeli armed forces in these circumstances violated article 18 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention and violated customary international law in relation to proportionality. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Attacks on al-Wafa hospital, 5 and 16 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p>630. The Mission interviewed three senior doctors of al-Wafa hospital. One was Dr. Khamis 
el-Essi, its Director. The two other doctors do not wish to be identified. The Mission has also 
reviewed information in the public domain in relation to the various alleged attacks on the 
hospital. 
</p>
<p>631. Al-Wafa hospital is located at the eastern part of al-Shujaeiyah (east Gaza City), very 
close to the Israel-Gaza eastern border. It was founded in 1996 and provides long-term care to </p>

 <p> 
those suffering from head and spinal injuries. Many patients are elderly. It can accommodate 
over 50 patients.  
</p>
<p>632. The hospital consists of three buildings. From south to north these are the administrative 
building (three floors), the hospital buildings (rooms of patients and surgeries, seven floors) and 
the building for the elderly (reception and rehabilitation, three floors). 
</p>
<p><b>1. The facts 
</b></p>
<p>633. The hospital was the object of a significant attack on 16 April 2008. Tanks fired in and 
around the hospital area, damaging a large number of patient rooms and causing significant 
destruction of the building for rehabilitative care for the elderly. Hospital staff indicate there was 
no armed presence inside the hospital at that time but cannot say whether there may have been a 
presence outside. 
</p>
<p>634. During the military operations, the hospital was<b> </b>attacked again. Despite media reports that 
a warning had been given, hospital staff deny that any specific warning was received. Leaflets 
had been dropped in the area with general indications that support of Hamas would be punished. 
The hospital had also received a number of telephone warnings with recorded messages but with 
no specific indication that the hospital itself would be the object of an attack, much less with an 
indication of when that would occur. One doctor indicated that the hospital had received around 
four such messages each day since 27 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>635. On 5 January, the hospital was attacked with intensive artillery fire, including white 
phosphorous shells. Senior doctors indicate that generic recorded telephone warnings were 
actually received during the shelling. The latest warning the hospital received on 5 January was 
at 4.30 p.m. Following this, at around 12.30-1 a.m. on 6 January, white phosphorous shells 
landed in the area surrounding the administrative building and on its roof. 
</p>
<p>636. The white phosphorous caused damage to the administrative building only, destroying the 
roof. 
</p>
<p>637. All three witnesses of the senior medical staff confirm absolutely that there was no 
presence of any armed resistance inside the hospital. They are not able to confirm or deny the 
presence of such elements outside of the hospital. 
</p>
<p>638. The hospital was attacked again with artillery fire on 16 January 2009 at 2 a.m. No 
specific warning was given. Again a general recorded message had been received saying that 
people located in the border areas should leave and threatening punitive measures to those who 
stayed. Again doctors confirm there was no armed presence inside the hospital but cannot say 
what was occurring outside it. 
</p>
<p>639. The attack damaged the building for elderly patients on the ground and third floors as well 
as the roof. It damaged the third and fourth floors of the central hospital building.  
</p>
<p>640. Doctors estimate that the tanks were as close as 70 metres from the hospital. 
</p>
<p>641. The damage to the hospital (as a result of the two attacks) is estimated at US$ 550,000. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>642. As to why the hospital was the subject of these attacks, doctors speculate that its location 
close to the border is one possible reason. Another relates to the rumour that Israel believes that 
Muhammad al-Deif, a well-known Hamas militant, is treated inside the hospital.  
</p>
<p>643. According to one witness in the hospital, Israeli armed forces tried to assassinate Mr. al-
Deif on 12 July 2006. Although he survived the assassination attempt, he was badly hurt and, 
according to some rumours, his legs were amputated and he became blind. It seems that Israel 
believes that he receives some rehabilitation and medical treatment at al-Wafa hospital. 
</p>
<p>644. On 5 February 2003, for instance, Israeli snipers shot and killed two staff nurses who were 
on duty inside the hospital (Abd al-Karim Lubad and Omar Hassan, both aged 21).<b>378</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>645. The Mission notes that the three witnesses interviewed are senior doctors in the hospital. 
The Mission found them to be credible and reliable. They clarified a number of apparently 
inaccurate statements that have appeared in press reports, especially regarding the nature of the 
warnings given. 
</p>
<p>646. The Mission considers that the warnings given cannot be considered as a warning within 
the meaning of article 19 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It was not specific and no indication 
was given about when the attack would take place or how much time there was to evacuate the 
hospital.  
</p>
<p>647. As to the reasons for the multiple attacks on the hospital in 2003, 2008 and 2009, the 
Mission is not in a position to comment. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>648. The Mission finds that the choice of deploying white phosphorous shells in and around 
such a building, where patients receiving long-term care and suffering from particularly serious 
injuries were especially vulnerable, was not acceptable in the circumstances. The Mission is 
particularly concerned about the attack on the hospital on 16 January from such close proximity. 
Even if there was some degree of armed resistance in the area (which the Mission cannot 
confirm), commanders in deploying such weaponry must take into account all the facts and 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>649. The Mission considers the use of white phosphorous in such an area as reckless and not 
justifiable in relation to any military advantage sought in the particular circumstances.  
</p>
<p>650. The Mission considers that the general protection given to hospitals indicates the need for 
particular consideration to be given to the use of such especially hazardous materials. The failure 
to provide sufficient warning indicates in the Mission&#8217;s view a wilful failure to consider 
seriously the consequences of using such weapons in those circumstances. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>378</b> See http://www.hrea.org/lists/hr-health-professionals/markup/msg00099.html.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>651. The Mission notes that the case of al-Wafa hospital demonstrates the complete 
ineffectiveness of certain kinds of warnings. The information the Mission has received points 
towards a kind of repetition and routine warning system taking no account at all of the realities 
of the hospital. 
</p>
<p>652. As such the Mission considers that, from all the information available to it, the Israeli 
armed forces violated articles 18 and 19 of the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as customary 
international law as reflected in Additional Protocol I, articles 57 (2) (b) and (c). 
</p>
<p><b>X.  INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS BY ISRAELI ARMED FORCES RESULTING  
IN THE LOSS OF LIFE AND INJURY TO CIVILIANS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. The shelling in al-Fakhura Street by Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>653. In the afternoon of 6 January at least four mortar bombs fired by Israeli armed forces 
exploded near the al-Fakhura junction in the al-Fakhura area of the Jabaliyah camp in northern 
Gaza.<b>379</b> 
</p>
<p>654. The Mission interviewed Mr. Muhammed Fouad Abu Askar on three occasions. His 
brother and two sons were killed in the attack.<b>380</b> It also met surviving members of the al-Deeb 
family on two occasions.<b>381</b> The Mission interviewed four men who had lost family members in 
the attack, the Director of the UNRWA premises that were being used as a shelter for civilians 
and a number of journalists who covered the story. In addition, the Mission has seen a number of 
statements provided to organizations in Gaza in the form of affidavits. The Mission has also 
considered to the degree possible the information available from Israeli sources on the 
circumstances of the strike. 
</p>
<p><b>B. The facts surrounding the Israeli armed forces&#8217; mortar shelling 
</b></p>
<p>655. On 5 January 2009 UNRWA had opened the elementary school on al-Fakhura Street to 
provide shelter to civilians fleeing the areas where the Israeli armed forces had entered.  
</p>
<p>656. The Mission spoke on two occasions with the Director of the shelter about its 
management. He said that about 90 per cent of those in the shelter had come from outside of 
Jabaliyah camp, largely from the al-Atatra area. He explained that the shelter was guarded by 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>379</b> Interviewees&#8217; statements vary, asserting between four and six shells landed. The Mission saw for itself what it 
assessed to be the effects of mortars that landed. The crater in the orchard beside the al-Deeb house may have been 
caused by a mortar, but given the nature of the surroundings it is less easy to tell in terms of shrapnel patterns. The 
Mission does not reject the possibility that more landed but was not able to inspect those sites or to come to a firm 
view confirming the additional shells. 
<b>380</b> Mr. Abu Askar is a Hamas member. He also provided testimony at the public hearings in Gaza. He was detained 
on the charge of being a member of Hamas in 1992. He is the Director-General for Religious Affairs (a voluntary 
position) and is on the Dialogue Committee, organizing the pilgrimage to Mecca (Saudi Arabia). He is in charge of 
the Hamas Follow-Up Committee in North Gaza related to the settlement of disputes between Hamas and other 
groups in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. He has a master&#8217;s degree in education and is currently pursuing a PhD 
in the Syrian Arab Republic. He denies any involvement in armed militant activities. 
<b>381</b> Two of the members of the family also presented their testimony at the public hearings in Gaza. </p>

 <p> 
security staff at its entry points and that all people coming in were registered by name and 
searched to ensure no weapons were being taken into the premises.  
</p>
<p>657. UNRWA has confirmed to the Mission that the Israeli armed forces were fully aware that 
the school was being used as a shelter from 5 January 2005. UNRWA materials indicate that 
there were 1,368 people in the shelter at the time. 
</p>
<p>658. About 16 hours prior to the shelling on the afternoon of 6 January 2009, Israeli armed 
forces had already carried out at least one strike, destroying the house of Mr. Abu Askar. At 
around 1.45 a.m. on 6 January 2009, Mr. Abu Askar received a personal telephone call from the 
Israeli armed forces advising him that he should evacuate the house and everyone in it because it 
was going to be destroyed by an air strike. The building housed not only his immediate family 
but a large number of his extended family, about 40 in all. Mr. Abu Askar responded quickly, 
evacuating not only his own extended family but also advising neighbours of the imminent 
strike. The survivors of the al-Deeb family confirm they were advised at this time by Mr. Abu 
Askar of the call he had received. 
</p>
<p>659. The house was struck by a missile from an F-16 according to Mr. Abu Askar about seven 
minutes after the call was received. Several hours later, at around 6 a.m., he returned to the site 
of the house with members of his family hoping to retrieve some items of furniture. There he 
noticed that a number of other houses in the area also appeared to have been hit at some time in 
the intervening four hours. In the course of that day Mr. Abu Askar and members of his family 
took various steps to prepare the move of the family to rented accommodation nearby.  
</p>
<p>660. Mr. Abu Askar was in the street at around 4 p.m., when several mortars landed. He 
believes that there were about 150 people in the street at the time. The Director of the shelter 
confirmed that the street outside the school was generally busy. It had become busier than usual 
due to the large influx of people into the school looking for shelter. Some relatives were coming 
to the school to visit those who had recently arrived and new people were arriving to seek 
shelter, including with belongings on donkey carts.  
</p>
<p>661. Witnesses indicate that all of the explosions were over within around two minutes. One 
shell landed directly in the courtyard outside the al-Deeb house, where most of the family was 
gathered. Surviving family members interviewed by the Mission explained that nine members of 
the family were killed immediately. Ziyad Samir al-Deeb lost both legs as a result of the blast.<b>382</b> 
Surviving family members and neighbours carried the dead and injured one after another to 
hospital. Ambulances came, but most casualties were transported in private cars. Alaa Deeb, a 
daughter of Mo&#8217;in Deeb, was taken to al-Shifa hospital and thereafter to Egypt, where she died 
of her injuries. In total, 11 members of the family died, including four women and four girls. 
</p>
<p>662. Apart from the shell that landed in the al-Deeb courtyard, three other shells landed in the 
street outside. The total spread of the four mortars was a little over 100 metres. The Mission 
cannot specify in which order the mortars fell, but proceeding southwards from the al-Deeb 
house along al-Fakhura Street, the Mission saw the impact of another mortar, 45 metres away, a 
third was seen a further 50 metres south and a fourth a further 10 metres south.  
                                                 
<b>382</b> Ziyad al-Deeb testified before the Mission at the public hearings in Gaza along with his uncle. </p>

 <p> 
663. The three other shells that the Mission could identify as having landed at different places 
on al-Fakhura Street killed at least 24 people. The witnesses estimate that up to another 40 were 
injured by the blasts.<b>383</b> The Mission has not been able to verify those figures, but having 
inspected the site and viewed the footage, it does not consider these numbers to be exaggerated. 
</p>
<p>664. Among those killed immediately were two sons of Mr. Abu Askar, Imad, aged 13, and 
Khaled Abu Askar, aged 19. Mr. Abu Askar&#8217;s brother Arafat was also killed. 
</p>
<p>665. The Director of the UNRWA school shelter confirmed to the Mission that the blasts had 
damaged the part of the school building facing onto al-Fakhura Street. Up to nine people were 
injured. One boy of 16, who was sheltering in the school but was in the street at the time, was 
killed. No one inside the school was killed. He confirmed that no shell had directly hit the United 
Nations premises either inside or outside. 
</p>
<p>666. Witnesses have described the scene of chaos and carnage caused by the bombs. They 
indicate that people were ferried to hospitals in private cars because of the difficulties in reaching 
ambulance services at the time, although some ambulances did arrive. 
</p>
<p><b>C. The Israeli position 
</b></p>
<p>667. Contradictory accounts emerge from official Israeli statements. The initial position 
accepted that Israeli forces had struck inside the UNRWA school, claiming to be in response to 
Hamas fire. A later response accepted that Hamas had not been in the UNRWA school but had 
allegedly fired from 80 metres away from the school. Finally, the Israeli Government claimed 
that in fact Hamas operatives were launching mortars at Israeli armed forces for around one 
hour, firing every few minutes until the Israeli armed forces identified them and returned fire, 
killing a number of them.  
</p>
<p>668. On 6 January the Israeli armed forces posted the following statement on their website: 
</p>
<p>An initial inquiry by forces on operating in the area of the incident indicates that a 
number of mortar shells were fired at IDF forces from within the Jebaliya school. In 
response to the incoming enemy fire, the forces returned mortar fire to the source. 
</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Hamas has fired mortars and rockets from schools, in 
such a way deliberately using civilians as human shields in their acts of terror against 
Israel. This was already proven several months ago by footage from an unmanned plane 
showing rockets and mortars being fired from the yard of an UNRWA school. 
</p>
<p>Again, we emphasize that this announcement is based on an initial inquiry. 
</p>
<p>After an investigation that took place over the past hour it has been found that 
among the dead at the Jebaliya school were Hamas terror operatives and a mortar 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>383</b> A number of reports put the total figure of deaths at 42 or 43, including the al-Deeb family deaths. The Mission 
has not been able to contact all the relatives of those reported to have died. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>battery squad who were firing on IDF forces in the area. Hamas operatives Immad Abu 
Iskar and Hassan Abu Iskar were among terrorists identified killed.<b>384</b> 
</p>
<p>669. Further statements from spokespersons for the Prime Minister,<b>385</b> the Foreign Ministry and 
the Israeli armed forces all adhered to the position set out in the statement cited above. In two 
interviews the Prime Minister&#8217;s spokesman, Mr. Regev, emphasized that he considered Hamas 
were mounting a cover-up in relation to the fact the senior operatives had been killed by the 
Israeli armed forces in its strike and in particular that two persons, Imad and Hassan Abu Askar, 
were &#8220;well-known members of the Hamas military machine &#8211; part of the rocket network&#8221;.<b>386</b>  
</p>
<p>670. The position set out on 6 January was repeated again in comments to the press on 12 
January by an Israeli armed forces&#8217; spokesman.<b>387</b> 
</p>
<p>671. On 15 and 19 February 2009 <i>The</i> <i>Jerusalem Post</i> published reports quoting Colonel 
Moshe Levi of CLA. He indicated that the stories of 40 or more dying as a result of the attack 
were the result of distortions and that in fact the Israeli armed forces had killed 12 people, 
including nine Hamas operatives and three non-combatants. The report of 19 February lists 7 of 
the 12 he said were killed. He also pointed out that the Israeli surveillance footage showed only a 
&#8220;few stretchers were brought in to evacuate people&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>672. On 22 April 2009 the Israeli armed forces published the results of their preliminary 
investigations, stating a completely different position from that previously expressed: 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>384</b> http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2009/Initial_inquiry_school_incident_6-Jan-2009.htm.  
<b>385</b> On 7 January in a television interview on the British Broadcasting Corporation&#8217;s programme Newsnight, Mr. 
Regev indicated that he believed that the Israeli armed forces had attacked the school because they had come under 
fire, that the school was occupied by Hamas operatives and that those Hamas operatives had committed a war crime 
by using the premises for the purpose of launching mortars. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-
GB&amp;v=9wv0giW1elo&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=9277810AA376DF8D&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=5.  
</p>
<p>In another interview he indicated the Israeli armed forces&#8217; patrol returned fire having received mortar fire, that he 
assumed the school had been taken by force by Hamas &#8220;with guns&#8221; and held the people in the school as &#8220;hostages&#8221;. 
See https://www.csidonline.org/resources/news/9/462-strike-on-gaza-school-kills-40?tmpl=component&amp;print 
=1&amp;page. 
</p>
<p>On the same day Major Avital Leibovich, spokeswoman of the Israeli armed forces, in an interview with Channel 4 
news said that Hamas had fired from &#8220;the vicinity of the school&#8221; but later asserted that the two Hamas militants were 
inside the school firing at the Israeli armed forces. See http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/ 
bcpid1184614595?bctid=6539745001 
</p>
<p>On the same day Israeli armed forces&#8217; spokesman Captain Benjamin Rutland made a presentation posted on 
YouTube. He indicated that it had transpired later that the mortar fire had come from within a United Nations 
school, that this was a crime on the part of Hamas and that civilians had been killed. He noted, however, that Hamas 
terror operatives had been killed including the well-known Abu Askar brothers. Another Israeli armed forces 
spokesperson confirmed on 12 January that it was adhering to the same positions as had been expressed on 6 and 
7 January. See http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/4/2201.htm.  
<b>386</b> See https://www.csidonline.org/resources/news/9/462-strike-on-gaza-school-kills-
40?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page 
<b>387</b> The statement of Captain Ishai David in The Jerusalem Post on 12 January 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Regarding the UNRWA school in Jabaliya, the Fahoura school, the investigation 
concluded that the IDF used minimal and proportionate retaliatory fire, using the most 
precise weapons available to them. Hamas made this necessary, as it fired mortar shells 
at Israeli forces 80 metres from the school. Additionally, it was concluded that all of the 
shells fired by IDF forces landed outside of the school grounds.<b>388</b> 
</p>
<p>673. In July 2009 the Israeli Government stated: 
</p>
<p>Soon after the source of fire was detected, a scouting unit was dispatched to 
confirm the location. Approximately 50 minutes after the mortar attack had begun, two 
independent sources cross-verified the location of the mortars. Only subsequent to this, 
and after verification of a safety margin of at least 50 metres between the target (i.e. 
the identified source of the mortar fire) and the UNRWA school, did the force respond 
to the ongoing barrage, by using the most accurate weapon available to it &#8211; 120-mm 
mortars.<b>389</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Other reports 
</b></p>
<p>674. The Mission carried out nine interviews with people who were present in al-Fakhura 
Street, in the al-Deeb yard or in the UNRWA school. No witness stated that he had heard any 
firing prior to the Israeli armed forces&#8217; mortars landing. On the other hand, the Mission is aware 
of at least two reports that indicate local residents had heard such fire in the area.<b>390</b>  
</p>
<p>675. The Mission notes that the statement of the Israeli armed forces on 22 April did not 
indicate where the Hamas fire came from, only stating it was 80 metres away. The Mission finds 
it difficult to understand how the Israeli armed forces could have come to this view without 
having the information at the same time that Hamas operatives had been firing mortars for 
almost one hour. It regards these new allegations as lacking credibility. However, the Mission 
accepts, for the purposes of this report, that some firing may have occurred that gave rise to the 
Israeli armed forces&#8217; response. 
</p>
<p>676. It seems clear to the Mission that Israel&#8217;s Government developed a position justifying the 
striking of an UNRWA school as a result of the immediate outcry generated by initial erroneous 
reports that the school had been hit. That effort included a number of statements, in particular 
those by Mr. Regev and Major Leibovich, which turned out to be erroneous. 
</p>
<p>677. The Mission notes the comment of Colonel Moshe Levi in <i>The</i> <i>Jerusalem Post</i> on 
15 February 2009 casting doubt on the numbers of dead noting that Israeli surveillance saw only 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>388</b> http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/4/2201.htm. 
<b>389</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 338. 
<b>390</b> One report comes from the Associated Press, whose sources insisted on anonymity. The other is by a 
correspondent of the British Channel 4 News programme who reports that locals told him &#8220;militants had been firing 
rockets&#8221; at the Israeli armed forces and were running down the street to get away. See  Jonathan Miller, &quot;Why UN 
'reversal' over Gaza school should be treated with caution&quot;. Channel 4, 5 February 2009, available at: 
http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/middle_east/why+un+reversal+over+gaza+school+should+be+treate
d+with+caution/2924657. </p>

 <p> 
a few stretchers being used to lift the dead and injured. If Israel had that capacity of surveillance 
in the immediate aftermath of the shelling, it must have been able to see that the shells had hit on 
the street outside the school and not inside the school. Furthermore, if such surveillance was 
recorded, in the face of serious allegations levelled against the Israeli armed forces by several 
sources after the military operation in Gaza, the Government could have made this footage 
public in order to establish the truth of its claims regarding this incident.  
</p>
<p>678. Finally, the Mission comes to the repeated assertion of the Israeli authorities as to the 
identities of those killed in the strikes. The most detailed attempt to name these come in Col. 
Levi&#8217;s statement of the 12 dead, including nine militants and three non-combatants. On 
19 February <i>The</i> <i>Jerusalem Post</i> published seven of the names given to them by CLA. The 
Mission notes that CLA did not provide any information to explain where the information on the 
dead came from. None of the seven names corresponds with any the Mission has so far 
established died in the attack. 
</p>
<p>679. The position assumed by Colonel Levi of CLA is problematic in the light of the relatively 
uncomplicated case of the al-Deeb family, of whom nine members died immediately and two 
died later. Four of these were women and four were children. Given these figures alone, and the 
relative ease with which the victims could be identified, the Mission considers the CLA 
assertions as to the total numbers and identities of those killed in the Israeli armed forces&#8217; mortar 
strikes to be unreliable. Even if the Israeli authorities were to be correct in saying that nine 
combatants were killed, they are, in the considered view of the Mission, incorrect in stating that 
only three non-combatants were killed. 
</p>
<p>680. A further assertion made several times by Israeli spokespersons on 6 and 7 January and 
confirmed again on 12 January was that the strikes had not only managed to hit the militant 
rocket launchers but had also killed two senior Hamas militants, namely Imad Abu Askar and 
Hassan Abu Askar.<b>391</b> Again, for the most part these early assertions indicated that both had been 
killed in the UNRWA school. It is noticeable that the Israeli armed forces&#8217; summary of their own 
preliminary investigations does not repeat this claim. 
</p>
<p>681. What is now clear is that, if any Hamas operatives were killed by the Israeli strike, they 
were not killed in the school premises. It is difficult for the Mission to understand how the Israeli 
authorities could establish with such certainty within a matter of hours the identities of two of the 
Hamas operatives it had killed but could not establish within a week that the alleged firing had 
not come from the school and that the Israeli armed forces had not hit the school. 
</p>
<p>682. The Mission is satisfied that three Abu Askar family members were killed: Imad, aged 13, 
his brother Khaled, aged 19, and their uncle, Arafat, aged 33. Mr. Mark Regev indicated that 
Imad Abu Askar was a well-known member of Hamas&#8217;s militant operation and of some 
significance in the rocket-launching operations. Major Leibovich and Captain Rutland also 
named Imad as one of the two operatives killed.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>391</b> In her interview with Channel 4 News, Major Leibovich in fact appears to say &#8220;Amr Abu Askar&#8221; after some 
hesitation but in the light of the other statements the Mission considers this to have been an error on her part and that 
in all likelihood she intended to say &#8220;Imad&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>683. The Mission does not deny the possibility of children being recruited by Palestinian armed 
groups. However, in the case of Imad Abu Askar, the Mission is satisfied that he was not a 
Hamas operative. Apart from his father&#8217;s vehement and, in the Mission&#8217;s view, credible rejection 
of any such claim, two other factors appear relevant. Firstly, since it has become clear that Imad 
was a 13-year-old boy it is noticeable that Israel has not commented further on the allegation of 
his alleged Hamas activity in general or the allegation in particular that on the day in question he 
had launched mortars at Israel.  
</p>
<p>684. Secondly, the Israeli armed forces directly called Mr. Abu Askar early in the morning of 
6 January notifying him that his house would be attacked imminently. If Imad Abu Askar was as 
notorious and important as alleged, despite his young age, the Mission presumes that the Israeli 
authorities would have known where he lived and, in particular, that he lived in the very house 
they were about to destroy. It is extremely doubtful that the Israeli armed forces, having 
identified the house where alleged Hamas militants of some significance lived, would warn them 
so that they may escape and then bomb the house. 
</p>
<p>685. There is no indication that anyone of the name of Hassan Abu Askar was killed in the 
attacks as far as the Mission can determine. The Mission notes that the two Hamas operatives 
Israeli reports refer to were at least on one occasion referred to as brothers. Mr. Abu Askar 
confirms that there is no one of such a name in his family.  
</p>
<p>686. It would appear that shortly after the attack the Israeli armed forces received some 
information that two Abu Askar brothers had been killed. That much is indeed true. However, 
the use made of that information appears to the Mission to have been knowingly distorted. The 
brothers were Imad and Khaled, not Imad and Hassan as asserted. One was a 13-year-old boy, 
the other was a recently married 19-year-old. The certainty and specificity with which the Israeli 
authorities spoke at the time make it very difficult for them to suggest now that they had simply 
mixed up the names. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>687. The facts gathered by the Mission indicate that on 6 January 2006 at around 1.45 a.m. the 
Israeli forces called Mr. Abu Askar&#8217;s house, alerted him to the imminent strike on his house and 
proceeded to destroy it with an aerial strike about seven minutes later. As a result of the warning, 
Mr. Abu Askar was able to save himself and his family. The Mission finds that the Israeli forces 
did not seek to kill Mr. Abu Askar or the members of his family with this strike. 
</p>
<p>688. The Mission also finds that at around 4 p.m. Israeli forces launched at least four mortar 
shells. One landed in the al-Deeb courtyard, killing nine people immediately and two later on. 
</p>
<p>689. Three other shells landed on al-Fakhura Street, which was busy at the time, killing at least 
a further 24 people and injuring as many as 40. 
</p>
<p>690. The Mission notes that the attack may have been in response to a mortar attack from an 
armed Palestinian group but considers the credibility of Israel&#8217;s position damaged by the series 
of inconsistencies and factual inaccuracies. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>F. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>691. Elements of article 50 of Additional Protocol I reflect customary international law and 
provide the following:  
</p>
<p>2. The civilian population comprises all persons who are civilians. 
</p>
<p>3. The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not 
come within the definition of civilians does not deprive the population 
of its civilian character. 
</p>
<p>692. Article 57 is relevant in relation to the following provisions: 
</p>
<p>1. In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to 
spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. 
</p>
<p>2. With respect to attacks, the following precautions shall be taken: 
</p>
<p>(a) Those who plan or decide upon an attack shall: 
</p>
<p>(i) Do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are 
neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special 
protection but are military objectives within the meaning of paragraph 2 
of article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this 
Protocol to attack them; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of 
attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, 
incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian 
objects; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to 
cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to 
civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in 
relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; 
</p>
<p>(b) An attack shall be cancelled or suspended if it becomes apparent that the 
objective is not a military one or is subject to special protection or that the attack may be 
expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian 
objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and 
direct military advantage anticipated; 
</p>
<p>(c) Effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the 
civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit. 
</p>
<p>693. The Mission considers there are two key issues to be considered in the present case: the 
issue of proportionality in relation to the military advantage to be gained and the choice of 
weapons used. </p>

 <p> 
694. A detailed discussion of the difficulties of assessing military advantage is presented in the 
analysis of the Committee established to review the NATO bombing campaign against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998.<b>392</b> According to that Committee, the following are some 
of the relevant questions to be asked: 
</p>
<p>(a) What are the relative values to be assigned to the military advantage gained and the 
injury to non-combatants and or the damage to civilian objects? 
</p>
<p>(b) What do you include or exclude in totalling your sums? 
</p>
<p>(c) What is the standard of measurement in time or space? And 
</p>
<p>(d) To what extent is a military commander obligated to expose his own forces to danger 
in order to limit civilian casualties or damage to civilian objects? 
</p>
<p>695. The Committee reflected further: 
</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are not simple. It may be necessary to resolve 
them on a case-by-case basis, and the answers may differ depending on the background 
and values of the decision maker. It is unlikely that a human rights lawyer and an 
experienced combat commander would assign the same relative values to military 
advantage and to injury to non-combatants. Further, it is unlikely that military 
commanders with different doctrinal backgrounds and differing degrees of combat 
experience or national military histories would always agree in close cases. It is 
suggested that the determination of relative values must be that of the &quot;reasonable 
military commander&quot;. Although there will be room for argument in close cases, there 
will be many cases where reasonable military commanders will agree that the injury to 
non-combatants or the damage to civilian objects was clearly disproportionate to the 
military advantage gained. 
</p>
<p>696. Accepting that these views are helpful to inform the present discussion, the Mission finds 
the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) The military advantage to be gained was to stop the alleged firing of mortars that 
posed a risk to the lives of Israeli armed forces;  
</p>
<p>(b) Even if there were people firing mortars near al-Fakhura Street, the calculation of the 
military advantage had to be assessed bearing in mind the chances of success in killing the 
targets as against the risk of firing into a street full of civilians and very near a shelter with 
1,368 civilians and of which the Israeli authorities had been informed. 
</p>
<p>697. The Mission recognizes that for all armies proportionality decisions will present very 
genuine dilemmas in certain cases. The Mission does not consider this to be such a case.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>392</b> &#8220;Final report to the Prosecutor&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 47-50. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>698. The Mission does not say that the Israeli armed forces had to accept the risk to themselves 
at all cost, but in addressing that risk it appears to the Mission that they had ample opportunity to 
make a choice of weapons that would have significantly limited the risk to civilians in the area. 
According to the position the Government has itself taken, Israeli forces had a full 50 minutes to 
respond to this threat &#8211; or at least they took a full 50 minutes to respond to it. Given the 
mobilization speeds of helicopters and fighter jets in the context of the military operations in 
Gaza, the Mission finds it difficult to believe that mortars were the most accurate weapons 
available at the time. The time in question is almost 1 hour. The decision is difficult to justify. 
</p>
<p>699. The choice of weapon &#8211; mortars &#8211; appears to have been a reckless one. Mortars are area 
weapons. They kill or maim whoever is within the impact zone after detonation and they are 
incapable of distinguishing between combatants and civilians. A decision to deploy them in a 
location filled with civilians is a decision that a commander knows will result in the death and 
injuries of some of those civilians.  
</p>
<p>700. Even if the version of events presented now by Israel is to be believed, the Mission does 
not consider that the choice of deploying mortar weapons in a busy street with around 
150 civilians in it (not to mention those within the school) can be justified. The Mission does not 
consider that in these circumstances it was a choice that any reasonable commander would have 
made. 
</p>
<p>701. From the facts available to it, the Mission believes that there has been a violation of:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Additional Protocol I, articles 57 (2) (a) (ii) and (iii) as set out above; 
&#8226; The inherent right to life of the Palestinian civilians killed in the above incidents by 
</p>
<p>depriving them arbitrarily of their life in violation of article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>702. The Mission views as being unreliable the versions given by the Israeli authorities. The 
confusion as to what was hit, the erroneous allegations of who was specifically hit and where the 
armed groups were firing from, the indication that Israeli surveillance watched the scene but 
nonetheless could not detect where the strikes occurred, all combine to give the impression of 
either profound confusion or obfuscation. 
</p>
<p>703. Whatever the truth, the Mission is of the view that the deployment of at least four mortar 
shells to attempt to kill a small number of specified individuals in a setting where large numbers 
of civilians were going about their daily business and 1,368 people were sheltering nearby 
cannot meet the test of what a reasonable commander would have determined to be an acceptable 
loss of civilian life for the military advantage sought.  
</p>
<p><b>XI.  DELIBERATE ATTACKS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION 
</b></p>
<p>704. According to the Israeli Government, the Israeli armed forces&#8217; rules of engagement for 
the military operation in Gaza emphasized the principle of distinction as one of four &#8220;guiding 
principles that applied in an integrated and cumulative manner: military necessity, distinction, 
proportionality and humanity&#8221;. It defines the principle of distinction in the following terms: 
&#8220;Strikes shall be directed against military objectives and combatants only. It is absolutely </p>

 <p> 
prohibited to intentionally strike civilians or civilian objects (in contrast to incidental 
proportional harm).&#8221;<b>393</b> 
</p>
<p>705. The Mission investigated 11 incidents in which serious allegations of direct attacks with 
lethal outcome were made against civilians. There appears to have been no justifiable military 
objective pursued in any of them. The first two incidents concern alleged attacks by Israeli 
armed forces against houses in the al-Samouni neighbourhood of Gaza during the initial phase of 
the ground invasion. The following group of seven incidents concern the alleged shooting of 
civilians who were trying to leave their homes to walk to a safer place, waving white flags and, 
in some of the cases, following an injunction from the Israeli armed forces to do so. In the last of 
these seven cases, a house was allegedly shelled with white phosphorous, killing five and 
injuring others. Two further members of the family were allegedly shot by Israeli troops as they 
tried to evacuate the wounded to a hospital. In the following incident, a mosque was targeted 
during the early evening prayer, resulting in the death of 15. In many of the incidents, the Israeli 
armed forces allegedly obstructed emergency medical help to the wounded. A further incident 
concerns the bombing of a family house, killing 22 family members. In the last of the incidents 
described, a crowd of family and neighbours at a condolence tent was attacked with flechettes. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Attacks on the houses of Ateya al-Samouni and Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni in Zeytoun, 
resulting in the death of 23 members of the al-Samouni family</b> 
</p>
<p>706. To investigate the attacks on the houses of Ateya and Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni, which killed

Two members of the extended al-Samouni family, who were eyewitnesses to the incident,

interviewed PRCS ambulance drivers who went to the area on 4, 7 and 18 January 2009, and 
obtained copies of PRCS records. The Mission finally reviewed material on this incident 
submitted to it by TAWTHEQ as well as by NGOs.

<p>707. The so-called al-Samouni area is part of Zeytoun, south of Gaza City, bordered to the east 
by al-Sekka Street, which in that part of Gaza runs parallel and very close to Salah ad-Din Street. 
It is inhabited by members of the extended al-Samouni family, which gives its name to the area, 
as well as by other families, such as the Arafats and the Hajjis. Al-Samouni area is more rural 
than urban, houses used to stand next to small olive and fig groves, chicken coops and other 
small plots of agricultural land. A small mosque stood in the centre of the neighbourhood. These 
no longer existed at the time of the Mission&#8217;s visit in June 2009. The Mission saw very few

<p>708. The Israeli ground offensive from the east reached al-Samouni neighbourhood around 
4 a.m. on 4 January 2009. In addition to the ground forces moving in from the east, there were, 
in all likelihood, heliborne<b>397</b> troops that landed on the roofs of several houses in the area. 
Residents told the Mission that there was shooting in the neighbourhood in the night of 3 to 
4 January and again the following night, but denied having seen any Palestinian fighters.  
</p>
<p><b>1. The killing of Ateya al-Samouni and his son Ahmad 
</b></p>
<p>709. During the morning of 4 January 2009, Israeli soldiers entered many of the houses in 
al-Samouni area. One of the first, around 5 a.m., was the house of Ateya Helmi al-Samouni, a 
45-year-old man. Faraj, his 22-year-old son, had already met Israeli soldiers some minutes 
earlier as he stepped outside the house to warn his neighbours that their roof was burning. The 
soldiers entered Ateya al-Samouni&#8217;s house by force, throwing some explosive device, possibly a 
grenade. In the midst of the smoke, fire and loud noise, Ateya al-Samouni stepped forward, his 
arms raised, and declared that he was the owner of the house. The soldiers shot him while he was 
still holding his ID and an Israeli driving licence in his hands. The soldiers then opened gunfire 
inside the room in which all the approximately 20 family members were gathered. Several were 
injured, Ahmad, a boy of four, particularly seriously. Soldiers with night vision equipment 
entered the room and closely inspected each of those present. The soldiers then moved to the 
next room and set fire to it. The smoke from that room soon started to suffocate the family. A 
witness speaking to the Mission recalled seeing &#8220;white stuff&#8221; coming out of the mouth of his 
17-month-old nephew and helping him to breathe.  
</p>
<p>710. At about 6.30 a.m. the soldiers ordered the family to leave the house. They had to leave 
Ateya&#8217;s body behind but were carrying Ahmad, who was still breathing. The family tried to enter 
the house of an uncle next door, but were not allowed to do so by the soldiers. The soldiers told 
them to take the road and leave the area, but a few metres further a different group of soldiers 
stopped them and ordered the men to undress completely. Faraj al-Samouni, who was carrying 
the severely injured Ahmad, pleaded with them to be allowed to take the injured to Gaza. The 
soldiers allegedly replied using abusive language. They also said &#8220;You are bad Arabs&#8221;. &#8220;You go 
to Nitzarim&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>711. Faraj al-Samouni, his mother and others entered the house of an uncle in the 
neighbourhood. From there, they called PRCS. As described below, at around 4 p.m. that day 
a PRCS ambulance managed to come in the vicinity of the house where Ahmad was lying 
wounded, but was prevented by the Israeli armed forces from rescuing him. Ahmad died at

<b>396</b> The UNOSAT report (p. 21) counts &#8220;114 &#8230; destroyed or severely damaged buildings, &#8230; 27 damaged 
greenhouse complexes, and 17 impact craters along roads or in cultivated fields&#8221; in the area of al-Samouni Street. 
A soldier stationed in Zeytoun during the military operations recalled that he observed through his binoculars 
&#8220;increasing devastation. Houses that disappear with time, farm land ploughed over time.&#8221; (<i>Soldiers&#8217; testimonies&#8230;</i>, 
testimony 37, p. 82). 
<b>397</b> One witness told the Mission that on 5 January 2009, walking on Salah ad-Din Street towards Gaza, he saw by 
the roadside parachutes Israeli troops had used to land in the area. </p>

 <p> 
around 2 a.m. during the night of 4 to 5 January.<b>398</b> The following morning those present in the 
house, about 45 persons, decided to leave. They made themselves white flags and walked in the 
direction of Salah ad-Din Street. A group of soldiers on the street told them to go back to the 
house, but the witness said that they walked on in the direction of Gaza. The soldiers shot at their 
feet, without injuring anyone, however. Two kilometres further north on Salah ad-Din Street, 
they found ambulances which took the injured to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.  
</p>
<p><b>2. The attack on the house of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni 
</b></p>
<p>712. In other cases, the entry of soldiers was less violent than in Ateya al-Samouni&#8217;s home. In 
one instance, the soldiers landed on the roof and descended the stairs to the ground floor, 
separated men from women, searched and handcuffed the men.<b>399</b> In another case they broke into 
a house by knocking a hole in the wall with a sledgehammer.<b>400</b> At the house of Saleh al-
Samouni, the Israeli soldiers knocked on the door and ordered those inside to open it. All the 
persons inside the house stepped out one by one and Saleh&#8217;s father identified each of the family 
members in Hebrew for the soldiers. According to Saleh al-Samouni, they asked to be allowed to 
go to Gaza City, but the soldiers refused and instead ordered them to go to Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s 
house across the street. 
</p>
<p>713. The Israeli soldiers also ordered those in other houses to move to Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s 
house. As a result, around 100 members of the extended al-Samouni family, the majority women 
and children, were assembled in that house by noon on 4 January. There was hardly any water 
and no milk for the babies. Around 5 p.m. on 4 January, one of the women went outside to fetch 
firewood. There was some flour in the house and she made bread, one piece for each of those 
present.  
</p>
<p>714. In the morning of 5 January 2009, around 6.30 &#8211; 7 a.m., Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni, Saleh al-
Samouni, Hamdi Maher al-Samouni, Muhammad Ibrahim al-Samouni and Iyad al-Samouni, 
stepped outside the house to collect firewood. Rashad Helmi al-Samouni remained standing next 
to the door of the house. Saleh al-Samouni has pointed out to the Mission that from where the 
Israeli soldiers were positioned on the roofs of the houses they could see the men clearly. 
Suddenly, a projectile struck next to the five men, close to the door of Wa&#8217;el&#8217;s house and killed 
Muhammad Ibrahim al-Samouni and, probably, Hamdi Maher al-Samouni.<b>401</b> The other men 
managed to retreat to the house. Within about five minutes, two or three more projectiles had 
struck the house directly. Saleh and Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni stated at the public hearing that these 
were missiles launched from Apache helicopters. The Mission has not been able to determine the 
type of munition used.  
                                                 
<b>398</b> Faraj al-Samouni also told the Mission that, at the time of Ahmad's death, another relative gave birth to a baby in 
the same house. The following day the mother, who had to be transported in a wheelchair because she had broken 
her leg doing household chores, and the baby were among the group that managed to evacuate to Gaza City. Mother 
and child are in good health.

<b>400</b> Testimony of Saleh al-Samouni, 3 June 2009. 
<b>401</b> The Mission notes that while all testimonies agree that Muhammad Ibrahim al-Samouni died on the spot, there 
are some discrepancies as to whether Hamdi Maher al-Samouni was killed by the first strike or died subsequently 
inside the house. </p>

 <p> 
715. Saleh al-Samouni stated that overall 21 family members were killed and 19 injured in the 
attack on Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house. The dead include Saleh al-Samouni&#8217;s father, Talal Helmi 
al-Samouni, his mother, Rahma Muhammad al-Samouni, and his two-year-old daughter Azza. 
Three of his sons, aged five, three and less than one year (Mahmoud, Omar and Ahmad), were 
injured, but survived. Of Wa&#8217;el&#8217;s immediate family, a daughter and a son (Rezqa, 14, and Fares, 
12) were killed, while two smaller children (Abdullah and Muhammad) were injured.<b>402</b> The 
photographs of all the dead victims were shown to the Mission at the home of the al-Samouni 
family and displayed at the public hearing in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>716. After the shelling of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house, most of those inside decided to leave 
immediately and walk to Gaza City, leaving behind the dead and some of the wounded. The 
women waved their scarves. Soldiers, however, ordered the al-Samounis to return to the house. 
When family members replied that there were many injured among them, the soldiers&#8217; reaction 
was, according to Saleh al-Samouni, &#8220;go back to death&#8221;. They decided not to follow this 
injunction and walked in the direction of Gaza City. Once in Gaza, they went to PRCS and told 
them about the injured that had remained behind. 
</p>
<p><b>3. The attempts of PRCS and ICRC to rescue the civilians  
in the al-Samouni area 
</b></p>
<p>717. PRCS had made its first attempt to evacuate the injured from the al-Samouni area on 4 
January 2009 around 4 p.m. after receiving a call from the family of Ateya al-Samouni. PRCS 
had called ICRC, asking it to coordinate its entry into the area with the Israeli armed forces. A 
PRCS ambulance from al-Quds hospital managed to reach the al-Samouni area. The ambulance 
had turned west off Salah ad-Din Street when, at one of the first houses in the area, Israeli 
soldiers on the ground and on the roof of one of the houses directed their guns at it and ordered it 
to stop. The driver and the nurse were ordered to get out of the vehicle, raise their hands, take off 
their clothes and lie on the ground. Israeli soldiers then searched them and the vehicle for 5 to 
10 minutes. Having found nothing, the soldiers ordered the ambulance team to return to Gaza 
City, in spite of their pleas to be allowed to pick up some wounded. In his statement to the 
Mission, the ambulance driver recalled seeing women and children huddling under the staircase 
in a house, but not being allowed to take them with him.<b>403</b> 
</p>
<p>718. As soon as the first evacuees from the al-Samouni family arrived in Gaza City on 
5 January, PRCS and ICRC requested permission from the Israeli armed forces to go into the 
al Samouni neighbourhood to evacuate the wounded. These requests were denied. On 6 January 
around 6.45 p.m., one ICRC car and four PRCS ambulances drove towards the al-Samouni area 
</p>

<b>402</b> The names of the other 15 members of the extended al-Samouni family killed in the attack on Wa&#8217;el al-
Samouni&#8217;s house are: Rabab Izaat (female, aged 37); Tawfiq Rashad (male, aged 22); Layla Nabeeh (female, aged 
44); Ismaeil Ibrahim (male, aged 16); Ishaq Ibrahim (male, aged 14); Maha Muhammad (female, aged 20);

 <p> 
in spite of the lack of coordination with the Israeli armed forces, but were not allowed to enter 
the area and evacuate the wounded.  
</p>
<p>719. On 7 January 2009, the Israeli armed forces finally authorized ICRC and PRCS to go to 
the al-Samouni area during the &#8220;temporary ceasefire&#8221; declared from 1 to 4 p.m. on that day.<b>404</b> 
Three PRCS ambulances, an ICRC car and another car used to transport bodies drove down 
Salah ad-Din Street from Gaza City until, 1.5 km north of the al-Samouni area, they found it 
closed by sand mounds. ICRC tried to coordinate with the Israeli armed forces to have the road 
opened, but they refused and asked the ambulance staff to walk the remaining 1.5 km.  
</p>
<p>720. Once in the al-Samouni neighbourhood, PRCS looked for survivors in the houses. An 
ambulance driver who was part of the team told the Mission that in Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house 
they found 15 dead bodies and two seriously injured children.<b>405</b> One of the children had a deep 
wound in the shoulder, which was infected and giving off a foul odour. The children were 
dehydrated and scared of the PRCS staff member. In a house close by, they found 11 persons in 
one room, including a dead woman.  
</p>
<p>721. The rescue teams had only three hours for the entire operation and the evacuees were 
physically weak and emotionally very unstable. The road had been damaged by the impact of 
shells and the movement of Israeli armed forces, including tanks and bulldozers. The rescuers 
put all the elderly on a cart and pulled it themselves for 1.5 kilometres to the place where they 
had been forced to leave the ambulances. The dead bodies lying in the street or under the rubble, 
among them women and children, as well as the dead they had found in the houses had to be left 
behind. On the way back to the cars, PRCS staff entered one house where they found a man with 
two broken legs. While they were carrying the man out of the house, the Israeli armed forces 
started firing at the house, probably to warn that the three-hour &#8220;temporary ceasefire&#8221; were about 
to expire. PRCS was not able to return to the area until 18 January.  
</p>
<p>722. On 18 January 2009, members of the al-Samouni family were finally able to return to their 
neighbourhood. They found that Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house, as most other houses in the 
neighbourhood and the small mosque, had been demolished. The Israeli armed forces had 
destroyed the building on top of the bodies of those who died in the attack. Pictures taken on 
18 January show feet and legs sticking out from under the rubble and sand, and rescuers pulling 
out the bodies of women, men and children. A witness described to the Mission family members 
taking away the corpses on horse carts, a young man sitting in shock beside the ruins of his 
house and, above all, the extremely strong smell of death.<b>406</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>723. The Mission found the foregoing witnesses to be credible and reliable. It has no reason to 
doubt their testimony. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>404</b> Mission interview with PRCS driver W1, 10 June 2009. 
<b>405</b> Ibid. 
<b>406</b> Mission interview with witness W2, 7 June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
724. With regard to the context in which the attacks on the houses of Ateya al-Samouni and 
Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni took place, the Mission notes that there is some indication that there might 
have been a presence of Palestinian combatants in the al-Samouni neighbourhood during the first 
hours of the Israeli ground attack. A witness told the Mission that when he heard the first shots in 
the vicinity of his house in the night of 3 to 4 January, he at first thought it was Palestinian 
fighters. An NGO report submitted to the Mission states that a Palestinian combatant, reportedly 
a member of the Islamic Jihad, was killed in the al-Samouni area around midnight between 3 and 
4 January.<b>407</b> 
</p>
<p>725. The Mission considers, however, that the testimonies of the witnesses strongly suggest 
that already before daybreak on 4 January 2009 the Israeli armed forces were in full control of 
the al-Samouni neighbourhood. The Israeli soldiers had taken up position on the roofs of the 
houses in the area. According to several witnesses, the soldiers on the street spoke to residents 
who had ventured out of their houses.<b>408</b> In some cases (for instance, at the house of Saleh 
al-Samouni and at the house Iyad al-Samouni was in, see below), they entered the houses 
non-violently after knocking on the door. According to Saleh al-Samouni, the prolonged 
identification of all the persons present in his house (his father identifying each family member 
in Hebrew for the soldiers) took place outside. The soldiers appear to have been confident that 
they were not at immediate risk of being attacked. 
</p>
<p>726. The Mission also reviewed the submission it received from an Israeli researcher, arguing 
generally that statements from Palestinian residents claiming that no fighting took place in their 
neighbourhood are disproved by the accounts Palestinian armed groups give of the armed 
operations. The Mission notes that, as far as the al-Samouni neighbourhood is concerned, this 
report would appear to support the statements of the witnesses that there was no combat.<b>409</b>   
</p>
<p>727. Regarding the attack on Ateya al-Samouni&#8217;s house, the Mission finds that the account 
given to it by Faraj al-Samouni is corroborated by the soldiers&#8217; testimonies published by the 
Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence. The assault on Ateya al-Samouni&#8217;s house appears to be the 
procedure of the Israeli armed forces referred to as a &#8220;wet entry&#8221;. A &#8220;wet entry&#8221; is, according to 
the soldier&#8217;s explanation, &#8220;missiles, tank fire, machine-gun fire into the house, grenades. Shoot 
as we enter a room. The idea was that when we enter a house, no one there could fire at us.&#8221; This 
procedure was, according to the soldier, thoroughly practised during recent Israeli armed forces 
manoeuvres.<b>410</b>  
</p>
<p>728. The Mission notes that considering the generally calm circumstances that appear to have 
prevailed in the al-Samouni neighbourhood at the time (as evidenced by the way the soldiers

<b>409</b> &#8220;The hidden dimension of Palestinian war casualties&#8230;&#8221;. Only 4 of the more than 100 entries in the submission 
refer to combat action in Zeytoun, the much larger part of Gaza City of which al-Samouni neighbourhood is a part. 
The incidents in Zeytoun that are mentioned reportedly occurred on 6, 7, 11 and 13 January 2009, and consist of 
Palestinian combatants opening fire against Israeli troops with rocket-propelled grenades, a mortar (in one case) and 
detonating an explosive device.

 <p> 
entered other houses after knocking on the door) and the fact that the soldiers had already spoken 
to Faraj al-Samouni, one of the persons in Ateya al-Samouni&#8217;s house, the Mission cannot see any 
circumstance justifying the violent entry into the house. 
</p>
<p>729. With regard to the attack on the five men who stepped out of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house to 
fetch firewood in the early morning of 5 January 2009 and to the subsequent shelling of the 
house, the Mission notes that the members of the other families who had been moved by the 
Israeli forces into Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house had been searched by Israeli soldiers, as recounted 
by Saleh al-Samouni. Everything indicates that the Israeli forces knew that there were about 
100 civilians in the house. Indeed, the families had asked to be allowed to leave the area towards 
a safer place, but had been ordered to stay in Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house. The house must have 
been under constant observation by the Israeli soldiers, who had complete control over the area 
at the time.  
</p>
<p>730. The Mission was not able to determine whether the attack was carried out by missiles 
launched from Apache helicopters, as Saleh and Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni told the Mission at the public 
hearing in Gaza, or by other munitions. Nevertheless, the fact that a first projectile struck next to 
the five men soon after they had left the house (at a time at which there was no combat in the 
area) and two or three projectiles struck the house after the survivors had retreated into the 
house, indicates that the weaponry used allowed a high degree of precision with a short response 
time and that the five men and then the house were the intended targets of the attack. 
</p>
<p>731. The Mission notes that, four days later, the Israeli armed forces denied that the attack on 
the house of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni had taken place. On 9 January 2009, an Israeli army spokesman, 
Jacob Dallal, reportedly told the Reuters news agency that &#8220;the IDF did not mass people into any 
specific building. [&#8230;] Furthermore, we checked with regard to IDF fire on the 5th. The IDF did 
not target any building in or near Zeitun on the 5th.&#8221;<b>411</b> The Mission is not aware of any 
subsequent statement from the Israeli Government which would contradict this blanket denial or 
suggest that the allegations have been the subject of further investigation. 
</p>
<p>732. With regard to the obstruction of emergency medical access to the wounded in the 
al-Samouni neighbourhood, the Mission notes that four-year-old Ahmad al-Samouni was still 
alive at 4 p.m. on 4 January 2009, when the PRCS ambulance called by his relatives managed to 
arrive within what the Mission estimates to be 100 to 200 metres from the house where he was. 
In fact, he died about 10 hours later, which suggests that he might have had a good chance of 
survival. Israeli soldiers stopped the ambulance and thoroughly searched the driver, nurse and 
vehicle.<b>412</b> Although they did not find anything indicating that the ambulance staff was not on a 
genuine emergency mission to evacuate a wounded civilian, they forced the ambulance to return 
to Gaza City without the injured Ahmad.  
</p>
<p>733. On 5 and 6 January 2009, following the arrival in Gaza City hospitals of survivors of the 
attack on Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house, PRCS and ICRC requested permission from the Israeli 
                                                 
<b>411</b> http://www.javno.com/en-world/gaza-boy-recounts-house-of-death_222451.  
<b>412</b> In addition to searching the ambulance driver and the nurse, the Israeli soldiers also appear to have intended to 
humiliate them by forcing them to lie down on the street in their underwear for 5 to 10 minutes, in the cold of an 
early January late afternoon. </p>

 <p> 
armed forces to go into the al-Samouni neighbourhood to evacuate the wounded. These requests 
were denied. According to the information available to PRCS, the Israeli armed forces told ICRC 
that there were combat operations going on in the area. A PRCS ambulance driver who was part 
of the PRCS convoy which went to the area in spite of the refusal of the Israeli armed forces to 
grant permission, reported that there were no clashes at the time.<b>413</b> PRCS and ICRC were not 
able to evacuate the wounded from the area until 7 January in the afternoon. 
</p>
<p>734. The information before it leads the Mission to believe that the Israeli armed forces 
arbitrarily prevented the evacuation of the wounded from the al-Samouni area, thereby causing at 
least one additional death, worsening of the injuries in others, and severe psychological trauma 
in at least some of the victims, particularly children. 
</p>
<p>735. These findings are corroborated by the press release ICRC issued on 8 January 2008:  
</p>
<p>The ICRC had requested safe passage for ambulances to access this neighbourhood 
[the al-Samouni area in Zeytoun] since 3 January but it only received permission to do so 
from the Israel Defense Forces during the afternoon of 7 January.  
</p>
<p>The ICRC/PRCS team found four small children next to their dead mothers in one 
of the houses. They were too weak to stand up on their own. One man was also found 
alive, too weak to stand up. In all there were at least 12 corpses lying on mattresses.  
</p>
<p>In another house, the ICRC/PRCS rescue team found 15 other survivors of this 
attack including several wounded. In yet another house, they found an additional three 
corpses. Israeli soldiers posted at a military position some 80 metres away from this house 
ordered the rescue team to leave the area which they refused to do. There were several 
other positions of the Israel Defense Forces nearby as well as two tanks.<b>414</b>

</b></p>
<p><b>1. The shooting of Iyad al-Samouni 
</b></p>
<p>736. The Mission received testimony on the death of Iyad al-Samouni from Muhammad Asaad 
al-Samouni and Fawzi Arafat, as well as from a PRCS staff member. In the night of 3 to 
4 January 2009, Iyad al-Samouni, his wife and five children were, together with about 40 other 
members of their extended family in Asaad al-Samouni&#8217;s house, very close to the houses of 
Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni and Ateya al-Samouni (the scenes of the incidents described above). At 1 a.m. 
on 4 January 2009 they heard noise on the roof. At around 5 a.m. Israeli soldiers walked down 
the stairs from the roof, knocked on the door and entered the house. They asked for Hamas 
fighters. The residents replied that there were none. The soldiers then separated women, children 
and the elderly from the men. The men were forced into a separate room, blindfolded and 
handcuffed with plastic handcuffs. They were allowed to go to the toilet only after one of the 
men urinated on himself. The soldiers stationed themselves in the house.

 <p> 
</p><p>737. In the morning of 5 January 2009, after the shelling of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house, two of 
the survivors took refuge in Asaad al-Samouni&#8217;s house. From the testimonies received, the 
Mission is not able to state whether the Israeli soldiers then ordered the al-Samouni family 
members in the house to leave and walk to Gaza City, or whether it was the families who 
pleaded with the soldiers to be allowed to leave having heard the appalling news of what had 
happened to their relatives in Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house. In any event, the persons assembled in 
Asaad al-Samouni&#8217;s house walked out of the house and down al-Samouni Street to take Salah 
ad-Din Street in the direction of Gaza City. They had been instructed by the soldiers to walk 
directly to Gaza City without stopping or diverting from the direct route. The men were still 
handcuffed and the soldiers had told them that they would be shot if they attempted to remove 
the handcuffs. 
</p>
<p>738. On Salah ad-Din Street, just a few metres north of al-Samouni Street and in front of the 
Juha family house,<b>415</b> a single or several of the Israeli soldiers positioned on the roofs of the 
houses opened fire. Iyad was struck in the leg and fell to the ground.<b>416</b> Muhammad Asaad 
al-Samouni, who was walking immediately behind him, moved to help him, but an Israeli soldier 
on a rooftop ordered him to walk on. When he saw the red point of a laser beam on his body and 
understood that an Israeli soldier had taken aim at him, he desisted. The Israeli soldiers also fired 
warning shots at Muhammad Asaad al-Samouni&#8217;s father to prevent him from assisting Iyad to 
get back on his feet. Iyad al-Samouni&#8217;s wife and children were prevented from helping him by 
further warning shots. Fawzi Arafat, who was part of another group walking from the 
al-Samouni neighbourhood to Gaza, told the Mission that he saw Iyad al-Samouni lying on the 
ground, his hands shackled with white plastic handcuffs, blood pouring from the wounds in his 
legs, begging for help. Fawzi Arafat stated that he yelled at an Israeli soldier &#8220;we want to 
evacuate the wounded man&#8221;. The soldier, however, pointed his gun at Iyad&#8217;s wife and children 
and ordered them to move on without him. 
</p>
<p>739. Iyad al-Samouni&#8217;s family and relatives were forced to abandon him and continue to walk 
towards Gaza City. At al-Shifa hospital they reported his case and those of the other dead and 
wounded left behind. Representatives of PRCS told them that the Israeli armed forces were not 
permitting them to access the area.  
</p>
<p>740. A PRCS staff member<b>417</b> told the Mission that three days later, on 8 January 2009, PRCS 
was granted permission by the Israeli armed forces through ICRC to evacuate Iyad al-Samouni. 
The PRCS staff member found him on the ground in Salah ad-Din Street in the place described 
by his relatives. He was still handcuffed. He had been shot in both legs and had bled to death. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>415</b> This is the home of the family of Mu&#8217;een Juha, see the case of the shooting of Ibrahim Juha discussed below in 
the chapter. 
<b>416</b> According to the researchers of a Palestinian NGO who investigated this case, the mobile phone in the pocket of 
the cousin walking in front of Iyad al-Samouni rang and Iyad al-Samouni tried to take the phone out of his pocket 
(the cousin&#8217;s hands were tied as well, so he could not reach into his pocket himself), whereupon the Israeli soldier 
opened fire. This detail was not mentioned to the Mission in its interviews. 
<b>417</b> Mission interview with PRCS driver W4, 10 June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>741. The Mission found the witnesses it heard in relation to the shooting of Iyad al-Samouni 
to be credible and reliable. It has no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of their 
testimony, which is corroborated by the testimony of the PRCS ambulance driver. 
</p>
<p>742. The Mission finds that Iyad al-Samouni was part of a large group of civilians who were 
leaving their homes and walking towards Gaza City in an area under the complete control of the 
Israeli armed forces. His hands were tied with white plastic handcuffs. The soldier who opened 
fire on him should have known, on the basis of the plastic handcuffs if not of coordination with 
his fellow soldiers stationed in Asaad al-Samouni&#8217;s house a few hundred metres away, that he 
had been searched and detained by the Israeli armed forces. In opening fire on Iyad al-Samouni, 
the Israeli armed forces shot deliberately at a civilian who posed no threat to them.  
</p>
<p>743. While the fire directed at Iyad al-Samouni could have been intended to incapacitate rather 
than to kill, by threatening his family members and friends with lethal fire, the Israeli armed 
forces ensured that he did not receive lifesaving medical help. They deliberately let him bleed to 
death. 
</p>
<p>744. The Mission found that the witnesses who spoke about the death of Iyad al-Samouni 
appeared to be profoundly traumatized by the recollection of his pleading for help from his wife, 
children and relatives. They also recalled the helplessness of his family, who were under a very 
credible threat of being shot themselves if they came to his help, and who were compelled to 
abandon him on the road to bleed to death. 
</p>
<p><b>3. The death of Muhammad Hajji in the attack on his family&#8217;s house  
and the shooting of Shahd Hajji and Ola Masood Arafat 
</b></p>
<p>745. The Mission interviewed Mrs. Abir Hajji in private and received her testimony at the 
public hearing in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>746. In the night of 4 to 5 January 2009, the family of Muhammad Hajji and his wife Abir<b>418</b> 
was at home in the al-Samouni neighbourhood. In the hope of being safer from the shooting, 
they had put their mattresses on the floor. At around 1.30 a.m., Abir Hajji heard a very loud 
explosion, which shook the house and shattered the windows. Some minutes later, Abir Hajji 
was in a different room from the rest of the family, looking for her mobile phone to use as a 
torch, when she heard a second explosion, this time apparently inside the house. The children 
screamed, shouted &#8220;Dad!&#8221;, but her husband did not reply. In the pitch-darkness she found her 
husband and felt that he was injured on one side of his head, in the area of the eye and the ear. 
Her daughters Noor, aged 6, and Nagham, aged 13, were injured.  
</p>
<p>747. She called her neighbour and brother-in-law, Nasser Hajji, who examined his brother 
and told her that he was dead. As they were preparing to move to Nasser Hajji&#8217;s house, Israeli 
soldiers broke into the house shooting. The soldiers asked Nasser Hajji whether he &#8220;was 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>418</b> Muhammad and Abir Hajji had five children, four daughters, Ghada (aged 16), Nagham (aged 13), Noor al-Huda 
(aged 6) and Shahd (aged 3), and a son, Amin (aged 11).  </p>

 <p> 
Hamas&#8221;, which he denied assuring them that nobody in the area was a member of either Hamas 
or Fatah. Mrs. Hajji remembers the soldiers laughing and insisting that Nasser Hajji &#8220;was 
Hamas&#8221;. The laughing added to her pain, as the soldiers had seen her dead husband and the 
children. Nasser Hajji was ordered to undress and then pull his brother&#8217;s body to another room, 
where the soldiers threw mattresses and blankets on the body (the body was still lying in the 
same position when Abir Hajji returned to her home two weeks later). Her children asked her 
whether they would be killed as well. She told them to say the <i>Shehada</i>, the prayer recited in the 
face of death. Mrs. Hajji also recalled that the soldiers were breaking the tiles on the floor of the 
house and digging in the earth below. Asked about this at the public hearing, she expressed the 
opinion that this was to obtain sand for the sandbags they subsequently placed on the roof of the 
house.<b>419</b>  
</p>
<p>748. After some time, during which they were sitting on the ground as ordered by the Israeli 
soldiers, Mrs. Hajji, her children and Nasser Hajji were taken to Nasser&#8217;s house. There they 
found four households of the extended Hajji family. The young men had been handcuffed and 
four of them also blindfolded. About 60 Israeli soldiers were in the house. Mrs. Hajji recalled 
them carrying around food and drinks and relaxing in the couches. One of her daughters asked to 
be allowed to eat something. The soldiers first denied her request, but then allowed her to go into 
the kitchen and get a small piece of bread.  
</p>
<p>749. After the midday prayers on 5 January 2009, the Israeli soldiers separated the men from 
the women and children. The latter were ordered to walk to Rafah. The Hajjis protested, asking 
to be allowed to go to Gaza City, where they had relatives, but the soldiers told them that they 
would be shot if they tried to walk to Gaza City. Nasser Hajji and his 18-year-old son were 
allowed to walk with the women and children, while the other men stayed behind.<b>420</b> 
</p>
<p>750. The group of Hajji family members walked down the alley to al-Sekka Street. There they 
were joined by members of the Arafat family, who also live in the al-Samouni neighbourhood, 
carrying white flags. On al-Sekka Street, one of the Israeli soldiers standing on a rooftop ordered 
the families to turn south and walk towards Rafah. The families begged to be allowed to walk to 
Gaza City instead. Without warning, the Israeli soldiers opened fire, &#8220;shooting at random&#8221; 
according to Abir Hajji. Ola Masood Arafat, a 28-year-old woman, was struck by a bullet and 
died on the spot. Mrs. Hajji was wounded in her right arm. Her three-year-old daughter Shahd 
was shot in the chest. Abir Hajji, who was still carrying Shahd, her other children, her mother-in-
law and others managed to take refuge in a house. There they found out that Shahd was still 
alive. 
</p>
<p>751. Later on, they left the house and walked together with other families to Salah ad-Din 
Street and then south on that road. When they reached the Gaza wadi, a motorist took Abir Hajji 
and her daughter Shahd to a hospital in Deir al-Balah. Shahd died of her wound very soon after 
                                                 
<b>419</b> <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i> suggests that breaking the tiles in civilian homes was a standard practice with two 
purposes: to fill sandbags ( &#8220;Take for example the house we were in &#8211; it was abandoned and you go about it as if 
you own it. You break floor tiles to make sandbags, you break stuff to prepare an outpost&#8221;, testimony 46, p. 100,) 
and to search for tunnels (&#8220;You're also told to wreck the floor tiles to check for tunnels&#8221;, testimony 23, p. 54) 
<b>420</b> Abir Hajji learned after the armed operations that they had been detained in that house for another three days and 
then released. </p>

 <p> 
arriving at the hospital. Abir Hajji, who was two months pregnant at the time, also suffered a 
miscarriage. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>752. The Mission found Mrs. Hajji to be a credible and reliable witness. It has no reason to 
doubt the veracity of her testimony. The Mission also notes that according to the testimony of 
four other witnesses (those it heard in the case of Ibrahim Juha below), a very similar incident 
occurred in the immediate vicinity on the same day. 
</p>
<p>753. With regard to the death of Muhammad Hajji, the Mission notes that Mrs. Hajji&#8217;s 
testimony does not provide sufficient information to establish exactly what happened. On the 
basis of the information before it, the Mission can neither make a statement as to what type 
of weapon killed him, nor as to whether he was the intended target of a direct attack. The 
circumstances of his death suggest, however, that he was killed by fire from the Israeli armed 
forces while at home in a room with his children. 
</p>
<p>754. As to the fatal shooting of Shahd Hajji and Ola Masood Arafat, Mrs. Hajji&#8217;s testimony as 
well as that of Mr. Mu&#8217;een Juha and Mrs. Juha, the parents of Ibrahim Juha, of Mr. Sameh 
Sawafeary and of Mr. Rajab Darwish Mughrabi (see the case of Ibrahim Juha below) all 
establish that there were no combat operations in the area at the time of the incident. Indeed, the 
Israeli armed forces would not have ordered the members of the extended Hajji, Arafat, Juha and 
Sawafeary families to walk to Rafah, thereby asking hundreds of civilians to come out of their 
houses and fill the streets, if there had been any fighting in the neighbourhood at the time. The 
Israeli armed forces opened fire on a group of persons they had interacted with during the 
preceding 12 hours and therefore knew to be civilians. In doing so they killed Ola Masood Arafat 
and three-year-old Shahd Hajji and injured her mother, who was holding her in her arms. 
</p>
<p><b>5. The shooting of Ibrahim Juha 
</b></p>
<p>755. The Mission interviewed three eyewitnesses to the shooting of Ibrahim Juha and a further 
witness of the events surrounding the shooting.<b>421</b> The events preceding and following the 
shooting of Ibrahim Juha are described in greater detail in chapter XIII below in connection with 
the destruction of the Sawafeary chicken farms. 
</p>
<p>756. The Juha family lives in a house on al-Sekka Street a few meters north of where al-
Samouni Street goes off Salah ad-Din Street to the west. The house was struck by several 
missiles during the night of 3 to 4 January 2009, which had caused significant destruction. In the 
early morning of 4 January, Israeli soldiers entered the house and fired into the room where the 
Juha family, consisting of Mr. Juha, his two wives, his mother and 13 children, was assembled. 
Photographs of the scene taken by Mr. Juha show that numerous rounds were discharged. The 
family was made to assemble in the upper part of the house. They were then ordered to leave the 
house and walk towards Rafah.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>421</b> Mr. Mu&#8217;een Juha and Mrs. Juha, the parents of Ibrahim, Mr. Sameh Sawafeary and Mr. Mughrabi. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>757. The Juha family and their neighbours, the Sawafeary family, walked down al-Sekka Street 
for 100 metres in the direction of Rafah. When they reached the house of another neighbour, 
Mr. Abu Zur, they were invited into that house and decided to stay there. The three families 
spent 4 January in the house. On the morning of 5 January the house was the subject of intense 
firing from Israeli troops in the vicinity. After some time Israeli soldiers approached the house 
and ordered everyone to come out. The men were separated from the women. From the group of 
men four were separated and required to strip to their underwear. They were held in a house 
opposite the Abu Zur house, belonging to Mr. Subhi al-Samouni. The remaining group was told 
once again to leave the area and walk towards Rafah. Mr. Juha recounts that walking down 
al Sekka Street the group came to a point where a large crater blocked the way ahead and the 
surrounding rubble provided a difficult obstacle for some members of his family, including his 
ageing mother, who had fainted shortly before outside the Abu Zur house. 
</p>
<p>758. In the face of these obstacles the group of three families walked east towards Salah ad-Din 
Street. There they entered the house of another family, the Mughrabis. With the arrival of the 
Juha, Sawafeary and Abu Zur families, there were now more than 70 persons assembled in the 
house. 
</p>
<p>759. Mr. Juha told the Mission that, after taking a little rest in the Mughrabi house, he came to 
the view that it was impossible for them all to stay there, given their substantial numbers and the 
earlier experience of the intense firing at the Abu Zur house. He decided that they should seek to 
go back into the street and move to another place. Mr. Mughrabi strongly advised against this. 
</p>
<p>760. The Juha, Abu Zur and Sawafeary families went back into the street in the afternoon of 
5 January. Mr. Juha had his mother in front of him propped up on a two-wheeled trolley as she 
was unable to walk. Mr. Sawafeary was near to him at the front of the group. Behind him, 
towards the middle of the group, was his 15-year-old son, Ibrahim, carrying a white flag. 
Mr. Juha believes he heard two shots. One of the shots hit his son in the chest. The group 
immediately sought cover once again in the Mughrabi house. They tried to care for Ibrahim in 
the workshop at the front of the house. His mother tried to sew the wound with a needle and 
thread and sterilize the materials with eau de cologne. Ibrahim died some six hours after he was 
shot.  
</p>
<p>761. The group of over 70 persons remained in the house until 8 January in the afternoon, 
when ICRC and PRCS representatives came to the neighbourhood and they managed to leave the 
area and walk to Gaza City.  
</p>
<p><b>6. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>762. The Mission found the witnesses of the shooting of Ibrahim Juha to be credible and 
reliable. It has no reason to doubt the veracity of their testimony. 
</p>
<p>763. The testimonies of Mr. Mu&#8217;een Juha and Mrs. Juha, Mr. Sameh Sawafeary and Mr. Rajab 
Darwish Mughrabi, as well as of Mrs. Abir Hajji, all establish that there were no combat 
operations in the area at the time of the incident. The Israeli armed forces had attacked 
Mr. Juha&#8217;s house and that of Mr. Abu Zur, where the Juhas and other families had taken refuge, 
forcing them to leave the area. It was the Israeli armed forces that ordered these families to take 
the road to Rafah. In sum, the Israeli armed forces deliberately opened fire on a group of persons </p>

 <p> 
they had interacted with during the preceding 24 hours and therefore knew to be civilians, killing 
the child Ibrahim Juha.  
</p>
<p><b>7. The killing of Majda and Rayya Hajaj 
</b></p>
<p>764. The Mission visited Juhr ad-Dik village twice and interviewed three eyewitnesses of the 
killing of Majda and Rayya Hajaj<b>422</b> and two other members of the family, sons of Rayya Hajaj 
(and brothers of Majda). The Mission also measured the distances between the reported location 
of the victims at the time of the shooting and the tanks. The Mission further obtained copies of 
the PRCS records on its attempts to obtain approval from the Israeli armed forces to dispatch 
ambulances to Juhr ad-Dik. Finally, the Mission saw the agricultural land destroyed by tanks and 
bulldozers, the rubble remaining of the house of Saleh Hajaj, and the devastation and graffiti<b>423</b> 
left by the Israeli soldiers in Youssef Hajaj&#8217;s house.  
</p>
<p>765. Juhr ad-Dik is a village in an agricultural area south-east of Gaza City, about 1.5 
kilometres from the border with Israel (the so-called Green Line). On 3 January 2009, an Israeli 
tank force entered Juhr ad-Dik. Part of the tank force moved on towards Salah ad-Din Street and 
Zeytoun; the remaining force occupied Juhr ad-Dik.<b>424</b> 
</p>
<p>766. On 4 January 2009, at about 6 a.m., shells hit the house of Youssef Hajaj&#8217;s family, where 
he, his wife and children, the wife and children of his brother Majd (who was not with his 
family), their sister Majda, aged 37, and mother Rayya, aged 65, were taking shelter. A daughter 
of Youssef, 13-year-old Manar, was injured. Between 9 and 10 a.m., the Hajaj family decided to 
move to the house of their neighbour Muhammad al-Safdi. Around 11 a.m., Youssef Hajaj 
received a phone call from his brother Majd, informing him that the Israeli armed forces had 
announced on local radio stations (al-Aqsa and al-Hurriya) that people living along the border 
between Israel and Gaza should evacuate their houses to remain safe. Having prepared two 
make-shift white flags, which were carried by Majda Hajaj and Ahmad Muhammad al-Safdi, 
25 years old, who was also holding his two-year-old son in his arms, 26 members of the two 
families (more than half of them children)<b>425</b> left the al-Safdi house. They started walking down 
the road westwards, where a group of Israeli tanks was standing at a distance of 320 metres.<b>426</b> 
They walked very slowly, covering 200 metres in about 10 minutes. The group was some 
120 metres away from the Israeli tanks when, without warning, they were fired on from the 
direction of the tanks. Majda Hajaj and her mother, Rayya, were hit. Majda died of her injuries 
instantly. Rayya tried to flee, but fell to the ground after a few metres.

<b>424</b> Testimony to the Mission by Youssef and Saleh Hajaj, 3 June 2009. 
<b>425</b> The overall number of persons leaving the house of the al-Safdi family was also indicated to the Mission as 28. 
The Mission was told that 17 children led the procession. 
<b>426</b> This and the other distances mentioned in the summary of the case were measured with GPS instruments. </p>

 <p> 
767. The others scrambled back to the al-Safdi family house, and managed to take shelter 
behind a shack next to it and later inside the house. Members of the Hajjaj family called PRCS 
for help with the evacuation of Majda and Rayya Hajaj&#8217;s bodies. PRCS in turn contacted ICRC. 
The Israeli armed forces denied ICRC access to Juhr ad-Dik on the ground that the area had been 
declared a military zone.<b>427</b> The two families spent the remainder of the day and the night 
sheltering under the staircase in the al-Safdi house, while the Israeli armed forces continued to 
direct shell and machine-gun fire at the house. The following day they walked to Gaza City by a 
different, circuitous route. The Hajaj family found the bodies of Majda and Rayya Hajaj under 
the rubble when they were able to return to Juhr ad-Dik on the evening of 18 January 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>8. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>768. The Mission found the witnesses interviewed to be credible and reliable. It has no reason 
to doubt the veracity of their testimony. 
</p>
<p>769. The Mission finds that Majda and Rayya Hajaj were part of a group of civilians moving 
with white flags through an area in which there was, at the time, no combat. Moreover, the 
Israeli armed forces had, according to witnesses interviewed by the Mission, called over local 
radio on the civilian population of Juhr ad-Dik to evacuate their homes and walk towards Gaza 
City. In the light of these reported circumstances, and particularly considering that the civilians 
were at a distance of more than 100 metres from them, the Israeli soldiers could not have 
perceived an imminent threat from the movement of people in that area, as they would have 
expected the civilians to respond to the call for evacuation. The Mission, therefore, finds the 
shooting and killing of Majda and Rayya Hajjaj a deliberate act on the part of the Israeli soldiers. 
</p>
<p><b>9. The shooting of Amal, Souad, Samar and Hajja Souad Abd Rabbo 
</b></p>
<p>770. The Mission visited the site of the shooting of Amal, Souad, Samar and Hajja Souad Abd 
Rabbo and interviewed an eyewitness, Mr. Khalid Abd Rabbo, on site. Khalid and Kawthar Abd 
Rabbo gave their testimony at the public hearing in Gaza on 28 June 2009. The Mission also 
reviewed sworn statements from two additional witnesses it was not able to interview in 
person.<b>428</b> 
</p>
<p>771. The family of Khalid Abd Rabbo and his wife Kawthar lived on the ground floor of a 
four-storey building in the eastern part of Izbat Abd Rabbo, a neighbourhood east of Jabaliyah 
inhabited primarily by members of their extended family. Khalid Abd Rabbo&#8217;s parents and 
brothers with their families lived on the upper floors of the house. The residents of Izbat Abd 
Rabbo started hearing the sound of shooting and of the Israeli ground incursion in the evening of 
3 January 2009. Khalid Abd Rabbo&#8217;s family decided to stay inside the house, all gathered on the 
ground floor, as they had done safely during previous Israeli incursions into the neighbourhood. 
</p>
<p>772. In the late morning of 7 January 2009, Israeli tanks moved onto the small piece of 
agricultural land in front of the house. Shortly after 12.30 p.m., the inhabitants of that part of 
Izbat Abd Rabbo heard megaphone messages telling all residents to leave. According to one 
                                                 
<b>427</b> PRCS records confirm the ICRC requests to the Israeli armed forces to be allowed access to Juhr ad-Dik.

 <p> 
witness&#8217;s recollection, there had also been a radio message broadcast by the Israeli armed forces 
around 12.30 announcing that there would be a temporary cessation of shooting between 1 and 
4 p.m. that day, during which time residents of the area were asked to walk to central Jabaliyah. 
</p>
<p>773. At about 12.50 p.m., Khalid Abd Rabbo, his wife Kawthar, their three daughters, Souad 
(aged 9), Samar (aged 5) and Amal (aged 3), and his mother, Hajja Souad Abd Rabbo, stepped 
out of the house, all of them carrying white flags. Less than 10 metres from the door was a tank, 
turned towards their house. Two soldiers were sitting on top of it having a snack (one was eating 
chips, the other chocolate, according to one of the witnesses). The family stood still, waiting for 
orders from the soldiers as to what they should do, but none was given. Without warning, a third 
soldier emerged from inside the tank and started shooting at the three girls and then also at their 
grandmother. Several bullets hit Souad in the chest, Amal in the stomach and Samar in the back. 
Hajja Souad was hit in the lower back and in the left arm. 
</p>
<p>774. Khalid and Kawthar Abd Rabbo carried their three daughters and mother back inside the 
house. There, they and the family members who had stayed inside tried to call for help by mobile 
phone. They also shouted for help and a neighbour, Sameeh Atwa Rasheed al-Sheikh, who was 
an ambulance driver and had his ambulance parked next to his house, decided to come to their 
help. He put on his ambulance crew clothes and asked his son to put on a fluorescent jacket. 
They had driven a few metres from their house to the immediate vicinity of the Abd Rabbo 
house when Israeli soldiers near the Abed Rabbo house ordered them to halt and get out of the 
vehicle. Sameeh al-Sheikh protested that he had heard cries for help from the Abd Rabbo family 
and intended to bring the wounded to hospital. The soldiers ordered him and his son to undress 
and then re-dress. They then ordered them to abandon the ambulance and to walk towards 
Jabaliyah, which they complied with. When the families returned to Izbat Abd Rabbo on 
18 January, they found the ambulance was in the same place but had been crushed, probably by a 
tank.  
</p>
<p>775. Inside the Abed Rabbo house, Amal and Souad died of their wounds. The family decided 
that they had to make an attempt to walk to Jabalya and take Samar, the dead bodies of Amal and 
Souad, and their grandmother to hospital. Khaled and Kawthar Abd Rabbo, and other family 
members and neighbours carried the girls on their shoulders. Hajja Souad was carried by family 
and neighbours on a bed. Samar was transferred to al-Shifa hospital and then, through Egypt, to 
Belgium, where she still is in hospital. According to her parents, Samar suffered a spinal injury 
and will remain paraplegic for the rest of her life.  
</p>
<p>776. When Khalid Abd Rabbo returned to his home on 18 January 2009, his house, as most 
houses in that part of Izbat Abd Rabbo, had been demolished. He drew the Mission&#8217;s attention to 
an anti-tank mine under the rubble of a neighbour&#8217;s house.<b>429</b> 
</p>
<p><b>10. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>777. The Mission found Khalid and Kawthar Abd Rabbo to be credible and reliable witnesses. 
It has no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of their testimony. The Mission also 
                                                 
<b>429</b> The UNOSAT report (p. 14) counts 341 buildings in Izbat Abd Rabbo destroyed or severely damaged as a result 
of the military operations.  </p>

 <p> 
reviewed several sworn statements they and other eyewitnesses gave to NGOs about the incident 
and found them to be consistent with the account it received. 
</p>
<p>778. The Mission notes that, in general, Izbat Abd Rabbo and the nearby areas of Jabal 
al-Kashef and Jabal al-Rayes appear to have been among the locations in Gaza which saw the 
most intense combat during the military operations.<b>430</b> The testimony of Khalid and Kawthar 
Abd Rabbo, however, shows that the Israeli armed forces were not engaged in combat or fearing 
an attack at the time of the incident. Two soldiers were sitting on the tank in front of the Abd 
Rabbo family house and having a snack. They clearly did not perceive any danger from the 
house, its occupants or the surroundings. Moreover, when the family, consisting of a man, a 
young and an elderly woman, and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, stepped 
out of the house, they stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers. 
The Israeli soldiers could, therefore, not reasonably have perceived any threat from the group. 
Indeed, the fact that the gunfire was directed at the three girls and, subsequently, at the elderly 
woman, and not at the young adult couple, can be seen as further corroborating the finding that 
there was no reasonable ground for the soldier shooting to assume that any of the members of the 
group were directly participating in the hostilities. The Mission finds that the soldier deliberately 
directed lethal fire at Souad, Samar and Amal Abd Rabbo and at their grandmother, Hajja Souad 
Abd Rabbo. 
</p>
<p>779. The Mission further finds that, by preventing Sameeh al-Sheikh from taking the wounded 
to the nearest hospital in his ambulance, the Israeli armed forces deliberately further aggravated 
the consequences of the shooting. The Mission recalls that the soldiers had forced Sameeh al-
Sheikh and his son to get out of the ambulance, undress and then re-dress. They therefore knew 
that they did not constitute a threat. Instead of allowing them to take the gravely wounded Samar 
Abd Rabbo to hospital, the soldiers forced Sameeh al-Sheikh and his son to abandon the 
ambulance and to walk towards Jabaliyah. 
</p>
<p><b>11. The shooting of Rouhiyah al-Najjar 
</b></p>
<p>780. The Mission visited the site of the shooting of Rouhiyah al-Najjar in Khuza&#8217;a. It 
interviewed two eyewitnesses of the shooting and six other witnesses to the events, including 
Yasmine al-Najjar, Nasser al-Najjar, Rouhiyah al-Najjar&#8217;s husband, and their daughter Hiba.  
</p>
<p>781. The Israeli armed forces launched the attack against Khuza&#8217;a, a small town about half a 
kilometre from the border (Green Line) with Israel east of Khan Yunis, around 10 p.m. on 
12 January 2009. During the night, they used white phosphorous munitions, causing fires to 
break out in the al-Najjar neighbourhood on the eastern fringe of Khuza&#8217;a. Families in the 
neighbourhood, including the family of Nasser al-Najjar, his first wife Rouhiyah and their 
daughter Hiba, spent much of the night trying to extinguish fires in their houses. Israeli armed 
forces, possibly heliborne troops, had taken position on the roofs of some houses in the 
neighbourhood and observed the residents as they attempted to fight the fires. Around 3 a.m. 
residents also began to hear the noise of approaching tanks and bulldozers, with which they were 
well familiar, as in 2008 there had been several Israeli incursions into the farmland to the north 
                                                 
<b>430</b> &#8220;The hidden dimension of Palestinian war casualties&#8230;&#8221; suggests that these areas were among those in which 
Palestinian combatants most frequently engaged the Israeli armed forces. </p>

 <p> 
and east of Khuza&#8217;a, in the course of which bulldozers flattened fields, groves, chicken coops 
and greenhouses.  
</p>
<p>782. In the early morning hours, some of the residents, including Rouhiyah al-Najjar, climbed 
on the roofs of their houses and hoisted improvised white flags. Using megaphones, the Israeli 
armed forces asked the men of the neighbourhood to come out of the houses and walk towards 
the tanks. There the men were separated into two groups which were then held in different 
houses under the control of the soldiers.  
</p>
<p>783. At some point between 7 and 7.45 a.m., Rouhiyah al-Najjar and the women in her 
immediate neighbourhood decided to leave their homes and walk with their children to the town 
centre. The group of women was headed by Rouhiyah al-Najjar and her 23-year-old neighbour 
and relative Yasmine al-Najjar, both carrying white flags. Rouhiyah&#8217;s daughter Hiba was right 
behind her. Other women were holding up babies in their arms, shouting &#8220;God is great!&#8221; and 
&#8220;We have children!&#8221; The group of women and children started moving down a straight alley, 
about six or seven metres wide, flanked on both sides by houses. At the other end of the alley, a 
little more than 200 metres away,<b>431</b> was the house of Faris al-Najjar, which had been occupied 
by numerous Israeli soldiers (around 60 according to one witness). The soldiers had made a hole 
in the wall of the first floor of the house, giving them a good view down the alley into which the 
group of women and children were advancing. When Rouhiyah al-Najjar was about 200 metres 
from Faris al-Najjar&#8217;s house, a shot fired from that house hit her in the temple (she had just 
turned her head towards her neighbour next to her to encourage her). Rouhiyah al-Najjar fell to 
the ground; Yasmine was struck in her leg. This single shot was followed by concentrated 
gunfire, which forced the group of women and children to scramble back into the houses of 
Osama al-Najjar and Shawki al-Najjar, though it did not cause further injury. Because of the fire 
from the Israeli soldiers, they did not dare to leave the house and look after Rouhiyah al-Najjar. 
They stayed inside until around noon the same day, when they made a second, successful attempt 
to leave the neighbourhood and walk to a safer part of Khuza&#8217;a. 
</p>
<p>784. An ambulance driver from Khan Yunis hospital, Marwan Abu Reda, received a phone call 
from Khuza&#8217;a asking for emergency help for Rouhiyah al-Najjar at around 7.45 a.m. He 
immediately drove to Khuza&#8217;a and arrived in the neighbourhood shortly after 8 a.m., i.e. within 
no more than an hour from the shooting. He was already in the alley where Rouhiyah al-Najjar 
was lying on the ground<b>432</b> when soldiers opened fire from houses or rooftops, forcing him to 
make a U-turn and take the ambulance to a nearby alley. He called PRCS and asked it to seek 
access to the injured woman, through ICRC and in coordination with the Israeli armed forces, 
without success. Marwan Abu Reda was not able to pick up Rouhiyah al-Najjar&#8217;s (by then 
lifeless) body until the evening of that day. He confirmed to the Mission that she had received a 
bullet in the temple. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>431</b> The Mission did not measure the distance; this is an estimate. 
<b>432</b> The Mission does not have information which would allow it to state whether Rouhiyah al-Najjar was still alive 
when the ambulance arrived. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>12. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>785. The Mission has no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of the testimony of 
the witnesses it heard with regard to the shooting of Rouhiyah al-Najjar.  
</p>
<p>786. The Mission&#8217;s site inspection and the testimony of several witnesses appear to establish 
that the group of women and children led by Rouhiyah al-Najjar had slowly walked for at least 
20 metres before the shot that killed Rouhiyahher was fired. During that time, Israeli soldiers 
standing on the roofs of the houses in the neighbourhood had ample time to observe the group. 
The fact that, after shooting Rouhiyah and Yasmine al-Najjar, the soldiers directed warning fire 
at the group without injuring anyone, but forcing them to retreat to a house, is further indication 
that the soldiers had not observed any threat to them from the group.<b>433</b> Indeed, a few hours later 
the same group was allowed to walk past the soldiers to a safer area of Khuza&#8217;a. The Mission 
accordingly finds that Rouhiyah al-Najjar was deliberately shot by an Israeli soldier who had no 
reason to assume that she was a combatant or otherwise taking part in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>787. The Mission also observes that, while it is unclear whether the ambulance from Khan 
Yunis hospital could have saved Rouhiyah al-Najjar&#8217;s life, the Israeli forces prevented the 
evacuation of the wounded woman without any justification. 
</p>
<p><b>13. The Abu Halima family case 
</b></p>
<p>788. The Mission interviewed three members of the Abu Halima family who were 
eyewitnesses to the events described below.<b>434</b> The Mission also spoke to the doctor who treated 
some of the family members.<b>435</b> The Mission reviewed a report by Physicians for Human Rights 
&#8211; Israel and Palestinian Medical Relief Society which includes analysis by doctors who observed 
the wounds of the surviving victims at the beginning of March 2009 and also has medical reports 
confirming the injuries they suffered.<b>436</b> Finally, the Mission reviewed information received from 
TAWTHEQ. 
</p>
<p>789. On 3 and 4 January 2009, the initial days of the ground invasion, there was heavy aerial 
bombardment and shelling by tanks of the open areas around Siyafa village, in al-Atatra 
neighbourhood west of Beit Lahia. Most residents are farmers and, although the Israeli armed

<p>                                                 
<b>433</b> The Mission was not given any testimony about the presence of Palestinian combatants in Khuza&#8217;a at the time of 
this incident. In fact, Khuza&#8217;a municipal officials expressly denied that there was any combatant activity in Khuza&#8217;a 
at the time of the Israeli ground invasion, arguing that, Khuza&#8217;a and the surrounding fields being such an open area, 
there was no place for fighters to take cover. These statements are contradicted by reports indicating that &#8220;about one 
dozen fighters had directly engaged the IDF in Khuza&#8217;a. But these engagements appear to have been minimal, with 
the fighters mostly retreating whenever the Israeli forces advanced.&#8221; (Human Rights Watch, <i>Rain of Fire: Israel&#8217;s

forces had dropped leaflets warning civilians to leave the area, most had chosen to stay. Based 
on their previous experiences of ground invasions, they reportedly believed that they were not in 
danger.  
</p>
<p>790. On 4 January 2009, the bombardment reportedly increased as Israeli troops moved into 
and took control of al-Atatra neighbourhood. The Abu Halima family was sheltering in the home 
of Muhammad Sa&#8217;ad Abu Halima and Sabah Abu Halima in Sifaya village. The house has two 
floors; the ground floor is used for storage and the living quarters are on the upper floor. 
According to Sabah Abu Halima,<b>437</b> 16 members of her immediate family were sheltering on the 
upper floor. 
</p>
<p>791. In the afternoon, after hearing that a shell had hit the adjacent house of Sabah Abu 
Halima&#8217;s brother-in-law, most of the family moved from the bedroom into a hallway in the 
middle of the upper floor, where they thought they would be better protected. At around 
4.30 p.m., a white phosphorous shell came through the ceiling into the room where they were 
sheltering.  
</p>
<p>792. According to family members who survived,<b>438</b> there was intense fire and white smoke in 
the room, the walls of which were glowing red. Five members of the family died immediately or 
within a short period: Muhammad Sa&#8217;ad Abu Halima (aged 45) and four of his children, sons 
Abd al-Rahim Sa&#8217;ad (aged 14), Zaid (aged 12) and Hamza (aged 8), and daughter Shahid (aged 
18 months). Muhammad Sa&#8217;ad and Abd al-Rahim Sa&#8217;ad were decapitated, the others burnt to 
death. Five members of the family escaped and suffered various degrees of burns: Sabah Abu 
Halima, her sons Youssef (aged 16) and Ali (aged 4), daughter-in-law Ghada (aged 21), and 
Ghada&#8217;s daughter Farah (aged 2).<b>439</b>  
</p>
<p>793. Family members tried to call an ambulance, but the Israeli armed forces had declared the 
area a closed military zone and ambulances were not permitted to enter. Two cousins put Sabah 
Abu Halima in the back of a tractor trailer and drove her to Kamal Idwan hospital in Beit Lahia. 
The driver reported that he reached the hospital despite coming under fire from Israeli soldiers 
posted inside the Omar Bin Khattab school for girls on the road to al-Atatra.<b>440</b> One cousin 
remained with Sabah Abu Halima, while the other returned to help the rest of the family.  
</p>
<p>794. The remaining survivors and the injured were placed on a second tractor trailer to take 
them to Kamal Idwan hospital. The remains of Shahid Abu Halima were also taken. The tractor 
was driven by a cousin, Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima (aged 16). Another cousin, Matar Abu 
Halima (aged 17), his brother Ali (aged 11) and his mother, Nabila, accompanied them.

 <p> 
795. When they reached the crossroads next to the Omar Bin Khattab school in al-Atatra, 
Israeli soldiers positioned on the roof of a nearby house, some ten metres away, ordered them to 
stop. Muhammad Hekmat, Matar, Ali, Nabila and Matar got down and stood beside the tractor. 
One or more soldiers opened fire, hitting Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima in the chest and 
Matar Abu Halima in the abdomen.<b>441</b> Both died as a result of their injuries. Ali, Omar and 
Nabila Abu Halima fled. Omar was shot in the arm, but they eventually reached Kamal Idwan 
hospital.  
</p>
<p>796. The remaining family members were ordered to abandon the tractors and walk. They were 
not permitted to take the bodies of the two dead boys, or the remains of Shahid Abu Halima, 
which were recovered four days later, on 8 January. Ghada Abu Halima, who had burns on 
45 per cent of her body, had great difficulty walking. After some 500 metres, a vehicle picked up 
several members of the family, including Ghada and Farah, and took them to al-Shifa hospital in 
Gaza City. 
</p>
<p>797. Dr. Nafiz Abu Shaban, Chief of Plastic Surgery at al-Shifa hospital, confirmed that Sabah, 
Ghada and Farah Abu Halima were admitted there with serious burns and were transferred to 
Egypt for treatment. The doctor believed that the burns were caused by contact with white 
phosphorous.<b>442</b>  
</p>
<p><b>14. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>798. The Mission found Sabah Abu Halima, Muhammad Sa&#8217;ad Abu Halima and Omar Sa&#8217;ad 
Abu Halima to be credible and reliable witnesses. It has no reason to doubt the veracity of the 
main elements of their testimonies, which were corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Nafiz Abu 
Shaban of al-Shifa hospital.  
</p>
<p>799. With regard to the white phosphorous shelling of the Abu Halima family house, the 
Mission notes that the house is located in a village in a rural area. The shelling occurred on 
4 January 2009 at a time when Israeli ground forces were apparently advancing into al-Atatra. 
Moreover, the Israeli armed forces had dropped leaflets warning civilians to leave. Under the 
circumstances, the Mission cannot make any determination as to whether the shelling of the Abu 
Halima house was a direct attack against a civilian objective, an indiscriminate attack or a 
justifiable part of the broader military operation. 
</p>
<p>800. With regard to the shooting of Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima and Matar Abu Halima, 
the Mission notes that the Israeli soldiers had ordered the tractor on which they were transporting 
the wounded to stop and had ordered the two cousins (aged 16 and 17) to come down. They had 
complied with those instructions and were standing next to the tractor, when the Israeli soldiers 
standing on the roof of a nearby house opened fire on them. The soldiers cannot have been 
mistaken about the circumstance that these were two civilians taking gravely wounded persons to 
a hospital. The shooting of Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima and Matar Abu Halima was a direct 
                                                 
<b>441</b> According to statements given by Omar and Nabila Abu Halima to the NGO Defence for Children International 
(ibid.). Information provided to the Mission by Omar Abu Halima on 15 June 2009 was less detailed but consistent 
with this information. 
<b>442</b> Mission interview, 12 June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
lethal attack on two under-age civilians. The fact that they were hit in the chest and the abdomen, 
respectively, indicates that the intention was to kill them.  
</p>
<p>801. The Mission further notes that in this case the Israeli armed forces denied the ambulances 
access to the area to evacuate the wounded and then opened fire on the relatives of the wounded 
who were trying to take them to the nearest hospital. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Information concerning the instructions given to the Israeli armed forces  
with regard to the opening of fire against civilians 
</b></p>
<p>802. The Mission found in the above incidents that the Israeli armed forces repeatedly opened 
fire on civilians who were not taking part in the hostilities and who posed no threat to them. 
These incidents indicate that the instructions given to the Israeli armed forces moving into Gaza 
provided for a low threshold for the use of lethal fire against the civilian population. The Mission 
found strong corroboration of this trend emerging from its fact-finding in the testimonies of 
Israeli soldiers collected by the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence<b>443</b> and in the Protocol of the 
Rabin Academy&#8217;s &#8220;Fighters&#8217; Talk&#8221;. These testimonies suggest in particular that the instructions 
given to the soldiers conveyed two &#8220;policies&#8221;. Both are an expression of the aim to eliminate as 
far as possible any risk to the lives of the Israeli soldiers.  
</p>
<p>803. The first policy could be summarized, in the words of one of the soldiers: &#8220;if we see 
something suspect and shoot, better hit an innocent than hesitate to target an enemy.&#8221; Another 
soldier attributed the following instructions to his battalion commander: &#8220;If you are not sure &#8211; 
shoot. If there is doubt then there is no doubt.&#8221; The first soldier summarized the briefing from the 
battalion commander as follows &#8220;the enemy was hiding behind civilian population. [&#8230;] if we 
suspect someone, we should not give him the benefit of the doubt. Eventually, this could be an 
enemy, even if it&#8217;s some old woman approaching the house. It could be an old woman carrying 
an explosive charge.&#8221; A third soldier explained &#8220;you don&#8217;t only shoot when threatened. The 
assumption is that you constantly feel threatened, so anything there threatens you, and you shoot. 
No one actually said &#8216;shoot regardless&#8217; or &#8216;shoot anything that moves.&#8217; But we were not ordered 
to open fire only if there was a real threat.&#8221;<b>444</b>  
</p>
<p>804. The Mission notes that some soldiers stated that they agreed with the instructions to 
&#8220;shoot in case of doubt.&#8221; One of them explained &#8220;this is the difference between urban warfare 
and a limited confrontation. In urban warfare, anyone is your enemy. No innocents.&#8221;<b> </b>Another 
told of his profound discomfort with the policy and of how he and his comrades had attempted to 
question their commander about it after a clearly harmless man was shot.<b>445</b> While they disagreed 
about the legitimacy and morality of the policy, they had little doubt about the terms of the 
instructions: each soldier and commander on the ground had to exercise judgement,<b>446</b> but the 
policy was to shoot in case of doubt. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>443</b> <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i>. 
<b>444</b> Ibid., testimony 21, pp. 50&#8211;51, testimony 7, p. 20, and testimony 9, p. 24. 
<b>445</b> Ibid., testimony 7, p. 20, and testimony 14, pp. 38-39. 
<b>446</b> Ibid., testimony 13, p. 37. </p>

 <p> 
805. The second policy clearly emerging from the soldiers&#8217; testimonies is explained by one of 
the soldiers as follows: &#8220;One of the things in this procedure [the outpost procedure, which is 
being applied in areas held by the Israeli armed forces after the Gaza ground invasion] is setting 
red lines. It means that whoever crosses this limit is shot, no questions asked. [&#8230;] Shoot to 
kill.&#8221;<b>447</b> In one incident highly relevant to the cases investigated by the Mission because of 
factual similarities, a soldier recounted an event he witnessed.<b>448</b> A family is ordered to leave 
their house. For reasons that remain unclear, probably a misunderstanding, the mother and two 
children turn left instead of right after having walked between 100 and 200 metres from their 
house. They thereby cross a &#8220;red line&#8221; established by the Israeli unit (of whose existence the 
mother and children could have no knowledge). An Israeli marksman on the roof of the house 
they had just left opens fire on the woman and her two children, killing them. As the soldier 
speaking at the Rabin Academy&#8217;s &#8220;Fighters&#8217; Talk&#8221; a month later observes, &#8220;from our 
perspective, he [the marksman] did his job according to the orders he was given&#8221;.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>806. &#8220;Incessant&#8221; alerts about suicide bombers<b>449</b> meant that even civilians clearly identified by 
the soldiers as carrying no arms were perceived as a threat as soon as they came within a certain 
distance from the soldiers &#8211; a threat to be eliminated, also without warning fire, as a second 
might be enough for the &#8220;suicide bomber&#8221; to get close enough to harm the soldiers. 
</p>
<p>807. The Mission notes that many of the persons interviewed in Gaza described incidents in 
which they were, individually, as part of a group or in a vehicle, exposed to intense gunfire 
from Israeli soldiers &#8211; but without being hit or injured. This was the case, for instance, of an 
ambulance drivers attempting to drive into an area which the Israeli armed forces had decided he 
should not enter.<b>450</b> In the Khuza&#8217;a case, after the lethal shooting of Rouhiyah al-Najjar and 
wounding of Yasmine al-Najjar, the other women and children were exposed to fire from the 
Israeli soldiers, which forced them to retreat to the houses they had been trying to leave.<b>451</b> These 
incidents suggest that the Israeli armed forces made ample use of gunfire to &#8220;communicate&#8221; with 
the civilian population, to issue injunctions to civilians not to walk or not to drive any further in a 
certain direction or to immediately retreat to a building they were about to leave. The terrifying 
effect this sort of non-verbal communication had on those at the receiving end is evident, as is 
the likelihood of lethal consequences. 
</p>
<p>808. The Mission also read testimony from soldiers who recounted cases in which, although a 
civilian had come within a distance from them which would have required opening fire under the 
rules imparted to them, they decided not to shoot because they did not consider the civilian a 
threat to them.

<b>448</b> Testimony of &#8220;Ram&#8221; in the Rabin Academy Fighters&#8217; Talk, pp. 6-7. The Mission notes that &#8220;Ram&#8221; clearly states 
that he was an eyewitness to the incident.

<b>451</b> This would appear to have been the case also in the shooting of Majda and Rayya Hajaj in Juhr ad-Dik. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Legal findings with regard to the cases investigated by the Mission</b> 
</p>
<p>809. The fundamental principles applicable to these incidents, which are cornerstones of both 
treaty-based and customary international humanitarian law, are that &#8220;the parties to the conflict 
shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants&#8221;<b>452</b> and that &#8220;the 
civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack&#8221;.<b> 453</b> 
The Israeli Government refers to the principle of distinction as &#8220;the first core principle of the 
Law of Armed Conflict.&#8221; It further states that &#8220;the IDF&#8217;s emphasis on compliance with the Law 
of Armed Conflict was also directly incorporated into the rules of engagement for the Gaza 
Operation.&#8221;<b> </b>The principle of distinction was reportedly incorporated in the following terms: 
&#8220;Strikes shall be directed against military objectives and combatants only. It is absolutely 
prohibited to intentionally strike civilians or civilian objects (in contrast to incidental 
proportional harm).&#8221;<b>454</b> 
</p>
<p>810. In reviewing the above incidents the Mission found in every case that the Israeli armed 
forces had carried out direct intentional strikes against civilians. The only exception is the 
shelling of the Abu Halima family home, where the Mission does not have sufficient information 
on the military situation prevailing at the time to reach a conclusion. 
</p>
<p>811. The Mission found that, on the basis of the facts it was able to ascertain, in none of the 
cases reviewed were there any grounds which could have reasonably induced the Israeli armed 
forces to assume that the civilians attacked were in fact taking a direct part in the hostilities and 
had thus lost their immunity against direct attacks.<b>455</b> 
</p>
<p>812. The Mission therefore finds that the Israeli armed forces have violated the prohibition 
under customary international law and reflected in article 51 (2) of Additional Protocol I that the 
civilian population as such will not be the object of attacks. This finding applies to the attacks on 
the houses of Ateya and Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni, the shooting of Iyad al-Samouni, of Shahd Hajji and 
Ola Masood Arafat, of Ibrahim Juha, of Rayya and Majda Hajaj, of Amal, Souad, Samar, and 
Hajja Souad Abd Rabbo, of Rouhiyah al-Najjar, and of Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima and 
Matar Abu Halima. In these incidents, 34 Palestinian civilians lost their lives owing to Israeli fire 
intentionally directed at them. Numerous others were injured, some very severely and with 
permanent consequences. 
</p>
<p>813. Not only are civilians not to be the object of attacks, they are also &#8220;entitled in all 
circumstances, to respect for their persons &#8230; protected especially against all acts of violence or 
threats thereof&#8221; (Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 27). Fundamental guarantees set out in article 
75 of Additional Protocol I include the absolute prohibition &#8220;at any time and in any place&#8221; of 
&#8220;violence to the life, health, or physical or mental well-being of persons&#8221;. According to the facts 
presented to the Mission, these provisions have been violated.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>452</b> Additional Protocol I, art. 48. 
<b>453</b> Additional Protocol I, art. 51 (2). 
<b>454</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 94 and 222. 
<b>455</b> Pursuant to article 51 (3) of Protocol Additional I, civilians enjoy immunity from attack &#8220;unless and for such time 
as they take a direct part in hostilities.&#8221; On the status of this rule in customary law, see chap. VII. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>814. The State of Israel would be responsible under international law for these internationally 
wrongful actions carried out by its agents  
</p>
<p>815. From the facts ascertained, the Mission finds that the conduct of the Israeli armed forces 
in these cases would constitute grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention in respect of 
wilful killings and wilfully causing great suffering to protected persons<b>456</b> and as such give rise 
to individual criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>816. The Mission also finds that the direct targeting and arbitrary killing of Palestinian 
civilians is a violation by the Israeli armed forces of the right to life as provided in article 6 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>817. In most of the cases examined above, the Mission finds that the Israeli armed forces 
denied the medical emergency services access to the wounded civilians. This was the case with 
regard to all the incidents occurring in the al-Samouni neighbourhood, particularly after the 
shooting of Ahmad al-Samouni, where the PRCS ambulance was forced to return to Gaza City 
having come within 100 metres of the gravely wounded boy. Ambulances were also arbitrarily 
prevented from reaching the wounded after the attack on Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house, most 
dramatically after the shooting of Amal, Souad, Samar, and Hajja Souad Abd Rabbo and of 
Rouhiyah al-Najjar. In the case of the shooting of Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima and Matar 
Abu Halima, it is the rescuers who were executed, preventing them from taking their severely 
burned relatives to hospital. In the case of Iyad al-Samouni, finally, the relatives who wanted to 
assist him were threatened with being shot themselves. 
</p>
<p>818. The Mission recalls that article 10 (2) of Additional Protocol I provides that &#8220;In all 
circumstances [the wounded] shall be treated humanely and shall receive, to the fullest extent 
practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention required by their 
condition. &#8230;&#8221; This provision enjoys customary international law status. The Mission is mindful 
that &#8220;the obligation to protect and care for the wounded &#8230; is an obligation of means.&#8221; It applies 
whenever circumstances permit. However, &#8220;each party to the conflict must use its best efforts to 
provide protection and care for the wounded,&#8230; , including permitting humanitarian 
organizations to provide for their protection and care.&#8221;<b>457</b> 
</p>
<p>819. The facts ascertained by the Mission establish that in the incidents investigated the Israeli 
armed forces did not use their best efforts to provide humanitarian organizations access to the 
wounded. On the contrary, the facts indicate that, while the circumstances permitted giving 
access, the Israeli armed forces arbitrarily withheld it.  
</p>
<p>820. On this basis, the Mission finds a violation of the obligation under customary international 
law to treat the wounded humanely.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>456</b> Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention defines the &#8220;wilful killing&#8221; of protected persons as a grave breach 
of the Convention. The same qualification is applied to acts which &#8220;wilfully caus[e] great suffering or serious injury 
to body or health&#8221;. 
<b>457</b> <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i>&#8230;, rule 110 and p. 402. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>821. The conduct of the Israeli armed forces amounted to violations of the right to life where it 
resulted in death, and to a violation of the right to physical integrity, and to cruel and inhuman 
treatment in other cases, which constitutes a violation of articles 6 and 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>E. The attack on the al-Maqadmah mosque, 3 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The facts gathered by the Mission 
</b></p>
<p>822. The al-Maqadmah mosque is situated near the north-west outskirts of Jabaliyah camp, 
close to Beit Lahia. It is located less than 100 metres from the Kamal Idwan hospital, in the al-
Alami housing project. At least 15 people were killed and around 40 injured &#8211; many seriously &#8211; 
when the Israeli armed forces struck the entrance of the mosque with a missile. 
</p>
<p>823. The Mission heard five eyewitnesses who had been in the mosque at the time it was 
struck. Two of them had been facing the door as the explosion occurred. Three of them had been 
kneeling facing the opposite direction and had been seriously injured. The Mission also heard 
from a number of relatives of those who died in the attack and has seen a number of sworn 
statements signed by them testifying to the facts they witnessed.<b>458</b> The Mission also heard again 
from three witnesses it had interviewed earlier at the public hearings in Gaza. Finally, the 
Mission reviewed information received from TAWTHEQ. 
</p>
<p>824. On the evening of 3 January 2009, between 5 and 6 p.m., a large number of people had 
gathered in the mosque for evening prayers. Witnesses indicate that between 200 and 300 men 
had gathered on the first floor.<b>459</b> A number of women had also congregated in the basement at 
that time. Witnesses explained that in time of fear or emergency it was the tradition to combine 
sunset and evening prayers.<b>460</b> In addition, the Mission heard that, while some time normally 
elapses between the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer and the prayers beginning, at this time 
it was the practice to begin prayers almost immediately. 
</p>
<p>825. The witnesses indicated that prayers had ended and the sermon was just beginning. At that 
point there was an explosion in the doorway to the mosque. One of the two wooden doors was 
blown off its hinges and all the way across the prayer area to the opposite wall.   
</p>
<p>826. As a result of the explosion at least 15 people died. Almost all were inside the mosque at 
the time. One of the casualties was a boy who had been sitting at the entrance. His leg was blown 
off by the missile strike and found afterwards on the roof of the mosque. A large number, around 
40, suffered injuries. Many were taken to the Kamal Idwan hospital for treatment.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>458</b> Note, for example, the affidavit of Ismail al-Salawi, brother of the sheikh at the mosque. He recounts how he was 
on his way to the mosque when his 13-year-old daughter ran towards him screaming that it had been bombed. He 
rushed in to find a scene of bloody chaos. As an immediate result of the strike his grandson Muhammad (13 years 
old), his nephews Hani (8 years old) and Omar (27 years old) were killed. See also a similar explanation of events 
by Ayisha Ibrahim, whose husband, Abdul Rahman (46), and son Ra&#8217;id were killed in the attack. 
<b>459</b> Sheikh al-Salawi, interviewed on 3 June 2009 and 4 July 2009. 
<b>460</b> See, for example, Sheikh al-Salawi at the public hearing in Gaza on 27 July 2009, available at 
http://www.realnetworks.com </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>827. On visiting the mosque, the Mission was able to observe the damage done to it. Its 
immediate entrance is on a raised level from the external pavement and is reached via a ramp. 
There are a number of stairs below the doorway, now covered by the raised entrance at the end 
of the ramp. The stairs underneath the ramp were damaged and the concrete had been pierced. 
There was a scorch mark on the ground and stairs. 
</p>
<p>828. The Mission has also viewed a number of photographs taken shortly after the strike and 
considers them to be reliable. They showed that something had penetrated the concrete (about 
three inches thick) immediately outside of the mosque doorway and then hit the pavement at the 
bottom of the stairs below the concrete covering. The ramp and entrance level structure had a 
wall about one metre high built on its outer side. The part of the wall opposite the mosque door 
was blown away. 
</p>
<p>829. The Mission observed that the interior walls of the mosque and part of the exterio<b>r</b> wall 
around the doorway appeared to have suffered significant damage as a result of a spray of small 
metal cubes. A good number of these were lodged in the wall even at the time of the Mission&#8217;s 
visit to the site in June 2009. Several of these were retrieved and the Mission could see how 
deeply embedded they were in the concrete walls.  
</p>
<p>830. Apart from the aforementioned visit to the mosque, the Mission has interviewed its sheikh 
on three occasions, its imam twice, its muezzin, several members of the sheikh&#8217;s family, several 
of those injured in the blast and a number of the relatives who lost family members and who 
assisted in the immediate aftermath of the attack. It has seen medical certificates that bear out the 
nature of those injuries related by the young men it interviewed. The Mission questioned all of 
the witnesses and sought to clarify any doubts it may have had. 
</p>
<p><b>2. The position of the Israeli Government and the Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>831. The Israeli armed forces&#8217; response to the allegations states:  
</p>
<p>&#8230; relating to a strike against the &#8220;Maqadme&#8221; mosque in Beit-Lahiya on January 3rd, 2009, 
it was discovered that as opposed to the claims, the mosque was not attacked at all. 
Furthermore, it was found that the supposed uninvolved civilians who were the casualties 
of the attack were in fact Hamas operatives killed while fighting against the IDF.<b>461</b> 
</p>
<p>832. Apart from the apparent contradictions it contains, the Mission notes that the statement 
does not indicate in any way the nature of the inquiry, the source of its information or the 
reliability and credibility of such sources. 
</p>
<p>833. In July 2009 the Israeli Government repeated the same position.<b>462</b> 
</p>

<b>461</b> &#8220;Conclusions of investigations into central claims and issues in Operation Cast Lead&#8221;, 22 April 2009, annex C. 
The document was approved and authorized by the Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi. It is 
available at: http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/opcast/postop/press/2201.htm  
<b>462</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>834. The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near 
the doorway of the mosque. The penetration pattern witnessed on the concrete ramp and stairs 
underneath is consistent with that which would be expected of a shrapnel fragmentation sleeve 
fitted onto an air-to-ground missile. Shrapnel cubes that the Mission retrieved from the rear 
inside wall of the mosque are consistent with what would be expected to be discharged by a 
missile of this nature.<b>463</b> 
</p>
<p>835. The strike killed<b> </b>at least 15 people attending the mosque for prayers and very seriously 
injured several others. 
</p>
<p>836. The Mission is not in a position to say from which kind of aircraft or air-launch platform 
the missile was fired. It believes the testimony of the witnesses regarding the circumstances of 
the attack, finding it plausible and consistent not only with the other witnesses, but also with the 
physical evidence at the scene. The Mission also notes that a number of local organizations sent 
representatives to the site of the attack very shortly after it occurred and they witnessed the scene 
for themselves. The Mission has also spoken with them and notes that their accounts are 
consistent with the testimony provided by the witnesses it heard. 
</p>
<p>837. There has been no suggestion that the al-Maqadmah mosque was being used at that time 
to launch rockets, store weapons or shelter combatants.<b>464</b> Since it does not appear from the 
testimonies of the incident or the inspection of the site that any other damage was done in the 
area at that time, the Mission concludes that what occurred was an isolated strike and not in 
connection with an ongoing battle or exchange of fire. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>838. In the absence of any explanation as to the circumstances that led to the missile strike on 
al-Maqadmah mosque and taking into account the credible and reliable accounts the Mission 
heard from multiple witnesses, as well as the matters it could review for itself by visiting the site, 
the Mission concludes that the mosque was intentionally targeted by the Israeli armed forces. 
The Mission also takes into account the precision and sophistication of the Israeli armed forces&#8217; 
munitions in making this finding. 
</p>
<p>839. The Mission&#8217;s finding is strengthened in the face of the unsatisfactory and demonstrably 
false position of the Israeli Government.   
</p>
<p>840. It follows that this was an attack on the civilian population as such and not on a military 
objective. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>463</b> The Mission considers it possible in analysing the information available that the missile in question may have 
been a modified high-explosive anti-tank missile, sometimes referred to as either augmented high-explosive anti-
tank (AHEAT) or high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP). 
<b>464</b> See, for example, statements made by Israel in &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 234.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>841. Based on the facts ascertained, the Mission finds that the Israeli armed forces have 
violated the prohibition under customary international law that the civilian population as such 
will not be the object of attacks as reflected in article 51 (2) of Additional Protocol I. 
</p>
<p>842. Based on those facts, the violations also constitute a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention in respect of wilful killings and wilfully causing great suffering to protected persons. 
</p>
<p>843. The Mission also finds that the State of Israel would be responsible for the arbitrary 
deprivation of the right to life, in relation to article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, of those killed. 
</p>
<p><b>F. The attack on the al-Daya family house, 6 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The facts gathered by the Mission 
</b></p>
<p>844. On 6 January 2009, the al-Daya Family house located on al-Rai&#8217;i Street in Zeytoun, south-
east of Gaza City, was struck by a projectile fired from an F-16 aircraft which killed 22 members 
of the family. Twelve of those killed were children under 10. 
</p>
<p>845. In June 2009, the Mission visited the site of the incident where it interviewed two of the 
four surviving members from the al-Daya family and a number of local residents.<b>465</b> Further 
inquiries and interviews were conducted in late July with neighbours of the al-Daya family. 
</p>
<p>846. The al-Daya house was a four-storey building with seven apartments owned by Fayez 
Musbah al-Daya. Each apartment was occupied by one of his seven sons, some married and 
living with their own families, and two unmarried daughters.  
</p>
<p>847. The Israeli armed forces reached Zeytoun on 3 January. Witnesses interviewed by the 
Mission said that the Israeli armed forces dropped leaflets in the area instructing people not to 
support Hamas and to provide the Israeli armed forces with information, at a given number, on 
military activities in the neighbourhood, including details of weapon facilities.<b>466</b>  
</p>
<p>848. Witnesses mentioned that a rumour had circulated that the Israeli forces were going to 
bomb a house in the neighbourhood, which led several families to leave their homes.<b>467</b> A few 
families chose to stay, including the remaining members of the al-Daya family and five other 
families.<b>468</b>    
</p>
<p>849. On the morning of 6 January, at around 5.35 a.m. a missile was reportedly fired in the 
vicinity of the al-Daya house, close to the Hassan al-Banna mosque, which killed an elderly man. 
Witnesses stated that the strike occurred shortly after the morning prayers had ended and when 
the man was on his way home. The same witnesses confirmed that the death of the man in 
                                                 
<b>465</b> Muhammad Fayez al-Daya, Rida Fayez al-Daya, Aimer al-Daya and Hafez al-Daya.  
<b>466</b> Mission interviews with Muhammad Salam al-Ra&#8217;i, Deeb al-Ra&#8217;i, Faraj al-Ra&#8217;i and Rida al-Daya, July 2009. 
<b>467</b> Those who left included the eldest son of the al- Daya family, Nafez al-Daya, his wife and seven children.  
<b>468</b> The families of Zuher al-Ra&#8217;i (an estimated 16 people), Faraj al-Ra&#8217;i (an estimated 15 people), Jumaa al-Ra&#8217;i 
(an estimated 7 people), Mahmoud al-Hindi (an estimated 4 people) and Shawqi Sa&#8217;d.  </p>

 <p> 
question was caused not by a bullet but by a small missile. Approximately 10 minutes later, at 
around 5.45 a.m. the al-Daya family house was hit by a projectile from an F-16 aircraft.  
</p>
<p>850. Twenty-two members of the al-Daya family inside the house were killed.<b>469</b> 
</p>
<p>851. The Mission interviewed a number of neighbours. Each one of them said they had not 
received any warning call from the Israeli forces prior to the strike on the al-Daya house and 
confirmed that no other house in the street was struck after the al-Daya house had been hit. 
</p>
<p>852. Owing to the location of the house and the narrow street access it took several hours 
before neighbours were able to dig through the rubble. One brother, Radwan al-Daya, was pulled 
out of the debris alive and taken to the hospital with the help of a PRCS worker who lived near 
the al-Daya house. He died three days later having suffered severe asphyxiation. Several bodies 
were recovered only after the withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces. 
</p>
<p><b>2. The Israeli position 
</b></p>
<p>853. On 22 April 2009 the Israeli armed forces issued the following statement: 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;] The Al-Daia family residence in the Zeitoun neighbourhood in the city of Gaza 
(January 6th, 2009) &#8211; the incident in question was a result of an operational error with 
unfortunate consequences. The investigation concluded that the IDF intended to attack a 
weapons storage facility that was located in the building next to the Al-Daia family 
residence. It appears that following an error, the structure that was planned to be attacked 
was the Al-Daia residence rather than the building containing the weapons.<b>470</b> 
</p>
<p>854. In July 2009 the Israeli Government stated the following: 
</p>
<p>The IDF has concluded that this tragic event was the result of an operational error. 
An investigation determined that the IDF intended to strike a weapons&#8217; storage facility 
located in a building next to this residence. However, the IDF erroneously targeted the 
Al-Daia residence, rather than the weapons storehouse. Although the IDF did provide 
warning shots to the roof of the Al-Daia residence, other warnings (such as the warning 
phone call) were made to the building <i>actually </i>containing the weapons, not the Al-Daia 
residence. 
</p>
<p>The IDF is examining how the unfortunate operational error occurred, in order to 
reinforce safeguards and to prevent its recurrence. Israel deeply regrets the tragic 
outcome. This is the kind of mistake that can occur during intensive fighting in a crowded 
environment, against an enemy that uses civilian neighbourhoods as cover for its 
operations. IDF forces did not intentionally target civilians. This lack of unlawful intent 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>469</b> These included the wife of Muhammad al-Daya (one of the surviving family members), their three daughters and 
one son, all under seven, who were crushed under the rubble of the house. Most of them were asleep at the time of 
the attack. Others killed included Fayez al-Daya and his wife; Iyad al-Daya and his wife Rawda, their three 
daughters and three sons, all under 10; Ramez al-Daya, his wife Safa, and their six-month-old daughter and two-
year-old son; two sisters, Raghdah and Sabrine, and Radwan al-Daya. 
<b>470</b> &#8220;Conclusions of investigations&#8230;&#8221;, annex C.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>has been a critical factor, in past incidents involving operational mistakes by other armies 
(such as NATO&#8217;s erroneous bombing of the Chinese Embassy in the former Yugoslavia), 
in determining that no violation of the Law of Armed Conflict occurred. Similarly, 
although its attack on the Al-Daia residence was a tragic error, it did not constitute a 
violation of the laws of war.<b>471</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>855. Israel&#8217;s position is that the al-Daya house was destroyed as a result of an &#8220;operational 
error&#8221; made at some point in the planning of the operation. It says the target that should have 
been hit was a neighbouring house storing weapons. The Mission has interviewed the residents 
of the neighbouring houses and visited the site. No neighbouring house was attacked at any time 
after the al-Daya house was destroyed. The Mission finds it difficult to understand how a target 
apparently important enough to be targeted for such definitive destruction in the first place, as a 
result of what it apparently contained, could then remain free from attack for the remaining 
12 days of the land operation. 
</p>
<p>856. The Mission is unable to verify claims that a warning was given by means of firing a 
small missile to the roof as the house was destroyed and the residents killed. Local witnesses 
have reported that a small missile did appear to strike an elderly man in the neighbourhood about 
10 minutes before the al-Daya house was destroyed but the Mission is not in a position to say 
whether this is likely to have been an errant warning shot. 
</p>
<p>857. The Israeli authorities have not indicated with any precision which house they called but 
the claim that a warning call was made to the house that allegedly contained weapons has been 
denied by all local residents. No such call was received by anyone in the houses neighbouring 
the al-Daya house. 
</p>
<p>858. In these circumstances there are significant doubts about the Israeli authorities&#8217; account of 
the incident and what has been offered to date does not in the view of the Mission constitute an 
explanation. 
</p>
<p>859. Besides the main difficulties mentioned above, there are a number of issues that could 
have been easily clarified but were not. The precise nature of the operational error remains 
unclear, as does the time it occurred and who was responsible for it. Similarly, it would appear 
that the warnings system failed at various points: the Government of Israel reports that a warning 
was given on the basis that it believed there was a house storing weapons. Given the power of 
the projectile that destroyed the four-storey al-Daya building, the Mission wonders what the 
consequences would have been if the projectile had in fact struck a weapons store, yet there is no 
suggestion by the Israeli authorities of a warning having been given to neighbouring houses that 
secondary explosions were possible. Not only does it appear that the wrong warnings were given 
to the wrong people, but if the existence of the storage facility is to be believed at all, it would 
also appear that the apparently feasible step of warning locals of entirely foreseeable danger was 
not taken either.

<b>471</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 386-387. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>860. The Mission finds the version of events offered so far by Israel to be unsatisfactory. The 
details given are not sufficient to clarify the nature of the very serious error that has been made, 
if it was an error. In so far as any explanation has been given, it appears to lack coherence and 
raises more questions than it answers. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>861. In the absence of information necessary to determine the precise circumstances of the 
incident, the Mission can make no findings on possible violations of international humanitarian 
law or international criminal law. If indeed a mistake was made and the intention was to destroy 
a house nearby rather than to kill the al-Daya family, there could not be said to be a case of 
wilful killing as the requisite degree of criminal intent would not have been established on the 
part of the individuals responsible.<b>472</b> 
</p>
<p>862. However, the issue of State responsibility remains. The International Law Commission&#8217;s 
articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts<b>473</b> are silent on whether 
such a mistake relieves a State of its international responsibility for the commission of an 
internationally wrongful act and the requirement of fault in international law is controversial. In 
a commentary on the articles, Crawford and Olleson consider that &#8220;if a State deliberately carries 
out some specific act, there is less room for it to argue that the harmful consequences were 
unintended and should be disregarded. Everything depends on the specific context and on the 
content and interpretation of the obligation said to have been breached&#8221;.<b>474</b>  
</p>
<p>863. The obligation breached in this case is the duty to ensure the general protection of the 
civilian population against the dangers arising from military operations, as reflected in article 
51 (1) of Additional Protocol I. 
</p>
<p>864. The firing of the projectile was a deliberate act in so far as it was planned, by Israel&#8217;s 
admission, to strike the al-Daya house. The fact that target selection had gone wrong at the 
planning stage does not strip the act of its deliberate character. The consequences may have been 
unintended; the act was deliberate. Taken together with further facts (such as the failure to 
deliver an effective warning) and the nature of the &#8220;intransgressible obligation&#8221; to protect 
civilian life, the Mission considers that, even if a fault element is required, the available 
information demonstrates a substantial failure of due diligence on the part of Israel. As such, the 
Mission considers Israel to be liable for the consequences of this wrongful act. 
</p>
<p>865. The Mission finds that Israel&#8217;s lack of due diligence in this case also constitutes a 
violation of the right to life as set out in article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Israel is a party. The right to life includes the negative obligation to 
respect life and the positive obligation to protect life. The Human Rights Committee has stated 
that States parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation by criminal

 <p> 
acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces.<b>475</b> No exception is made 
for acts during war.  
</p>
<p>866. The right to life also includes a procedural component that requires adequate investigation 
of any alleged violation &#8220;promptly, thoroughly and effectively through independent and 
impartial bodies&#8221; for &#8220;failure by a State party to investigate allegations of violations could in and 
of itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant.&#8221;<b>476</b> The investigation of the Israeli armed 
forces referred to above lacks transparency and credibility. The failure of Israel to comply with 
the procedural requirement adds to the frustration and anger felt by survivors, who have received 
no credible explanation for what occurred.  
</p>
<p><b>G. Attack on the Abd al-Dayem condolence tents 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The facts gathered by the Mission 
</b></p>
<p>867. On 4 January 2009 the Israeli armed forces struck an ambulance in the Beit Lahia area 
with a flechette missile as it was attending a number of wounded persons who had been hit in an 
earlier attack. Those wounded in the first attack had also been hit by a flechette missile. As a 
result of the attack on the ambulance, one of the first-aid volunteers in the ambulance crew, 
Arafa Abd al-Dayem, suffered severe injuries. He died later the same afternoon.  
</p>
<p>868. The following day, as is the custom, the family set up condolence tents where family and 
friends would pay their respects and comfort the grieving relatives. The family home is in Izbat 
Beit Hanoun, a built-up area in the north-east corner of the Gaza strip. It is located between 
Jabaliyah and Beit Hanoun, about 3 kilometres from the border with Israel both to the north and 
to the east. Although the Israeli armed forces had entered Gaza at the time of the incident, in this 
area they remained on the Israeli side of the &#8220;Green Line&#8221; border. Two tents were set up &#8211; one 
for male visitors and one for female visitors. They were positioned at about ten metres from each 
other. The male tent was outside the house of Mohammed Deeb Abd al-Dayem, the father of the 
ambulance driver. 
</p>
<p>869. The tents were struck three times in two hours, again with flechette missiles.  
</p>
<p>870. The Mission spoke to several of the witnesses who had attended and survived the attacks 
on the condolence tents. The Mission noted the great pride Arafa Abd al-Dayem&#8217;s father had in 
his son and the deep sense of loss he clearly felt.  
</p>
<p>871. As regards the attacks on the condolence tents, witnesses stated that at around 7.30 a.m. 
on 5 January, the house of Mohammed Deeb Abd al-Dayem, was hit by a shell. The shell struck 
the fourth floor of the five-storey building causing the roof to collapse.<b>477</b> Three men at the 
gathering, including the father of the deceased, were slightly wounded and taken to the Kamal

Idwan hospital in Beit Lahia for treatment. They returned to the house at around 8.15 a.m. where 
a decision was taken by the mourners to end the condolence ceremony for fear of further attacks. 
</p>
<p>872. The witness stated that at around 8.30 a.m. when the people were leaving the house of 
Mohammed Deeb Abd al-Dayem and moving towards the women&#8217;s condolence tent, two 
flechette missiles struck within a few metres of the tent and less than half a minute apart. Around 
20 to 30 persons assembled there were injured. The injured include a 13-year-old boy who 
received a flechette injury to the right side of his head and a 33-year-old man who sustained 
injuries to the chest and head, his body punctuated with little holes according to a witness who 
saw his corpse being prepared for burial. A 22-year-old man was wounded in the abdomen, the 
chest and the head. A 16-year-old boy sustained injuries to the head and the neck. A 26-year-old 
man sustained injuries to his chest, head and left leg. These five persons died of their injuries. 
Another 17 persons present at the scene, including 14 men, two children (aged 17 and 11) and 
one woman were injured. 
</p>
<p>873. IK/12, who survived the attack, still has several flechettes embedded in his body, 
including in his chest, and is unable to move freely without pain. 
</p>
<p>874. Witnesses described that their sense of loss was aggravated by the fact that they could not 
access the injured or dead in hospitals as movement was restricted owing to continued shelling in 
and around the neighbourhood. Only two families out of the five families of the dead were able 
to conduct the burial according to their traditional customs and practices.  
</p>
<p><b>2. The Israeli position 
</b></p>
<p>875. The Israeli Government does not appear to have made any public comment on the 
allegations surrounding the Abd al-Dayem case, despite information about it being in the public 
domain for some time.<b>478</b> It has, however, recalled that the Israeli High Court of Justice has 
rejected the argument that flechette munitions are by their nature indiscriminate and maintains 
that subject to the general requirements of the rules of armed conflict their use is legal.<b>479</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>876. The Mission visited the area and the house of the Abd al-Dayem family. It spoke with the 
father of Arafa Abd al-Dayem, who had died as a result of the injuries received while working as 
a first-aid volunteer, and with several of the witnesses who had attended the condolence 
ceremonies. 
</p>
<p>877. The account of the incidents was consistent and plausible. The fact that it was mainly men 
who were killed near the women&#8217;s tent is explained by the fact that the strikes occurred precisely 
when the men were making their way across the road. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>478</b> The incident is mentioned in Amnesty International, <i>Fuelling Conflict: Foreign Arms Supplies to Usrael/Gaza</i> 
(February 2009). 
<b>479</b> See &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 431-435. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>878. The Mission can see nothing at all that points to the house of Mohammed Deeb Abd 
al-Dayem, or the condolence tents constituting a military objective. The repeated nature of the 
strikes indicates that there was a deliberate attempt to kill members of the group or the entire 
group, but no information about the purpose of the strikes has been forthcoming from the Israeli 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>879. The Mission inspected the sites of the attacks and was left in no doubt that they had been 
entirely deliberate. There was a tent at each side of the wide road. The particular area is 
relatively open. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>880. While international humanitarian law does not explicitly prohibit the use of flechettes in 
all circumstances, the principles of proportionality and precautions necessary in attack render 
their use illegal. Flechettes are 4-cm-long metal darts used as anti-personnel weapons that 
penetrate straight through human bone and can cause serious, often fatal, injuries.<b>480</b> Discharged 
from tank shells and aircraft or UAV-launched missiles, they are fired in salvo and are therefore 
an area anti-personnel weapon. They are, therefore, by their nature lacking in discrimination. 
</p>
<p>881. The Mission notes that, during the condolence ceremony, flechette shells were fired in the 
vicinity of a large group of civilians, killing 5 and injuring more than 20. To consider the attacks 
indiscriminate would imply that there was a military objective underlying the attacks in the first 
place. The Mission has no information on which to base such a conclusion and notes the silence 
of the Israeli authorities on the incident.  
</p>
<p>882. The Mission therefore considers that the families participating in the condolence 
ceremony were civilians and taking no active part in hostilities. The attacks on the condolence 
tent on the morning of 4 January were entirely unjustified and unnecessary. The attacks seemed 
designed to kill and maim the victims directly and otherwise to terrify the people in the area 
rather than to pursue any genuine military objective. 
</p>
<p>883. The Mission finds that the attack on the Abd al-Dayem family condolence tents 
constitutes an intentional attack against the civilian population and civilian objects, wilful killing 
and the wilful infliction of suffering. In particular, the Mission believes that any party using a 
flechette missile in circumstances that are totally or predominantly civilian cannot fail to 
anticipate the severe and unnecessary suffering of the civilians affected.  
</p>
<p>884. Based on the facts ascertained, the Mission therefore finds there to have been violations of 
customary international law in respect of a deliberate attack on civilians. It considers the attack 
was not only an attack intended to kill but also to spread terror among the civilian population, 
given the nature of the weapon used. (See art. 51 (2) of Additional Protocol I.)

 <p> 
</p><p>885. The Mission also finds the attack to constitute a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention with respect to article 147 regarding wilful killings and wilfully causing great 
suffering. 
</p>
<p><b>XII.  THE USE OF CERTAIN WEAPONS 
</b></p>
<p>886. In the course of its inquiries, the Mission was made aware of the use of certain weapons 
by the Israeli armed forces. This chapter does not intend to present a comprehensive analysis of 
all the aspects raised on the kinds of weaponry used during the military operations. It is rather a 
summary of the Mission&#8217;s views on a number of issues that arise from the foregoing chapters in 
relation to the obligation to take all feasible precautions in the choice of the means and methods 
of warfare. Many of the issues brought to the Mission&#8217;s attention had already received scrutiny 
in the press or as a result of analysis carried out by a number of organizations.<b>481</b> Among these 
issues was the use of white phosphorous, the use of flechette missiles, the use of so-called dense 
inert metal explosive (DIME) munitions, and the use of depleted uranium.  
</p>
<p><b>A. White phosphorous 
</b></p>
<p>887. White phosphorous was used throughout the ground phase of the operations. The Israeli 
Government has set out its reasons for doing so, emphasizing that it is not only not a proscribed 
weapon under international law but that it was deployed with a high degree of success.<b>482</b> 
</p>
<p>888. It has explained that it used white phosphorous in two forms. One was as exploding 
munitions used as mortar shells by ground and naval forces. It says that in this form it was 
deployed only in unpopulated areas for marking and signalling purposes, and not in an anti-
personnel capacity. It claims that, as a result of international concerns, it decided to stop using 
these munitions on 7 January 2009, although this was not required by international law. It also 
acknowledges the use of smoke projectiles containing felt wedges dipped in white phosphorous.  
</p>
<p>889. The Mission understands the means of deploying these smoke projectiles was that they 
were fired as a canister shell by 155-mm howitzers. The projectile was timed or programmed to 
air-burst over its designated target. The canister shell then discharged a quantity of felt wedges 
impregnated with white phosphorous, usually in the order of 160 wedges in a fan-like dispersion 
earthwards. These wedges with white phosphorous, which is a pyrophoric chemical (that is, self-
igniting when in contact with the air), emit smoke and continue to do so until the chemical is 
exhausted or deprived of air. Wedges of white phosphorous therefore remain active and have 
done so in Gaza for up to 21 and 24 days after discharge. It is technically possible that there are 
</p>

<b>481</b> See, for example, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, Report of the Independent Fact Finding Mission into 
violations in the Gaza Strip during the period 27.12.08-18.01.09, http://www.phr.org.il/phr/files/articlefile 
_1241949935203.pdf, Human Rights Watch,  Rain of Fire: Israel&#8217;s Unlawful Use of White Phosphorous in Gaza

 <p> 
still active white phosphorous wedges in Gaza &#8211; in water tanks or in sewage systems, for 
example. Children have subsequently been injured by coming in contact with such wedges. 
</p>
<p>890. The Mission has recounted a number of incidents where it has particular concern about the 
choice to use white phosphorous. These incidents have been addressed in detail elsewhere and 
include the incidents at the UNRWA compound in Gaza City, the attacks on al-Quds and al-
Wafa hospitals, also in Gaza City, and the use of white phosphorous in the attack on the Abu 
Halima family to the north of al-Atatra and in Khuz&#8217;a.  
</p>
<p>891. The Mission notes that, at least in the case of Abu Halima,<b>483</b> it appears that the white 
phosphorous was deployed by means of an exploding shell and not as a smoke projectile. This 
occurred several days after the apparent decision to stop using the munitions on 7 January 2009. 
</p>
<p>892. The Mission has also spoken at some length to a number of local and international 
medical experts who treated patients in Gaza who suffered burns as a result of exposure to white 
phosphorous. 
</p>
<p>893. The Mission need not repeat much of what it has already concluded on the choice to use 
white phosphorous in specific circumstances. It has already made clear that the risks it posed to 
the civilian population and civilian objects in the area under attack were excessive in relation to 
the specific military advantages sought.  
</p>
<p>894. The Israeli Government has frequently pointed out the difficulties posed by fighting in 
built-up areas. One of the difficulties is the proximity of civilian premises to possible military 
targets. Commanders have no choice but to factor in the risk to such premises and the people 
inside them in deciding which weapons to use. The Mission finds that the Israeli armed forces 
were systematically reckless in determining to use white phosphorous in built-up areas and in 
particular in and around areas of particular importance to civilian health and safety.  
</p>
<p>895. In addition to the reckless use of white phosphorous, the Mission must emphasize that it is 
concerned not only with the inordinate risks the Israeli armed forces took in using it, but also the 
damage it caused in fact. In speaking with medical experts and practitioners, it was impressed by 
the severity and sometimes untreatable nature of the burns caused by the substance. 
</p>
<p>896. Several doctors told of how they believed they had dealt with a wound successfully only 
to find unexpected complications developing as a result of the phosphorous having caused 
deeper damage to tissue and organs than could be detected at the time. Several patients died, 
according to doctors, as a result of organ failure resulting from the burns. 
</p>
<p>897. A senior doctor at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City confirmed that Sabah, Ghada and Farah 
Abu Halima were admitted with serious burns and transferred to Egypt for treatment. The doctor 
believed that the burns were caused by contact with white phosphorous.<b>484</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>483</b> See chap. XI.  
<b>484</b> Mission interview on 12 June 2009.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>898. The doctor commented that, before the military operations, the hospital was not familiar 
with white phosphorous burns. Staff became concerned when patients who had been sent home 
after treatment of apparently minor burns would come back in the following days with more 
serious wounds. They found that when they removed the bandages that had been applied to a 
wound that still contained fragments of white phosphorous, smoke would come from the wound, 
even hours after the injury. White phosphorous continues to burn as long as it is in contact with 
oxygen. 
</p>
<p>899. International doctors working with al-Shifa staff, some of whom had worked in Lebanon 
during the 2006 war, identified white phosphorous as the cause of these injuries and the 
treatment was adapted accordingly. Any apparent white phosphorous burn was immediately 
covered with a wet sponge and the particles extracted. White phosphorous sticks to tissue, so all 
flesh and sometimes the muscle around the burn would have to be excised. 
</p>
<p>900. In addition, the highly toxic substance, used so widely in civilian settings posed a real 
health threat to doctors dealing with patients. Medical staff reported to the Mission how even 
working in the areas where the phosphorous had been used made them feel sick, their lips would 
swell and they would become extremely thirsty and nauseous. 
</p>
<p>901. While accepting that white phosphorous is not at this stage proscribed under international 
law, the Mission considers that the repeated misuse of the substance by the Israeli armed forces 
during this operation calls into question the wisdom of allowing its continued use without some 
further degree of control. The Mission understands the need to use obscurants and illuminants for 
various reasons during military operations and especially in screening troops from observation or 
enemy fire. There are, however, other screening and illuminating means which are free from the 
toxicities, volatilities and hazards that are inherent in the chemical white phosphorous. The use 
of white phosphorous in any from in and around areas dedicated to the health and safety of 
civilians has been shown to carry very substantial risks. The Mission therefore believes that 
serious consideration should be given to banning the use of white phosphorous as an obscurant. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Flechettes485 
</b></p>
<p>902. Flechettes are small, dart-like pieces of composite metal and are usually fired in salvo 
from canister projectiles or shells. Those fired and retrieved in Gaza were 4 cm long and 
approximately 2&#8211;4 mm wide, having a pointed end and a fletched end. 
</p>
<p>903. Flechettes are used in an anti-personnel role and are discharged in such quantities that 
they cover an area forward of the canister shell. As an area weapon, on impact the darts will hit 
whatever is within a certain zone. They are incapable of discriminating between objectives after 
detonation. They are, therefore, particularly unsuitable for use in urban settings where there is 
reason to believe civilians may be present. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>485</b> See &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 431-434. The report simply states that the weapons are not proscribed and 
this was reiterated by the Israeli High Court of Justice in 2002. Although it does not address specific allegations, it 
does state in general terms that allegations are still being investigated (para. 435). The Mission addressed questions 
to the Government of Israel regarding the use of flechettes during the military operations in Gaza. No reply was 
received. </p>

 <p> 
904. Flechettes were fired during the military operations on several occasions by tanks and on 
at least one occasion from an air-to-surface missile of the &#8220;Helfire&#8221; type.<b>486</b> In all cases those hit 
by these devices were civilians and in one case were attending a condolence tent following the 
loss of a family member who was also killed by flechettes. 
</p>
<p>905. Flechettes are known to bend, break or &#8220;tumble&#8221; on impact with human flesh. Such 
performances are often part of the flechettes design characteristic and are marketed as such. 
&#8220;Tumbling&#8221; in particular is adjudged to be a further determination of the projectiles 
&#8220;incapacitation&#8221; effect.<b>487</b> The Mission notes, however, that flechettes can be designed to be free 
of these post-impact characteristics if it is desired that they should do so. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Alleged use of munitions causing a specific type of injury 
</b></p>
<p>906.  The Mission received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who operated in Gaza 
during the military operations of a strikingly high percentage of patients with severed legs as a 
result of the impact of projectiles launched by the Israeli armed forces. Dr. Mads Gilbert, a 
Norwegian anaesthetist, and Dr. Eric Fosse, a Norwegian surgeon, who carried out surgery in 
al-Shifa Hospital from 31 December 2008 to 10 January 2009,<b>488</b> described to the Mission the 
characteristics of the wounds. The amputations mostly occurred at waist height in children, 
generally lower in adults, and were combined with skin-deep, third-degree burns, four to six 
fingers upward from the amputation. Where the amputation took place, the flesh was cauterized 
as a result of the heat. The patients with these amputations had no shrapnel wounds, but red 
flashes on the abdomen and chest. The excision of large pieces of flesh was not infrequent in 
these patients. Dr. Gilbert added that the patients also suffered internal burns. This description 
was confirmed to the Mission by Palestinian surgeons.  
</p>
<p>907. The Mission understands such injuries to be compatible with the impact of DIME 
weapons. DIME weapons consist of a carbon-fibre casing filled with a homogeneous mixture of 
an explosive material and small particles, basically a powder, of a heavy metal, for instance, a 
tungsten alloy. Upon detonation of the explosive, the casing disintegrates into extremely small, 
non-lethal fibres. The tungsten powder tears apart anything it hits. The impact of such weapons 
in general causes very severe wounds within a relatively limited diameter (compared to other 
projectiles) from the point of detonation. As the small heavy metal particles can slice through 
soft tissue and bone, survivors close to the lethal zone may have their limbs amputated and 
tungsten alloy particles embedded in their bodies. The probabilities of injuries to persons at a 
greater distance from the detonation point are reduced compared to more conventional 
projectiles. It is therefore also referred to as a &#8220;focused lethality munition&#8221;.<b>489</b>

908. The materials submitted to the Mission, including by the expert witness Lt. Col. Lane, 
point to specific medical concerns with regard to survivors of DIME weapon injuries.<b>490</b> The 
tungsten<b> </b>alloy particles are suspected to be highly carcinogenic and so small that they cannot be 
extracted from the patient&#8217;s body. Dr. Gilbert noted that there had been no follow-up studies on 
the survivors of this type of amputation observed in Gaza and Lebanon since 2006 following 
Israeli military operations. There is some research suggesting that these patients might be at 
increased risk of cancer. These concerns apply equally to missile or projectile shrapnel of heavy 
metal such as tungsten or tungsten alloy which was used in at least two occasions in Gaza. The 
carcinogenic hazards are the same no matter the delivery means or the size or shape of the pieces 
of the metal that enter human flesh. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Factual findings on the use of munitions causing a specific type of injury 
</b></p>
<p>909. From the facts it gathered, the Mission finds that the allegations that DIME weapons were 
used by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza during the military operations require further 
clarification with regard to their use and, particularly, the health-care needs of survivors of the 
amputations attributed to DIME weapons.  
</p>
<p>910. The Mission notes that DIME or heavy metal shrapnel weapons and weapons armed with 
heavy metal are not prohibited under international law as it currently stands. The &#8220;focused 
lethality&#8221; reportedly pursued in the development of DIME weapons could be seen as advancing 
compliance with the principle of distinction. The Mission also observes, however, that there 
remains a very high risk of harming civilians when using these weapons in built-up areas and 
that concerns have been expressed that DIME weapons could have a particularly adverse impact 
on the enjoyment of the right to health of survivors, which would go beyond the impact generally 
associated with being affected by anti-personnel weapons in an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Allegations regarding the use of depleted and non-depleted uranium  
munitions by the Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>911. The Mission received submissions and reviewed reports alleging the use of depleted 
uranium weapons by the Israeli armed forces during the military operations in Gaza.<b>491</b> While it 
cannot be excluded that such weapons were used, on the basis of the information received the 
Mission decided not to investigate the matter further. 
</p>
<p>912. The Mission also received a submission which alleged that the analysis of the air filter

</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                             
micro-shrapnel consisted of tungsten or tungsten alloy cubes, which may have similar carcinogenic hazards as the 
powder or fibres in DIME.

<p><b>XIII. ATTACKS ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF CIVILIAN LIFE IN GAZA: 
DESTRUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE, FOOD 
PRODUCTION, WATER INSTALLATIONS, SEWAGE TREATMENT 
PLANTS AND HOUSING</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. The destruction of el-Bader flour mill 
</b></p>
<p>913. The Mission visited the site of the air strikes and surveyed the surrounding area in 
Sudaniyah, west of Jabaliyah. It met and interviewed the Hamada brothers, joint owners of the 
el-Bader flour mill, on four occasions. It spoke with representatives of the business community 
about the context and consequences of the strike on the flour mill. Mr. Hamada also testified at 
the public hearings in Gaza.<b>493</b> The Mission also addressed questions to the Government of Israel 
with regard to the military advantage pursued in attacking the el-Bader flour mill, but received 
no reply. 
</p>
<p>914. The Hamada brothers are well-established businessmen and hold <i>Businessman Cards</i>, 
issued by the Israeli authorities to facilitate business travel to and from Israel. The flour mill is 
one of several businesses owned by the brothers on this site, including a tomato-canning factory 
and a factory for the production of nappies. These last two businesses were closed down 
sometime before the beginning of the Israeli military operations in Gaza, as the blockade led to a 
lack of supplies. According to Mr. Rashad Hamada, the tomato-canning business failed primarily 
because of the Israeli authorities&#8217; refusal to allow tins for canning into Gaza. The owners had 
transferred many employees from the businesses that had closed down to the flour mill so that 
these employees would continue to draw a salary. At the time of its destruction, the flour mill 
employed more than 50 people. 
</p>
<p>915. The el-Bader flour mill began operations in 1999.<b>494</b> By 27 December 2008, it was the 
only one of Gaza&#8217;s three flour mills still operating. The others had ceased operations owing to a 
lack of supplies. The el-Bader mill was able to continue in part because of its greater storage 
capacity. 
</p>

<b>492</b> Submission by Chris Busby &amp; Dai Williams. Battlefield Fallout: Evidence of Uranium and Niobium in Weapons 
Employed by the Israeli Military in Gaza. Analysis of Ambulance Air Filter and Bomb Crater. 
<b>493</b> The Mission met Rashad Hamada and other members of the Palestinian business community on 3 June 2009 and 
interviewed him at the site of the el-Bader flour mill on 4 June 2009. Mr. Hamada testified at the public hearings in 
Gaza on 29 June 2009. 
<b>494</b> Rashad Hamada stated that the aim of the business, besides making a profit, was to help Gaza to be more self-
sustaining economically and thus to reduce dependence on external supplies. He indicated that the increase in 
running costs caused by the blockade gave Israeli competitors a considerable advantage. The cost of electricity, for 
example, was approximately 50 per cent higher than it was for his competitors in Israel. In addition, since the Israeli 
Government had closed the Erez crossing and all imports and exports had to go through the Karni crossing, transport 
costs had increased 10-fold. The increased cost for the consumer had, as a result, also been significant. The retail 
price of milled flour had risen, in his estimation, by perhaps as much as 10 per cent. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>916. On 30 December 2008, a recorded warning was left on the flour mill&#8217;s answering machine 
to the effect that the message was from the Israeli armed forces and that the building should be 
evacuated immediately. The approximately 45 workers in the mill at the time were evacuated at 
around 9.30 a.m. 
</p>
<p>917. Following the evacuation, Mr. Hamada called a business associate in Israel, explained 
what had happened and asked him for advice. The business associate called him back, indicating 
that he had spoken with contacts in the Israeli armed forces on Mr. Hamada&#8217;s behalf, and had 
been told that, although the mill had been on a list of proposed targets, they had decided not to 
proceed with the strike. Mr. Hamada did not receive any information as to why his mill might 
have been targeted. 
</p>
<p>918. As a result of these conversations and the fact that there had been no strike, the employees 
returned to work the next day. Work continued for a number of days until a second recorded 
warning was received on or around 4 January 2009. The flour mill was again evacuated and 
Mr. Hamada again contacted his business associate in Israel. The same scenario unfolded 
whereby Mr. Hamada received a call later on to the effect that the Israeli armed forces had 
informed his associate that the mill would not be hit. The employees returned to work in the light 
of the information and the fact that the warnings had not been put into effect. 
</p>
<p>919. On 9 January, at around 3 or 4 a.m., the flour mill was hit by an air strike, possibly by an 
F-16. The missile struck the floor that housed one of the machines indispensable to the mill&#8217;s 
functioning, completely destroying it. The guard who was on duty at the time called Mr. Hamada 
to inform him that the building had been hit and was on fire. He was unhurt. In the next 60 to 
90 minutes the mill was hit several times by missiles fired from an Apache helicopter. These 
missiles hit the upper floors of the factory, destroying key machinery. Adjoining buildings, 
including the grain store, were not hit. The strikes entirely disabled the factory and it has not 
been back in operation since. A large amount of grain remains at the site but cannot be 
processed.  
</p>
<p>920.  The Israeli armed forces occupied the disabled building until around 13 January. 
Hundreds of shells were found on its roof after the soldiers left. They appeared to be 40-mm 
grenade machine-gun spent cartridges. 
</p>
<p>921. The Hamada brothers rejected any suggestion that the building was at any time used for 
any purpose by Palestinian armed groups. They pointed out that all of the buildings and factories 
were surrounded by a high wall and manned by at least one guard at night. In addition, the Israeli 
authorities knew them as businessmen and they would not have been given Businessman Cards 
had there been any reason for the Israeli Government to suspect that they were involved with or 
supported armed groups. They were both adamant that their interest was and always had been 
industrial and commercial, and that the last thing they were prepared to do was put their business 
at risk. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>922. The Mission found the Hamada brothers to be credible and reliable witnesses. It has no 
reason to doubt the veracity of their testimony. The information they provided was corroborated </p>

 <p> 
by other representatives of the Gaza business community with whom the Mission discussed the 
context and consequences of the strike on the flour mill.  
</p>
<p>923. The owners and employees of the flour mill were forced to evacuate the building twice 
because of the two recorded warnings left on the answerphone, which were not followed by air 
strikes. They were put into a state of fear as a result of the false alarms. When the mill was hit on 
9 January, the strike happened without prior warning, raising questions about the efficacy or 
seriousness of the warnings system used by the Israeli armed forces.  
</p>
<p>924. The consequences of the strike on the flour mill were significant. Not only are all the 
employees out of work, the capacity of Gaza to produce milled flour, the most basic staple 
ingredient of the local diet, has been greatly diminished. As a result, the population of Gaza is 
now more dependent on the Israeli authorities&#8217; granting permission for flour and bread to enter 
the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p>925. Available information does not suggest that the Israeli authorities have investigated the 
destruction of the flour mill. The Mission finds the version of the Hamada brothers to be credible 
and in line with the Israeli practice of leaving telephone warnings of impending attacks. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>926. In considering the degree to which there may have been violations of international 
humanitarian law, the Mission refers to article 52 of Additional Protocol 1, which is set out in 
full above at chapter VII. The Mission also considers the following provisions to be relevant to 
its deliberations: 
</p>
<p><b>Article 54 (1) and (2) of Additional Protocol I 
</b></p>
<p>1. Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>2. It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects 
indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural 
areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and 
supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their 
sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse party, whatever the motive, 
whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other 
motive. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides: 
</b></p>
<p>Grave breaches to which the preceding article relates shall be those involving any of 
the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the present 
Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological 
experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, unlawful 
deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of a protected person, compelling a 
protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power, or wilfully depriving a protected 
person of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the present Convention, taking of 
hostages and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military 
necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>927. No other buildings in the industrial compound belonging to the Hamadas were damaged at 
the time of the strikes. It appears that the strikes on the flour mill were intentional and precise. 
</p>
<p>928. The Hamada brothers are well-known businessmen. The Israeli authorities did not appear 
to consider them either before or after the military operations to be a threat, given the 
unrestricted issuance of their Businessman Cards and their ability to travel to Israel afterwards. 
The issuance of a Businessman Card is no trifle, especially in the context of the ongoing 
restrictions on trade. It is not plausible that the Israeli authorities would issue such a document to 
any party it regarded with suspicion. 
</p>
<p>929. The only issue that remains to be examined is whether there was any reason for the flour 
mill to have been deemed a military objective on 9 January. The building was one of the tallest 
in the area and would have offered extensive views to the Israeli armed forces. The Mission 
notes that taking control of the building might be deemed a legitimate objective in the 
circumstances. However, by 9 January the Israeli armed forces were fully aware that the flour 
mill could be evacuated at short notice by using the warning message system. If the reason for 
attacking the mill was to gain control of it for observation and control purposes, it made no sense 
to bomb the principal machinery and to destroy the upper floors. There is also no suggestion that 
the Israeli armed forces considered the building to be a source of enemy fire.  
</p>
<p>930. The nature of the strikes on the mill and in particular the precise targeting of crucial 
machinery on one of the mid-level floors suggests that the intention was to disable its productive 
capacity. There appears to be no plausible justification for the extensive damage to the flour mill 
if the sole objective was to take control of the building. It thus appears that the only purpose was 
to put an end to the production of flour in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>931. From the facts it ascertained, the Mission finds that there has been a violation of the grave 
breaches provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Unlawful and wanton destruction which 
is not justified by military necessity would amount to a war crime.  
</p>
<p>932. Having concluded that the strikes were without any military justification, and therefore 
wanton and unlawful, the Mission finds it useful to consider if there was any non-military 
purpose to the strikes.  
</p>
<p>933. The aim of the strike, if not military, could only have been to destroy the local capacity to 
produce flour. The question is whether such deliberate destruction of the sole remaining flour-
producing capacity in the Gaza Strip can be described as having been done for the purpose of 
denying sustenance to the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>934. Article 54 (1) and (2) of Additional Protocol I reflect customary international law.<b>495</b> 
Article 54 (2) prohibits acts whose specific purpose is the denial of sustenance for whatever 
reason, including starvation, forced displacement or anything else. In short, the motive for 
denying sustenance need not be to starve the civilian population. Indeed, the motive is irrelevant. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>495</b> In this respect the Mission agrees with the views expressed by ICRC in <i>Customary Rules of International Law&#8230;</i>, 
pp. 189-193. </p>

 <p> 
935. The civilian population is increasingly dependent on external humanitarian assistance, 
whose arrival depends on permission from the Israeli authorities. While it is not suggested that 
starvation is imminent, the health and welfare of the population at large have been profoundly 
affected by the blockade and the military operations. The only reason why starvation is not 
imminent however is precisely the provision of humanitarian assistance. Without such assistance 
Gaza&#8217;s civilian population would not be able to feed itself.<b>496</b>  
</p>
<p>936. States cannot escape their obligations not to deny the means of sustenance simply by 
presuming the international community will fill the gap they have created by deliberately 
destroying the existing capacity. 
</p>
<p>937. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission finds that the destruction of the mill was 
carried out for the purpose of denying sustenance to the civilian population, which is a violation 
of customary international law as reflected in article 54 (2) of Additional Protocol I and may 
constitute a war crime. 
</p>
<p><b>3. The right to food</b>497<b> 
</b></p>
<p>938. The right to adequate food therefore requires the right to food security (through either 
self-production or adequate income) and the &#8220;fundamental&#8221; right to be free from hunger.<b>498</b> That 
Israel has not created a state of hunger is the result largely of the external aid provided to the 
population of Gaza. It has, however, severely affected the ability of Gazans both to produce food 
and to purchase it. 
</p>
<p>939. Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that &#8220;in no case 
may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>940. The right to adequate food is also reflected in the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, which requires State parties to guarantee to women 
&#8220;adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>941. The Mission finds that, as a result of its actions to destroy food and water supplies and 
infrastructure, Israel has violated article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
article 12 (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>496</b> According to John Ging, 80 per cent of the Gazan population is dependent on UNRWA for food supplies.

<p><b>B. The destruction of the Sawafeary chicken farms 
</b></p>
<p>942. On or around the night of 3 January 2009 Israeli troops arrived at a number of houses on 
al-Sekka Road in Zeytoun. The Mission interviewed four people who were direct witnesses to 
and victims of the events that occurred in the aftermath of their arrival. One witness was 
interviewed three times for a total of five hours and testified at the public hearings in Gaza.<b>499</b> 
Another three were interviewed for an hour each. The Mission also visited the site of the 
Sawafeary chicken farms. Finally, the Mission addressed questions to the Government of Israel 
with regard to the military advantage pursued in attacking Mr. Sawafeary&#8217;s chicken farms, but 
received no reply. The following narrative reflects the eyewitness accounts.  
</p>
<p>943. Sameh Sawafeary is a chicken farmer. His family has been in the egg production business 
for many years. He indicated that he, his brothers and his children owned 11 chicken farms in 
Zeytoun as of December 2008. The farms housed more than 100,000 chickens. 
</p>
<p>944. On 3 January, Mr. Sawafeary, who was in his home on al-Sekka Road in the al-Samouni 
neighbourhood of Zeytoun with his family, was alerted by an al-Jazeera television news 
broadcast at around 8 p.m. that an Israeli ground invasion was imminent.<b>500</b> As a result, he took a 
number of precautions, including hiding money and other valuables. He then gathered around 
11 members of his family on the upper floor of the two-storey concrete house. At around 10 p.m. 
a missile struck the house, entering through the rear of the upper floor and exiting near the 
window of the living room opposite. The missile passed over several of Mr. Sawafeary&#8217;s 
children and grandchildren, who were lying on the floor. No one was injured.  
</p>
<p>945. At around 11 p.m., Mr. Sawafeary heard the sound of helicopters flying over his house 
followed by soldiers landing on his roof. The soldiers remained there until 7 a.m. the next 
morning, firing what he described as &#8220;a rain of bullets&#8221;. The family stayed, terrified, on the floor 
of an upstairs room.  
</p>
<p>946. At around 7.15 a.m. on 4 January, soldiers came into the upstairs room where the family 
was sheltering. They separated the men from the women and put the women in another room. 
The hands of the men and the boys were tied behind their backs, except for one of 
Mr. Sawafeary&#8217;s sons who has only one arm. After some time the commander told Mr. 
Sawafeary that they should walk south and &#8220;go to Rafah&#8221;. The soldiers then searched the house. 
The 11 members of the household there at the time left the house as instructed. 
</p>
<p>947. The Sawafeary family spent the following five days in terror. Together with neighbouring 
families they spent one night in the Abu Zur house and the following three in the nearby house 
of Mr. Rajab Mughrabi. During that time they suffered a number of violations at the hands of the 
Israeli armed forces, including the killing of the child Ibrahim Juha (see chap. XI). 
</p>
<p>948. For the purposes of this section the Mission refers to the information it received about the 
systematic destruction that occurred for several days and which the witnesses were able to see 
during the time they were forced by the circumstances to remain in the house of Mr. Mughrabi. 
                                                 
<b>499</b> Interviewed by the Mission in Gaza on 3 June and 14 June and at the Gaza public hearing on 29 June. 
<b>500</b> The previous night, a garage next door had been destroyed by an air strike. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>949. Mr. Sawafeary and Mr. Mughrabi informed the Mission that they had watched Israeli 
armoured bulldozers systematically destroy land, crops, chickens and farm infrastructure. 
Mr. Mughrabi stated that he watched the bulldozers plough through fields with crops and trees, 
destroying everything in their path. Mr. Sawafeary stated that he saw less, as he was watching 
through a small opening because he was afraid of being seen and shot. He stated that he saw only 
two or three &#8220;tanks&#8221;, but was not in a position to say whether there were more. He watched as 
the armoured bulldozers destroyed the chicken farms, crushing the wire mesh coops with the 
chickens inside. He could not see his own farms and the chickens he could see being destroyed 
were not his. He noted that the drivers of the tanks would spend hours flattening the chicken 
coops, sometimes stopping for coffee breaks, before resuming their work. 
</p>
<p>950. When he left Mr. Mughrabi&#8217;s house on 8 January, Mr. Sawafeary was able to see that his 
own farms did not appear to have been subjected to the destruction he had witnessed from inside 
the house. However, when he was able to return to his home after the Israeli withdrawal all 
31,000 of his chickens had been killed and the coops systematically flattened. 
</p>
<p>951. The Mission visited the site and saw the still flattened mesh coops, which had been 
covered with corrugated iron, as well as the remains of water tanks and machinery. The Mission 
was also shown the remnants of a small mosque near the end of one of the lines of the coops that 
had been destroyed. The remains of some dead chickens were still visible and Mr. Sawafeary 
stated that it had been a mammoth task to clean up the area when he returned. He pointed out 
that, in addition to the loss of livestock, the farm had been completely automated with significant 
investment in machinery, all of which had been destroyed, as had the plant for packaging the 
eggs. In short, the business had been razed to the ground. A protective grille, believed to be part 
of a D-9 armoured bulldozer, was found at the site. 
</p>
<p>952. The Mission notes comments from one soldier to Breaking the Silence that appears to 
broadly corroborate the destruction in Zeytoun, probably at the hands of the Givati Brigade.<b>501</b> 
</p>
<p>953. The Mission inspected the inside of Mr. Sawafeary&#8217;s house and noted damage to the 
upper floor, where a missile had penetrated. It also observed a number of graffiti that appeared to 
have been written by Israeli troops. One said &#8220;424 Givati&#8221;. There were others apparently written 
in Russian.  
</p>
<p>954. Mr. Sawafeary told the Mission that he and his family together supplied approximately 
35 per cent of the egg market in Gaza. His own farms supplied over 10 per cent. He noted that it 
was not only his farms that had been destroyed but also most of his family&#8217;s farms had been 
destroyed in the same way as his. He estimated that close to 100,000 chickens were killed in the 
process. 
</p>
<p>955. The Mission has reviewed the relevant UNOSAT report and satellite imagery. One 
satellite image shows the Sawafeary chicken farms in June 2007 and another shows the area in 
</p>

 <p> 
January 2009. The images depict clearly the size of the farms and the surrounding area. The 
destruction is plainly visible in the second image.<b>502</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>956. The systematic destruction along with the large numbers of killings of civilians suggest 
premeditation and a high level of planning. Even in the context of a campaign that had many 
serious violations of international humanitarian law, the events in Zeytoun at this time stand out.  
</p>
<p>957. The Mission finds that the destruction of the land and farms in the area was not justified 
by the pursuit of any military objective. The Israeli armed forces that arrived took control of the 
area within a matter of hours. They remained there until 18 January. The destruction of the land 
was not necessary to move the tanks or equipment or gain any particular visual advantage.  
</p>
<p>958. An inspection of the scene indicates that the area is relatively sparsely populated. The 
Mission rejects the idea that the Sawafeary farm was destroyed in the pursuit of any military 
objective.  
</p>
<p>959. The destruction of the farms appears to have been wanton and not militarily necessary. 
Not only were the coops with the chickens destroyed, but all of the plant and machinery of the 
farms as well. 
</p>
<p>960. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission finds that the Sawafeary chicken farms, the 
31,000 chickens and the plant and material necessary for the business were systematically and 
deliberately destroyed, and that this constituted a deliberate act of wanton destruction not 
justified by any military necessity. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>961. The Mission makes the same findings regarding article 147 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and article 54 (2) of Additional Protocol I, article 1 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and article 12 (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women as it made above in relation to the el-Bader flour mill.

<p><b>C. The destruction of water and sewage installation 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The Gaza wastewater treatment plant, Road No. 10,  
al-Sheikh Ejlin, Gaza City 
</b></p>
<p>962. The Mission visited the site of al-Sheikh Ejlin treatment plant on 3 and 17 June 2009. 
While there it interviewed the Director of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU), 
Mr. Munther Shublaq, inspected the plant, the site of lagoon No. 3 and the location where a large 
pipe carrying raw sewage had been ruptured. On 3 June, the Mission also visited a nearby farm 
that had been inundated with raw sewage and spoke to the farmer. The Mission interviewed Mr.

<b>502</b> UNOSAT satellite image analysis, 27 April 2009, p. 29. </p>

 <p> 
Munther Shublaq a second time at length on 14 June 2009. The Mission took photographs of the 
area, and obtained plans and diagrams of the plant. Finally, the Mission addressed questions to 
the Government of Israel with regard to the military advantage pursued in attacking al-Sheikh 
Ejlin treatment plant, but received no reply. 
</p>
<p>963. The Gaza wastewater treatment plant is located in the coastal area south-west of Gaza 
City in the al-Sheikh Ejlin neighbourhood. It was built in 1977 and expanded with support from 
development cooperation. It consists of a number of installations, including offices, tanks and 
lagoons to store raw sewage. 
</p>
<p>964. At some point between 3 and 10 January, a large missile hit the northernmost wall of 
lagoon No. 3, causing a massive outflow of raw sewage, which travelled a distance of 
1.2 kilometres and damaged 5.5 hectares of land, including agricultural land, according to 
UNOSAT satellite imagery.  
</p>
<p>965. The chief of the plant, Mr. Jaoudat al-Dalou, explained to the Mission that when the 
Israeli ground offensive started around 3 January, all staff left for security reasons, as did the 
local residents of the sparsely populated area. Around 14 January, he received a phone call from 
someone in the vicinity of the plant reporting the strike on lagoon No. 3 and the flooding of 
neighbouring farmland by sewage. He contacted  ICRC and PRCS to seek permission from the 
Israeli armed forces to go to the plant and carry out urgent repairs. Permission was denied on the 
grounds that the area was a &#8220;military zone&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>966. After the withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces, Mr. al-Dalou and his colleagues returned 
to al-Sheikh Ejlin to inspect the damage. They also saw what they believed to be unexploded 
bombs nearby and called the police to contact UNRWA to clear the area. Mr. al-Dalou found a 
crater five metres deep on the north-east side of lagoon No. 3. The damaged wall took over four 
days to repair at a cost of some US$ 158,000. More than 200,000 cubic metres of raw sewage 
had flowed into neighbouring farmland. 
</p>
<p>967. In addition, a number of items, including an incubator, had been taken out of the plant and 
used by Israeli soldiers to make a barricade or protection wall. The damage done by the impact 
of bullets could still be seen on interior walls. Shattered windows had still not been replaced as 
glass was not available. Other damaged equipment included distillation equipment (damaged 
beyond repair) and a nitrogen ammonium machine. 
</p>
<p>968. In interviews with the Mission, Mr. Munther Shublaq, who issued a CMWU report of the 
damage in January 2009,<b>503</b> confirmed that staff had left upon the arrival of Israeli ground forces 
and did not return until their withdrawal. He also indicated that on hearing news of the rupture of 
lagoon No. 3 he made several unsuccessful efforts to obtain permission to access the area to stop 
the damage caused by the outflow. 
</p>
<p>969. The Mission noted breaks in a large raw-sewage pipe which ran to the north of lagoon 
No. 3. Plant officials suggested that clearly visible markings on the pipe had been made by tanks. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>503</b> CMWU, &#8220;Damage assessment report: water and waste water infrastructure and facilities&#8221;, January 2009, 
available at: http://www.cmwu.ps/upload/Damages_Assessment_for_W_WW_after_War2009.pdf.  </p>

 <p> 
The routes of such pipes are marked by 1.5-metre-high, red and white poles to ensure that care is 
taken not to damage the pipes. The damage is very close to one such pole. 
</p>
<p>970. The precise date of the strike on Lagoon No. 3 is uncertain because there were no 
witnesses in the area at the time. With satellite images it is, however, possible to establish that 
the strike must have occurred before 10 January 2009, as the images clearly show the massive 
outflow of sewage from the lagoon on that date. 
</p>
<p>971. It is also possible to ascertain from the satellite images that the strike on the lagoon wall&#8217;s 
eastern side created a breach of about 22 metres, through which the sewage flowed. The same 
images show the route of the outflow and where it stopped. The United Nations Environment 
Programme carried out a ground survey of the site on 30 January 2009 and data from that survey 
were added to the UNOSAT image interpretation. 
</p>
<p>972. The plant occupies a position at the top of a hill and provides a view over a considerable 
area of open land, which is mainly farmland. As such, it might reasonably be considered to be of 
strategic interest. 
</p>
<p><b>Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>973. The plant was effectively abandoned by staff when the ground invasion began. The strike 
on lagoon No. 3 must have occurred after the Israeli armed forces had taken control of the plant 
and the surrounding area as the employees interviewed confirmed that it was intact when they 
left the area. Although the damage to the raw-sewage pipe may have been caused by a tank 
stopping or passing over it, the Mission is not in a position to conclude that this was in fact what 
occurred.  
</p>
<p>974. Notwithstanding the possible military advantage offered to the Israeli armed forces by the 
plant&#8217;s location, the Mission cannot find any justification for striking the lagoon with what must 
have been a very powerful missile, sufficient to cause a breach 5 metres deep and 22 metres 
wide. It is highly unlikely that Palestinian armed groups could have taken up positions in or 
around the lagoon after the initial occupation of the area by Israeli armed forces:  any such 
groups would have been exposed in the open area. The fact that the lagoon wall was struck 
precisely there where it would cause outflow of the raw sewage suggests that the strike was 
deliberate and premeditated. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Namar wells group, Salah ad-Din Street, Jabaliyah refugee camp 
</b></p>
<p>975. The Mission visited the site of the Namar wells group on 17 June 2009.<b>504</b> It interviewed 
engineer Ramadan Nai&#8217;m, CMWU water production and storage manager, and Ibrahim al-Ejjla, 
CMWU media coordinator. The Mission took photographs of the site. The Mission also 
addressed questions to the Government of Israel with regard to the military advantage pursued in 
attacking the Namar wells group, but received no reply. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>504</b> The Namar wells group consists of two of installations situated in Jabaliyah. See &#8220;Damage assessment report&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
976. The wells group stood approximately 50 metres from the Jabaliyah refugee camp&#8217;s 
administration building, which was also destroyed. A crater (approximately five metres wide) 
was still visible in the grounds belonging to the civil administration, with at its bottom the case 
of a rocket.<b>505</b> 
</p>
<p>977. This was a complex of two water well pumps, one in operation and another next to it as 
standby. Mr<b>.</b> Ramadan Nai&#8217;m told the Mission how proud CMWU had been of this water well, 
which produced more than 200 cubic metres per hour of the best-quality water in the area. The 
well supplied water to some 25,000 people in eastern and central Jabaliyah. The standby well 
pump was capable of pumping some 100 cubic metres of water. Both were completely destroyed 
on 27 December by an airstrike. 
</p>
<p>978. In the Namar water wells complex there were not only pumping machines but also a 
180 kg generator, a fuel store, a reservoir chlorination unit, buildings and related equipment. 
These were also destroyed.  
</p>
<p>979. The operator, Mr. Abdullah Ismail al-Zein, was killed in the air strike while he was 
working at the station. He was employed by the Municipality rather than by CMWU and had 
been working in the station for four years. He was blown to pieces and his identity was 
established when his shoes were found three days later.  
</p>
<p>980. The strike also blew up the pipes connecting the wells to other water wells; incoming 
water spilled into the area for some 10 days before the pipes could be shut off. 
</p>
<p>981. Mr. Nai&#8217;m informed the Mission that he tried through the mediation of ICRC to get 
permission from the Israeli armed forces to repair the supply pipes, but permission was not 
granted and he was obliged to wait until the withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces.  
</p>
<p>982. It was calculated that repairs to this group of water wells would cost around US$ 200,000, 
excluding the ancillary but necessary civil engineering works. 
</p>
<p>983. Mr. Nai&#8217;m stated that at least 10 bombs were used to destroy the complex. Not a single 
wall was left intact. 
</p>
<p><b>Factual findings 
</b>984. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission finds that the Namar wells were destroyed by 
multiple air strikes on the first day of the Israeli aerial attack and that civil administration 
buildings located at approximately 50 metres were also destroyed.  
</p>
<p>985. The question remains as to whether the Israeli air strikes on the Namar wells group were 
deliberate or made in error. The Mission notes that the deployment systems and aircraft used in 
the strikes of 27 December (principally F-16 fighter jets and UAVs) are capable of a high degree 
of precision. It notes also that, by all accounts, a great deal of preparation had been put into 
determining and designating the targets of air strikes. The Mission considers it unlikely that a 
target the size of the Namar wells could have been hit by multiple strikes in error, given the 
                                                 
<b>505</b> Photographs of the damage can be found in &#8220;Damage assessment report&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
nature of the deployment systems and the distance between the wells and any neighbouring 
buildings. The facts thus indicate that the strikes on the Namar wells group were intentional. 
</p>
<p>986. The Mission found no grounds to suggest that there was any military advantage to be 
gained from hitting the wells. There was no suggestion that Palestinian armed groups had used 
the wells for any purpose.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Legal findings 
</b>987. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission makes similar findings to those set out 
regarding the violation of article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Conventions and article 54 (2) of 
Additional Protocol I in relation to the destruction of the el-Bader flour mill. 
</p>
<p>988. The right to food clearly includes the right to have adequate access to water. The Mission 
finds that this was denied to the people served by the Namar wells. It took some 75 days to repair 
them 
</p>
<p>989. The Mission also finds that the killing of Mr. Abdullah Ismail al-Zein was unlawful and 
constitutes a violation of the right to life. Since targeting the wells constituted an act of wanton 
destruction, the incidental loss of life cannot be justified with regard to any military advantage. 
</p>
<p><b>D. The destruction of housing 
</b></p>
<p>990. The Mission received information about the extensive destruction of houses and private 
property during the military operations.<b>506</b> During its own visits to the Gaza Strip, the Mission 
witnessed the extent of the destruction caused by air strikes, mortar and artillery shelling, missile 
strikes, the operation of bulldozers and demolition charges. Some areas of the Gaza Strip were 
more heavily affected than others, but the Mission saw many piles of rubble where, prior to the 
military operations, there had been multi-storey houses. 
</p>
<p>991. In many, if not most, of the incidents investigated by the Mission, described in chapters X, 
XI, XIV and XV, the victims it interviewed not only suffered the loss of loved ones (or were 
used as human shields or detained), but also saw their homes severely damaged or completely 
destroyed. For present purposes, the Mission will recall a few of the incidents relating to the 
destruction of housing.  
</p>
<p>992. In some cases, the damage to or destruction of housing was arguably related to the 
conduct of military operations against Palestinian combatants. The houses of Majdi Abd Rabbo 
</p>

Destroyed by Israeli Occupation Forces during Operation Cast Lead, June 2009, Al-Dameer Gaza, IOF Targets 
Civilian Premises and Cultural Properties during its Offensive on the Gaza Strip, May 2009, Submission to the 
Mission by Habitat International Coalition&#8217;s Housing and Land Rights Network entitled &#8220;Targeting Shelters and 
Shelter Seekers during Operation Cast Lead in the Context of Israeli Military Practice.&#8221;, and Submission to the 
Mission by the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE), June 2009, pp. 3-4. </p>

 <p> 
and of his neighbour, HS/08, for instance, were destroyed in combat against the three Palestinian 
fighters hiding in HS/08&#8217;s house (see chap. XIV).<b>507</b> 
</p>
<p>993. In many others, such as the shelling of the houses of Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami 
(chap. XIV), of the Sawafeary family (see above and chap. XI) and of the Abu Halima family 
(chap. XI), the houses were in the general path of the advancing Israeli ground troops.  
</p>
<p>994. In a third group of cases, however, the facts ascertained by the Mission strongly suggest 
that housing was destroyed without their having any direct link to combat operations. On 
6 January 2009 at 1.45 a.m., Mr. Abu Askar received a phone call from the Israeli armed forces 
informing him that his family should evacuate their house as it was going to be targeted by an air 
strike. This warning was put into practice a few minutes later, when the home of about 
40 members of the extended Abu Askar family was destroyed by a missile (see chap. X). 
</p>
<p>995. In Juhr ad-Dik, after the killing of Majda and Rayya Hajaj (chap. XI), the Israeli armed 
forces directed machine-gun fire at the house of the al-Safadi family for the entire afternoon of 
4 January 2009. The soldiers firing at the house had seen the Hajaj and al-Safadi families taking 
refuge there after their failed attempt to flee to Gaza City. When the Hajaj family managed to 
leave Juhr ad-Dik the following day, Israeli troops apparently took up position in Mr. Youssef 
Hajaj&#8217;s house, which they rendered completely uninhabitable, as the Mission saw for itself 
during a visit. His brother Saleh Hajaj was even less fortunate. His house was reduced to a pile 
of rubble. 
</p>
<p>996. Other neighbourhoods were destroyed during the last few days of the military operations 
as the Israeli armed forces were preparing to withdraw. For example, in an incident described 
below, after an attempt to demolish a cement-packaging plant in east Gaza, soldiers also 
destroyed the surrounding houses of the owner and the employees. The factory owner, Mr. Abu 
Jubbah, had hidden in the house for two days with seven members of his family. Suddenly, a 
direct strike on the side of the house warned them that the house was to be destroyed and they 
should leave. Waving a white flag, Mr. Abu Jubbah left the house in a rush, put his family in a 
car and drove off. On their way they saw tanks and soldiers in the area. Their house was 
destroyed by shelling. It took several strikes to destroy it, while the factory facilities and the 
fence were demolished by bulldozers. Housing for 55 factory workers was also demolished with 
bulldozers.<b>508</b>  
</p>
<p>997. Two further cases investigated by the Mission also exemplify the deliberate demolition of 
residential housing. The house of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni, in which 21 family members died, was 
damaged but still standing when PRCS and ICRC extracted the wounded survivors in the 
afternoon of 7 January 2009 (chap. XI). When the family and rescuers returned to the area on 
18 January, the house was completely demolished. As the Mission could see for itself during its 
visit to the area as well as on photographs taken on that day, the manner in which the house had 
collapsed strongly indicated that this was the result of deliberate demolition and not of combat. 
                                                 
<b>507</b> The Mission is only noting that there was a factual link between combat and the destruction of the houses, it is 
not making a finding as to whether the destruction of the two civilian houses was proportionate to the military 
objective to be achieved. 
<b>508</b> Mission interview with Mr. Atta Abu Jubbah, owner of the cement packaging factory. </p>

 <p> 
Similarly, when Khalid Abd Rabbo returned to the home of his extended family in Izbat Abd 
Rabbo (which he had abandoned intact after the shooting of his daughters, see chap. XI) after the 
withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces, he found it completely demolished, as were the other 
houses in the vicinity. Khalid Abd Rabbo drew the Mission&#8217;s attention to what appeared to be an 
anti-tank mine visible under the rubble of his neighbour&#8217;s house, which had reportedly been used 
by the Israeli armed forces to cause the controlled explosion which brought down the building. 
As in the case of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni&#8217;s house, the way the buildings had collapsed strongly 
suggests that both Khaled Abd Rabbo&#8217;s house and that of his neighbour were deliberately 
demolished by explosives experts, rather than damaged during combat. Khaled Abd Rabbo 
added that, to his knowledge, his house had been demolished by the Israeli armed forces shortly 
before they withdrew from Gaza.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>998. From the facts gathered, the Mission concludes that, in a number of cases it investigated, the 
Israeli armed forces launched direct attacks against residential houses, destroying them. Although 
the Mission does not have complete information on the circumstances prevailing in Juhr ad-Dik, 
al-Samouni neighbourhood and Izbat Abd Rabbo when the houses of the Hajaj, al-Samouni and 
Khalid Abd Rabbo families were destroyed, the information in its possession strongly suggests 
that they were destroyed outside of any combat engagements with Palestinian armed groups. Nor 
were these houses otherwise making any effective contribution to military action. These attacks 
deprived the extended families living there of shelter and of a significant part of their property. 
</p>
<p>999. In other cases, residential neighbourhoods were subjected to air-launched bombing and 
to intensive shelling apparently in the context of the advance of Israeli ground forces. In these 
cases, although the facts gathered by the Mission do not suggest that the residential houses were 
directly targeted, it doubts whether there were military objectives pursued by the shelling. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Corroboration of Mission&#8217;s factual findings and widespread nature of housing 
destruction 
</b></p>
<p>1000. Testimonies of Israeli soldiers deployed in Gaza during the military operations 
corroborate what the Mission saw for itself and heard from the witnesses it interviewed. Several 
of the soldiers interviewed by Breaking the Silence spoke of the unprecedented scale of 
destruction of houses and of &#8220;intentional, systematic destruction.&#8221;<b>509</b> The testimonies of the 
soldiers appear to distinguish between three phases in or types of destruction of residential 
housing. First, there is the destruction which is incidental to the actual combat between the 
advancing Israeli forces and the Palestinian combatants or to Israeli forces directing fire at 
locations from which rockets were launched.<b>510</b> Second, there is destruction of houses for what 
                                                 
<b>509</b> <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i>, pp. 59, 66, 69 and 101. One soldier recalls: &#8220;There was a point where D-9s were razing 
areas. It was amazing. At first you go in and see lots of houses. A week later, after the razing, you see the horizon 
further away, almost to the sea. They simply took down all the houses around so the terrorists would have nowhere 
else to hide.&#8221; 
<b>510</b> In &#8220;The hidden dimension of Palestinian war casualties&#8230;&#8221;, the Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs argues that 
Palestinian houses were also demolished when Palestinian armed groups attacked houses in Gaza in which the 
Israeli armed forces had taken up positions. This argument is supported with reports of incidents gathered from 
websites of Palestinian armed groups, such as the following referring to the evening of 9 January 2009: &#8220;Three RPG 
 </p>

 <p> 
is termed &#8220;operational reasons&#8221;. This is the deliberate destruction of houses from which fire had 
been opened on Israeli soldiers or which were suspected of being booby-trapped, containing 
tunnels or being used for weapons storage.<b>511</b> &#8220;Operational necessity&#8221; also embraced the 
destruction of houses which obstructed visibility for the Israeli armed forces or had a &#8220;strategic 
advantage&#8221; for them.<b>512</b> &#8220;In case of any doubt, takedown houses. You don&#8217;t need confirmation 
for anything, if you want&#8221;, were the instructions of one commander to his troops.<b>513</b> 
</p>
<p>1001. The third phase of destruction of housing was no longer tied to the &#8220;operational 
necessities&#8221; of the ongoing military operations. It was in view of &#8220;the day after&#8221; the Israeli armed 
forces withdrew from Gaza. In the words of one Israeli soldier: 
</p>
<p>&#8230; then we were told there are houses to be demolished for the sake of &#8220;the day after&#8221;. 
The day after is actually a thought that obviously we&#8217;re going in for a limited period of 
time which could be a week and it might also be a few months. But it&#8217;s not a longer span 
of time without defining what it is. And the rationale was that we want to come out with 
the area remaining sterile as far as we&#8217;re concerned. And the best way to do this is by 
razing. That way we have good firing capacity, good visibility for observation, we can see 
anything, we control a very large part of the area and very effectively. This was the 
meaning of demolition for the sake of the day after. In practical terms this meant taking a 
house that is not implicated in any way, that its single sin is the fact that it is situated on 
top of a hill in the Gaza Strip.<b>514</b> 
</p>
<p>1002. Satellite imagery provided by UNOSAT at the Mission&#8217;s request is consistent with the 
soldiers&#8217; testimonies. It shows, for instance, that 65 per cent of the destruction/damage of 
buildings in Rafah was caused by airstrikes between 11 and 18 January. By contrast, 54 per cent 
of the destruction/damage in Izbat Abd Rabbo (east Gaza) occurred between 6 and 10 January as 
the Israeli troops advanced into the city.<b>515</b>  
</p>
<p>1003. The UNOSAT reports on the destruction of buildings in al-Samouni neighbourhood and 
al-Atatra, two areas that suffered particularly heavy destruction of civilian housing and other 
buildings, show that most were destroyed during the last three days of the Israeli armed forces&#8217; 
presence on the ground in Gaza. In al-Samouni, out of 114 severely damaged or completely 
destroyed buildings, 60 were destroyed between 27 December 2008 and 10 January 2009 (i.e. the

rockets and machine guns are fired against a house where IDF soldiers took up positions in the Ezvet Abd Rabbo 
region in the eastern sector of Jabalya&#8221; (p. 12). 
<b>511</b> <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i>, pp. 26, 35, 44, 56, 59, 61 (&#8220;Sometimes you know the house is empty. You know as far 
as you can know. Now if the house disrupts your defence line, you take it down with a tank or a bulldozer. We took 
an eight-storey house and the instruction was not to enter any doorway because it would be booby-trapped.&#8221;), and 66

destruction, enabling total visibility. Razing was meant to give us the advantage of full control over fire and field of

50 between 16 and 19 January 2009.<b>516</b> Similarly, in al-Atatra, out of 94 severely damaged or

2009, only 6 between 10 and 16 January, and 52 between 16 and 19 January 2009.<b>517</b>  
</p>
<p>1004. These figures confirm that a first phase of extensive destruction of housing for the 
&#8220;operational necessity&#8221; of the advancing Israeli forces in these areas was followed by a period of 
relative idleness on the part of the Israeli bulldozers and explosives engineers. But during the last 
three days, aware of their imminent withdrawal, the Israeli armed forces engaged in another 
wave of systematic destruction of civilian buildings.<b>518</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>1005. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission finds that the houses of the families of Saleh 
Hajaj, of Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni, of Khalid Abd Rabbo and of Muhammad Fouad Abu Askar were 
subjected to direct attacks in spite of their unmistakably civilian nature. They did not present any 
apparent threat to the Israeli armed forces. These attacks violated the principle of distinction in 
customary international humanitarian law as codified in article 52 of Additional Protocol I.  
</p>
<p>1006. Considering the facts it has gathered on the destruction of these houses from the soldiers&#8217; 
testimonies and the UNOSAT report, the Mission finds that the conduct of the Israeli armed 
forces in these cases amounted to the grave breach of &#8220;extensive destruction&#8230; of property, not 
justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly&#8221; under article 147 of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention.  
</p>
<p>1007. Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires 
State parties to &#8220;recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and 
his family, including adequate&#8230; housing&#8221;. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission finds 
that the Israeli armed forces violated the right to adequate housing of the families concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Analysis of the pattern of widespread destruction of economic  
and infrastructural targets 
</b></p>
<p>1008. The Mission interviewed Mr. Amr Hamad, the Deputy General-Secretary of the 
Palestinian Federation of Industries, on three separate occasions, including at the public hearings 
in Gaza. The Mission also met a number of businessmen involved in fishing, strawberry farming, 
construction, including concrete and cement production and packaging, food and drinks 
production, car mechanics and repairs, livestock farming and refrigeration. While much of the 
information provided to the Mission focused on the effect of the restrictions Israel had imposed 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>516</b> UNOSAT report, p. 17. <i> 
<b></b></i><b>517</b> Ibid., pp. 20&#8211;21. 
<b>518</b> The Mission finally notes that, in its formal submission, Housing and Land Rights Network &#8211; Habitat 
International Coalition provides a detailed historical account of the Israeli army practices of targeting civilian homes 
and generating displaced populations that suggests a pattern that is not unique to the military operation in Gaza of 
December 2008 &#8211; January 2009 , but &#8220;consistent over time and across borders&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
on the Gaza Strip for a considerable time before 27 December 2008, significant information was 
also provided on the effect of the attacks during the Israeli military operations in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1009. Mr. Amr Hamad indicated that 324 factories had been destroyed during the Israeli military 
operations at a cost of 40,000 jobs. In its detailed written report on the impact of the Israeli 
military activities, the Palestinian Federation of Industries points out that 200 businesses and 
factories were destroyed in Gaza City, 101 in northern Gaza and 20 in southern Gaza. Of the 
total 324 premises damaged, almost 30 per cent were linked to the metals and engineering sector, 
over 20 per cent to construction and 16 per cent to furniture businesses. Other sectors with 
significant losses were aluminium, food, sewing textiles, chemicals and cosmetics, plastics and 
rubber, paper and carton, and handicrafts. The Federation states that more than half were totally 
destroyed.  
</p>
<p>1010. The Federation emphasized that &#8220;the Gaza Strip&#8217;s most crucial industries, and ones which 
require the greatest investment, were most severely hit&#8221;.<b>519</b> Eleven of the 324 premises struck by 
the Israeli armed forces were linked to the food industry and the losses incurred amount to some 
US$ 37 million, i.e. over one third of all the losses to the industrial sector. Similarly, while the 
construction sector suffered 69 of the 324 strikes, this represented just under 30 per cent of the 
total damage. The report notes that the majority of the losses resulting from the strikes on the 
324 premises related to machinery costs (50 per cent), while just over a quarter relate to the 
buildings themselves. 
</p>
<p>1011. The Mission found the information provided by Mr. Hamad, as well as the report 
produced by the Palestinian Federation of Industries, to be credible and reliable. The Mission 
discussed and was satisfied by the methodology used in compiling the report, which was 
produced with the support of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. The Mission also found that the 
testimony of businessmen whose premises had been struck or destroyed by the Israeli armed 
forces corroborate information provided by Mr. Hamad and the Palestinian Federation of 
Industries.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Construction industry 
</b></p>
<p>1012. One of the incidents Mr. Hamad referred to at the public hearing relates to the destruction 
of the only cement-packaging plant in Gaza. The Mission also interviewed its owner, Mr. Atta 
Abu Jubbah.<b>520</b> According to the reconstruction of the events, the Israeli armed forces began 
striking the plant from the air, damaging it significantly. Later ground forces -- equipped with 
bulldozers and tanks -- moved in and used mines and explosives to destroy the silo that used to 
contain 4,000 tons of cement. Helicopters launched rockets to destroy the main manufacturing 
line and fired holes into the cement containers. Bulldozers were used to destroy the factory walls. 
Over four days the factory was systematically destroyed. The Mission spoke with a number of 
other witnesses able to verify this account and considers it to be reliable. Among those witnesses 
was a civil engineer who inspected the site and confirmed that certain aspects of the destruction 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>519</b> Page 14 of the Report of the Palestinian Federation of Industries.  
<b>520</b> Mission interview with Mr. Atta Abu Jubbah, Gaza, 17 June 2009.  </p>

 <p> 
could have been achieved only by placing explosives inside the building. The silo had not been 
entirely destroyed in the aerial attacks, so explosives were attached to its supporting columns. 
</p>
<p>1013. The plant was an important part of Gaza&#8217;s construction industry. It produced cement in 
bags, selling 200 tons per day with a profit of US$ 15 per ton. The company is valued at some 
US$ 12 million. As mentioned above, the owner&#8217;s house was also destroyed by rocket fire.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>1014. The owner is one of fewer than 100 businessmen who are in possession of the 
Businessman Card issued by Israel. The Mission notes that the plant was not destroyed during 
the aerial phase but was systematically reduced to rubble in a concerted effort over several days 
at the end of the military operations.  
</p>
<p>1015. The destruction of Mr. Atta Abu Jubbah&#8217;s plant forms part of what appears to have been 
a very deliberate strategy of attacking the construction industry. The Palestinian Federation of 
Industries also provides detail on the systematic and total destruction of the Abu Eida factories 
for ready-mix concrete. They were established in 1993. Nineteen of the 27 concrete factories 
were reported to have been destroyed, representing 85 per cent of the productive capacity. 
</p>
<p>1016. The ability to produce and supply concrete in a context where external supplies are 
entirely controlled by Israel is a matter not only of economic importance but arguably one of 
human necessity to satisfy the basic need for shelter. Even if the population can get by in 
makeshift accommodation or by living in cramped conditions with their extended families, the 
capacity to repair the massive damage done to buildings without internally produced concrete is 
severely reduced. To the extent that concrete is allowed to enter at all, it is significantly more 
expensive than domestically produced concrete. 
</p>
<p>1017. There appears to have been no military reason or justification for destroying the factory. 
This conclusion is borne out by the long established trading history of the owners and their 
recognition through the Businessman Cards. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Destruction of the remaining food industry 
</b></p>
<p>1018. As already reported, more than a third of all egg factories were destroyed by the Israeli 
armed forces. Other testimonies, for example that of the Mayor of al-Atatra,<b>521</b> who referred to 
the destruction of his sister&#8217;s chicken farms, indicated that a substantial part of the chicken 
farming industry appears to have been deliberately and systematically destroyed. 
</p>
<p>1019. The Mission also notes the destruction of the al-Wadiyah Group&#8217;s factories. The 
al-Wadiyah Group employed some 170 people, had been in business since 1954 and produced a 
variety of food and drinks. Dr. al-Wadiyah presented a detailed account of its activities and 
losses to the Mission.<b>522</b> 
</p>

<b>521</b> Mission interview with Muhammad Husein al-Atar, Mayor of al-Atatra, 3 June 2009. 
<b>522</b> Mission interview with Dr. Yasser al-Wadia, 3 June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1020. The Mission found no reason to believe that the premises of the flour mill, chicken farms 
and food-processing plants that were destroyed had been used for purposes that would render 
them in any way military objectives. 
</p>
<p>1021. The Mission also reviewed satellite images showing significant destruction of 
greenhouses throughout Gaza.<b>523</b> In total, it is estimated that over 30 hectares of greenhouses 
were demolished; 11.2 hectares were destroyed in Gaza City and 9.5 hectares in north Gaza. The 
Mission found that the large-scale and systematic destruction of greenhouses was not justified by 
any possible military objective. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Destruction of water installations 
</b></p>
<p>1022. Finally, in relation to the supply and treatment of water, the Mission analysed a limited 
number of cases. The strikes on the al-Sheikh Ejlin plant and on the Namar water wells have 
been described in some detail. The Mission also spoke at length with Mr. Munther Shublaq, who 
was responsible for the CMWU Damage Assessment Report. That report indicates that all types 
of water installations appeared to have been damaged to some extent during the Israeli 
operations, but notes especially that in some areas, particularly Beit Lahia, Jabaliyah, Beit 
Hanoun, part of Zeytoun, south of Rafah and the villages in the east, buildings, water and 
wastewater infrastructure and other facilities have been totally destroyed. &#8220;Those areas need a 
complete water and wastewater infrastructure which may require re-designing the networks 
based on the new population in the area&#8221;.<b>524</b> 
</p>
<p>1023. Mr. Munther Shublaq noted that, although a number of wells had been struck, the worst 
effects had been as a result of the damage to water-treatment plants and sewage pipes. The 
Mission heard a number of reports that indicated that the strikes on plants, pipes, wells and tanks 
had put considerable pressure on the sanitation and water-supply system.  
</p>
<p>1024. The Palestinian Authority claimed that 5,708 roof water storage tanks were destroyed, but 
it is not clear how many of these were on the roofs of the 4,036 houses that the Palestinian 
Authority stated were destroyed.  
</p>
<p>1025. The Mission found that the targeting of water-related installations was not justified by any 
possible military objective.  
</p>
<p><b>4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1026. The facts ascertained by the Mission indicate that there was a deliberate and systematic 
policy on the part of the Israeli armed forces to target industrial sites and water installations. In a 
number of testimonies given to Breaking the Silence, Israeli soldiers have described in detail the 
way in which what is at one point euphemistically referred to as &#8220;infrastructure work&#8221; was

<b>523</b> UNOSAT report, pp. 23&#8211;27. See also chapter XVII. 
<b>524</b> &#8220;Damage assessment report&#8230;&#8221;, p. 8. </p>

 <p> 
carried out. The deployment of bulldozers for systematic destruction is graphically recounted. 
Soldiers confirm in considerable detail information provided to the Mission by witnesses.<b>525</b> 
</p>
<p>1027. The Mission refers to chapter XVII, where it found that the systematic destruction of food 
production, water services and construction industries was related to the overall policy of 
disproportionate destruction of a significant part of Gaza&#8217;s infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><b>5. General legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>1028. The Mission has made detailed findings in relation to each of the incidents set out above. 
However, given the nature of the systematic attacks on the food, water and infrastructure 
provision in Gaza during the military operations, the Mission also believes it is important to 
highlight the issue of State responsibility and the liability of Israel in relation to the 
internationally wrongful acts committed. 
</p>
<p>1029. While the element of fault is controversial in the law of State responsibility, the Mission 
has found that in all of the cases described above both the act and the consequence were 
intended.  
</p>
<p>1030. Israel had a number of duties in respect of its actions during the military operations. These 
included the general obligation reflected in article 52 of Additional Protocol I to ensure that 
civilian objects are not the objects of attack and to ensure the protection of objects indispensable 
to the survival of the civilian population. In addition, the customary norms of international law 
contained in article 54 (2) of Additional Protocol I require States not to destroy objects 
indispensable to the survival of the population. 
</p>
<p>1031. Israel displayed a premeditated determination to achieve the objective of destruction. It is, 
therefore, responsible for the internationally wrongful acts it perpetrated in breach of the duties 
specified above. 
</p>
<p><b>XIV. THE USE OF PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS 
</b></p>
<p>1032. The Mission received allegations that in two areas in north Gaza Israeli troops used 
Palestinian men as human shields whilst conducting house searches. The Palestinian men were 
allegedly forced to enter houses at gunpoint in front of or, in one case, instead of soldiers. The 
Mission investigated four cases. One incident took place in the Izbat Abd Rabbo neighbourhood 
and another in al-Salam neighbourhood, both east of Jabaliyah, close to the border with Israel. 
Two incidents took place in al-Israa neighbourhood, west of Beit Lahia. The Mission visited 
                                                 
<b>525</b> See <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i>, testimony 17 on &#8220;infrastructure work&#8221; and the razing of orchards, p. 44 and 
testimony 29, p. 66. Note also testimony 46 on the practice of D-9 armoured bulldozers effectively working around 
the clock, largely destroying orchards (p. 100). The Mission notes that an issue raised on several occasions was the 
idea of the &#8220;day after&#8221; &#8211; the circumstances that Israel would find after finishing the military operations in terms of 
addressing future attacks from Gaza. Even if this could be conceived of as a longer-term strategic military goal, it is 
not a legitimate one in these circumstances. It does not meet the appropriate test for military advantage in the pursuit 
of certain objectives. Nor does it meet the test of military necessity referred to in the grave breaches provisions. See 
also chapter XVI. 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
each of the locations and interviewed a number of witnesses. In each case, the Mission found the 
allegations to be credible.  
</p>
<p><b>A. The case of Majdi Abd Rabbo 
</b></p>
<p>1033. To investigate this case, the Mission visited Izbat Abd Rabbo. The Mission interviewed 
Mr. Majdi Abd Rabbo<b>526</b> and several of his neighbours.<b>527</b> It also obtained two sworn statements 
Majdi Abd Rabbo had given to two NGOs. 
</p>
<p>1034. Majdi Abd Rabbo, a man aged 39 at the time of the incident, is married and the father of 
five children aged between 16 years and 14 months. He is an intelligence officer of the 
Palestinian Authority. He lived with his family in a house on the main street of Izbat Abd Rabbo, 
al-Quds Street, which in this section is commonly known as Izbat Abd Rabbo Street. His family 
house stood next to Salah ad-Din mosque. The home of the family of Khalid and Kawthar Abd 
Rabbo (see chap. XI) is less than 500 metres east of the Majdi Abd Rabbo family home. 
</p>
<p>1035. Majdi Abd Rabbo recounted that, at around 9.30 a.m. on 5 January 2009, he heard loud 
banging on the outer door of the house. He asked who was at the door and someone responded in 
Arabic, ordering him to open the door. He opened the door and saw in front of him a handcuffed 
Palestinian man, whom he later found out to be HS/07, aged 20. A group of around 15 Israeli 
soldiers stood behind HS/07. One of the soldiers was holding a weapon to HS/07&#8217;s head. The 
soldiers pushed HS/07 to one side and four soldiers pointed their weapons at Majdi Abd Rabbo. 
They ordered him to undress down to his underwear. He was then told to dress again and they 
pushed him into the house. 
</p>
<p>1036. The soldiers ordered him to call his children one by one. He started with his eldest son, 
aged 16, who was ordered by the soldiers to strip naked. The same process was followed with the 
two other sons, aged nine and eight. He then called his daughter, aged 14, who was told to press 
her clothes to her body and turn around. His wife, who was holding their baby daughter, was also 
told to press her clothes to her body, and then to take the baby&#8217;s trousers off.  
</p>
<p>1037. Majdi Abd Rabbo stated that the soldiers then forced him to walk in front of them as they 
searched the house, room by room, holding a firearm to his head. They questioned him about the 
house behind his. He told them that the house was empty and the owner, HS/08, had been absent 
for four years working in the Sudan. There was a small gap between the two houses, but they 
were joined at the roof. The soldiers gave him a sledgehammer, the kind used to break stones, 
and told him to break a hole through the dividing wall into HS/08&#8217;s house. This took around 
15 minutes.  
</p>
<p>1038. From the roof, the soldiers entered HS/08&#8217;s house, pushing Majdi Abd Rabbo ahead of 
them down the stairs while they watched over his shoulders. They had descended only a few 
steps, however, when the soldiers apparently detected some movement in the house, started

 <p> 
shouting, pulled Majdi Abd Rabbo back and rushed back into his house over the roof. Majdi Abd 
Rabbo heard some gun shots. 
</p>
<p>1039. The soldiers ran out into the street, forcing Majdi Abd Rabbo and HS/07 with them while 
they were shooting. Both were taken into the adjacent mosque, where there were a large number 
of soldiers with military equipment. They were forced to sit down and then handcuffed.  
</p>
<p>1040. The soldiers used the raised area of the mosque, from where the imam leads prayers, to 
fire at Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s house and the houses next to it. He shouted at the soldiers to stop, as 
his family was still in the house. A soldier told him to shut up or they would shoot him. The 
shooting continued for around 30 minutes. After a lull, the soldiers warned that there would be a 
huge explosion and, indeed, about three minutes later there was a huge explosion. The explosion 
was followed by intensive gunfire and artillery shells. Majdi Abd Rabbo could not identify the 
source of the explosion.<b>528</b> 
</p>
<p>1041. In the meantime, he had been forced to break a hole in the wall of the mosque on the south 
side and into the neighbouring house. He had then been interrogated about his knowledge of 
Hamas and the location of tunnels. Subsequently, he was taken and detained together with a 
group of neighbours, men and women, in another house in the neighbourhood (the HS/09 family 
home).  
</p>
<p>1042. When the shooting stopped, soldiers came to fetch him. He was taken to the road next to 
his house, to an empty area behind HS/08&#8217;s house. He saw that HS/08&#8217;s house and the entrance 
area of his house had been damaged. There were numerous soldiers standing next to the house, 
including some officers. He saw a senior officer talking to the soldiers who raided his house, and 
the officer then came to speak to him, through an Arabic-speaking soldier. The soldier said that 
they had killed the fighters inside the house and told him to go into the house and come back 
with their clothes and weapons. He protested, saying that he just wanted to find out if his family 
was safe. The officer told him to obey their orders if he wanted to see his family again. He 
refused to go, and was kicked and beaten by soldiers with their weapons until he gave in.  
</p>
<p>1043. He approached HS/08&#8217;s house from the street. The entrance was destroyed and blocked by 
rubble. He went back to the officer and told him that he could not get in. The officer told him to 
go through the roof instead. He went into his own house, which he found empty, except for a 
soldier. This reinforced his anxiety about the fate of his family. At this point, there was no major 
damage to his house. He crossed the roof and went down the stairs into HS/08&#8217;s house. He was 
scared that the fighters would shoot at him and shouted, &#8220;I am a Palestinian, a neighbour. I am 
being forced to come into this house.&#8221; In a room at the bottom of the stairs he found three armed 
young men wearing military camouflage and headbands of al-Qassam Brigades. They pointed 
their weapons at him. He told them that the Israeli soldiers thought that they had been killed 
and had sent him to check. He said that he was helpless as the soldiers had taken his wife and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>528</b> Other sources clarify that HS/08&#8217;s house had been bombed by Israeli aircraft which had been called in by the 
soldiers in the mosque. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, &#8220;The hidden dimension of Palestinian war casualties in

from other soldiers). </p>

 <p> 
children. The armed men told him that they had seen everything, and asked him to go back to the 
soldiers and tell them what he had seen.  
</p>
<p>1044. He went back outside, again crossing over the roof of his house. As he approached the 
soldiers, they pointed their weapons at him and ordered him to stop, strip naked and turn around. 
After he dressed again, he told them what he had seen. Initially, the soldiers did not believe him. 
They asked how he knew that they were Hamas militants and he explained about their 
headbands. The soldiers asked about their weapons. He replied that they were carrying 
Kalashnikovs. The officer told him that, if he was lying, he would be shot dead.  
</p>
<p>1045. He was handcuffed and taken back to the HS/09 family house for detention. At around 
3 p.m., he heard gunfire for around 30 minutes. The soldiers came back for him and took him to 
the same officer. This time he noticed different soldiers present with different military 
equipment. Through the translator, the officer told him that they had killed the militants, and told 
him to go in and bring back their bodies. Again he refused, saying &#8220;this is not my job, I don&#8217;t 
want to die.&#8221; He lied to them, saying that the three militants had told him that if he came back, 
they would kill him. The officer told him that, as they had already killed the militants, he should 
not worry. He added that they had fired two missiles into the house, which must have killed the 
militants. When he still resisted, he was beaten and kicked again, until he went into HS/08&#8217;s 
house via the roof again.  
</p>
<p>1046. He found the house very badly damaged. The bottom part of the stairs was missing. He 
again went in shouting, to alert the militants if they were still alive. He found them in the same 
room as before. Two were unharmed. The third was badly injured, covered in blood, with 
wounds to his shoulder and abdomen. They asked him what was going on outside and he told 
them that the area was fully occupied and the soldiers had taken numerous hostages, including 
his family.  
</p>
<p>1047. The wounded man gave him his name (HS/10) and asked him to tell his family what had 
happened. Majdi Abd Rabbo promised to do so if he survived and later did so. Another of the 
three told him to tell the Israeli officer that, if he was a real man, he would come to them himself.  
</p>
<p>1048. Majdi Abd Rabbo returned to the soldiers, who again forced him to strip naked before 
they approached him. He told the officer that two of the militants were unharmed. The officer 
swore at him and accused him of lying. Majdi Abd Rabbo then repeated the message from the 
militant, at which the officer and four other soldiers assaulted him with their weapons and 
insulted him.  
</p>
<p>1049. The officer asked Majdi Abd Rabbo for his identity card. He replied that it was in his 
house but gave him the ID card number. The officer checked the number via an electronic 
device. Three minutes later the officer asked him if it was true that he worked with the head of 
Palestinian Authority&#8217;s intelligence services, which he confirmed. The officer asked him if he 
was with Abu Mazen and a Fatah affiliate. He said he was. 
</p>
<p>1050. The soldiers brought Majdi Abd Rabbo a megaphone and told him to use it to call the 
militants. He initially refused but did so under threat. As instructed, he told the militants to 
surrender, that ICRC was present and they could hand themselves over. There was no response.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1051. By then, night had fallen. Majdi Abd Rabbo was again handcuffed and taken back to the 
house of the HS/09 family. Thirty to forty minutes later, he heard shooting and a huge explosion. 
Soldiers came to tell him that they had bombed HS/08&#8217;s house and ordered him to go in again 
and check on the fighters.  
</p>
<p>1052. The Israeli armed forces had floodlit the area. Majdi Abd Rabbo found both his and 
HS/08&#8217;s house very badly damaged. He could not use the roof of his house to enter HS/08&#8217;s 
house, as it had collapsed. He went back to the soldiers, who again made him strip, this time to 
his underwear. He asked where his family was and said that he could not reach the fighters 
because of the damage to the houses. He accused the soldiers of destroying his house. The 
officer said that they had only hit HS/08&#8217;s house. Majdi Abd Rabbo was then handcuffed. Until 
this time, he had been given no food or water, and it was very cold. After a while, his handcuffs 
were removed, he was told to dress and taken back to the HS/09 family house, to the room where 
he found that other people were being held. All the men and boys in this room were handcuffed 
and their ankles were tied. A soldier came with some drinking glasses and smashed them at the 
entrance to the room where they were being held. After smashing the glasses, he left again. 
Majdi Abd Rabbo had developed a severe headache. Another detainee, who spoke Hebrew, 
called a soldier to say that Majdi Abd Rabbo was sick and needed medicine. The soldier told him 
to keep quiet or he would be shot. A woman tied a scarf around Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s head to ease 
the pain.  
</p>
<p>1053. At around 7 a.m., Majdi Abd Rabbo was taken back to the soldiers outside. He was 
questioned about the number of fighters in the house. He confirmed that he had seen only three.  
</p>
<p>1054. Two young Palestinian men from the neighbourhood were brought over. A soldier gave 
them a camera and told them to go into the house and take photos of the fighters. The two tried 
to refuse, and were beaten and kicked. The soldier showed them how to use the camera and they 
went into HS/08&#8217;s house through the damaged main entrance. About 10 minutes later, they came 
back with photos of the three fighters. Two appeared to be dead, under rubble. The third was also 
trapped by rubble but appeared to be alive and was still holding his firearm. A soldier showed 
Majdi Abd Rabbo the photos and asked if these were the same people. He confirmed they were.  
</p>
<p>1055. A soldier took the megaphone and told the fighters that they had 15 minutes to surrender, 
that the neighbourhood was under the control of the Israeli armed forces and that, if they did not 
surrender, they would hit the house with an air strike.  
</p>
<p>1056. Fifteen minutes later, a soldier came with a dog, which had electronic gear attached to its 
body and what looked like a camera on its head. Another soldier had a small laptop. The dog 
handler sent the dog into the house. A few minutes later, shots were heard and the dog came 
running out. It had been shot and subsequently died.  
</p>
<p>1057. At around 10.30 a.m. on 6 January 2009, a bulldozer arrived and started to level the 
house. The bulldozer moved from east to west, demolishing everything in its way. Majdi Abd 
Rabbo watched it demolish his own house and HS/08&#8217;s house. He and the two young men were 
told to go back to the HS/09 house. They heard shooting. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1058. At around 3 p.m., he was taken back close to the site of his and HS/08&#8217;s house. He told 
the Mission that he saw the bodies of the three fighters lying on the ground in the rubble of the 
house.  
</p>
<p>1059. The soldiers then forced him to enter other houses on the street as they searched them. All 
the houses were empty. The soldiers forced him to go into the house alone initially and, when he 
came out, sent in a dog to search the house. During the house searches he managed to find some 
water to drink, the first drink he had had for two days. At midnight, the soldiers took him back to 
the HS/09 family house.  
</p>
<p>1060. On 7 January, all the men and boys were taken from the HS/09 family house and 
transferred to the house of a cousin of Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s in the same neighbourhood. There 
were more than 100 men and boys, including members of his extended family, aged between 15 
and 70. The women were being held elsewhere. Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s immediate family members 
were not there, and he learnt that no one had seen them. He remained extremely anxious about 
their safety. 
</p>
<p>1061. At around 11 p.m., the men and boys in that house were told that they were going to be 
released, and that they should all walk west towards Jabaliyah, without turning left or right, on 
threat of being shot. They found Izbat Abd Rabbo Street severely damaged. Majdi Abd Rabbo 
went to his sister&#8217;s house in Jabaliyah, where he was reunited with his wife and children on 
9 January 2009. His wife then told him that they had stayed for some hours in the house, during 
the first shooting on 5 January, and had then fled with a white flag to a neighbour&#8217;s house. 
</p>
<p>1062. Majdi Abd Rabbo told the Mission that he and his family were traumatized by what had 
happened to them and did not know what to do now, having lost their home and all their 
possessions. His children were all suffering psychologically and performing poorly at school. 
Five months later, in June 2009, Majdi Abd Rabbo was still having nightmares. 
</p>
<p>1063. The Mission notes that his account to it implies that there were at least three other 
Palestinian men compelled by the Israeli armed forces to search houses. A journalist&#8217;s account 
indicates that the author &#8220;spoke with eight residents of Izbat Abd Rabbo neighbourhood, who 
testified that they were made to accompany IDF soldiers on missions involving breaking into and 
searching houses [&#8230;]. The eight estimated that about 20 local people were made to carry out 
&#8220;escort and protection&#8221; missions of various kinds, [&#8230;], between January 5 and January 12.&#8221;<b>529</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. The case of Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa 
</b></p>
<p>1064. The Mission interviewed Mr. Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa and his wife,<b>530</b> and visited 
al-Israa, the neighbourhood west of Beit Lahia, where his house is located.  
</p>
<p>1065. When hostilities started on 27 December 2008, Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa, aged 59, 
asked his family to leave the home and stayed behind alone. On 9 January 2009, after a day of 
                                                 
<b>529</b> Haaretz, &#8220;Gazans: IDF used us as 'human shields' during offensive&#8221;, 28 March 2008, available at:

<b>530</b> Mission interviews with Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa and his wife.  </p>

 <p> 
shelling, the ground forces invaded the north-west of his neighbourhood. At around 0.05 a.m. on 
5 January 2009, the Israeli armed forces stormed into his house. He was hiding under the 
staircase and screamed when they reached him, putting his hands in the air. The soldiers had 
torch lights on their rifles and helmets, and their faces were painted black.  
</p>
<p>1066. At gunpoint, the soldiers ordered him to take off his clothes, which he did except for his 
underwear. They made him turn around and ordered him to dress again. By this time there were 
some 40 soldiers in the house. His hands were tied behind his back, his legs were tied and he was 
blindfolded. He was severely beaten. He was then taken to a neighbour&#8217;s house. He told the 
soldiers that he had bad asthma, but they would not allow him to take his inhaler.  
</p>
<p>1067. In the neighbour&#8217;s house, he was questioned by an Israeli officer about the whereabouts of 
Gilad Shalit and the location of Hamas tunnels and rocket launch sites. The soldiers threatened to 
blow up his house if he did not tell them. He insisted that he did not know the answers to their 
questions. He pleaded that he had worked in Israel for 30 years and had built hundreds of houses 
there. He speaks fluent Hebrew and communicated with the soldiers in Hebrew. 
</p>
<p>1068. After about 30 minutes, he was taken to a different location in the vicinity and made to sit 
down. After another 15 minutes, he was again made to walk to a different location. He was still 
blindfolded; the ties binding his legs had been loosened slightly, but walking was difficult. One 
of the soldiers was directing his footsteps while holding him at gunpoint.  
</p>
<p>1069. In a house that he subsequently recognized as that of a neighbour, one of the soldiers 
untied his legs and the blindfold. His hands remained tied. He saw a number of soldiers in the 
house and around 15 officers sitting in the living room. They had maps and radios in front of 
them. One of the officers (there were three stripes on the shoulder of his uniform) asked him to 
identify his house on the map, and then asked him about the location of tunnels and rocket 
launching sites. He answered that he did not know. He was blindfolded again but he could see a 
little through the blindfold.  
</p>
<p>1070. He was then taken out of the house and onto the road. As previously, he was held from 
behind, a weapon pressed against his back or the back of his head. Due to the damage to the 
roads caused by the tanks and other military equipment, walking was difficult. For about two 
hours he walked around as directed by the soldiers. They would stop and call: &#8220;Who is in the 
house?&#8221; They would then open fire, force Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa to go into the house 
while they were gathering behind him, and then leave the house again after the search. He was 
made to go into five houses in this way. They did not find anyone in any of the houses.  
</p>
<p>1071. Thereafter, they walked and stopped for about an hour without any shooting. Finally, he 
was ordered to sit down on the ground and covered with a blanket. He was held for two days at 
this location, which he identified to be near the American School in north Gaza, close to an 
Israeli armed forces&#8217; tank position. During the two days he was given neither food nor water. 
</p>
<p>1072. He was then transported, blindfolded, in what he believes was a tank, for about 90 minutes 
to another location which he believes was Netsalim (Nitzarim), where he was thrown on the 
ground. He was kept there for two days and nights in the open, during which time the soldiers 
refused to give him a blanket. During the two days he was again interrogated several times about </p>

 <p> 
the location of Hamas tunnels and rockets, and about Gilad Shalit&#8217;s whereabouts. He was beaten 
and threatened with death if he did not provide the information.  
</p>
<p>1073. At around 5 p.m. on the second day he was taken in a closed vehicle, which he believes 
was a truck, to a detention centre inside Israel, which he heard a soldier refer to as Telmund. He 
was fingerprinted and taken to see a doctor, whom he told that he was suffering from acute 
asthma and severe pain from a back injury caused by the beating.<b>531</b> The doctor did not give him 
medication. He was placed in a cell, where he was again refused a blanket.  
</p>
<p>1074. He was interrogated again at the detention centre, this time by civilians and then 
transferred to another location, where he was held together with some 50 Arabs. After two days, 
he was taken to the Erez border crossing and told to walk back into Gaza. Soldiers shot around 
his feet and over his head as he walked. He managed to reach his sister&#8217;s house, where he 
collapsed and was taken to al-Shifa hospital.  
</p>
<p>1075. When he returned to his house, he found it vandalized. When the Mission spoke to him, 
he was still traumatized from the treatment he had undergone at the hands of the Israeli armed 
forces.  
</p>
<p><b>C. The case of Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami 
</b></p>
<p>1076. Mr. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami was interviewed twice, at length, by the Mission. He 
also testified at the public hearing in Gaza on 30 June 2009.  
</p>
<p>1077. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami is a former civil servant, whose last position was as 
Assistant Foreign Minister. He resigned from the Ministry when Hamas took over Gaza and has 
not worked since. He, his wife and 15-year-old daughter lived in a house in the same 
neighbourhood west of Beit Lahia as Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa. The area was shelled 
during the initial air strikes of the Israeli campaign. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami&#8217;s home was 
directly hit for the first time on 2 or 3 January 2009, according to him by tank shells and by 
missiles fired by Apache helicopters, which seriously damaged external and internal walls. 
Tanks came into the area on 3 or 4 January and initially were positioned around 500 metres north 
of his house. 
</p>
<p>1078. He stayed in the house with his wife and daughter. As he told the Mission, he had decided 
not to leave because of his father&#8217;s experience of leaving his home in Israel and not being able to 
return. On an unspecified date during the first week of January, however, he decided that this 
was proving too difficult for his daughter. He called a taxi and his daughter moved to the house 
of an uncle in a safer area. 
</p>
<p>1079. On 9 January 2009, shelling of the area was particularly intensive. According to 
Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami, 10 tank shells hit his house. His wife received light injuries 
from shrapnel and broken glass. In the night of 9 to 10 January 2009, around midnight, soldiers 
made a violent entry into their home, where he and his wife were sheltering on the ground floor, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>531</b> The Mission was provided medical documentation supporting his statement that he suffered two fractured 
vertebrae as a result of the beating by Israeli soldiers. He now has to wear a corset to support his spine.  </p>

 <p> 
underneath the stairs. They threw a grenade into the entrance on the west side of the building and 
entered the house shooting.  
</p>
<p>1080. An officer ordered Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami to lift his robe (he was in 
nightclothes) and turn around. He then told Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami&#8217;s wife to press her 
clothes close to her body and turn around. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami and his wife were 
then taken to a neighbouring house where soldiers took his identity card and checked his identity 
on a laptop computer. An officer interrogated him about the location of Hamas tunnels, rockets, 
Palestinian fighters and Gilad Shalit. He responded that he could not provide that information 
because he did not know, that he was previously a member of the Fatah administration. The 
soldier responded: &#8220;You are Hamas; Hamas killed all Fatah and others in Gaza, so you must be 
Hamas.&#8221; Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami insisted that he was a civilian. The officer told him 
again that he had five minutes in which to give him information or he would be shot. Five 
minutes later, he again responded that he did not know anything about the questions asked.  
</p>
<p>1081. He was handcuffed with his hands in front of him and blindfolded. Two or three soldiers 
took him by the shoulders and forced him to walk in front of them. His wife tried to go with him 
but they pushed her back into the room. It was by now around 2 a.m. The soldiers took him up to 
the second floor of the building and threw him down. He landed on rubble and fainted. When he 
came to, he had severe pain in his right side and had difficulty breathing. He found out later that 
he had broken four ribs and he had severe bruising down his right leg. Four soldiers forced him 
to stand. He was moaning with the pain but did not want them to hear. It was raining and still 
dark. The soldiers pushed him against a wall and walked away from him. He thought that they 
were going to shoot him. He was still blindfolded. 
</p>
<p>1082. In the early morning hours, the soldiers took him and another man (whom he subsequently 
found out to be his neighbour Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa) and forced them to walk in front 
of them. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami was blindfolded and a gun was held to the back of his 
head. He thinks that there were around 25 soldiers behind him and the other Palestinian man. 
Having walked in this way for a while, both he and the other man were forced to enter several 
houses with the soldiers taking cover behind them. In Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami&#8217;s 
recollection, on six or seven occasions the soldiers opened fire. They did not find anyone in any 
of the houses. 
</p>
<p>1083. After these house searches, the soldiers, Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami and Abbas 
Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa walked north towards a place called Dogit, a former settlement. He 
could hear the movement of tanks and see tank positions. Both men were forced to sit on the 
ground. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami had his hands handcuffed in front; the other man had 
his hands handcuffed behind him. It was still raining, very cold, and Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-
Ajrami&#8217;s ribs and leg were very stiff and painful. They were left there without food, water or 
blankets until morning. At around 10 a.m., soldiers took Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa for 
interrogation.  
</p>
<p>1084. During that and the following day, Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami was also interrogated, 
by a senior officer. On the second day, he was taken to the edge of the camp and told to walk 
back south into Gaza City. He was able to reach the outskirts of the city and was helped by a 
stranger to reach a family member&#8217;s house, from where he was taken to al-Shifa hospital.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1085. On returning to his house, he found it ransacked and vandalized. He recounted that many 
items of value had been stolen, including jewellery and electronic equipment.   
</p>
<p><b>D. The case of AD/03 
</b></p>
<p>1086. The summary of AD/03&#8217;s case is based on his interview by the Mission. His case is also 
discussed in chapter XV, which gives more details on his case.  
</p>
<p>1087. AD/03 is a resident of al-Salam neighbourhood, located east of Jabaliyah, close to the 
eastern border with Israel. On 8 January, at around noon, the Israeli armed forces made an 
announcement ordering all residents of the area to evacuate their homes and come out in the 
street. The men were separated from the women and children, the men being told to line up 
against a wall. They were told to lift their shirts and to strip to their underwear. They remained in 
that position, stripped and lined up against the wall for approximately 15 minutes. The women 
and children were told to go to Jabaliyah. Shortly afterwards, AD/03 and three others (his 
brother, a cousin and an unknown man) were made to lie on the ground, were blindfolded and 
their hands were tied behind their backs with plastic strips. They were detained overnight in a 
house, in a room together with three men who identified themselves as residents of Izbat Abd 
Rabbo. The next morning, on 9 January, their blindfolds were removed and the seven men were 
interrogated.  
</p>
<p>1088. On the second day of detention, the Israeli armed forces began to use a number of the 
detainees as human shields. At this point the detainees had been without food and without sleep 
for a day. There were constant death threats and insults. To carry out house searches, the Israelis 
took off AD/03&#8217;s blindfold but he remained handcuffed. He was forced to walk in front of the 
soldiers and told that, if he saw someone in the house but failed to tell the Israeli soldiers, he 
would be killed. He was instructed to search each room in each house cupboard by cupboard. 
After one house was completed, he was taken to another house with a gun pressed against his 
head and told to carry out the same search there. He was punched, slapped and insulted 
throughout the process. AD/03 indicates that he was forced to do this twice while the group was 
held in this house for eight days. Others were also required to do it. On the first occasion he was 
forced to carry out searches in three houses and on the second occasion in four houses. AD/03 
estimates that each time he was involved in searches for between one hour and one and a half 
hours. At no point did he come across any explosive devices or armed group members. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Denial of the allegations by the Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>1089. Reacting to reports of the use of civilian men as human shields in Izbat Abd Rabbo, the 
Israeli armed forces&#8217; Spokesperson's Unit told an Israeli journalist:  
</p>
<p>The IDF is a moral army and its soldiers operate according to the spirit and values 
of the IDF, and we suggest a thorough examination of the allegations of Palestinian 
elements with vested interests. The IDF troops were instructed unequivocally not to make 
use of the civilian population within the combat framework for any purpose whatsoever, 
certainly not as &#8220;human shields.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Following an examination with the commanders of the forces that were in the area 
in question, no evidence was found of the cases mentioned. Anyone who tries to accuse </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the IDF of actions of this kind creates a mistaken and misleading impression of the IDF 
and its fighters, who operate according to moral criteria and international law.<b>532</b> 
</p>
<p><b>F. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>1090. The Mission found the foregoing witnesses to be credible and reliable. It has no reason to 
doubt the veracity of their accounts and found that the different stories serve to support the 
allegation that Palestinians were used as human shields. 
</p>
<p>1091. The Mission notes in particular that Mr. Majdi Abd Rabbo has told the story of his 
experience from 5 to 7 January 2009 to several NGOs, to several journalists and to the Mission 
without any material inconsistencies. There are some minor inconsistencies, which are not, in the 
opinion of the Mission, sufficiently weighty to cast doubt on the general reliability of Majdi Abd 
Rabbo. There are also, not surprisingly, some elements of the long account which appear in some 
versions and not in others. The Mission finds that these inconsistencies do not undermine the 
credibility of Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s account. 
</p>
<p>1092. The Mission further notes that one of the Israeli soldiers interviewed by the NGO 
Breaking the Silence recounts the case of Majdi Abd Rabbo. The soldier describes the case in 
great detail and mentions having personally met Majdi Abd Rabbo.<b>533</b> Finally, the Mission notes 
that the submission it has received from the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, while not 
containing a summary of Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s role in the incident in which the three Palestinian 
fighters were killed, also refers to the incident.<b>534</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>532</b> &#8220;Gazans: IDF used us as 'human shields' during offensive&#8221;. 
<b>533</b> The Mission notes, however, that the soldier does not appear to have been a direct witness to the incident, but 
rather heard it from others and subsequently met Majdi Abd Rabbo. <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i>, pp. 7-8: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Testimony 1 [&#8230;] In one case, our men tried to get them to come out, then they opened fire, fired some anti-tank 
missiles at the house and at some point brought in a D-9, bulldozer, and combat helicopters. There were three armed 
men inside. The helicopters fired anti-tank missiles and again the neighbour was sent in. At first he told them that 
nothing had happened to them yet, they were still in there. Again helicopters were summoned and fired, I don't 
know at what stage of escalation (in the use of force). The neighbour was sent in once again. He said that two were 
dead and one was still alive, so a D-9 was brought in and started demolishing the house over him until the neighbour 
went in, the last armed man came out and was caught and passed on to the Shabak. [&#8230;] [Some civilians] were made 
to smash walls with 5-kilo sledgehammers. There was a wall around a yard where the force didn't want to use the 
gate, it needed an alternative opening for fear of booby-traps or any other device. So the &quot;Johnnies&quot; themselves were 
required to bang open another hole with a sledgehammer. Talking of such things, by the way, there was a story 
published by Amira Hass in Haaretz daily newspaper, about Jebalya where a guy tells exactly the same thing. It's the 
guy who was sent. I saw him afterwards, the guy who was made to go into that house three times. He also told us 
about being given sledgehammers to break walls.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The newspaper article referred to by this testimony is &#8220;Gazans: IDF used us as 'human shields' during offensive&#8221;. 
The Mission notes that the soldier who gave testimony 1 states that one of the three Palestinian combatants was 
arrested, while Majdi Abd Rabbo&#8217;s testimony is that he saw all three of them dead. 
<b>534</b> &#8220;The hidden dimension&#8230;&#8221; p. 20. This submission is a &#8220;war diary&#8221; pieced together &#8220;from detailed data that both 
Hamas and its Izz ad-Din Qassam Brigades have published.&#8221; That this incident and the story of Majdi Abd Rabbo 
are the same is corroborated by comparing the three names of the killed Palestinian combatants mentioned in both 
accounts (one name is identical, the second very similar).  </p>

 <p> 
1093. In more general terms, the Mission notes that the statements of the men used as human 
shields by the Israeli armed forces during house searches are corroborated by statements made 
by Israeli soldiers to the NGO Breaking the Silence. The soldier providing testimony 1 speaks of 
the &#8220;Johnnie procedure&#8221;: &#8220;It was the first week of the war, fighting was intense, there were 
explosive charges to expose, tunnels in open spaces and armed men inside houses. [&#8230;] Close in 
on each house. The method used has a new name now &#8211; no longer 'neighbour procedure.' Now 
people are called 'Johnnie.' They're Palestinian civilians, and they're called Johnnies [&#8230;] To 
every house we close in on, we send the neighbour in, 'the Johnnie,' and if there are armed men 
inside, we start, like working the 'pressure cooker' in the West Bank.&#8221; This soldier then mentions 
that some commanders were &#8220;bothered&#8221; by the fact that &#8220;civilians were used to a greater extent 
than just sending them into houses.&#8221; A second soldier interviewed by Breaking the Silence, 
testimony 17, appears to have discussed the &#8220;Johnnie procedure&#8221; at length, but his testimony was 
censored or otherwise cut in that respect, so that we can only read: &#8220;They [civilians found in 
houses] were used as &#8216;Johnnies&#8217; (at a different point in the interview the witness described the 
&#8216;Johnnie&#8217; procedure, using Palestinian civilians as human shields during house searches), and 
then released, and we&#8217;re finding them in later searches.&#8221;<b> 535</b> 
</p>
<p>1094. The Mission thus finds that while these testimonies do not confirm the details of the 
specific cases it investigated, they strongly support the general allegation that the Israeli armed 
forces engaged in the practice of compelling Palestinian civilians to accompany them on house 
searches.  
</p>
<p>1095. In conclusion, from the facts it gathered, the Mission finds that Messrs. Majdi Abd Rabbo, 
Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa, Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami and AD/03 were captured by 
the Israeli armed forces while they were in their homes, in some cases together with their 
families, and were then forced at gunpoint to search houses together with the Israeli armed 
forces. The Mission also finds on the basis of those facts that they were all subject to cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment during their captivity.  
</p>
<p><b>G. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>1096. Several provisions of international humanitarian law prohibit the practice of using civilian 
men captured by the armed forces to search houses in which the invading army suspects the risk 
of ambushes or booby traps. 
</p>
<p>1097. This practice constitutes the use of involuntary human shields and is a violation of article 
28 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which reads: &#8220;The presence of a protected person may not 
be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.&#8221; Article 51, paragraph 
7, of Additional Protocol I (set out in full in chapter VIII above) adds that &#8220;the presence or 
movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain 
points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military

<b>535</b> <i>Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies&#8230;</i>, pp. 7&#8211;8 and 46. A third soldier recounts discussing the use of Palestinian civilians with 
his unit commander. The unit commander denied knowing about this, but the soldier concludes: &#8220;This procedure of 
using civilians exists, he knows about this. 'Neighbour procedure' is an official army procedure; it's just not called 
that any longer. The brigade commander was on the ground the whole time. He even came to visit us one day. An 
official army procedure means army instructions.&#8221; Ibid., p. 107. </p>

 <p> 
objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the 
conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to 
attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.&#8221; The 
prohibition of the use of human shields also has customary law status (rule 97 of the ICRC rules 
of customary humanitarian law<b>536</b>), both in international and in non-international armed conflict. 
The Mission, therefore, finds that the Israeli armed forces have violated article 28 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention and the prohibition under customary international law that the civilian 
population as such will not be the object of attacks, as reflected in article 51 (2) of Additional 
Protocol I. 
</p>
<p>1098. In 2002, the Israeli Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice was seized of a 
case regarding the use of a very similar practice in the West Bank, at the time known as the 
&#8220;neighbour procedure&#8221;. The petitioners, seven Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations, 
described cases in which &#8220;the IDF forced Palestinian residents to walk through and scan 
buildings suspected to be booby-trapped, and in which it ordered them to enter certain areas 
before the combat forces, in order to find wanted persons there; also described are cases in which 
the army used residents as a &#8220;human shield&#8221; which accompanied the combat forces, to serve as a 
shield against attack on those forces. [&#8230;] Further described were cases in which local residents 
were asked about the presence of wanted persons and weapons, under threat of bodily injury or 
death, should the questions go unanswered.&#8221;<b>537</b> In other words, the petitioners described 
incidents analogous to those investigated by the Mission in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1099. In their response to the petition, the Israeli armed forces and other respondents &#8220;clarified 
unequivocally that they recognize that the forces operating in the field are categorically 
forbidden from using Palestinian residents as a &#8216;live shield&#8217; or as &#8216;hostages&#8217;, and that involving 
local residents in any activity exposing them to danger to life or limb is prohibited.&#8221;<b>538</b> The 
Israeli armed forces also submitted to the High Court of Justice a directive regarding the use of 
the so-called &#8220;early warning&#8221; procedure. This procedure relied on the allegedly exclusively 
voluntary cooperation of Palestinian civilians to give wanted persons a warning to turn 
themselves in. The directive states that &#8220;it is strictly forbidden to use the local resident in military 
missions (e.g. locating explosive charges, intelligence gathering).&#8221; It also provides &#8220;it is strictly 
forbidden to use a local resident as a &#8216;live shield&#8217; against attack. Thus, during the advance of the 
force, accompanied by the local resident, the latter is not to be positioned at the head of the 
force.&#8221;<b>539</b> 
</p>
<p>1100. As a result of these assurances given by the Israeli armed forces, the High Court of Justice 
did not rule on the so-called neighbour procedure, but on the &#8220;early warning&#8221; procedure. In its 
ruling, it found that the &#8220;early warning&#8221; procedure was also &#8220;at odds with international law&#8221; and

<b>539</b> Ibid., para. 7. </p>

 <p> 
ordered the armed forces to desist from any further use of the procedure.<b>540</b> In reaching this 
outcome, Supreme Court President A. Barak left no doubt that he considered the &#8220;neighbour 
procedure&#8221; to violate article 28 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. He quotes approvingly from J. 
Pictet&#8217;s <i>Commentary</i> to the Fourth Geneva Convention, in which it is stated that &#8220;such practices 
[the use of human shields], the object of which is to divert enemy fire, have rightly been 
condemned as cruel and barbaric&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1101. When reporting on its military operations in Gaza, the Israeli Government stated: 
</p>
<p>IDF&#8217;s rules of engagement strictly prohibit the use of civilians as human shields. 
Moreover, the Israel Supreme Court has ruled that use of civilians in any capacity for the 
purpose of military operations is unlawful, including the use of civilians to call terrorists 
hiding in buildings. Following this judgement, this latter practice has also been proscribed 
by IDF orders. The IDF is committed to enforcing this prohibition.  
</p>
<p>The IDF took a variety of measures to teach and instil awareness of these rules of 
engagement in commanders and soldiers.<b>541</b> 
</p>
<p>The Israeli Government does not, however, in any way mention the very specific allegations of 
use of Palestinian civilians as human shields in January 2009 which have been in the public 
domain since they were published in an Israeli newspaper in March 2009<b>542</b> and in NGO reports 
from April 2009 onwards, and which have been brought to the attention of the Attorney-General 
of Israel in letters by Israeli NGOs.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1102. The Mission further finds from the facts available to it that the conduct of the Israeli 
armed forces in the cases above violates article 31 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. This 
provision dictates that &#8220;no physical or moral coercion shall be exercised against protected 
persons, in particular to obtain information from them or from third parties.&#8221; The ICRC 
Commentary notes that &#8220;article 31 prohibits coercion for any purpose or reason and the obtaining 
of information is only given as an example. Thus, the custom, hitherto accepted in practice but 
disputed in theory, that an invasion army may force the inhabitants of an occupied territory to 
serve as &#8216;guides&#8217; is now forbidden.&#8221;<b>543</b>  
</p>
<p>1103. The questioning of civilians under threat of death or injury by Israeli soldiers, who 
demanded information about Hamas and the location of Palestinian combatants and tunnels, also 
constitutes a violation of article 31. The Mission has no information on cases in which such a 
threat was actually followed by the killing of a captured civilian. However, Messrs. Majdi Abd 
Rabbo, Abbas Ahmad Ibrahim Halawa and Mahmoud Abd Rabbo al-Ajrami, all claim that they 
were threatened with execution. Majdi Abd Rabbo also claimed that he was kicked and beaten 
by soldiers until he gave in to their request to enter the house of HS/08. Mahmoud Abd Rabbo 
</p>

<b>543</b> p. 220. </p>

 <p> 
al-Ajrami was thrown from the second floor of his house after refusing to provide information to 
Israeli soldiers, resulting in several broken ribs. 
</p>
<p>1104. The use of the &#8220;neighbour procedure&#8221;, now apparently renamed &#8220;Johnnie procedure&#8221;, 
constitutes a violation of fundamental human rights norms. It puts the right to life of the civilians 
concerned, protected in article 6 of ICCPR, at risk in an arbitrary and unlawful way. The anguish 
to which civilians who, blindfolded and handcuffed, are forced at gunpoint to enter houses which 
&#8211; this is the reason they are forced to enter the houses &#8211; might be booby-trapped or harbour 
combatants who might open fire on them, can only be described as cruel and inhuman treatment 
prohibited by article 7 of ICCPR. Furthermore, the witnesses were all deprived of liberty and the 
security of their person violated. This also constitute a violation of article 9 of ICCPR. The 
Mission must state that numerous civilians who came into contact with the Israeli armed forces 
during the military operation recounted shocking stories of humiliation that would certainly be in 
stark contravention of the principle of respect for human dignity, which forms the core of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>1105. The Mission also finds that the intentional use as human shields of those whose accounts 
are presented above qualifies as inhuman treatment of and wilfully causing great suffering to 
protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention. As such, the Mission considers the 
conduct of the Israeli armed forces in relation to such persons to amount to grave breaches of the 
said Convention. The use of human shields is also a war crime under article 8 (2) (b) (xxiii) of 
the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>1106. Finally, the Mission finds that obliging Majdi Abd Rabbo to use a megaphone to call on 
the men trapped in the house behind his to surrender, on the grounds that ICRC was present and 
they could safely hand themselves over, qualifies as a violation of article 37 of Additional 
Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits perfidy. At the time, the Izbat Abd Rabbo 
area was a closed military zone into which no one, including ICRC, was permitted to enter. 
Perfidy is defined by article 37 as &#8220;acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to 
believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international 
law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence&#8221;. Acts amounting to 
perfidy resulting in death or serious personal injury are also a war crime under article 8 
(2) (b) (vii) of the Rome Statute.  
</p>
<p><b>XV. DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY: GAZANS DETAINED DURING  
THE ISRAELI MILITARY OPERATIONS OF 27 DECEMBER 2008  
TO 18 JANUARY 2009</b> 
</p>
<p>1107. According to information that the Mission received, hundreds of Gazans, including 
women and children, were detained by the Israeli armed forces during the military operations. 
Their exact number is not known. Some were held for hours or days in homes, other buildings or 
sandpits in the Gaza Strip; others were taken into detention in Israel, either immediately or after 
an initial period of detention in the Gaza Strip. A number of people were held in army bases (e.g. 
Sde Teiman<b>544</b>), others were held in prison, and some released detainees do not know where they 
                                                 
<b>544</b> Correspondence with HaMoked, 22 July 2009. See also the testimony of AD/06 taken by Addameer, Prisoners 
Support and Human Rights Association. </p>

 <p> 
were held. Some detainees have reported abuse during detention, including beatings, and being 
kept in unsanitary conditions, without any or with only inadequate food or toilet facilities. Some 
released persons have reported that they were used as human shields during their detention, for 
example, forced to walk in front of soldiers and enter buildings ahead of soldiers.<b>545</b>   
</p>
<p>1108. On 28 January 2009, seven Israeli human rights organizations appealed to the Israeli 
Military Judge Advocate General and to the Attorney General, concerning the &#8220;appalling 
conditions in which Palestinians arrested during the fighting in Gaza were held, and the 
humiliating and inhuman treatment to which they were subjected from the time of their arrest 
until their transfer to the custody of the Israel Prison Service.&#8221;<b>546</b>  
</p>
<p>1109. The number of detainees that were eventually taken to Israeli prisons has been estimated 
at around 100.<b>547</b> Some of them have since been released. It often took the families and lawyers 
several weeks to find out that their loved ones or clients were being detained. Some lawyers have 
alleged that Israel deliberately did not disclose the number of detentions, even to ICRC.<b>548</b> 
Human rights organization Adalah have filed a freedom of information request to the 
Government, but at the time of writing this report is yet to receive a response. Eventually many 
were released by the Israeli Prison Service but the Mission is not in a position to determine the 
exact number. 
</p>
<p>1110. A PCATI lawyer representing detainees, Mr. Bader, who spoke at the Mission&#8217;s public 
hearings in Geneva, interviewed a number of the detainees in Israeli prisons and relayed their 
testimonies. These include stories from prisoners who said they were used as human shields or 
held in sandpits.  
</p>
<p>1111. The Mission has interviewed a number of persons who were detained by the Israeli armed 
forces for substantial periods of time during the military operations in Gaza and thereafter. In the 
course of that detention they were in some cases held without trial or respect for basic due 
process guarantees, and were mentally and physically abused. The Mission has also heard 
directly from legal representatives of several people who were detained at this time, including 
some of those referred to above. Moreover, the Mission addressed questions to the Government 
of Israel with regard to the number of persons from Gaza detained by Israel during the military 
operations and the duration of their detention, including how many remain in custody. The 
Mission asked how many persons detained in Gaza were charged with being &#8220;unlawful 
combatants&#8221; and on what basis, how many were subjected to trial and what due process 
guarantees were afforded to them. No reply was received.

</p>
<p><b>A. Al-Atatra sandpits 
</b></p>
<p>1112. Al-Atatra is located 10 kilometres north of Gaza City, west of Beit Lahia and three to four 
kilometres south of the Green Line. The neighbourhood is largely agricultural with orange and 
lemon orchards. On the morning of 5 January, it suffered heavy aerial bombardment, which was 
followed by a ground incursion by Israeli troops. The Mission met six people, members of the 
same extended family<b>549</b> and residents of al-Atatra, three of whom were direct witnesses and 
victims of the events that occurred in the aftermath of the ground incursion.<b>550</b> Their testimonies 
are supported by those of three others, also residents of al-Atatra, submitted to the Mission by an 
NGO.<b>551</b>  
</p>
<p>1113. On the morning of 5 January, shortly after the ground operations began, an estimated 
40 Israeli soldiers broke into several homes, including that of AD/01, who described to the 
Mission how 65 persons, several of whom were holding white flags, were made to assemble in 
the street. The soldiers separated the men from the women. The men were made to line up 
against a wall and strip to their underwear. AD/01 indicated that any attempt to resist the soldiers 
was met with physical force, resulting in injuries. 
</p>
<p>1114. Approximately 20 minutes later, they were taken into a house owned by Mr. Khalil 
Misbah Attar, where they were detained for a day, the men still separated from the women. The 
house had been struck by a number of missiles that morning and was badly damaged. Witnesses 
indicated to the Mission that the house was at that time being used by the Israeli armed forces as 
a military base and sniper position.<b>552</b>  
</p>
<p>1115. At around 10 p.m., all of the men were handcuffed behind their backs with plastic 
restraints and blindfolded. The men, 11 women and at least seven children below the age of 14 
were taken on foot to al-Kaklouk located south of the American School, one to two kilometres 
away. Many of the men remained in their underwear, exposed to the harsh winter weather.<b>553</b> Al-
Kaklouk is very close to Israeli military artillery and tank positions, and while the detainees were 
held here at least one tank was engaged in frequent firing.  
</p>
<p>1116. AD/01 told the Mission that, on arrival at al-Kaklouk, everyone was asked to clamber 
down into trenches, which had been dug to create a pit surrounded by a wall of sand, about three 
metres high. There were three such pits, each of which was surrounded by barbed wire. They 
were estimated to cover about 7,000 square metres  (&#8220;six or seven <i>donums</i>&#8221;) each. AD/01 
described how they were assembled in long single files, rather than massed together, and held in

<b>553</b> According to the BBC weather services, temperatures in the Gaza Strip in December and January, on average, 
vary from maximum 17&#176; to minimum 7&#176; Celsius. </p>

 <p> 
these pits, in the open air and exposed to cold temperatures for three days (till 8 January). Each 
pit accommodated approximately 20 people. They were forced to sit in stress positions, on their 
knees and leaning forward keeping their heads down. They were monitored by soldiers and were 
not allowed to communicate with each other. They had no access to food or water on the first 
day of their internment, and were given a sip of water and an olive each to eat on the second and 
third days of their detention (6 and 7 January). They had limited access to toilet facilities. The 
men had to wait for two to three hours after asking before they were allowed to leave the pits to 
relieve themselves and sometimes were able to remove their blindfolds for the purpose. A few of 
them were told to relieve themselves inside the pit, behind a small mount of sand. They stated 
that it was culturally too difficult for the women to seek permission to relieve themselves and 
they did not ask.  
</p>
<p>1117. AD/01 states that some tanks were inside the pit with at least one tank positioned at the 
eastern end.<b>554</b> While the people were held there, the tank facing inland each day sporadically 
fired on the houses along the road opposite the site.  
</p>
<p>1118. AD/01B and AD/01C recounted that on 8 January, the women and children were released 
and told to go to Jabaliyah. The men were transferred to military barracks near the northern 
border, identified as the Izokim Barracks. At the Izokim barracks, the men were detained in pits 
similar to but smaller than those in al-Kaklouk. They continued to be exposed to the cold 
temperature, rain and the constant sound of tank movement overhead. The witnesses have 
described to the Mission the experience of continued and prolonged exposure to the sound of this 
tank movement as disorienting and creating feelings of futility, isolation, helplessness and abject 
terror.  
</p>
<p>1119. The men were held handcuffed and in their underwear in the Izokim barracks overnight. 
They were questioned intermittently, mostly on details and locations of Qassam rockets, the 
tunnels and the whereabouts of Hamas parliamentarians. According to statements made to the 
Mission, they were beaten during the interrogation and threatened with death and being run over 
by tanks. The Mission notes that the nature and types of questions asked remained the same 
throughout the interrogations in various detention facilities.  
</p>
<p>1120. On 9 January, the men were taken to a prison in Israel, indentified by one witness as the 
Negev prison, where they remained until 12 January. They were detained in one section of the 
prison, alternating between being held in isolation and in shared cells, and were subjected to 
harsh interrogation, often by two people dressed in civilian clothes. Interrogation focused on the 
identification of Hamas tunnels and arms as well as the whereabouts of Gilad Shalit.   
</p>
<p>1121. AD/01B and AD/01C recounted that they were shackled to a chair with plastic strips and 
interrogated several times, with AD/01B stating that he was made to strip naked during an 
interrogation. He was kept in solitary confinement where a soldier would come intermittently 
during the day, and slam the cell door open and shut, exposing him to extremely cold 
temperatures. AD/01C stated that during the first interrogation he was verbally threatened and in 
the subsequent two he was blindfolded and beaten. He was made to stand up and face the wall, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>554</b> This is corroborated in the statement by RR to PCATI. </p>

 <p> 
following which his face was smashed against the wall several times before he was severely 
beaten (kicked and punched) on his back and buttocks.  
</p>
<p>1122. Requests for clothing were denied. During the interrogation the detainees were informed 
that they were &#8220;illegal combatants&#8221; and that they had no protection under the Geneva 
Conventions. They had limited access to food, water and sanitation. Their morning meal was a 
bottle-cap-sized piece of bread with a drop of marmalade. The evening meal, if provided, 
consisted of rotting sardines and cheese on mouldy bread.  
</p>
<p>1123. AD/01C described the experience of being detained, stripped and shackled as one of 
abandonment, desperation, suffocation and isolation. He continues to experience discomfort 
where he was beaten and is unable to sit and sleep comfortably.  
</p>
<p>1124. AD/01C stated that while in Negev prison an additional group arrived. They were kept 
separately in the second section. The exact number of detainees in the second group is unknown, 
although AD/01C indicated to the Mission that the second group was smaller.  
</p>
<p>1125. On 12 January, nine people including the witnesses were blindfolded, handcuffed and 
transported to the Erez border. AD/01 described to the Mission how they were subjected to harsh 
interrogation at Erez and made to strip completely. Several hours later they were told to run into 
Gaza, to look straight ahead and not to look back.   
</p>
<p>1126. AD/01 states that all 65 detainees from the original group taken from al-Atatra to Israel 
were eventually released. Some members of his family were detained afterwards, but not in the 
original group of 65. At the time of writing, three of these remain incarcerated in various 
detention facilities of the Israel Prison Service. An unknown number remain in prison facing 
charges of being illegal combatants and members of al-Qassam Brigades. The first hearing was 
scheduled to be held in August in Israel (exact date not known).  
</p>
<p><b>B. Detention and abuse of AD/02</b> 
</p>
<p>1127. AD/02 was interviewed by the Mission on 1 July 2009. He is a resident of Beit Lahia and 
a businessman. He was detained on 4 January 2009 for around 85 days. In that period he was 
held in Beersheba and Negev prisons, after being detained in locations identified as military 
posts. He was mentally and physically abused. He appeared before what appeared to be a 
criminal court, but the precise nature of the proceedings and their results were never made clear 
to him. He was released without explanation and returned to the Erez border and told to re-enter 
Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1128. By 3 January AD/02 and his extended family, numbering over 200, had gathered together 
in Beit Lahia as a result of the attacks that were taking place in the area. At around 4 a.m. on 4 
January Israeli troops entered the area shooting. They ordered everyone out of the house and 
separated the men from the women and children. They selected 15 of the men, without asking for 
names. The women and children were ordered to go south. AD/02 recounted that the 15 men, 
including him, were separated from the other men and were blindfolded and handcuffed with </p>

 <p> 
plastic strips.<b>555</b> They were taken on foot to an open space half a kilometre away. An hour later, 
they were taken to a house where they were joined by an estimated 54 or 55 people, who 
apparently also wore blindfolds.   
</p>
<p>1129. AD/02 described how they were interrogated in a separate room, individually and at times 
in groups of two or three. He stated that some of the men, though not him, were beaten during 
the interrogation and were made to clamber down into trenches or pits, dug in the ground outside 
the house, big enough to accommodate one person. They were kept in the pits for several hours 
at a time, handcuffed and blindfolded, with no access to toilets.  
</p>
<p>1130. Later that night, 15 people &#8211; four women and at least 11 children &#8211; were brought to the 
house. They were detained overnight in the corridor outside the room where the men were 
detained. The next morning, on 4 January, the men, women and children were taken out of the 
house to an open space. The men remained blindfolded and handcuffed. AD/02 stated that the 
open space was a military post with many tanks and soldiers. They were all told to sit in the 
middle of the empty space. A fence of barbed wire was then erected around them. They sat 
within the barbed enclosure all day and all night in close proximity to the movement and sound 
of military tanks. 
</p>
<p>1131. AD/02 stated that 18 to 20 other men were held overnight in an open truck, exposed to the 
cold and rain. AD/02 knew this from talking to some of the men the following morning.<b>556</b>  
</p>
<p>1132. On 5 January, 18 to 20 men, not including AD/02, were taken from the military post to an 
unknown location.<b>557</b> AD/02 and 35 others were taken to an area described by him as located 
north of Gaza City and in Israel. They remained handcuffed and blindfolded for an hour and a 
half. Then a roll-call was taken, their blindfolds removed and they were interrogated by a person 
who identified himself as an intelligence officer. Shortly afterwards, AD/02 and a few others 
(exact number not known) were interviewed by a group of people identifying themselves as part 
of a television crew. AD/02 does not know the name and/or details of the television channel. 
They were then led to an open space, where they stayed all evening exposed to the rain and cold. 
Later that night (5&#8211;6 January) they were blindfolded and shackled with chains and taken to a 
location which AD/02 subsequently learned was the Beersheba prison facility. A few hours later, 
at dawn, their blindfolds and handcuffs were removed.  
</p>
<p>1133. AD/02 recounted that he was in extreme pain as the handcuffs were very tight, adding to 
the pain caused by pre-existing injuries to his hands and wrist. Earlier in his life, he had suffered 
serious burns and the scarring on his hands and arms is evident. There is continued nerve damage 
to the skin tissue which causes significant pain in cold weather. His gloves were taken away by

family in one room and begin to search&#8221;, p. 50. 
<b>556</b> AD/02&#8217;s statement is corroborated in a letter sent by various NGOs (ACRI, PCATI, HaMoked, PHR, B&#8217;Tselem,

http://www.stoptorture.org.il/files/28109_eng.pdf.  
<b>557</b> AD/02 indicated that it was later learned that the men had been taken to Ashkelon prison before being brought to 
the Beersheba Prison, where they were grouped with the others, including AD/02.  </p>

soldiers during an interrogation, exposing his hands to the extreme cold. His requests for medical 
assistance were ignored several times before his arrival in Beersheba, where he was given access 
to a doctor. He was, however, given only a non-medicated lotion.  
</p>
<p>1134. AD/02 stated that he was detained in Beersheba for approximately a week. He was 
intermittently kept in isolation and then in a courtyard with several other detainees. In one 
instance, he was blindfolded, handcuffed and shackled, and interrogated for approximately two 
hours by three people. He was verbally abused and beaten during the interrogation, his hair was 
pulled and he was kicked with one of the interrogators attempting to push his boots through the 
loop of the handcuffs tied around his wrists.  
</p>
<p>1135. On or around 13 January, pursuant to an interrogation by a person dressed in civilian 
clothes, AD/02 was blindfolded and handcuffed and taken to the Negev prison. He remained 
there until the end of March. During this time he was transferred at least 10 times from one cell 
to another.   
</p>
<p>1136. On arrival his handcuffs were removed and he was taken to a ward, which consisted of 
small one-man cells with iron doors and no windows. The cells each contained an iron bench. 
Two hours later, he was blindfolded and taken to an interrogation room, where he was stripped 
and made to stand alone, naked, for almost an hour before his clothes were returned and he was 
handcuffed and shackled. He was taken by four people to another room, where he was beaten 
with the butt of a rifle while also being kicked and punched several times. The beating lasted for 
about 30 minutes. He was then left alone in the room for about 2 hours. He was then taken to a 
large communal space referred by the soldiers as the &#8220;tents.&#8221; There were seven or eight such 
spaces or tents spread across the prison. 
</p>
<p>1137. AD/02 said that he was unable to stand owing to the severe injuries sustained during the 
beatings and had to be carried to the tents. He was taken to a doctor, given some medicines and 
allowed to take a shower. AD/02 stated that he stayed in the tent area for about a week before 
being transferred to a cell occupied by four people. The cell had an iron bed and a bunk bed. 
Two people including AD/02 slept on the floor. The cell was dark and filthy. There was no clean 
water and no toilet. During the entire week the men had to relieve themselves in the cell, which 
was never cleaned.  
</p>
<p>1138. AD/02 remained in the cell for about one week. At some time during this period he was 
taken, blindfolded, handcuffed and shackled, by bus to what appeared to be a court. On arrival, 
his handcuffs and blindfold were removed. He remained shackled when he was taken inside the 
courtroom. The courtroom had a standard layout with the judge seated behind a table in the 
centre of the room. The prosecution was on one side and the defence on the other. They were all 
dressed in civilian clothes. Once inside the courtroom, AD/02 was made to sign a consent form, 
accepting the lawyer reportedly appointed to defend him. Although the lawyer identified himself 
as belonging to a human rights organization, he gave no name. As the proceedings began, the 
judge addressed AD/02 and read out the charge against him. The judge announced that he was 
being charged with being an illegal combatant but did not explain specific charges. AD/02 was 
asked no questions. When the defence lawyer asked for the charge to be elaborated, the judge 
replied that the charges were part of a secret dossier and could not be elaborated upon or 
revealed. The proceeding lasted about 30 minutes and AD/02 was taken back to Negev.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1139. A week later, around or on 28 January, AD/02 was transferred to another section of the 
prison, where roll-calls and strip searches were carried out regularly. Some 8 to 10 days later, 
around 7 February, he and 14 others, were moved to a larger ward with prisoners from the West 
Bank. The ICRC was given access to them. 
</p>
<p>1140. On 8 February, AD/02 was transferred, twice, to another section of the prison and shortly 
afterwards to the cell where he had first been detained on arrival at Negev. On 9 February, at 
around noon, he and several others were transferred, for the ninth time, to another section of the 
prison occupied by a large number of prisoners, including those from the West Bank. AD/02 
indicated that several of them were parliamentarians. He remained in this section for 
approximately 20 days. During this time he three times met a person who identified himself as a 
lawyer. He was informed of the charges against him, which included membership and 
involvement with the resistance.  
</p>
<p>1141. On 2 March, he was transferred with 10 others to yet another section of the prison. They 
were put in two rooms, five in each room. The rooms had graffiti on the wall that read <i>illegal 
combatants</i> in English and in Hebrew. They had limited access to toilets and were given 
uncooked food to eat.  
</p>
<p>1142. Around 29&#8211;30 March, AD/02 was finally released. He and his brother, a cousin and two 
other residents of Izbat Abd Rabbo were blindfolded and handcuffed and taken to the Erez 
border, where they were interrogated for approximately four hours. They were then told to cross 
the border and not look back. They were given no explanation about either their detention or 
their release. 
</p>
<p><b>C. AD/03 
</b></p>
<p>1143. AD/03 is a resident of al-Salam neighbourhood, east of Jabaliyah and close to the eastern 
border with Israel. His arrest and detention were preceded by aerial attacks and a ground 
invasion in his neighbourhood. His house was struck several times, over a period of five days, by 
projectiles fired from F-16 aircraft. The attacks continued throughout the night when most 
people were asleep.<b>558</b> As a result of the continued attacks, he sought refuge in a relative&#8217;s house 
nearby. 
</p>
<p>1144. AD/03 stated that, although the area could be considered as a frontline where armed 
groups had been present, the neighbourhood could not reasonably have been perceived as a 
military threat by the time the Israeli armed forces arrived on the ground. There was no 
resistance going on in the neighbourhood when it was targeted. If the intent of the attacks was to

<p>                                                 
<b>558</b> On the afternoon of 3 January, AD/03&#8217;s house was struck twice by projectiles, within two hours, causing 
significant damage. He and his family moved to a relative&#8217;s house nearby, where they stayed overnight. On 4 
January in the evening, when AD/03 had returned to his own home, it was struck for the third time and part of the 
roof collapsed. AD/03 sustained minor injuries; his mother and his wife sustained more serious injuries. Later that 
night, at around 9.40 p.m., the house was hit by a fourth rocket, which was followed by another attack 20 minutes 
later that completely destroyed the ground floor facade injuring AD/03&#8217;s father&#8217;s second wife. Another shell (the 
sixth attack) was fired shortly afterwards.  AD/03 and his family relocated for the second time to his cousin&#8217;s house, 
where they remained for four nights, until 7 January. On the morning of 8 January, aerial bombardment intensified 
to the extent that three explosions/shells were reportedly heard every minute. </p>

 <p> 
destroy alleged command centres, positions or weapons caches of Hamas, he felt that those 
positions would have been destroyed in the first few attacks on the neighbourhood given the 
intensity of the shelling.  
</p>
<p>1145. On 8 January, at around 11.30 a.m., the house where AD/03 was seeking refuge was 
struck by a missile so he decided to return to his own house. He described how Israeli soldiers 
fired at them, including women and children carrying white flags, when they tried to leave his 
cousin&#8217;s house. His father&#8217;s wife sustained a bullet injury to her leg. Thirty minutes later, around 
noon, the Israeli armed forces ordered all residents to evacuate their homes and come out in the 
street. The men were separated from the women and children, and told to line up against a wall, 
lift their shirts and strip to their underwear. They remained stripped and lined up against the wall 
for approximately 15 minutes. The men, women and children were then told to walk down the 
street. 
</p>
<p>1146. AD/03 recounted that the street was blocked with large piles of heavy rubble and debris of 
bulldozed buildings, which provided a difficult obstacle for several people, including children 
and elderly people. They walked 200-250 metres before arriving at a house. Two hours later the 
women and children were told to go to Jabaliyah. Shortly afterwards, AD/03, his brother, cousin 
and an unknown man were taken to another room, where they were forced to lie on the ground. 
They were then blindfolded and their hands were tied behind their backs with plastic strips. They 
were interrogated individually for several hours. Later that evening, they were made to walk 
about 100 metres eastward to another house. They were detained overnight in a room, together 
with three others, who identified themselves as residents of Abd Rabbo. They had no access to 
food, water or toilets. The next morning, on 9 January, their blindfolds were removed and all 
seven were interrogated, individually, by one soldier.  
</p>
<p>1147. AD/03 stated that the house was being used as a military base and sniper position. On the 
second day of detention the Israeli soldiers began to use some detainees as human shields. By 
then the detainees had been without food and sleep for a day. They had been subjected to what 
AD/03 described as psychological torture. There were constant death threats and insults. To 
carry out house searches as human shields the Israeli soldiers took off AD/03&#8217;s blindfold but he 
remained handcuffed. He was forced to walk in front of the soldiers and told that, if he saw 
someone in the house but failed to tell them, he would be killed. He was instructed to search 
each room in each house cupboard by cupboard. After one house was completed he was taken to 
another house with a gun pressed against his head and told to carry out the same procedure there. 
He was punched, slapped and insulted throughout the process. 
</p>
<p>1148. AD/03 indicated that he was forced to do this twice while the group was being held in this 
house for eight days. Others were also required to do the same thing. On the first occasion he 
was forced to carry out searches in three houses and on the second in four. AD/03 estimates that 
these searches took between one hour and one hour and a half. At no point did he come across 
any explosive devices or armed group members.  </p>

 <p> 
1149. AD/03 stated that, at the end of every search, the houses were vandalized by the Israeli 
soldiers, who broke doors, windows, kitchenware and furniture, for instance.<b>559</b>   
</p>
<p>1150. At the end of the day he was taken back to the house, where he and six others continued to 
be detained for 8 days, until 16 January. They had limited access to food and water and were 
often denied access to toilets. They were told that their ordeal would continue indefinitely. One 
soldier reportedly told them that the soldiers were &#8220;following instructions issued by the chain of 
command.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1151. For the first time the detainees were asked for proof of identity. AD/03 said that their 
identification documents were thoroughly inspected. Had they revealed anything in relation to 
militant activities, he believed they would have been killed. 
</p>
<p>1152. On 16 January they were handcuffed, with plastic strips tied very tightly around their 
wrists, made to stand in a single file, blindfolded and told to hold on to the shirt of the person 
standing in front of them. They were made to walk towards a military tank positioned very close 
to the house where they had been detained and told to sit on top of each other inside the tank. 
The tank drove on a bumpy track and over big boulders causing them to frequently slam against 
the sides of the tank. About three hours later it stopped in an unknown location. On arrival, they 
were asked to clamber down into holes or pits about three to four metres deep. AD/03 stated that 
they were in a military post, as they heard the voices of several soldiers laughing and joking 
noisily. They remained blindfolded and handcuffed and exposed to the continued sound of tank 
movement overhead. They remained in the pit for about one hour and were then made to sit 
inside a tank that moved in circles.  
</p>
<p>1153. Shortly afterwards, their handcuffs were removed and they were shackled with chains 
inside a bus. They were accompanied by soldiers who spoke Hebrew. On arrival, they were 
searched and then interrogated for eight hours before being taken to the military barracks in 
Beersheba. Then they were made to line against the wall before being asked to strip naked. They 
were made to stand, blindfolded, naked and exposed to the cold winds, for about three or four 
hours. 
</p>
<p>1154. On 19 January, eight people, including AD/03, his brother and one other man from the 
group of seven who were taken to Beersheba on 16 January, were shackled inside the bus, made 
to bend forward and keep their heads down, between their knees, and were taken to Negev 
prison, a journey that lasted approximately four hours. During this journey they were 
continuously beaten, kicked and punched by four or five soldiers on board. According to AD/03, 
the detainees sustained serious injuries and were bleeding, two bleeding more profusely than the 
others. Two detainees reportedly even fainted. He stated that soldiers on board made constant 
reference to shackling practices in the Russian Federation, leading AD/03 to believe that the 
soldiers were from there.  
</p>

<b>559</b> The account of a soldier interviewed by Breaking the Silence and the account in the submission of the Jerusalem 
Centre for Public Affairs clarify that soldiers would vandalize houses after searches. Jerusalem Center for Public 
Affairs submission, p. 78.  &#8220;The family was not in there, they had run away. He [one of the soldiers] took out

Testimonies&#8230;</i>, testimony 35, p. 80.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1155. On arrival at Negev, they were severely beaten by the prison security for approximately 
one and a half hours before being put into cells and told that they were caught during battle and 
were illegal combatants. Later that night, 10 more people joined the group of detainees. 
</p>
<p>1156. AD/03 described how on the second day of their incarceration, 20 January, the detainees 
(at this point 18 in number) were told that they would be interrogated in accordance with their 
alleged political affiliations. Several of them pointed out that they had none. They were grouped 
apart. AD/03 said that they talked among themselves and he found out that nine of them were 
livestock farmers and three or four were merchants and traders.  
</p>
<p>1157. AD/03 described how the detainees were divided into two groups of nine each and put in a 
section of the prison referred to as the <i>mardaban</i>, which was divided into two wards containing 
10 iron beds each and guarded by Israeli Arab soldiers. They remained incarcerated for eight 
days, until 27 January, with limited access to food, water, toilets and physical exercise.  
</p>
<p>1158. On 24 January, AD/03 was given access to a lawyer, affiliated with Addameer, Prisoners 
Support and Human Rights Association,<b>560</b> for the first and only time. The Mission interviewed 
him<b>561</b> and he confirmed that he had visited AD/03 and his brother on 25 January 2009. The 
lawyer&#8217;s evidence provided corroboration of the detention of AD/03 and his brother (who was 
also assisted by the lawyer), and the conditions under which he was subjected to criminal 
proceedings in Israel. The lawyer was informed by the Israeli authorities that AD/03 was 
detained under the illegal combatant law but he was not given the dossier to review. His brother 
was never formally charged. 
</p>
<p>1159. On 25 January, the detainees were told that they would be taken to Beersheba for their 
trial. On 26 January, all 18 detainees were shackled with iron chains to iron benches in a bus, 
handcuffed with iron handcuffs and taken to Beersheba. They were not blindfolded. The journey 
lasted five hours during which the bus drove on bumpy roads causing the detainees to slam 
against the sides of the bus. They were detained in Beersheba overnight in overcrowded cells 
together with people convicted of serious offences, according to AD/03. They were mostly 
Israeli Jews.  
</p>
<p>1160. The following morning, on 27 January, they were taken back to the Negev prison in 
shackles and handcuffs. They were given no information regarding the scheduled hearing. The 
outcome of the proceedings was not clear to AD/03 at the time, as he believed he had been 
&#8220;acquitted&#8221; only when they were returned to the Negev prison.  
</p>
<p>1161. The lawyer from Addameer was present in the court. According to him, the prosecutor 
made the decision not to proceed with the case rather than the detainees being acquitted. The 
lawyer confirms that they were held in Ktziot prison in the Negev Desert and released on 
27 January. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>560</b> The Mission has heard directly from AD/03&#8217;s legal representative, who stated that he received a copy of his file, 
but not the secret file, from the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on 21 January 2009. AD/03 was arrested on suspicion of being 
an illegal combatant.   
<b>561</b> The lawyer had been alerted to the cases by Al Mezan, a human rights organization in Gaza. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1162. AD/03 said they were then taken back to Beersheba and later to the Erez border, where 
they were released. They were told to run into Gaza and not look back.  
</p>
<p>1163. AD/03 indicated that two others, detained with him, were released a month later. Two 
others continue to be detained in the Ktziot prison and are reportedly awaiting trial. The status 
and whereabouts of 11 others are not known. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>1164. The Mission found the witnesses credible and reliable taking into account their demeanour 
and the consistency of their statements. At least one of them was still suffering considerable 
anguish because of the treatment he had endured at the hands of the Israeli soldiers and other 
officials. The Mission notes that there are several common features to these incidents that 
disclose a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Israeli soldiers, indicating that the treatment 
meted out to the persons deposing before the Mission were not isolated incidents. The facts 
available to the Mission indicate that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All three locations were near the border with Israel; 
&#8226; Before the arrival of ground troops, all three had been under aerial or ground attack. 
</p>
<p>The soldiers on the ground were in complete control of the area at the time of their 
encounter with the civilians; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There was no combat activity by the persons reporting, nor any likelihood of such 
activity being under way in the area or nearby at the time that the soldiers started the 
operation against civilians in the three locations. None of the civilians was armed or 
posed any apparent threat to the soldiers. In two of the incidents they were holding 
white flags as a sign of their non-combatant status;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is clear in two of the incidents that none of those detained had been asked for their 
names by the soldiers for several days. This establishes that there was no definite 
suspicion against them that they were combatants or otherwise engaged in hostile 
activities;<b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; In all cases a number of persons were herded together and detained in open spaces 
for several hours at a time and exposed to extreme weather conditions;<b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; The soldiers deliberately subjected civilians, including women and children, to cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment throughout their ordeal in order to terrorize, 
intimidate and humiliate them. The men were made to strip, sometimes naked, at 
different stages of their detention. All the men were handcuffed in a most painful 
manner and blindfolded, increasing their sense of fear and helplessness;<b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; Men, women and children were held close to artillery and tank positions, where 
constant shelling and firing was taking place, thus not only exposing them to danger, 
but increasing their fear and terror. This was deliberate, as is apparent from the fact 
that the sandpits to which they were taken were specially prepared and surrounded by 
barbed wire;<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; During their detention in the Gaza Strip, whether in the open or in houses, the 
detainees were subjected to beatings and other physical abuse that amounts to torture. 
This continued systematically throughout their detention;<b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; Civilians were used as human shields by the Israeli armed forces on more than one 
occasion in one of the three incidents. Taking account of other incidents in which the 
Mission has found this to have happened, it would not be difficult to conclude that 
this was a practice repeatedly adopted by the Israeli armed forces during the military 
operation in Gaza; <b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; Many civilians were transferred across the border to Israel and detained in open 
spaces as well as in prisons;<b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; The methods of interrogation amounted not only to torture in some of the cases, but 
also to physical and moral coercion of civilians to obtain information; <b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; These persons were subjected to torture, maltreatment and foul conditions in the 
prisons. They were deprived of food and water for several hours at a time and any 
food they did receive was inadequate and inedible;<b> </b></p>
<p>&#8226; While in detention in Israel they were denied due process.<b> E. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>1165. The Mission considers the following legal provisions relevant to its consideration of the 
matters presented above:<b>562</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
</b></p>
<p>Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any 
manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a 
party to the conflict or occupying Power of which they are not nationals. 
</p>
<p>Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. 
Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and 
nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the 
State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in 
whose hands they are. 
</p>
<p>The provisions of Part II are, however, wider in application, as defined in article 13. 
</p>
<p>Persons protected by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition 
of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12August 1949, or by the 
Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and 
Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12August 1949, or by the Geneva 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>562</b> The Mission does not repeat here the provisions already cited elsewhere, such as article 57 of Additional Protocol 
I or common article 3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12August 1949, shall not be 
considered as protected persons within the meaning of the present Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
</b></p>
<p>Where, in the territory of a party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an 
individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the 
security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and 
privileges under the present Convention as would, if exercised in the favour of such 
individual person, be prejudicial to the security of such State. 
</p>
<p>Where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as a spy or 
saboteur, or as a person under definite suspicion of activity hostile to the security of the 
occupying Power, such person shall, in those cases where absolute military security so 
requires, be regarded as having forfeited rights of communication under the present 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity and, in case 
of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present 
Convention. They shall also be granted the full rights and privileges of a protected person 
under the present Convention at the earliest date consistent with the security of the State 
or occupying Power, as the case may be. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
</b></p>
<p>Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their 
honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners 
and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially 
against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity. 
</p>
<p>Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular 
against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault. 
</p>
<p>Without prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and sex, all 
protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by the party to the conflict 
in whose power they are, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, 
religion or political opinion. 
</p>
<p>However, the parties to the conflict may take such measures of control and security 
in regard to protected persons as may be necessary as a result of the war. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
</b></p>
<p>Protected persons accused of offences shall be detained in the occupied country, and 
if convicted they shall serve their sentences therein. They shall, if possible, be separated 
from other detainees and shall enjoy conditions of food and hygiene which will be 
sufficient to keep them in good health, and which will be at least equal to those obtaining 
in prisons in the occupied country. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>They shall receive the medical attention required by their state of health. They shall 
also have the right to receive any spiritual assistance which they may require. 
</p>
<p>Women shall be confined in separate quarters and shall be under the direct 
supervision of women. 
</p>
<p>Proper regard shall be paid to the special treatment due to minors. 
</p>
<p>Protected persons who are detained shall have the right to be visited by delegates of 
the protecting Power and of the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance 
with the provisions of article 143. 
</p>
<p>Such persons shall have the right to receive at least one relief parcel monthly. 
</p>
<p>1166. Relevant parts of article 75 of Additional Protocol I, which reflect customary international 
law, provide: 
</p>
<p>1. In so far as they are affected by a situation referred to in article 1 of this Protocol, 
persons who are in the power of a party to the conflict and who do not benefit from more 
favourable treatment under the Conventions or under this Protocol shall be treated 
humanely in all circumstances and shall enjoy, as a minimum, the protection provided by 
this article without any adverse distinction based upon race, colour, sex, language, religion 
or belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin, wealth, birth or other status, 
or on any other similar criteria. Each Party shall respect the person, honour, convictions 
and religious practices of all such persons. 
</p>
<p>2. The following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents: 
</p>
<p> (a) Violence to the life, health, or physical or mental well-being of persons, in 
particular: 
</p>
<p>  [&#8230;] 
</p>
<p>  (ii) torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental; 
</p>
<p>  (iii) corporal punishment; and 
</p>
<p>  [&#8230;] 
</p>
<p> (b) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading 
treatment, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault; 
</p>
<p> (c) The taking of hostages; 
</p>
<p> (d) Collective punishments; and 
</p>
<p> (e) Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. Any person arrested, detained or interned for actions related to the armed conflict 
shall be informed promptly, in a language he understands, of the reasons why these 
measures have been taken. Except in cases of arrest or detention for penal offences, such 
persons shall be released with the minimum delay possible and in any event as soon as the 
circumstances justifying the arrest, detention or internment have ceased to exist. 
</p>
<p>4. No sentence may be passed and no penalty may be executed on a person found 
guilty of a penal offence related to the armed conflict except pursuant to a conviction 
pronounced by an impartial and regularly constituted court respecting the generally 
recognized principles of regular judicial procedure, which include the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) The procedure shall provide for an accused to be informed without delay of the 
particulars of the offence alleged against him and shall afford the accused before and 
during his trial all necessary rights and means of defence; 
</p>
<p> (b) No one shall be convicted of an offence except on the basis of individual penal 
responsibility; 
</p>
<p> (c) No one shall be accused or convicted of a criminal offence on account of any 
act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under the national or 
international law to which he was subject at the time when it was committed; nor shall a 
heavier penalty be imposed than that which was applicable at the time when the criminal 
offence was committed; if, after the commission of the offence, provision is made by law 
for the imposition of a lighter penalty, the offender shall benefit thereby; 
</p>
<p> (d) Anyone charged with an offence is presumed innocent until proved guilty 
according to law; 
</p>
<p> (e) Anyone charged with an offence shall have the right to be tried in his presence; 
</p>
<p> (f) No one shall be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt; 
</p>
<p> (g) Anyone charged with an offence shall have the right to examine, or have 
examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of 
witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
</p>
<p> (h) No one shall be prosecuted or punished by the same Party for an offence in 
respect of which a final judgement acquitting or convicting that person has been 
previously pronounced under the same law and judicial procedure; 
</p>
<p> (i) Anyone prosecuted for an offence shall have the right to have the judgement 
pronounced publicly; and 
</p>
<p> (j) a convicted person shall be advised on conviction of his judicial and other 
remedies and of the time limits within which they may be exercised. 
</p>
<p>5. Women whose liberty has been restricted for reasons related to the armed conflict 
shall be held in quarters separated from men's quarters. They shall be under the immediate 
supervision of women. Nevertheless, in cases where families are detained or interned, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>they shall, whenever possible, be held in the same place and accommodated as family 
units. 
</p>
<p>6. Persons who are arrested, detained or interned for reasons related to the armed 
conflict shall enjoy the protection provided by this article until their final release, 
repatriation or re-establishment, even after the end of the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. In order to avoid any doubt concerning the prosecution and trial of persons accused 
of war crimes or crimes against humanity, the following principles shall apply: 
</p>
<p> (a) Persons who are accused of such crimes should be submitted for the purpose of 
prosecution and trial in accordance with the applicable rules of international law; and 
</p>
<p> (b) Any such persons who do not benefit from more favourable treatment under 
the Conventions or this Protocol shall be accorded the treatment provided by this article, 
whether or not the crimes of which they are accused constitute grave breaches of the 
Conventions or of this Protocol. 
</p>
<p>8. No provision of this article may be construed as limiting or infringing any other 
more favourable provision granting greater protection, under any applicable rules of 
international law, to persons covered by paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p>1167. From the facts available to it, and in the absence of any information refuting the 
allegations that the incidents described above took place, the Mission finds that there have been a 
number of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  
</p>
<p>1168. All of the persons held were civilians and protected persons under article 4 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention. The Mission does not accept the proposition that the men were detained as 
or considered to be unlawful combatants and therefore beyond the protection of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention. An individual loses the status of protected person only if that person is 
&#8220;definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State&#8221; (art. 5). The 
Mission has not heard any information suggesting this to be the case. Even if a person is no 
longer entitled to the status of protected person, article 5 provides that such persons must 
&#8220;be treated with humanity&#8221; and &#8220;shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial.&#8221; 
Furthermore, under Additional Protocol I, article 75, they shall enjoy &#8220;as a minimum&#8221; the 
protections provided by that article.   
</p>
<p>1169. The Mission has considered to what extent the actions of the Israeli armed forces might 
legitimately be considered as some kind of internment in the light of the resistance from armed 
groups in the area generally, although not in the context of the specific detentions. These people 
from Gaza were detained in prisons inside Israel (Beersheba, Ashkelon and Negev prisons), 
contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which stipulates in article 76 that protected persons 
should be detained inside the occupied territory and not transferred out of it unless there is a 
pressing security need.<b>563</b> It also makes clear that internment is the most severe measure that a 
                                                 
<b>563</b> ICRC also specifies that, in occupied territories, civilians can be interned, or placed in assigned residence, only 
within the frontiers of the occupied country itself. See ICRC Commentary on article 78 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. </p>

 <p> 
detaining authority or occupying Power may take with respect to protected persons against 
whom no criminal proceedings have been initiated. Internment is a preventive administrative 
measure and cannot be considered a penal sanction.<b>564</b> Recourse to the measure may be had only 
if the security of the State makes it &#8220;absolutely necessary&#8221; (art. 42) or &#8220;for imperative reasons of 
security&#8221; (art. 78). 
</p>
<p>1170. The Mission does not consider that the information it has received supports defining the 
treatment described above as internment. 
</p>
<p>1171. The rounding-up of large groups of civilians and their prolonged detention under the 
circumstances described above constitute a collective penalty on those persons in violation of 
article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and article 50 of the Hague Regulations. Such 
treatment amounts to measures of intimidation and terrorism, prohibited under article 33 and a 
grave breach of the Convention that constitutes a war crime. 
</p>
<p>1172. By holding the detainees in sandpits without privacy, the Israeli soldiers failed to ensure 
respect for their persons or to treat them humanely as required by article 27 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. The information before the Mission suggests that this treatment could not be 
justified as necessary &#8220;measures of control and security.&#8221; This treatment also constituted 
outrages on personal dignity, humiliating and degrading treatment contrary to the Geneva 
Conventions, common article 3, and Additional Protocol I, article 75 (2) (b). The abuse, which 
required a considerable degree of planning and control, was sufficiently severe to constitute 
inhuman treatment within the meaning of article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and thus 
a grave breach of the said Convention that would constitute a war crime. 
</p>
<p>1173. &#8220;Women shall be the object of special respect&#8221;, in accordance with article 76 of 
Additional Protocol I. The Mission finds, on the information before it, that the treatment of the 
women in the sandpits, where they endured especially distressing circumstances, was contrary to 
this provision and would also constitute a war crime. 
</p>
<p>1174. The Mission has received information relating to the particular treatment received by 
some witnesses, such as shackling, severe beatings during detention and interrogation, being held 
in foul conditions or solitary confinement, which added to their already profound sense of 
degradation. Such treatment violates article 31 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which 
prohibits physical or moral coercion against protected persons, &#8220;in particular to gain information 
from them&#8221;. This would also constitute a war crime. 
</p>
<p>1175. Furthermore, on the basis of this information, the Mission considers that the severe 
beatings, constant humiliating and degrading treatment and detention in foul conditions allegedly 
suffered by individuals in the Gaza Strip under the control of the Israelis and in detention in 
Israel, would constitute torture, and a grave breach under article 147 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and a violation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Such violations also constitute war crimes.

 <p> 
</p><p>1176. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission believes that there has also been a violation 
of articles 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as of 
article 14  ICCPR with regard to the right to be brought before a judge at the earliest opportunity, 
the right to be informed of the charges against one, the right to consult with legal counsel and the 
right to be provided with a meaningful opportunity to defend oneself. 
</p>
<p><b>XVI. OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY OF ISRAEL&#8217;S MILITARY  
OPERATIONS IN GAZA 
</b></p>
<p>1177. This chapter addresses the objectives and the strategy underlying the Israeli military 
operations in Gaza. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Planning 
</b></p>
<p>1178. The question of whether incidents involving the Israeli armed forces that occurred 
between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 are likely to be the result of error, the activities 
of rogue elements or a deliberate policy or planning depends on a number of factors, including 
the degree and level of planning involved, the degree of discretion field commanders have in 
operations, the technical sophistication and specification of weaponry, and the degree of control 
commanders have over their subordinates. 
</p>
<p>1179. The Government of Israel has refused to cooperate with the Mission. The Mission has 
therefore been unable to interview high-level members of the Israeli armed forces. It has, 
nevertheless, reviewed a significant amount of commentary and conducted a number of 
interviews on planning and discipline, including with persons who have been connected with the 
planning of Israeli military operations in the recent past. The Mission has also analysed the 
views expressed by Israeli officials in official statements, official activities and articles, and 
considered comments by former senior soldiers and politicians. 
</p>
<p><b>1. The context 
</b></p>
<p>1180. Before considering the issue of planning there is an important issue that has to be borne in 
mind about the context of Israeli operations in Gaza. The land mass of Gaza covers 360 square 
kilometres of land. Israel had a physical presence on the ground for almost 40 years with a 
significant military force until 2005. Israel&#8217;s extensive and intimate knowledge of the realities of 
Gaza present a considerable advantage in terms of planning military operations. The Mission has 
seen grid maps in possession of the Israeli armed forces, for example, that show the 
identification by number of blocks of houses throughout Gaza City.  
</p>
<p>1181. In addition to such detailed background knowledge, it is also clear that the Israeli armed 
forces were able to access the telephone networks to contact a significant number of users in the 
course of their operations.<b>565</b>  
</p>
<p>1182. Since the departure of its ground forces from Gaza in 2005, Israel has maintained almost 
total control over land access and total control over air and sea access.<b>566</b> This has also included 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>565</b> See &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 8, 24, 138, 264, 350, 354, 375, 389 and 447.  </p>

 <p> 
the ability to maintain a monitoring capacity in Gaza, by a variety of surveillance and electronic 
means, including UAVs. In short, Israel&#8217;s intelligence gathering capacity in Gaza since its 
ground forces withdrew has remained extremely effective.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Legal input and training of soldiers on legal standards 
</b></p>
<p>1183. The Israeli Government has set out the legal training and supervision relevant to the 
planning, execution and investigation of military operations.<b>567</b> The Mission also met Col. (Ret.) 
Daniel Reisner, who was the head of the International Legal Department of the Military 
Advocate General&#8217;s Office of the Israeli Defense Forces from 1995 until 2004. In an interview 
with the Mission he explained how the principles and contents of international humanitarian law 
were instilled into officers. He explained the four-tiered training system, reflecting elements 
similar to those presented by the Government, which seeks to ensure knowledge of the relevant 
legal obligations for compliance in the field. Firstly, during training all soldiers and officers 
receive basic courses on relevant legal matters. The more senior the ranks, the more training is 
required &#8220;so that it becomes ingrained&#8221;. Secondly, before a significant or new operation, legal 
advice will be given. Col. Reisner indicated that he understood from talking with colleagues still 
in active service that detailed consultations had taken place with legal advisers in the planning of 
the December-January military operations. He was not in a position to say what that advice had 
been. Thirdly, there would be real-time legal support to commanders and decision makers at 
headquarters, command and division levels (but not at regiment levels or below). The fourth 
stage is that of investigation and prosecution wherever necessary. 
</p>
<p>1184. The same framework explained by Col. Reisner appears to be repeated in similar detail in 
a presentation of the Office of the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<b>568</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. The means at the disposal of the Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>1185. The Israeli armed forces are, in technological terms, among the most advanced in the 
world.<b>569</b> Not only do they possess the most advanced hardware in many respects, they are also a 
market leader in the production of some of the most advanced pieces of technology available, 
including UAVs.<b>570</b> They have a very significant capacity for precision strikes by a variety of 
methods, including aerial and ground launches. Moreover, some new targeting systems may have 
been employed in Gaza.<b>571</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                             
<b>566</b> See chap. IV. 
<b>567</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 212-221.

<b>569</b> For a detailed breakdown of Israeli capacity, see http://www.inss.org.il/upload/(FILE)1245235226.pdf. 
<b>570</b> Ibid., pp. 8-9. 
<b>571</b> According to the Israeli armed forces, the system, controlled by a computer and composed of 120 ml mortars, 
was developed for use by ground forces. &#8220;The Keshet weapons system is an autonomous mortar with the ability to 
aim and navigate independently. It fires at a fast speed and has the capacity to fire the first mortar accurately within 
a minute&#8221;. See http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/2008n/04/1401.htm. </p>

 <p> 
1186. Taking into account all of the foregoing factors, the Mission, therefore, concludes that 
Israel had the means necessary to plan the December-January military operations in detail. Given 
both the means at Israel&#8217;s disposal and the apparent degree of training, including training in 
international humanitarian law, and legal advice received, the Mission considers it highly 
unlikely that actions were taken, at least in the aerial phase of the operations, that had not been 
the subject of planning and deliberation.<b>572</b> In relation to the land-air phase, ground commanders 
would have had some discretion to decide on the specific tactics used to attack or respond to 
attacks. The same degree of planning and premeditation would therefore not be present. 
However, the Mission deduces from a review of many elements, including some soldiers&#8217; 
statements at seminars in Tel Aviv and to Breaking the Silence, that what occurred on the ground 
reflected guidance that had been provided to soldiers in training and briefing exercises.<b>573</b>  
</p>
<p>1187. The Mission notes that it has found only one example where the Israeli authorities have 
acknowledged that an error had occurred. This was in relation to the deaths of 22 members of the 
al-Daya family in Zeytoun. The Government of Israel explained that its armed forces had 
intended to strike the house next door, but that errors were made in the planning of the 
operation.<b>574</b> The Mission expresses elsewhere its concerns about this explanation (see chap. XI). 
However, since it appears to be the only incident that has elicited an admission of error by the 
Israeli authorities, the Mission takes the view that the Government of Israel does not consider the 
other strikes brought to its attention to be the result of similar or other errors. 
</p>
<p>1188. In relation to air strikes, the Mission notes the statement issued in Hebrew posted on the 
website of the Israeli armed forces on 23 March 2009: 
</p>
<p>Official data gathered by the Air Force concluded that 99 per cent of the firing that 
was carried out hit targets accurately. It also concluded that over 80 per cent of the bombs 
and missiles used by the Air Force are defined as accurate and their use reduces innocent 
casualties significantly&#8230;<b>575</b> 
</p>
<p>1189. The Mission understands this to mean that in over 80 per cent of its attacks the Air Force 
deployed weapons considered to be accurate by definition &#8211; what are known colloquially as 
precision weapons as a result of guidance technology. In the other 20 per cent of attacks, 
therefore, it apparently used unguided bombs. According to the Israeli armed forces, the fact that 
these 20 per cent were unguided did not diminish their accuracy in hitting their targets, but may 
have caused greater damage than those caused by precision or &#8220;accurate&#8221; weapons. 
</p>

<b>572</b> See &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 236. 
<b>573</b> See, for example, a soldier&#8217;s report of a junior officer&#8217;s briefing before entering Gaza: &#8220;I want aggression. If we 
suspect a building we take down this building. If there&#8217;s a suspect on one of the floors of that building we shell it. 
No second thoughts. It&#8217;s either them or us. Let it be them&#8230; No one has second thoughts. Let error take their lives, 
not ours&#8221;. See transcript from Channel Ten News on record with the Mission of soldiers speaking at a seminar in Tel 
Aviv. 
<b>574</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 385-387. The Israeli Government&#8217;s comments in relation to the attack on a 
truck with oxygen tanks is somewhat more equivocal. The blame is put on the proximity of the tanks to alleged 
armed groups. Ibid., paras. 398-400. 
<b>575</b> http://dover.idf.il/IDF/News_Channels/today/09/03/2301.htm (Mission&#8217;s own translation). </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1190. These represent extremely important findings by the Israeli Air Force. It means that what 
was struck was meant to be struck. It should also be borne in mind that the beginning of the 
ground phase of the operation on 3 January did not mean the end of the use of the Israeli Air 
Force. The statement indicates: 
</p>
<p>During the days prior to the operation &quot;Cast Lead&quot;, every brigade was provided with 
an escorting UAV squadron that would participate in action with it during the operation. 
Teams from the squadrons arrived at the armour and infantry corps, personally met the 
soldiers they were about to join and assisted in planning the infantry manoeuvres. The 
UAV squadrons had representatives in the command headquarters and officers in 
locations of actual combat who assisted in communication between the UAVs &#8211; operated 
by only two people, who are in Israeli territory &#8211; and the forces on the ground. The 
assistance of UAVs sometimes reached a ratio of one UAV to a regiment and, during 
extreme cases, even one UAV to a team. 
</p>
<p>1191. Taking into account the ability to plan, the means to execute plans with the most 
developed technology available, the indication that almost no errors occurred and the 
determination by investigating authorities thus far that no violations occurred, the Mission finds 
that the incident and patterns of events that are considered in this report have resulted from 
deliberate planning and policy decisions throughout the chain of command, down to the standard 
operating procedures and instructions given to the troops on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b>B. The development of strategic objectives in Israeli military thinking 
</b></p>
<p>1192. Israel&#8217;s operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory have had certain consistent 
features. In particular, the destruction of buildings, including houses, has been a recurrent tactical 
theme.<b>576</b> The specific means Israel has adopted to meet its military objectives in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and in Lebanon have repeatedly been censured by the United Nations 
Security Council, especially its attacks on houses.<b>577</b> The military operations from 27 December 
to 18 January did not occur in a vacuum, either in terms of proximate causes in relation to the 
Hamas/Israeli dynamics or in relation to the development of Israeli military thinking about how 
best to describe the nature of its military objectives.  
</p>
<p>1193. A review of the available information reveals that, while many of the tactics remain the 
same, the reframing of the strategic goals has resulted in a qualitative shift from relatively 
focused operations<b>578</b> to massive and deliberate destruction.  
</p>
<p>1194. In its operations in southern Lebanon in 2006, there emerged from Israeli military 
thinking a concept known as the Dahiya doctrine, as a result of the approach taken to the Beirut 
                                                 
<b>576</b> See, for example, Housing and Land Rights Network &#8211; Habitat International Coalition&#8217;s submission to the 
Mission (pp. 12-28). 
<b>577</b> Security Council resolutions 101 (1953), 106 (1955), 111 (1956), 171 (1962), 228 (1966), 248 (1968), 265 
(1969), 270 (1969), 313 (1972), 316 (1972), 332 (1973), 347 (1974), 450 (1979), 501 (1982), 515 (1982), 520 
(1982) and 1544 (2004). 
<b>578</b> The reference to relatively focused operations here should not be misunderstood as an indication that all such 
actions were acceptable in terms of distinction and proportionality. It is merely a comparative reference. </p>

 <p> 
neighbourhood of that name.<b>579</b> Major General Gadi Eisenkot, the Israeli Northern Command 
chief, expressed the premise of the doctrine: 
</p>
<p>1195. What happened in the Dahiya quarter of Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from 
which Israel is fired on. [&#8230;] We will apply disproportionate force on it and cause great damage 
and destruction there. From our standpoint, these are not civilian villages, they are military 
bases. [&#8230;] This is not a recommendation. This is a plan. And it has been approved.<b>580</b> 
</p>
<p>1196. After the war  in southern Lebanon in 2006, a number of senior former military figures 
appeared to develop the thinking that underlay the strategy set out by Gen. Eiskenot. In particular 
Major General (Ret.) Giora Eiland<b>581</b> has argued that, in the event of another war with 
Hizbullah,<b>582</b> the target must not be the defeat of Hizbullah but &#8220;the elimination of the Lebanese 
military, the destruction of the national infrastructure and intense suffering among the 
population&#8230; Serious damage to the Republic of Lebanon, the destruction of homes and 
infrastructure, and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people are consequences that can 
influence Hizbollah&#8217;s behaviour more than anything else&#8221;.<b>583</b> 
</p>
<p>1197. These thoughts, published in October 2008 were preceded by one month by the reflections 
of Col. (Ret.) Gabriel Siboni:<b>584</b> 
</p>
<p>With an outbreak of hostilities, the IDF will need to act immediately, decisively, and 
with force that is disproportionate to the enemy's actions and the threat it poses. Such a 
response aims at inflicting damage and meting out punishment to an extent that will 
demand long and expensive reconstruction processes. The strike must be carried out as 
quickly as possible, and must prioritize damaging assets over seeking out each and every 
launcher. Punishment must be aimed at decision makers and the power elite&#8230; In 
Lebanon, attacks should both aim at Hizbollah&#8217;s military capabilities and should target 
economic interests and the centres of civilian power that support the organization. 
Moreover, the closer the relationship between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Government, 
the more the elements of the Lebanese State infrastructure should be targeted. Such a 
response will create a lasting memory among &#8230; Lebanese decision makers, thereby 
increasing Israeli deterrence and reducing the likelihood of hostilities against Israel for an

<p>extended period. At the same time, it will force Syria, Hizbollah, and Lebanon to commit 
to lengthy and resource-intensive reconstruction programmes&#8230; 
</p>
<p>This approach is applicable to the Gaza Strip as well. There, the IDF will be 
required to strike hard at Hamas and to refrain from the cat and mouse games of searching 
for Qassam rocket launchers. The IDF should not be expected to stop the rocket and 
missile fire against the Israeli home front through attacks on the launchers themselves, but 
by means of imposing a ceasefire on the enemy.<b>585</b> 
</p>
<p>1198. General Eisenkot used the language quoted above while he was in active service in a 
senior command position and clarified that this was not a theoretical idea but an approved plan. 
Major General Eiland, though retired, was a man of considerable seniority. Colonel Siboni, while 
less senior than the other two, was nonetheless an experienced officer writing on his field of 
expertise in a publication regarded as serious.  
</p>
<p>1199. The Mission does not have to consider whether Israeli military officials were directly 
influenced by these writings. It is able to conclude from a review of the facts on the ground that 
it witnessed for itself that what is prescribed as the best strategy appears to have been precisely 
what was put into practice. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Official Israeli statements on the objectives of the military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1200. The Mission is aware of the official statements on the goals of the military operations: 
</p>
<p>The Operation was limited to what the IDF believed necessary to accomplish its 
objectives: to stop the bombardment of Israeli civilians by destroying and damaging the 
mortar and rocket launching apparatus and its supporting infrastructure, and to improve 
the safety and security of Southern Israel and its residents by reducing the ability of 
Hamas and other terrorist organizations in Gaza to carry out future attacks.<b>586</b> 
</p>
<p>1201. The Israeli Government states that this expression of its objectives is no broader than 
those expressed by NATO in 1998 during its campaign in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>1202. The Mission makes no comment on the legality or otherwise of NATO actions there.  
</p>
<p><b>D. The strategy to achieve the objectives 
</b></p>
<p>1203. The issue that is of special concern to the Mission is the conceptualization of the 
&#8220;supporting infrastructure&#8221;. The notion is indicated quite clearly in General Eisenkot&#8217;s 
statements in 2006 and reinforced by the reflections cited by non-serving but well-informed 
military thinkers. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>585</b> Siboni, op. cit. This appears very similar to the so-called Dahiya doctrine. See, for example, Ed Blanche, Jane&#8217;s 
Rockets and Missiles, 3 February 2009, citing Major General Gadi Eisenkot. 
<b>586</b> See &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 83. </p>

 <p> 
1204. On 6 January 2009, during the military operations in Gaza, Deputy Prime Minister Eli 
Yishai<b>587</b> stated: &quot;It [should be] possible to destroy Gaza, so they will understand not to mess 
with us&#8221;. He added that &#8220;it is a great opportunity to demolish thousands of houses of all the 
terrorists, so they will think twice before they launch rockets&#8221;. &quot;I hope the operation will come to 
an end with great achievements and with the complete destruction of terrorism and Hamas. In 
my opinion, they should be razed to the ground, so thousands of houses, tunnels and industries 
will be demolished&#8221;. He added that &#8220;residents of the South are strengthening us, so the operation 
will continue until a total destruction of Hamas [is achieved]&#8221;.<b>588</b>  
</p>
<p>1205. On 2 February 2009, after the end of the military operations, Eli Yishai went on: &#8220;Even if 
the rockets fall in an open air or to the sea, we should hit their infrastructure, and destroy 
100 homes for every rocket fired.&#8221;<b>589</b>  
</p>
<p>1206. On 13 January 2009, Israel&#8217;s Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, was quoted as saying: 
</p>
<p>We have proven to Hamas that we have changed the equation. Israel is not a country 
upon which you fire missiles and it does not respond. It is a country that when you fire on 
its citizens it responds by going wild &#8211; and this is a good thing.<b>590</b> 
</p>
<p>1207. It is in the context of comments such as these that the massive destruction of businesses, 
agricultural land, chicken farms and residential houses has to be understood. In particular, the 
Mission notes the large-scale destruction that occurred in the days leading up to the end of the 
operations. During the withdrawal phase it appears that possibly thousands of homes were 
destroyed. The Mission has referred elsewhere in this report to the &#8220;day after&#8221; doctrine,<b>591</b> as 
explained in the testimonies of Israeli soldiers, which can fit in with the general approach of 
massively disproportionate destruction without much difficulty.  
</p>
<p>1208. The concept of what constituted the supporting infrastructure has to be understood not 
only in the context of the military operations of December and January, but in the tightening of 
the restrictions of access to goods and people into and out of Gaza, especially since Hamas took 
power. The Mission does not accept that these restrictions can be characterized as primarily an 
attempt to limit the flow of materials to armed groups. The expected impact, and the Mission 
believes primary purpose, was to bring about a situation in which the civilian population would

<b>587</b>During the military operation in Gaza, Eli Yishai served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, 
Trade, and Labour in the Government of Mr. Olmert. He serves in the current Government headed by Mr. 
Netanyahu as Internal Affairs Minister as well as Deputy Prime Minister. During the military operations in Gaza, he 
was also a member of the Security Cabinet for National Security within the Israeli Cabinet. Its duties include setting 
the targets of the security system and its policies; questions related to the Israeli armed forces, issues related to 
intelligence, foreign policy, military and security operations, and coordination of the activities of the Government in 
&#8220;Judea, Samaria and Gaza&#8221;. See http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMO/Archive/Decisions/2006/05/des20.htm (in Hebrew).

 <p> 
find life so intolerable that they would leave (if that were possible) or turn Hamas out of office, 
as well as to collectively punish the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>1209. The Israeli Government has stated: 
</p>
<p>While Hamas operates ministries and is in charge of a variety of administrative and 
traditionally governmental functions in the Gaza Strip, it still remains a terrorist 
organization. Many of the ostensibly civilian elements of its regime are in reality active 
components of its terrorist and military efforts. Indeed, Hamas does not separate its 
civilian and military activities in the manner in which a legitimate government might. 
Instead, Hamas uses apparatuses under its control, including quasi-governmental 
institutions, to promote its terrorist activity.<b>592</b>   
</p>
<p>1210. The framing of the military objectives Israel sought to strike is thus very wide indeed. 
There is, in particular, a lack of clarity about the concept of promoting &#8220;terrorist activity&#8221;: since 
Israel claims there is no real division between civilian and military activities and it considers 
Hamas to be a terrorist organization, it would appear that anyone who supports Hamas in any 
way may be considered as promoting its terrorist activity. Hamas was the clear winner of the 
latest elections in Gaza. It is not far-fetched for the Mission to consider that Israel regards very 
large sections of the Gazan civilian population as part of the &#8220;supporting infrastructure&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1211. The indiscriminate and disproportionate impact of the restrictions on the movement of 
goods and people indicates that, from as early as some point in 2007, Israel had already 
determined its view about what constitutes attacking the supporting infrastructure, and it appears 
to encompass effectively the population of Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1212. A statement of objectives that explicitly admits the intentional targeting of civilian objects 
as part of the Israeli strategy is attributed to the Deputy Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Dan Harel. 
While the Israeli military operations in Gaza were under way, Maj. Gen. Harel was reported as 
saying, in a meeting with local authorities in southern Israel:  
</p>
<p>This operation is different from previous ones. We have set a high goal which we 
are aiming for. We are hitting not only terrorists and launchers, but also the whole <i>Hamas</i> 
government and all its wings. [&#8230;] We are hitting government buildings, production 
factories, security wings and more. We are demanding governmental responsibility from 
Hamas and are not making distinctions between the various wings. After this operation 
there will not be one Hamas building left standing in Gaza, and we plan to change the 
rules of the game.<b>593</b>   
</p>
<p><b>E. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1213. The Israeli military conception of what was necessary in a future war with Hamas seems 
to have been developed from at least the time of the 2006 conflict in southern Lebanon. It finds 
its origin in a military doctrine that views disproportionate destruction and creating maximum

 <p> 
disruption in the lives of many people as a legitimate means to achieve military and political 
goals. 
</p>
<p>1214. Through its overly broad framing of the &#8220;supporting infrastructure&#8221;, the Israeli armed 
forces have sought to construct a scope for their activities that, in the Mission&#8217;s view, was 
designed to have inevitably dire consequences for the non-combatants in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>1215. Statements by political and military leaders prior to and during the military operations in 
Gaza leave little doubt that disproportionate destruction and violence against civilians were part 
of a deliberate policy.<b>594</b>  
</p>
<p>1216. To the extent to which statements such as that of Mr. Yishai on 2 February 2009 indicate 
that the destruction of civilian objects, homes in that case, would be justified as a response to 
rocket attacks (&#8220;destroy 100 homes for every rocket fired&#8221;), the Mission is of the view that 
reprisals against civilians in armed hostilities are contrary to international humanitarian law.<b>595</b> 
Even if such actions could be considered a lawful reprisal, they do not meet the stringent 
conditions imposed, in particular they are disproportionate,<b>596</b> and violate fundamental human 
rights and obligations of a humanitarian character.<b>597</b> One party's targeting of civilians or civilian 
areas can never justify the opposing party&#8217;s targeting of civilians and civilian objects, such as 
homes, public and religious buildings, or schools. 
</p>
<p><b>XVII. THE IMPACT OF THE BLOCKADE AND OF THE MILITARY 
OPERATIONS ON THE PEOPLE OF GAZA AND THEIR  
HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><i>&#8220;A military commander&#8217;s obligation does not end with avoiding harm to the lives and 
the dignity of the local residents, a &#8220;negative obligation&#8221;, but his obligation is also

of the time and place&#8230;.&#8221; Justice Barak (HCJ 764/04) 
</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;As long as Israel has control of the transfer of necessities and the supply of 
humanitarian needs to the Gaza Strip, it is bound by the obligations of international 
humanitarian law to allow the civilian population to have access, inter alia, to medical 
facilities, food and water, as well as additional humanitarian items&#8221;.

<p>1217. During its visits to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and its meetings and hearings in 
Gaza, Amman, Geneva and other places, the Mission saw for itself and received reports and 
                                                 
<b>594</b> Highlighting the pattern of military actions targeting civilian shelters and shelter seekers, the Habitat 
International Coalition concludes: &#8220;The official statements that accompany these actions [&#8230;] seem to reflect a

the attackers&#8217; preferred outcome: defeat of resistance&#8221; (submission, cited, p. 40).

 <p> 
testimonies about the negative effects that the severe restrictions on the movement of goods and 
people from and to the Gaza Strip had caused to the full enjoyment of a range of social, 
economic and civil rights by women, men and children. These reports and testimonies come 
from a variety of sources, including businesspeople, industry owners, ordinary residents, public 
officials and NGOs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and abroad. 
</p>
<p>1218. People in Gaza, as in other parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, have been living 
under foreign occupation for decades and enduring the restrictions and other effects of the 
policies implemented by the occupying Power. While the start of the blockade and the most 
recent military operations have undoubtedly added to those restrictions and scarcities, people in 
Gaza have not been living in what can be called a &#8220;normal&#8221; situation for a long time.  
</p>
<p>1219. The restrictions imposed by Israel on the imports to and exports from the Gaza Strip 
through the border crossings as well as the naval and airspace blockade have had a severe impact 
on the availability and accessibility of a whole range of goods and services necessary for the 
people of Gaza to enjoy their human rights. Their already eroded ability to access and buy basic 
goods was compounded by the effects of the four-week Israeli military campaign, which further 
restricted access to those essential items and destroyed goods, land, facilities and infrastructure 
vital for the enjoyment of their fundamental rights. In conjunction, the blockade and the military 
hostilities have created a situation in which most people are destitute. Women and children have 
been particularly affected. The current situation has been described as a crisis of human 
dignity.<b>598</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. The economy, livelihoods and employment 
</b></p>
<p>1220. The Mission received information about the state of the economy, employment and family 
livelihoods in the Gaza Strip. Before the December-January military operations, the Gaza 
economy was already in dire straights, with few business sectors able to operate at full capacity. 
The blockade restricted or denied entry to a range of items and energy necessary for the 
economy to function. These included fuel and industrial diesel for the Gaza power plant to 
produce enough electricity for factories and businesses to function and for agricultural activities 
to continue on a regular basis. The net result was a stalled economy, with many businesses, 
factories and farms either closed or operating at reduced capacity.  
</p>
<p>1221. Electricity was purchased directly from Israel (51 per cent) and Egypt (7 per cent), while 
the Gaza power plant produced only 34 per cent, leaving an 8 per cent electricity deficit. 
Following additional cuts by Israel in the supply of industrial fuel, the Gaza power plant further 
reduced its output. The shortage of fuel caused the plant to malfunction, while the lack of spare 
parts and maintenance is likely to damage the plant in the long term.<b>599</b> According to OCHA, the 
electricity shortfall in the Gaza Strip was 41 per cent by 15 December 2008. Cooking gas was 
also restricted although less drastically. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1222. Raw materials, equipment, spare parts and other inputs necessary for industrial and 
agricultural activity were not allowed into the Gaza Strip either.  
</p>
<p>1223. The consequences for day-to-day life were considerable. Some areas of the Gaza Strip 
were left without electricity for several hours a week, many households, especially those in 
buildings that depend on the use of water pumps, had access to water only a few hours a week. 
Intermittent electricity supply damaged medical equipment in hospitals and doctors&#8217; practices, 
and generally disrupted civilian life. The operation of sewage treatment facilities was also 
reduced and increased quantities of untreated sewage were dumped into the sea, causing public 
health risks and pollution, which in turn affected fishing. 
</p>
<p>1224. Several companies closed or cut back their operations, laying off employees, who 
consequently lost their livelihoods. Information provided to the Mission covering June 2007 to 
July 2008 showed that 98 per cent of industries were temporarily shut down and five 
establishments were relocated to the West Bank and Jordan. Around 16,000 workers were laid 
off. The ban on all exports caused losses for the agricultural sector estimated at US$ 30 million 
up until July 2008 and 40,000 jobs lost. Similarly, the construction sector endured severe losses 
resulting from the halt in development projects and other construction projects owing to the 
absence of construction materials. Some 42,000 workers were reported to have lost their jobs as 
a result.<b>600</b> Those who were laid off searched for employment in other sectors, such as 
agriculture, or joined the ranks of those who live on food assistance from the United Nations and 
aid agencies. 
</p>
<p>1225. As a result of the closure of the crossings to the transit of people, many families also lost 
the financial support they had from relatives, usually the male head of the family, who used to 
work abroad, either in Israel or in neighbouring Arab countries.<b>601</b> In its submission to the 
Mission, UNCTAD stated that 15.4 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s labour force was employed in Israel by 
2000.<b>602</b> In his presentation to the Mission, the economist Shir Hever explained that by 2009 no 
one from Gaza could find work in Israel. Even Palestinian workers from the West Bank mostly 
work in industrial zones in settlements rather than in Israel.<b>603</b> 
</p>
<p>1226. By December 2008 the destructive impact of the blockade on the local economy had 
doubled unemployment levels. While in 2007 79 per cent of households lived below the official 
poverty line (US$ 4 per capita/day) and some 70 per cent below the deep poverty line (US$ 3 per 
capita/day), these figures were expected to increase by the end of 2008 &#8211; even before the Israeli 
military operations. The Mission received information from organizations explaining how the 
agricultural sector had traditionally absorbed unemployed workers from other sectors, but in the 
circumstances imposed by the blockade, without fertilizers, pesticides, machinery, spare parts

 <p> 
and, crucially, without access to markets, it could no longer fulfil the role of shock absorber.<b>604</b> 
In its submission to the Mission, UNCTAD noted that when the industrial and agricultural 
sectors lost their capacity to provide jobs, public administration and services absorbed up to 
54 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s labour force (up from 37 per cent in 1999). UNCTAD concluded:  
</p>
<p>The ultimate impact of this momentum is the systematic erosion of the Palestinian 
productive base to deprive them from the ability to produce and feed themselves, and turn 
them into poor consumers of essential goods imported mainly from Israel and financed 
mainly by donors. 
</p>
<p>1227. The military operations destroyed a substantial part of the Gaza Strip&#8217;s economic 
infrastructure and its capacity to support decent livelihoods for families. Many factories and 
businesses were directly targeted and destroyed or damaged. Poverty, unemployment and food 
insecurity increased dramatically. 
</p>
<p>1228. Information provided to the Mission showed that some 700 private (industry and trade) 
businesses were damaged or destroyed during the military operations, with direct losses totalling 
approximately US$ 140 million. The industrial sector appeared the most affected, as it suffered 
61 per cent of those losses, in particular in the sub-sectors of construction and food.<b>605</b> Because 
of the extent and gravity of the destruction inflicted on the industrial sector, businesspeople and 
industrialists who spoke to the Mission stated their belief that Israel had as one of its military 
objectives the destruction of local industrial capacity so as to harm the prospects for an economic 
recovery in the Gaza Strip.<b>606</b> 
</p>
<p>1229. The severe restrictions on the availability of banknotes imposed by Israel caused serious 
disruptions in economic transactions and affected the ability of the public sector and the non-
governmental sector to carry out operations such as contracting or procuring goods and services. 
</p>
<p>1230. The agricultural sector, including crop farming, fisheries, livestock farming and poultry 
farming, suffered direct losses worth some US$ 170 million. Indirect losses have still to be 
definitively calculated. One business organization estimates that 60 per cent of all agricultural 
land had been destroyed,  40 per cent directly during the military operations.<b>607</b> Moreover, 17 per 
cent of all orchards, 8.3 per cent of livestock, 2.6 per cent of poultry, 18.1 per cent of hatcheries, 
25.6 per cent of beehives, 9.2 per cent of open fields and 13 per cent of groundwater wells were 
destroyed. Agriculture had already lost a third of its capacity since the start of the second intifada 
and the frequent Israeli incursions, according to NGO estimates used by UNDP-Gaza.<b>608</b> Parts of

the land were reportedly contaminated by unexploded munitions and chemical weapons residues 
(e.g. white phosphorous) and would need to be tested and cleared before agricultural activity 
could resume.<b>609</b> Some 250 agricultural wells were reportedly destroyed or severely damaged. 
</p>
<p>1231. Fishing that provided direct employment to some 3,000 people was also affected by the 
blockade and the military operations. Several boats and some fishermen were directly hit. The 
Mission met representatives of fishermen&#8217;s associations and a fisherman testified at the public 
hearings in Gaza.<b>610</b> One fisherman interviewed by the Mission explained that he had previously 
owned a fishing boat, mainly to fish sardines. It was hit by shelling as it was moored beside the 
civil defence buildings that were hit by air strikes on 27 December. Half of it was destroyed. 
Another small boat was also destroyed as were the nets. The family house was also destroyed 
and he had been out of work since the beginning of the military operations in December. 
However, his fishing activities had already been affected before the operations, when the 
Government of Israel had imposed a limit of six nautical miles  for fishing, and then further 
reduced it to only three.<b>611</b> 
</p>
<p>1232. The continuation of the blockade does not permit the reconstruction of the economic 
infrastructure that was destroyed. Not only do construction materials continue to be banned but 
the provision of energy is also still insufficient and irregular. Local purchasing capacity being 
shattered, there is not enough market demand for many products.  
</p>
<p>1233. Exports also continue to be prohibited, with the exception of some truckloads of flowers 
that crossed the borders between January and March 2009. Without external markets, local 
production of all kinds has no prospect and so employment and livelihoods will remain 
precarious and diminished. A strawberry farmer and the Head of the Association of Strawberry 
Farmers based in Beit Lahia explained that before the military operations he used to export up to 
2,000 tons of strawberries to Europe. Hundreds of <i>donums</i> of land were destroyed during the 
operations as well as some 300 greenhouses and 2,000 acres of citrus trees. As a result, they  had 
lost the European market for their products.<b>612</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Food and nutrition 
</b></p>
<p>1234. The availability of food in the Gaza Strip is determined by the amount imported through 
the crossings and that which is locally produced. The Mission received credible information 
indicating that during the months preceding the military operations both sources of food suffered 
from the severe restrictions imposed by Israel. 
</p>
<p>1235. The closing of the Karni grain conveyor belt, the only mechanism for importing wheat, 
during part of December, resulted in the depletion of wheat stocks, forcing the six mills in the 
Gaza Strip to close down or reduce operations. The el-Bader flour mill appeared to be the only

one that kept working as its owners had kept a good stock of grain, but it was later bombed and 
destroyed (see chap. XIII). However, about one third of the previous number of truckloads of 
wheat continued entering through the Kerem Shalom crossing. The blockade was tightened 
following the confrontations of November 2008, further restricting United Nations food 
assistance. On 18 December, UNRWA was compelled to halt its food distribution programme to 
thousands of families because its stocks were depleted. It also had to downsize its cash-for-work 
programmes as it ran out of banknotes.

<p>1236. By December 2008 food insecurity was on the rise. Food security is the capacity of each 
individual to have access to sufficient and adequate food at all times. The Mission received 
information indicating that rising food insecurity was the result falling income levels, eroded 
livelihoods and higher food prices. Some food items were also unavailable in the local markets. 
Consequently, the average Gazan household was spending two thirds of its income on food.<b>613</b> 
People had to reduce the quantity and the quality of food they ate, shifting a diet based on 
low-cost and high-energy cereals, sugar and oil.  
</p>
<p>1237. Changes in diet patterns are likely to prejudice the long-term health and nutrition of the 
population. According to the WHO office in Gaza, there are indications of chronic micronutrient 
deficiencies among the population, in particular among children. Among the most worrying 
indicators is the high prevalence of stunting among 6- to 16-year-old children (7.2 per cent), 
while the prevalence of thinness among that group was 3.4 per cent for 2008 (the WHO standard 
is 5 per cent). Levels of anaemia are alarming: 66 per cent on average among 9- to 12-month-old 
babies (the rate being higher for girls (69 per cent)). On average, 35 per cent of pregnant women 
suffer from anaemia.<b>614</b> 
</p>
<p>1238. During the military operations the availability and quality of fresh food dropped: local 
production was suspended during the fighting and local produce was spoilt. Mr. Muhammad 
Husein al-Atar, Mayor of al-Atatra, told the Mission how agricultural land in his neighbourhood 
was razed. The area is close to the Israeli border and 95 per cent of the work is farming-related. 
Israeli military incursions had been happening since 2000 accompanied by destruction and 
bulldozing. As a result, 50,000 acres of land had not a single tree left standing and between 
10 and 15 farmers had been killed every year during the last nine years. During the December &#8211; 
January military operations the area was bombed from the air, land and sea. He had personally 
lost three (industrial) refrigerators, each capable of holding 600 tons of vegetables, for instance. 
His sister&#8217;s chicken farms were also destroyed, including some 70,000 chickens (see chap. 
XIII).<b>615</b>   
</p>
<p>1239. The destruction of land and greenhouses has an impact on the availability of fresh food 
in the Gaza Strip and, consequently, on the total supply of micronutrients to the population. 
Satellite imagery commissioned by the Mission shows that for the whole Gaza Strip an estimated 
187 greenhouse complexes were either destroyed or severely damaged, representing 
approximately 30.2 hectares. Of all the destroyed greenhouses 68.6 per cent were in the Gaza

 <p> 
and Gaza North Governorates; and 85.4 per cent were destroyed or damaged during the last 
week of the military operations. Satellite imagery also gives strong indications that tanks and/or 
heavy vehicles were likely to have been responsible for most of the damage.<b>616</b> 
</p>
<p>1240. Despite the increased quantities of food allowed into Gaza since the beginning of 
hostilities, representing between 60 and 80 per cent of all truckloads, wheat flour was in short 
supply. This was probably the result of the severe depletion of local stocks following the tighter 
restrictions during December. After the ceasefire was declared by the parties to the conflict, 
access to food remained problematic for most people many prices had risen and there was a lack 
of income and banknotes. It was reported that the military operations caused food insecurity to 
increase and affect up to 75 per cent of the population.<b>617</b>  
</p>
<p>1241. In a rapid assessment, FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) found that food 
availability was back to pre-military operations levels, but the supply of fresh food was likely 
to decrease in the immediate future due to the large-scale destruction. Prices continued to be 
very high and some items were prohibitively expensive (e.g. poultry, eggs and meat) and 
unaffordable. However, severe access problems persisted and were aggravated for a population 
whose income and livelihoods had been shattered, despite the food assistance provided by the 
United Nations and aid agencies.<b>618</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>1242. Figures about the overall damage to residential housing vary according to the source and 
time of the measurement as well as the methodology. The human rights NGO Al Mezan reports 
that a total 11,135 homes were partially or fully destroyed.<b>619</b> According to the human rights 
NGO Al-Dameer-Gaza, 2,011 civilian and cultural premises were destroyed, of which 1,404 
were houses that were completely demolished and 453 were partially destroyed or damaged.<b>620</b> A 
UNDP survey immediately after the end of military operations reported 3,354 houses completely 
destroyed and 11,112 partially damaged.<b>621</b> The destruction was more serious in the north, where 
65 per cent of houses were completely destroyed. As a result of the destruction, more than 
600 tons of rubble had to be removed, with the consequent costs and potential impact on the 
environment and public health. Information provided to the Mission showed that much of the 
construction in Gaza contained important amounts of asbestos, the particles of which had been or 
could be released into the air at the time of destruction or removal. The refugee population was 
concentrated in the north and the destruction of residential housing appeared to have particularly 
affected them.

 <p> 
</p><p>1243. The destruction or damage of their homes forced many people to flee and find shelter with 
relatives or agencies providing assistance, such as UNRWA. At the height of the military 
operations UNRWA was providing shelter to 50,896 displaced persons in 50 shelters. This 
number was estimated to be a fraction of those who had become homeless, most of whom found 
temporary shelter with relatives. The Mission was informed that this situation created extreme 
hardship for people who had to share already deteriorated and limited housing, sanitary and 
water facilities. It saw for itself people who were still living in tents some six months after the 
end of the operations.  
</p>
<p>1244. Children and women were particularly affected by the hardship caused by the destruction 
of homes and the displacement. Housing and Land Rights Network &#8211; Habitat International 
Coalition reported that &#8220;of those forced to seek shelter following the military damage or 
destruction of their home, over half were children. While female-headed households constitute 
only a relatively small percentage of the total affected families (7 per cent), their number in 
absolute terms, 763 such families, is significant.&#8221;<b>622</b> 
</p>
<p>1245. The impact of the destruction of housing is aggravated by the substantial destruction of 
the Gaza construction industry during the military operations. In chapter XIII, the Mission 
described the destruction of the Atta Abu Jubbah cement-packaging plant, which formed a 
significant part of the construction materials industry in Gaza. The Mission also noted reports 
regarding the destruction of 19 producing plants (representing 85 per cent of the production 
capacity of the Gaza factories of ready-mix concrete). External supplies of concrete and other 
building materials into Gaza are entirely controlled by Israel, which has banned imports of 
cement into Gaza. The thousands of families who have lost their shelter as a result of the military 
operations are therefore prevented by the blockade imposed by Israel from rebuilding their 
homes. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>1246. The Mission received submissions, testimonies and information about the effects of the 
blockade and of the military operations on the supply of and access to water and sanitation 
facilities by the population of the Gaza Strip.<b>623</b> During the months preceding the military 
operations the water and sanitation sectors were already under severe strain. The lack of 
construction materials, pipes and spare parts had prevented the building of additional 
infrastructure and the proper maintenance of existing facilities. Desalinization plants and works 
to preserve the aquifer had to be postponed. By December 2008, OCHA reported that the 
degradation of the system &#8220;is posing a major public health hazard&#8221;.<b>624</b> Frequent power outages, 
fuel shortages and a lack of spare parts for electricity generators had also affected the functioning 
of the water and sanitation systems.

 <p> 
</p><p>1247. By December 2008, it was reported that some 80 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s water wells were only 
partially functioning while the others were not functioning at all. This situation had already 
affected the population&#8217;s access to water: over half of the residents of Gaza City had access to 
running water few hours a week, with those living in houses and buildings using water pumps 
spending many hours trying to get water by other means. Of the water supplied in Gaza 80 per 
cent did not meet WHO standards for drinking water owing to, among other factors, the shortage 
of chlorine to purify the water. Important health risks were consequently likely to arise. Other 
health hazards were expected to arise from the practice of discharging untreated or partially 
treated wastewater into the sea. More than 70 million litres a day were discharged into the sea, 
creating significant environmental damage and health risks for human beings and marine life. 
</p>
<p>1248. As with other sectors, the military operations worsened the situation in the water and 
sanitation sector. Services and infrastructure already partially paralysed or in serious need of 
maintenance suffered further destruction or damage. The Gaza wastewater treatment plant was 
hit sometime between 3 and 10 January and one of its lagoons was severely damaged (see 
chap. XIII). Sewage pipes leading to the plant and others in different parts of the city were hit or 
damaged. Up to 11 water wells that supplied water for human consumption were hit and 
3 completely destroyed.<b>625</b> Thousands of metres of water and sewage pipes/networks were 
destroyed or damaged and around 5,700 rooftop water tanks destroyed and some 2,900 damaged. 
</p>
<p>1249. By the end of January only 70 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s water wells were working, either 
whether fully or partially, i.e. 10 per cent less than before the hostilities. At the height of the 
military operations some 500,000 Palestinians did not have access to running water at all, 
whereas the rest received water for few hours a week. Sanitation and water facilities in public 
shelters were overwhelmed, and raw sewage ran through fields and streets in some areas. The 
water authorities&#8217; reparations team were prevented from going to the sites to carry out urgent 
repairs and had to wait in most cases until Israeli troops had withdrawn. All urgent repairs were 
done on a provisional basis given the lack or shortage of construction materials and equipment. 
The Mission witnessed how precarious those repairs could be when it saw one sewage pipe in 
the vicinity of the Gaza wastewater treatment plant explode during a site visit. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Environment</b> 
</p>
<p>1250. The Mission has received comments and concerns from non-governmental organizations 
and concerned individuals in Gaza relating to threatened environmental damage by reason of 
munitions or debris from munitions. These concerns relate to the fear that hazardous material 
might have remained or will remain in the soil and water of parts of the Gaza Strip for indefinite 
periods of time and could enter the food chain or otherwise be hazardous to life. 
</p>
<p>1251. The Mission was unable to further investigate these concerns, but is aware of an 
environmental impact study being undertaken by the United Nations Environmental Programme 
(UNEP) in the Gaza Strip.  Preliminary results from UNEP indicate that the environment in the 
Gaza Strip has been seriously impacted by the Israeli military operations of December-January. 
</p>

<b>625</b> &#8220;Damage assessment report&#8230;&#8221;. Al Mezan reports that 112 wells were destroyed but it clarifies that this figure 
includes agricultural wells; COHRE submission to the Mission. </p>

 <p> 
In particular, the groundwater in Gaza show high nitrate levels exceeding WHO ceilings, putting 
infants at risk of nitrate poisoning.  
</p>
<p><b>F. Physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>1252. The capacity of the health sector in the Gaza Strip was already diminished by the 
blockade when the Israeli offensive started. While hospitals and clinics continued operating, the 
quality of their service and its accessibility were eroded. The insufficient and erratic supply of 
electricity caused equipment to malfunction even when the staff had recourse to generators. 
Power cuts and water impurities damaged equipment and created additional health hazards. The 
lack of maintenance and spare parts that were blocked at the crossings further compounded the 
situation. In addition, the lack of construction materials and inputs hampered the development of 
additional facilities and needed infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>1253. Reported confrontation between the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Gaza 
authorities also affected the quantity and quality of the service provided. The Ministry of Health 
in Ramallah had been responsible for the supply of medicines to Gaza since September 2008, but 
it was reported that few trucks with medicines actually reached the Gaza Strip after that time 
resulting in serious availability problems for some 20 per cent of essential medicines. The 
referral of patients needing specialized treatment abroad (e.g. in Israel, Jordan and Egypt) was 
also affected by the blockade established in 2007. Before that date only some 9 per cent of 
patients intending to cross the border were rejected or their permits delayed, but that proportion 
had reached some 22 per cent by September 2008.<b>626</b> 
</p>
<p>1254. The beleaguered health sector was subjected to severe strain when the military operations 
started on 28 December. Hospitals and health centres of the Ministry of Health worked on an 
emergency basis under extremely difficult conditions and with limited resources. They 
nevertheless responded effectively to the crisis. Urgent medical interventions to treat critical 
injuries were performed under severe circumstances. Of the 5,380 injured people reported by the 
Ministry, 40 per cent were admitted to the main hospitals, but because of the policy of 
discharging patients as soon as feasible to free up beds and staff, there were concerns that some 
injuries (e.g. burns and acute surgical conditions) might have led to complications as follow-up 
care may have been inadequate. Some injuries will result in permanent disability (see also 
section G below). 
</p>
<p>1255. Medical facilities and personnel were targeted during the fighting. Seventeen health 
personnel were killed and 26 injured. In total, 29 ambulances were damaged or destroyed by 
bombs or crushed by armoured vehicles, while 48 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s 122 health facilities were 
either directly or indirectly hit by shelling. Medical relief and rescue were in many cases also 
intentionally hindered. 
</p>
<p>1256. OCHA reported that medical supplies, including drugs and equipment, were allowed into 
the Gaza Strip in larger quantities during January in the midst of the fighting. However, logistical 
difficulties and the fact that many medicines had a very short expiration date prevented the 
health staff from using the increased quantities for the benefit of patients. Finally, the situation of 
                                                 
<b>626</b> WHO Report&#8230;.; &#8220;Gaza humanitarian situation report: the impact&#8230;&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
patients with chronic health conditions, su<b>c</b>h as heart and kidney problems, became a concern 
because patients with critical life-threatening injuries requiring urgent attention were given 
priority.<b>627</b> 
</p>
<p>1257. The destruction of sewage treatment facilities and pipes together with the lack of 
purifying materials had consequences for public health. Thousands of litres of untreated sewage 
dumped in fields or in the sea created a potential health hazard. The Mission received 
information about recent epidemiological tests of water samples. The samples had been collected 
from all water networks and wells, especially from areas targeted during the military operations, 
to investigate the presence of microbiological pollutants. Information on water-related diarrhoea 
among children under age 3 attending UNRWA facilities was collected weekly in January and 
February 2009. The analyses showed an increase of 18 per cent between 19 January and 8 
February. Moreover, 14 per cent of the water samples collected in February were polluted with 
microbiological pollutants. The increase in diarrhoeal disease was also confirmed to have 
occurred in the areas where the water had been contaminated.<b>628</b> 
</p>
<p>1258. WHO also cited the preliminary results from UNEP initial sampling in Gaza, which 
showed that &#8220;much of the rubble is contaminated with asbestos; damage to the waste treatment 
system had contaminated the aquifer; the health waste handling system had completely broken 
down, with such waste going into domestic waste. The results on heavy metal contamination are 
so far inconclusive.&#8221;<b>629</b> The Mission also investigated and confirmed allegations about the use of 
weapons whose potential long-term impact on individual victims&#8217; health raises concern. They 
include allegations of the use of weapons containing chemical pollutants such as tungsten and 
white phosphorus (see also chapter XII).<b>630</b>  
</p>
<p>1259. Conditions under Israeli occupation prior to 2005, together with poverty and the 
difficulties caused by the blockade, had already made a deep impact on the mental health of the 
local population. The three weeks of intense bombardment and military ground action added 
new, serious psychological traumas, especially noticeable in children. According to Dr. Iyad 
al Sarraj of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, over 20 per cent of Palestinian 
children in Gaza suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders, the symptoms of which &#8220;will appear 
over the days, months, years, or decades to come&#8221;.<b>631</b>  
</p>
<p>1260. One particular characteristic of the conflict, namely that the population could not flee the 
conflict areas as can be done in many conflicts, and had no shelters or safe places in which to 
hide or protect themselves, reinforced feelings of being trapped, defenceless and vulnerable to 
more attacks with a sense of inevitability.<b>632</b> Many of those who met the Mission stated that they 
felt terrorized.

 <p> 
1261. According to Dr. Ahmad Abu Tawahina, psychosomatic disorders have a particularly 
serious impact on Palestinian society, where social stigma is often associated with mental 
suffering. In general, this makes it difficult for people to express psychological problems. This 
condition is frequently experienced in the form of recurrent psychosomatic symptoms, such as 
migraines, pains in joints and muscles, general fatigue and the inability to do even normal daily 
activities. Most of these patients are referred not to mental health practitioners, but to general 
physicians, who prescribe drugs to alleviate the symptoms and not the causes. This in turn has 
given rise to a serious problem of drug dependency.<b>633</b>  
</p>
<p>1262. The sense of security that comes from living in a supportive and safe environment had 
already been eroded over the years by constant attacks and military confrontation, but was 
further undermined by the direct experience and/or witnessing of violence against relatives. The 
widespread destruction, the displacement, the inability to find a safe place anywhere, together 
with the direct exposure to life-threatening events will continue to have a serious impact on the 
population. The general state of the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip was described as a form of 
alienation.<b>634</b> 
</p>
<p>1263. Many of the mental health problems are the result of years of conflict, living in poverty, 
scarcity and instability in the area and will probably continue until the root causes are eliminated. 
People, in particular children, live or grow up in a society under occupation, with constant 
episodes of violence and no sense of security or normalcy.  
</p>
<p>1264. The situation is compounded by the relative scarcity of qualified professionals and 
inadequate facilities. The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme has only about 40 
members of staff specialized in mental health, including physicians, social researchers, nurses, as 
well as psychologists. According to Dr. al-Sarraj, this number is not sufficient to cover even the 
needs of Gaza City district, whereas for the entire population of the Gaza Strip a team of 
300 specialists would be necessary.<b>635</b> 
</p>
<p>1265. Over the past two decades, the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme and others 
have worked to build resilience in people. They told the Mission that the recent military 
operations had wiped out their achievements. People suffering severe loss also detach themselves 
from reality, in a phenomenon called &#8220;numbness&#8221;. According to Dr. Tawahina, the general 
feeling among most people in Gaza is that they have been completely abandoned by the 
international community. This feeling of abandonment in turn increases their frustration, creating 
additional pain, and leads eventually to more violence and extremism. The Gaza Community 
Mental Health Programme studied children&#8217;s attitudes towards violence and found that, as a 
result of this situation, and especially when children had lost their parents and with them the

 <p> 
associated protection and sense of security, they tended to look at &#8220;martyrs&#8221; and members of 
armed groups as adult role models instead.<b>636</b> 
</p>
<p>1266. A study conducted by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) 
revealed that men also showed more symptoms of psychological trauma after the December-
January military operations. Based on specialists&#8217; reports, the Mission is of the view that this 
could in part be due to the additional stress that men face as heads of families in a male-
dominated society when they are unable to fulfil their role as main breadwinners or to provide 
protection and security to their children, wives and other family members.<b>637</b> 
</p>
<p>1267. Based on previous experiences with emergenc<b>i</b>es, WHO expects the number of people 
with serious mental health disorders to increase by an average of 1 per cent above the baseline 
and with mild to moderate disorders by 5 to 10 per cent &#8220;provided that a protective environment 
is restored&#8221;.<b>638</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G. Education 
</b></p>
<p>1268. The Mission received information about the state of the education sector in the Gaza Strip. 
UNRWA operates one of the largest school systems in the Middle East and has been the main 
provider of basic education to Palestine refugees for nearly five decades. The Mission was 
greatly impressed by its activities and achievements. UNRWA runs 221 schools, while the 
Government runs 383. UNRWA schools are also a vehicle for health-monitoring and 
food/nutritional programmes. That Palestinians have high levels of education is largely the result 
of that work. By the same token, the Mission was shocked to learn how badly educational 
facilities and activities in the Gaza Strip have been affected as a result of the blockade and the 
recent military operations. 
</p>
<p>1269. Information and testimonies received by the Mission showed that the education system 
was affected in several ways by the restrictions imposed by the blockade. The lack of 
construction materials had halted all new construction. Repairs to the educational infrastructure 
also had to be postponed. Around 88 per cent of UNRWA schools and 82 per cent of 
Government schools operated on a shift system to cope with the demand. The lack of educational 
material and equipment hampered the ability to maintain teaching standards. This situation was 
causing a decline in attendance and performance at governmental schools.<b>639</b> 
</p>
<p>1270. The ban on the movement of people through the crossings affected not only university 
students planning to study or already undertaking studies abroad, but also the possibilities for 
academics and scholars to travel abroad on academic exchanges. Between July and September 
2008 only 70 students managed to leave the Gaza Strip via Erez but hundreds saw their 
aspirations to study abroad truncated.

 <p> 
</p><p>1271. The military operations destroyed or damaged at least 280 schools and kindergartens. Six 
of them were located in northern Gaza, affecting some 9,000 pupils, who had to be relocated. 
According to the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, 164 pupils and 12 teachers were 
killed during the military operations. Another 454 pupils and five teachers were injured. At 
UNRWA schools, 86 children and three teachers were killed, and 402 children and 14 teachers 
injured. During the military operations, 44 UNRWA schools were used as emergency shelters to 
cope with the more than 50,000 displaced individuals. 
</p>
<p>1272. Schools were generally closed for the duration of the hostilities, disrupting the study 
programme. After the ceasefire it was unclear how many students and teachers returned to 
schools but that number was reported to reach up to 90 per cent in UNRWA schools.<b>640</b> Children 
and teachers reported situations of anxiety and trauma as a result of the extreme violence to 
which they had been exposed and the loss of relatives or friends. The Mission heard that the start 
of the military operations with air strikes at a time when schools were functioning exposed 
children to a heightened risk and filled them with fear and panic. Schools and the roads towards 
them occasionally remained unsafe because of the presence of explosive remnants of war. Two 
Palestinian children were killed by those explosives in Zeytoun shortly after the ceasefire was 
declared. The Mission heard reports that some children were injured by white phosphorus on 
their way to school. 
</p>
<p>1273. The Mission saw the destruction caused to the American School. It also saw the 
destruction caused at the Islamic University and in other university buildings that were destroyed 
or damaged. These were civilian, educational buildings and the Mission did not find any 
information about their use as a military facility or their contribution to a military effort that 
might have made them a legitimate target in the eyes of the Israeli armed forces. 
</p>
<p>1274. The Mission was also informed of indoctrination programmes allegedly introduced by the 
Gaza authorities, and of a process of ideological and political polarization. Such programmes 
have a high potential for imposing models of education at odds with human rights values and 
with a culture of peace and tolerance. In this regard, the Mission believes that efforts to 
incorporate human rights in the curricula should be encouraged by the relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>H. Impact on women and children 
</b></p>
<p>1275. The attention of the Mission was drawn to the particular manner in which children and 
women had been affected by the blockade policies and the military operations. In its report, 
WHO took figures from PCHR: out of 1,417 persons killed, 313 were children and 116 women. 
It also takes figures from the Israeli armed forces that showed that 1,166 were killed, of whom 
49 were women and 89 were under 16.<b>641</b> Among the 5,380 injured, 1,872 were children and 
800 women.<b>642</b> The Mission directly investigated many incidents in which women and children 
had been killed as a result of deliberate or indiscriminate attacks by the Israeli armed forces.<b>643</b>

<b>643</b> See chapters VII, X, XI and XIV.  </p>

 <p> 
WHO also reported that among the many injured people who crossed the Rafah border and were 
accepted for medical treatment in Egypt during the second week of the military operations there 
were 10 children showing a single bullet injury to the head and one with two. 
</p>
<p>1276. The Mission held interviews with a number of women and representatives of women&#8217;s 
organizations and heard the testimony of Mariam Zaqout of the Culture and Free Thought 
Association.<b>644</b> It heard that the blockade and the military operations had aggravated poverty, 
which particularly affected women, who must find food and other essentials for their families. 
Women were often the sole breadwinners (for instance, if male family members had died or been 
injured as a result of conflict or violence, or were imprisoned) but jobs were hard to come by. 
Over 300 women had been widowed as a result of the military operations and had become 
dependent on food and income assistance. In addition, women bore a greater social burden, 
having to deal with daily life made harsher by the crisis and, at the same time, provide security 
and care for injured family members and children, their own and others who have lost their 
parents. These responsibilities sometimes compelled them to conceal their own sufferings, so 
their concerns remained unaddressed. 
</p>
<p>1277. In the same interviews, the participants stated that women were particularly affected by 
the destruction of homes and the invasion of privacy. Having to live in tents without privacy or 
appropriate sanitary facilities added to their hardship. Moreover, the military operations had 
strained relations among family members. Psychological pressures on men and women, together 
with financial difficulties, led to family disputes, family violence and divorce. There were 
frequent disputes between widows and their in-laws regarding child custody and inheritance. 
Widows were also under increased pressure to get married again to be able to sustain themselves. 
Consequently, there was an increase in women seeking legal aid, as legal problems tended to 
become aggravated because of shortcomings in the law and fewer safeguards for the rights of 
women.<b>645</b> 
</p>
<p>1278. The particular manner in which the conflict affected women was dramatically illustrated 
for the Mission by the testimony of a woman of the al-Samouni family (see chap. XI). She had 
three children and was pregnant when her family and her house came under attack. She 
commented on how the children were scared and crying. She was distressed when recounting 
how her 10-month-old baby, whom she was carrying in her arms, was hungry but she did not 
have anything to give him to eat, and how she tried to feed him by chewing on a piece of bread, 
the only food available, and giving it to him. She also managed to get half a cup of water from an 
ill functioning tap. There were other babies and older children. She and her sister exposed 
themselves to danger by going out to search for food for them. Her husband, mother and sister 
were killed but she managed to survive. Her other son was wounded in the back, and she carried 
both out of the house.<b>646</b>  
</p>
<p>1279. Many women felt helpless and embarrassed at not being able to protect and care for their 
children. Others felt frustrated, invaded in their personal space and powerless when their houses

and possessions were destroyed or vandalized. Those feelings contributed to their psychological 
suffering.<b>647</b>  
</p>
<p>1280. A UNFPA study conducted immediately after the December-January military operations 
reported a 40 per cent increase in miscarriages admitted to maternity wards, a 50 per cent 
increase in neonatal deaths, a rise in obstetric complications and anecdotal evidence of deaths or 
health complications because  pregnant women were unable to reach hospital to deliver their 
babies.<b>648</b> Women interviewed in the context of another UNFPA study expressed extreme fears 
for themselves and their loved ones. Associated symptoms included anxiety, panic attacks, 
feelings of insecurity, disturbed sleep and eating patterns, depression, sadness and fear of sudden 
death.<b>649</b> 
</p>
<p>1281. Adults and children showed signs of profound depression, while children suffered from 
insomnia and bed-wetting. Numerous testimonies received by the Mission highlight the presence 
of children in situations where houses were searched or occupied with force by Israeli soldiers, 
and when killings occurred.<b>650</b> The Mission heard the testimony of a mother whose children, 
aged 3 to 16, had witnessed the killing of their father in their own house. With Israeli soldiers 
forcefully questioning their mother and uncle and vandalizing their house, the children asked 
their mother whether they would be killed as well. Their mother felt the only comfort she could 
give them was to tell them to say the <i>Shehada</i>, the prayer recited in the face of death.<b>651</b> Children 
were present in improvised shelters on United Nations premises, enduring the trauma of 
displacement as well as feelings of fear from the military attacks and of deep insecurity from 
having been attacked in their own homes or in a shelter that was expected to be safe. During its 
visits, the Mission saw many children living with their families in the ruins of their homes and in 
makeshift accommodation. The trauma for children having witnessed violence and often the 
killing of their own family members will no doubt be long-lasting. Mrs. Massouda Sobhia 
al-Samouni told the Mission that her son was still traumatized. He kept placing coins in his 
mouth and when she told him it was dangerous and he might die if he did so, he replied that he 
wanted to join his father.

possessions. WHO estimated that some 30,000 children would need continued psychological 
support and warned of the potential for many to grow up with aggressive attitudes and hatred.<b>652</b>  
</p>
<p><b>I. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>1283. Information provided to the Mission showed that many of those who were injured during 
the Israeli military operations sustained permanent disabilities owing to the severity of their 
injuries and/or the lack of adequate and timely medical attention and rehabilitation. Gaza 
hospitals reportedly had to discharge patients too early so as to handle incoming emergencies. 
Other cases resulted in amputations or disfigurement. About 30 per cent of patients were 
expected to have long-term disabilities.<b>653</b> 
</p>
<p>1284. WHO reported that by mid-April 2009 the number of people with different types of 
permanent disability (e.g. brain injuries, amputations, spinal injuries, hearing deficiencies, 
mental health problems) as a result of the military operations was not yet known. It reported 
speculations that there might be some 1000 amputees; but information provided by the WHO 
office in Gaza and based on estimates by Handicap International indicated that around 
200 persons underwent amputations.<b>654</b>  
</p>
<p>1285. While the exact number of people who will suffer permanent disabilities is still unknown, 
the Mission understands that many persons who sustained traumatic injuries during the conflict 
still face the risk of permanent disability owing to complications and inadequate follow-up and 
physical rehabilitation.<b>655</b>  
</p>
<p>1286. The Mission also heard moving accounts of families with disabled relatives whose 
disability had slowed their evacuation from a dangerous area or who lived with a constant fear 
that, in an emergency, their families would have to leave them behind because it would be too 
difficult to evacuate them.  
</p>
<p>1287. One testimony concerned a person whose electric wheelchair was lost after his house was 
targeted and destroyed. Since the residents were given very short notice of the impending attack, 
the wheelchair could not be salvaged and the person had to be taken to safety on a plastic chair 
carried by four people. 
</p>
<p>1288. The Mission also heard a testimony concerning a pregnant woman who was instructed by 
an Israeli soldier to evacuate her home with her children, but to leave behind a mentally disabled 
child, which she refused to do.  
</p>
<p>1289. Even in the relative safety of shelters, people with disabilities continued to be exposed to 
additional hardship, as these shelters were not equipped for their special needs. The Mission 
heard of the case of a person with a hearing disability who was sheltering in an UNRWA school,

 <p> 
but was unable to communicate in sign language or understand what was happening and 
experienced sheer fear.  
</p>
<p>1290. Frequent disruptions in the power supply had a severe impact on the medical equipment 
needed by many people with disabilities. People using wheelchairs had to face additional hurdles 
when streets started piling up with the rubble from destroyed buildings and infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>1291. In addition, programmes for people with disabilities had to be closed down during the 
military operations and rehabilitation services stopped (for instance, organizations providing 
assistance were unable to access stocks of wheelchairs and other aids). Many social, educational, 
medical and psychological programmes have not yet fully resumed.<b>656</b> 
</p>
<p><b>J. Impact on humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>1292. The tightening of the blockade during the two months before the military operations 
entailed additional restrictions also for United Nations programmes and activities, in particular 
those of UNRWA, WFP and others that provide food and other forms of support. The Mission 
was informed that, as a result of the blockade and the Israeli limitations on the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance, the capacity of UNRWA to mitigate the effects of the military 
operations on the civilian population was reduced.<b>657</b> As stated above, just days before the Israeli 
military operations started, UNRWA had to suspend its food assistance programmes and scale 
down other programmes. 
</p>
<p>1293. But the impact of the blockade also extended to several humanitarian projects that had 
been planned or were in progress and had to be stopped and postponed. Most of them were in 
health, sanitation, water and education. 
</p>
<p>1294. During the military operations, UNRWA workers and trucks were also hit, resulting in 
deaths and injuries. The Board of Inquiry established by the United Nations Secretary-General 
investigated a number of incidents in which United Nations facilities were targeted and issued a 
report determining responsibilities.<b>658</b> The Mission is of the view that the factual findings made 
by the Board of Inquiry entail legal liability for those responsible (see below). 
</p>
<p>1295. The Mission learned that seven UNRWA staff members (none of them on duty), five job 
creation programme contractors (one on duty) and three contractors were killed; 21 other 
contractors were injured. In all, 57 UNRWA buildings were damaged by shelling or airstrikes, 
including 36 schools (six serving as emergency shelters), seven health centres, three sanitation 
offices, two warehouses and five other buildings. 
</p>
<p>1296. Thirty-five UNRWA vehicles, including three armoured vehicles, were damaged. From its 
remaining 321 vehicles, only 286 are operational and 7 are damaged beyond repair. 
</p>

<b>658</b> See Summary of the Report of the United Nations Headquarters Board of Inquiry.  </p>

 <p> 
1297. UNRWA informed the Mission that between 27 December and 19 January, 536 UNRWA 
trucks entered the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. By 21 January, 
394 trucks had entered through Karni and 2089 through Kerem Shalom (including private, 
humanitarian and UNRWA trucks). UNRWA considered these amounts to be insufficient to 
meet the humanitarian needs of the population of the Gaza Strip.<b>659</b>  
</p>
<p>1298. The Israeli Government stated that &#8220;from the commencement of the Gaza Operation and 
for its duration&#8221; a total of 1,511 trucks with supplies from Israel as well as diesel, cooking gas 
and other fuel were allowed into the Gaza Strip. It would appear that some 60 per cent of these 
supplies were foodstuffs. The Israeli Government states that (presumably during the same 
period) it also coordinated the passage of 706 trucks carrying donations from international 
organizations and various countries.<b>660</b> Information from UNRWA suggests that these quantities 
were irrelevant given the situation prevailing during the military operation and the local needs. 
For instance, although fuel for the power plant was let in, it was inadequate, forcing the power 
plant to shut down and causing 16-hour power cuts in some areas. Israel also reported allowing 
in 2,277,000 litres of diesel during the military operations, but according to UNRWA records 
only 199,400 litres were allowed in, while OCHA records suggest only 92,000 litres were 
allowed in, compared to 6,628,400<b> </b>litres in January 2007.<b>661</b> 
</p>
<p>1299. The Israeli Government also provided information about medical supplies that were 
brought into the Gaza Strip, but the figures are imprecise or incomplete as it was unclear what 
unit of measure was being used. In addition, many of the agencies listed were not actually 
bringing in medical supplies. For instance, its report lists that WFP brought in &#8220;3,611&#8221; medical 
supplies, but information made available to the Mission indicated that WFP was bringing in only 
flour and hygiene kits.  
</p>
<p><b>K. Legal analysis 
</b></p>
<p>1300. Obligations under international humanitarian law are relevant for the assessment of the 
facts described above. As mentioned earlier, the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as provisions 
of Additional Protocol I reflecting customary international law apply to the actions of Israel in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory before and during the military operations. The protections 
owed under international humanitarian law to the civilian population of the Gaza Strip by all 
parties to the conflict include the duty to allow the free passage of humanitarian medical 
supplies, as well as consignments of essential foodstuffs and clothing for children, pregnant 
women and mothers at the earliest opportunity (article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention). 
Article 70 of Additional Protocol I provides that parties to a conflict are obliged to allow the 
passage of articles that are essential for the civilian population, at the earliest opportunity and 
without delay. 
                                                 
<b>659</b> By 1 February UNRWA was providing food assistance to 900,000 registered Palestine refugees, 504,000 of them 
children, in the Gaza Strip. There are 1,048,125 refugees in the Gaza Strip (74 per cent of the population), see 
UNRWA, &#8220;Fact sheet: Consequences of the conflict in the Gaza Strip 27 December 2008- 18 January 2009&#8221;. 
<b>660</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 271. 
<b>661</b> OCHA also reported that in January 2009 no imports of petrol to Gaza were registered, compared to 
1,522,250 litres in January 2007; 915,310 kilograms of cooking gas was imported in January 2009, compared to 
5,238,030 in January 2007; and 3,760,400 litres of industrial diesel, compared to 8,370,290 in January 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1301. The relevant provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention relating to the duties of an 
occupying Power should also be taken into consideration, in particular the obligations contained 
in articles 50 (duty to facilitate the working of care and education institutions), 55 (duty to ensure 
food and medical supplies to the population), 56 (duty to ensure and maintain medical and 
hospital establishments and services), 59 (duty to agree on relief schemes if the occupied 
territory is not well supplied) and 60 (duty to continue performing obligations even if third 
parties provide relief consignments). Several provisions of Additional Protocol I reflecting 
customary international law are also relevant here, including articles 51 and 52, which prohibit 
attacks on civilians and on civilian objects, and article 54, which prohibits the destruction of 
objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>1302. Access to adequate food, shelter and clothing, as part of an adequate standard of living, 
are human rights recognized in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. The same instrument recognizes the rights to education and to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health (art. 12). The content of these rights and the 
corresponding State duties has been clarified by the United Nations Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child protects the child&#8217;s right 
to life, survival and development (art. 6) and to be protected from all forms of mental or physical 
violence (art. 19), to the highest standard of health (art. 24), to an adequate standard of living 
(art. 27) and to education (arts. 28 and 29). Although these instruments protect women and men, 
girls and boys alike, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women adds more specification and scope to those obligations with regard to women. All these 
human rights obligations are applicable to Israel with respect to its actions in the Gaza Strip 
since they apply also in situations of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>1303. Some rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights are subject to progressive realization. This means that they can be achieved only over 
time. States have an obligation to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards that 
goal. Deliberate retrogressive measures are permitted only under stringent conditions.<b>662</b> 
</p>
<p>1304. The Mission recalls in this regard its analysis of the Israeli objectives and strategies during 
the military operations in chapter XVI. There the Mission referred to statements made by Deputy 
Prime Minister Eli Yishai on 6 January 2009: &quot;It [should be] possible to destroy Gaza, so they 
will understand not to mess with us&#8221;. He added that &#8220;it is a great opportunity to demolish 
thousands of houses of all the terrorists, so they will think twice before they launch rockets&#8221;. The 
Mission also referred to the so-called Dahiya doctrine, which requires widespread destruction as 
a means of deterrence and seems to have been put into practice. These objectives and strategies 
should be kept in mind with regard to the following analysis. 
</p>
<p>1305. The Mission considers that the closure of or the restrictions imposed on border crossings 
by Israel in the immediate period before the military operations subjected the local population to 
extreme hardship and deprivations that are inconsistent with their protected status. The 
restrictions on the entry of foodstuffs, medical supplies, agricultural and industrial input, 
including industrial fuel, together with the restrictions on the use of land near the border and on 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>662</b> General comment No. 3 (1990), para 9. </p>

 <p> 
fishing in the sea have resulted in widespread poverty, increased dependence on food and other 
assistance, increased unemployment and economic paralysis. The Mission can conclude only that 
Israel has and continues to violate its obligations as an occupying Power under the Fourth 
Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p>1306. The Mission has given consideration to the argument put forward by the Israeli 
Government that the above policies and restrictions are being imposed as a form of sanction. 
However, such blanket sanctions are not permitted under international law. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has addressed economic sanctions and their effects on the 
enjoyment of economic and social rights, and held:  
</p>
<p>[&#8230;] whatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always take full account of the 
provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [and] 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;] it is essential to distinguish between the basic objective of applying political and 
economic pressure upon the governing elite of the country to persuade them to conform to 
international law, and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable 
groups within the targeted country.<b>663</b> 
</p>
<p>1307. In respect to the right to water, the Committee stated: &#8220;States parties should refrain at all 
times from imposing embargoes or similar measures that prevent the supply of water, as well as 
goods and services essential for securing the right to water.&#8221; Similar considerations apply to food 
and health services and goods.<b>664</b>  
</p>
<p>1308. The Mission also notes that reprisals and collective penalties are prohibited under 
international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>1309. The Mission has considered the question of military security. As serious as the situation 
that arises when rockets and mortars are fired on or near border crossings may be, the Mission 
considers that it does not justify a policy of collective punishment of the civilian population of 
the Gaza Strip. The Mission is aware of the Government of Israel&#8217;s declaration of the Gaza Strip 
as a &#8220;hostile territory&#8221;. Again, for the Mission, such a declaration does not relieve Israel of its 
obligations towards the civilian population of the Gaza Strip under international humanitarian 
law.  
</p>
<p>1310. Moreover, the Mission takes note that following the decision of the Supreme Court of 
Israel in what is known as the <i>Fuel and electricity</i> case,<b>665</b> Israel reconsidered its obligations 
relating to the amounts and types of humanitarian supplies that it allowed into the Gaza Strip to 
meet &#8220;vital humanitarian needs&#8221;. Whatever that somewhat vague standard may be, the Mission 
stresses that Israel is bound to ensure supplies to meet the humanitarian needs of the population, 
to the fullest extent possible. 
</p>

<b>665</b> Gaber et al. v. The Prime Minister, case No. 9132/07. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1311. In sum, the Mission restates its view that Israel has not fulfilled its duties as an occupying 
Power in relation to the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>1312. Again, reference is made to the blockade and Israel&#8217;s obligation to respect, protect, 
facilitate or provide, to the extent possible, for the enjoyment of the whole range of economic, 
social and cultural rights in the Gaza Strip. At the very least, Israel is &#8220;under an obligation not to 
raise any obstacle to the exercise of such rights in those fields where competence has been 
transferred to Palestinian authorities&#8221;.<b>666</b> Israel&#8217;s actions have led to a severe deterioration and 
regression in the levels of realization of those rights. Consequently, the Mission finds that Israel 
has failed to comply with those obligations. 
</p>
<p>1313. The Mission has also given consideration to the extent and type of military operations 
conducted by Israel in the Gaza Strip between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009. As 
mentioned earlier, provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and of Additional Protocol I that 
reflect international customary law apply to those operations. Their obligations include that 
under the Fourth Geneva Convention to give particular protection and respect to the infirm and 
expectant mothers (art. 16), to respect and protect civilian hospitals and medical personnel 
(arts. 18 and 20), and to allow the free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital 
objects, food and clothing subject to certain conditions (art. 23). The Mission will address here 
only respect for the provisions contained in article 23, which it considers to be part of customary 
international law. With regard to Additional Protocol I, the Mission will address here Israel&#8217;s 
compliance with article 54. 
</p>
<p>1314. The Government of Israel has provided information about the actions it took to ensure the 
supply of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip and to ensure that medical relief and rescue 
as well as essential facilities would function during the hostilities. These actions allegedly 
comprised: the continuous supply of humanitarian aid through the crossings; coordination of 
evacuation within the Gaza Strip and outside; a unilateral suspension of military operations each 
day to enable the resupply of assistance for the population and actions to ensure the functioning 
of essential infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. To this end, the Government of Israel reported that it 
established a number of coordinating and liaison bodies with Palestinian authorities and 
organizations, the United Nations agencies on the ground and humanitarian agencies, such as 
ICRC. The Government also reported that a number of trucks carrying humanitarian goods from 
Israel and from other countries, including from international organizations, were given passage.  
</p>
<p>1315. In response, the Mission draws attention to the fact that no consideration was given to the 
situation that prevailed in the Gaza Strip before the military operations. In particular, the Mission 
notes that the amounts and types of food, medical and hospital items and clothing were wholly 
insufficient to meet the humanitarian needs of the population. Given that since the end of the 
operations the number of truckloads allowed through the crossings has again fallen, the 
humanitarian supplies are even less sufficient. 
</p>
<p>1316. At the height of the military operations, several NGOs appealed to the Government of 
Israel to ensure a sufficient supply of electricity and fuel to the Gaza Strip to allow for the

Court of Israel on 7 and 9 of January, respectively, to order the Government to ensure that the 
Israeli armed forces did not attack ambulances and medical personnel and that sufficient 
electricity and fuel were supplied to enable hospitals, water and sanitation systems to function 
during the conflict. On 19 January, as military operations ended, the Supreme Court ruled 
denying both petitions.<b>668</b>  
</p>
<p>1317. The Government of Israel seems to see the hardship and suffering of Palestinians as 
an inevitable consequence of a situation of war. The Government&#8217;s statement that &#8220;civilian 
populations inevitably and tragically suffer during a time of armed combat, particularly where 
the combat operations take place in densely populated urban areas&#8221;<b>669</b> may be correct, but this 
does not relieve Israel from its obligations under international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>1318. From the facts it ascertained and the foregoing analysis, the Mission finds that Israel has 
violated its obligation to allow the free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital 
stores and objects, food and clothing (article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention). 
</p>
<p>1319. Article 54 of Additional Protocol I contains the prohibition: 
</p>
<p>to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the 
civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas&#8230;, drinking water installations 
and supplies and irrigation works for the specific purpose of denying them for their 
sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse party, whatever the motive 
[&#8230;]. 
</p>
<p>The Mission regards this rule as reflective of international customary law. In this context, 
Israel&#8217;s obligations to respect, protect and facilitate or provide for the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights, and its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women are also 
relevant, and have been undermined by the blockade and restrictions on the Gaza Strip, as well 
as the actions taken during the military operations.  
</p>
<p>1320. With regard to article 54 (2) of Additional Protocol I, the Mission recalls its analysis 
included in chapter XIII on the destruction of buildings, food production and industry. From the 
facts ascertained and the circumstances described in the present chapter and in chapters XIII and 
XVI, the Mission concludes that in the destruction or damaging of greenhouses, agricultural 
land, water wells for irrigation and irrigation networks there was the specific purpose  of denying 
their use for the sustenance of the civilian population of the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, this

 <p> 
appears to be done as part of a policy of collective punishment of the civilian population as 
elaborated below. 
</p>
<p>1321. With respect to the right to water, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
stated: 
</p>
<p>The obligation to <i>respect </i>[the right to water] requires that States parties refrain from 
[&#8230;] limiting access to, or destroying, water services and infrastructure as a punitive 
measure, for example, during armed conflicts in violation of international humanitarian 
law.<b>670</b>  
</p>
<p>1322. This language is similar to that of a resolution adopted by consensus at the 
26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent that calls upon parties to a 
conflict to &#8220;take all feasible measures to avoid in their military operations, all acts liable to 
destroy or damage water sources.&#8221;<b>671</b>   
</p>
<p>1323. Similar considerations apply to the right to adequate housing.<b>672</b> The widespread 
destruction of residential housing, water wells and pipe networks cannot be seen as an inevitable 
or necessary incidence of military hostilities. Israel had a duty to distinguish between civilian 
and military objects and not to direct any attacks at civilians or civilian objects. The Mission has 
not received any information suggesting that all the houses destroyed served as hideouts for 
Hamas fighters or were booby-trapped and does not accept that this was the case. The patterns of 
destruction described in the present chapter and in others reveal that many houses were fired at 
or demolished after their occupants had been ordered to leave them. There was then no clear 
necessity for Israeli soldiers to occupy such properties or to destroy them. They were in effective 
control of the area. In other cases, houses were demolished with bulldozers during the last few 
days of the military operations when, again, Israeli forces were in total control of the areas in 
which the houses were located. Military necessity and the need to prevent rockets being fired 
from the houses into Israel do not seem to the Mission plausible reasons for this widespread 
destruction. These considerations apply equally to the destruction of agricultural land and 
greenhouses, which are so important for local food security.  
</p>
<p>1324. From the facts available to it and by virtue of the foregoing considerations, the Mission 
believes that the destruction of private residential houses, water wells, water tanks, agricultural 
land and greenhouses violates Israel&#8217;s duties to respect the right of the people in the Gaza Strip 
to an adequate standard of living (including food, housing and water).  
</p>
<p>1325. The Mission is aware of the statement of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that 
many of the fundamental rights of the child &#8220;have been blatantly violated during this crisis&#8221;.673 
On the basis of this finding and on the facts as described above, the Mission also considers that

<b>673</b> Committee on the Rights of the Child, &#8220;Effects of the Gaza conflict on children &#8216;devastating&#8217;&#8221;, statement, 12 
January 2009. </p>

 <p> 
Israel has violated its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child during its 
military operations in the Gaza Strip and in particular of article 24 (1), stipulating that &#8220;States 
Parties recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. States Parties 
shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health-care 
services&#8221;; article 38 (1), stipulating that &#8220;States Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect 
for rules of international humanitarian law applicable to them in armed conflicts which are 
relevant to the child&#8221;; and article 38 (4), stipulating that &#8220;States Parties shall take all feasible 
measures to ensure protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1326. The Mission also notes that Israel is in continuing violation of article 39 of the 
Convention in that, by actively preventing reconstruction efforts, it does not fulfil its obligations 
to &#8220;take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social 
reintegration of a child victim of: [&#8230;] armed conflicts. Such recovery and reintegration shall 
take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1327. The Mission is also aware of the statement made by the Committee on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women that &#8220;the human rights of women and children in 
Gaza, in particular to peace and security, free movement, livelihood and health, have been 
seriously violated during this military engagement.&#8221;674 It concurs with this statement. The 
Mission also notes that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, article 11, 
requires States parties to take &#8220;all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of 
persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict&#8221;. Israel has 
signed, but not yet ratified, this Convention and is thus under an obligation not to defeat its 
object and purpose. 
</p>
<p>1328. The Mission also considered whether the Gaza population was subject to collective 
punishment or penalty. According to article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, &#8220;collective 
penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited&#8221;. Article 75 
(2) (d) of Additional Protocol I includes collective punishment as an act that is &#8220;prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever&#8221;. Reprisals against protected persons are also prohibited under 
article 33. These prohibitions are part of customary international law.<b>675</b> 
</p>
<p>1329. The Mission notes that the scope of collective penalties goes beyond physical or criminal 
sanctions to encompass also &#8220;sanctions and harassment of any sort, administrative, by police 
action or otherwise&#8221;.<b>676</b> The cumulative effect of the blockade policies, with the consequent 
hardship and deprivation among the whole population, and of the military operations coupled 
with statements by Israel made to the effect that the whole of the Gaza Strip was a &#8220;hostile 
territory&#8221; strongly suggest that there was an intent to subject the Gaza population to conditions 
such that they would be induced into withdrawing their support from Hamas. This was 
apparently confirmed by the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel commenting on the

 <p> 
decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the fuel cuts: &#8220;The Palestinians need to understand that 
business is not usual, I mean there is no equation in which Israeli children will be under attacks 
by Kassam rockets on a daily basis and life in the Gaza Strip can be as usual&#8221;.<b>677</b> 
</p>
<p>1330. The above statements should also be seen in the light of what the Mission has identified as 
the objectives and strategies of Israel before and during the operations (see chap. XVI). Israel, 
rather than fighting the Palestinian armed groups operating in Gaza in a targeted way, has chosen 
to punish the whole Gaza Strip and the population in it with economic, political and military 
sanctions. This has been seen and felt by many people with whom the Mission spoke as a form 
of collective punishment inflicted on the Palestinians because of their political choices.  
</p>
<p>1331. The facts ascertained by the Mission, the conditions resulting from the deliberate actions 
of the Israeli armed forces and the declared policies of the Israeli Government &#8211; as they were 
presented by its authorized representatives &#8211; with regard to the Gaza Strip before, during and 
after the military operation, cumulatively indicate the intention to inflict collective punishment 
on the people of the Gaza Strip. The Mission, therefore, finds a violation of the provisions of 
article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p>1332. The Mission has also considered the question of whether the crime of persecution as a 
form of crime against humanity had been committed against the civilian population of the Gaza 
Strip. To establish that a crime against humanity was committed it would have to be established 
that there was a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population that blatantly 
discriminated and infringed a fundamental right recognized under international customary law or 
treaty, and was carried out deliberately with the intention so to discriminate.<b>678</b>  
</p>
<p>The crime of persecution encompasses a variety of acts, including, inter alia, those 
of physical, economic or judicial nature, that violate an individual&#8217;s right to the equal 
enjoyment of his basic rights.<b>679</b> 
</p>
<p>1333. In <i>Prosecutor </i>v.<i> Kupreskic </i>judgement, the Trial Chamber of the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia describes the types of acts that would constitute the crime of 
persecution in the following terms: 
</p>
<p> [&#8230;]  
</p>
<p> (c) Persecution can also involve a variety of other discriminatory acts, involving 
attacks on political, social, and economic rights. [&#8230;] 
</p>
<p>

the submission to the Mission by Diakonia.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(d) Persecution is commonly used to describe a series of acts rather than a single 
act. Acts of persecution will usually form part of a policy or at least of a patterned 
practice, and must be regarded in their context. [&#8230;] 
</p>
<p>(e) [&#8230;] discriminatory acts charged as persecution must not be considered in 
isolation. Some of the acts mentioned above may not, in and of themselves, be so serious 
as to constitute a crime against humanity. For example, restrictions placed on a particular 
group to curtail their rights to participate in particular aspects of social life (such as visits 
to public parks, theatres or libraries) constitute discrimination, which is in itself a 
reprehensible act; however, they may not in and of themselves amount to persecution. 
These acts must not be considered in isolation but examined in their context and weighed 
for their cumulative effect.<b>680</b> 
</p>
<p>1334. The Mission has described above a series of acts that deprive Palestinians in the Gaza 
Strip from their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water. Palestinians are further 
denied freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country. Later the 
report will address the extent to which Palestinian rights to access a court of law and an effective 
remedy are limited or denied by Israeli laws (see chap. XXVII) 
</p>
<p>1335. From the facts available to it, the Mission is of the view that some of the actions of the 
Government of Israel might justify a competent court finding that crimes against humanity have 
been committed.  
</p>
<p><b>XVIII. THE CONTINUING DETENTION OF ISRAELI  
SOLDIER GILAD SHALIT 
</b></p>
<p>1336. The Mission notes the continued detention of Gilad Shalit, a member of the Israeli armed 
forces, captured in 2006 by Palestinian armed groups during a cross-border operation. In reaction 
to the capture, the Israeli Government ordered a number of incursions to attack important 
infrastructure in the Gaza Strip as well as Palestinian Authority offices.  This was followed by 
the arrest of eight Palestinian Government ministers and 26 members of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council by the Israeli security forces (see chap. II).  
</p>
<p>1337. Israeli Government officials have repeatedly stated that the easing of the blockade on the 
Gaza Strip (see chaps. V and XVII) is linked to the release of Gilad Shalit. In February 2009, it 
appeared that the Israeli Government had dropped its demand for Palestinian militants to release 
Gilad Shalit before it would end the blockade.<b>681</b> However, the then Deputy Prime Minister 
stated shortly after that &quot;Israel is facing a serious humanitarian crisis, and it is called Gilad 
Shalit, and... until he is returned home, not only will we not allow more cargo to reach the 
residents of Gaza, we will even diminish it.&quot; Israel&#8217;s then Prime Minister also stated that &quot;we 
will not reopen the border crossings [into Gaza] and assist Hamas so long as Gilad Shalit is in

their brutal prison.&quot;<b>682</b> According to the CBS News Channel, this position was reiterated by the 
current Israeli Prime Minister in July 2009.<b>683</b> 
</p>
<p>1338. In October 2008, a Hamas spokesman stated that &#8220;the Shalit case is dependent on 
prisoners swap... He will never be released if the Israeli occupation does not release Palestinian 
prisoners whom Hamas wants free&#8230;.&#8221;<b>684</b>  
</p>
<p>1339. The Mission is aware that negotiations, through intermediaries, continue with regard to 
the exchange of prisoners between the Israeli Government and Hamas representatives.  
</p>
<p>1340. The Mission asked the Gaza authorities to confirm the status of Gilad Shalit. In their 
reply, which the Mission considered to be unsatisfactory, the Gaza authorities denied being 
involved in any way with the capture and detention of Gilad Shalit and stated that they are not in 
possession of any information regarding his current status.  
</p>
<p>1341. During its investigations in the Gaza Strip, the Mission heard testimonies indicating that 
during the military operations of December 2008 &#8211; January 2009, Israeli soldiers questioned 
captured Palestinians about the whereabouts of Gilad Shalit (see chap. XV). 
</p>
<p>1342. Gilad Shalit&#8217;s father, Noam Shalit, appeared before the Mission at the public hearing held 
in Geneva on 6 July 2009.<b>685</b> He informed the Mission of his extreme concern about the 
condition of his son, who has not been able to communicate with his family and has not been 
allowed to receive ICRC visits. Mr. Shalit expressed concern about the health and psychological 
status of his son after more than three years of captivity and appealed for his release. 
</p>
<p><b>Legal findings and conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1343. The Mission is of the opinion that, as a soldier who belongs to the Israeli armed forces and 
who was captured during an enemy incursion into Israel, Gilad Shalit meets the requirements for 
prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. As such, he should be protected, 
treated humanely and be allowed external communication as appropriate according to that 
Convention. ICRC should be allowed to visit him without delay. Information about his condition 
should also be provided promptly to his family.  
</p>
<p>1344. The Mission is concerned by the declarations referred to above, made by various Israeli 
officials, who have indicated the intention of maintaining the blockade of the Gaza Strip until the 
release of Gilad Shalit. The Mission is of the opinion that this would constitute collective 
punishment of the civilian population of the Gaza Strip.

<p><b>SECTION B: INTERNAL VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>XIX. INTERNAL VIOLENCE AND TARGETING OF FATAH AFFILIATES  
BY SECURITY SERVICES UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GAZA 
AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>1345. The Mission has received reports and allegations of violations committed in Gaza by the 
security services in the period under inquiry. It has heard some of those allegations first-hand 
and investigated them by comparing the accounts it received with reports of domestic and 
international human rights organizations.  
</p>
<p>1346. From the beginning of 2006, when Hamas won the majority of seats in the Palestinian 
Legislative Council, violence between competing Palestinian political groups in the Gaza Strip 
escalated. Armed clashes periodically erupted between the security forces affiliated with the two 
main political groups &#8211; Fatah and Hamas &#8211; and culminated in June 2007, when Hamas seized 
control of the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s civil and security institutions of the Gaza Strip.<b>686</b>  
</p>
<p>1347. During the six months preceding the Israeli military operations in Gaza of December 
2008-January 2009, reports of deaths in suspicious circumstances and abuses by the security 
services reporting to the Gaza authorities continued to be documented by domestic monitoring 
mechanisms, including by the Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR).<b>687</b>  
</p>
<p>1348. Between June and December 2008, ICHR received 45 complaints from citizens alleging 
that they were subjected to torture while being detained or interrogated. All these complaints 
were lodged against the Ministry of Interior, the police, the military intelligence, the general 
intelligence and the internal security services of the Gaza authorities, as well as al-Qassam 
Brigades. 
</p>
<p>1349. During the same period, ICHR received about 250 complaints from citizens that security 
agencies (namely the internal security and the police) detained them without respecting legally 
prescribed procedures. In particular, ICHR reported that no arrest warrants from the competent 
authorities were presented to detainees and that the security services searched civilian houses 
without having obtained the relevant search warrants. ICHR reported that family visits to 
detainees were denied, especially in the al-Saraya and al-Mashtal detention and interrogation 
centres of the internal security agency. In addition, detainees were not brought before the judicial 
</p>

<b>686</b> Non-governmental organizations reported that members of the security forces and armed groups belonging to 
both groups &#8220;committed grave human rights abuses and displayed a flagrant disregard for the safety of the civilian 
population.&#8221; &#8220;Both sides killed captured rivals and abducted scores of members of rival groups and held them 
hostage, to be exchanged for friends and relatives held by their rivals.&#8221; See &#8220;Occupied Palestinian Territories torn 
apart&#8230;&#8221;. 
<b>687 </b>The Independent Commission for Human Rights is an independent Palestinian institution established in 1993 by 
Presidential Decree with a broad mandate in accordance with national and international norms. This mandate gives 
it the authority to deal with human rights violations; complaints of abuse of power submitted by citizens; education 
and promotion; monitoring; and generally integrating human rights into Palestinian legislation and practices. The 
Mission was impressed by the outstanding work of the institutions in both Gaza and the West Bank. See ICHR, 
&#8220;Monthly reports on violations of HR&#8221; (June to December 2008), available at: 
http://www.ichr.ps/etemplate.php?id=12. </p>

 <p> 
authorities within the legally prescribed period. According to ICHR, the security services also 
continued to detain citizens with arrest warrants issued by the military justice authority. 
</p>
<p>1350. Many leaders of the Fatah movement as well as the Governors of Khan Yunis and Gaza 
were at the time of drafting this report still in detention at the al-Mashtal detention and 
interrogation centre. 
</p>
<p>1351. In the course of its investigations in Gaza, the Mission obtained information from 
international and domestic organizations and from individuals in Gaza about violence against 
political opponents by the security services that report to the Gaza authorities. The Israeli 
attacks, including the aerial strikes targeting police stations and the main prison in Gaza City 
(see chap. VII), created chaos, making it impossible to independently verify initial reports about 
violations by the security services. Towards the end of the military operations, however, 
domestic human rights organizations started to verify such allegations, including by analysing 
information from hospitals that they had received bodies of persons who had apparently not been 
killed in the Israeli attacks. 
</p>
<p>1352. According to both domestic and international human rights organizations, members of the 
security services and unidentified gunmen killed between 29 and 32 Gaza residents between the 
beginning of the Israeli military operations and 27 February.<b>688</b> Among these, between 17 and 
22 detainees, who had been at al-Saraya detention facility on 28 December and had fled 
following an Israeli aerial attack, were killed in seemingly extrajudicial or summary executions, 
some of them while seeking medical assistance in hospitals (see chap. VII).   
</p>
<p>1353. Not all those killed after escaping detention were Fatah affiliates, detained for political 
reasons, or charged with collaborating with the enemy. Some of the escapees had been convicted 
of serious crimes, such as drug-dealing or murder, and had been sentenced to death.<b>689</b> 
Regardless of the intended scope of the Israeli attack on the prison, the effect was to create a 
chaotic situation that, according to some domestic observers,<b>690</b> was exploited by some elements 
in the security services.   
</p>
<p>1354. During the course of its work in Gaza, the Mission heard first-hand accounts of violations 
against Fatah affiliates committed during the period of the Israeli military operations. Some of 
the witnesses who were interviewed by the Mission were severely distressed and asked that their 
identity not be disclosed for fear of retaliation. The Mission questioned the witnesses and found 
them to be credible. The following cases are among those reported to the Mission and are based 
on information it gathered from a variety of sources.

 <p> 
</p><p>1355. One of the individuals killed following their escape from the damaged al-Saraya prison 
was a Fatah affiliate who had been arrested and detained long before the Israeli military 
operations in Gaza. For about two weeks his family made several unsuccessful enquiries with 
different security services to discover his whereabouts. After finally tracing him, the family was 
able to visit him in the detention facility run by the internal security and saw that he was in poor 
health as the likely result of torture and inadequate detention conditions. He was reportedly not

<p>1356. He was still in al-Saraya prison on 28 December 2008, when it was hit during an Israeli 
aerial bombardment. His dead body was later found with signs of bullet wounds at al-Shifa 
hospital in Gaza City. The family was told that he had been shot dead by unknown persons. 
Independent sources consulted by the Mission seem to indicate that the victim had fled from 
al-Saraya detention facility after the aerial attack and had been wounded in the attack itself or 
shot by the prison staff trying to prevent detainees from escaping.<b>691</b> 
</p>
<p>1357. The Mission received a number of reports of violent attacks against individuals affiliated 
with Fatah<b>692</b> by armed men who broke into their homes. In one incident,<b>693</b> a group of persons 
claiming to be police officers knocked at the door of a family residence in Gaza City. The family 
was confronted by a group of 7 to 10 men wearing civilian clothes, most of them masked. They 
took one member of the family outside. When they brought him back roughly half an hour later, 
he appeared to have been beaten violently with metal pipes. He died of his injuries about a 
month later.<b>694</b>  
</p>
<p>1358. In another incident reported to the Mission, a group of 10 to 12 masked men wearing 
military uniforms broke into the residence of an individual who used to work for the preventive 
security under the Palestinian Authority before the Hamas takeover. When the family tried to 
resist attempts to capture him, the masked men started shooting indiscriminately, killing one 
member of the family and injuring 11 others. After the shooting, the masked men fled. 
According to the information provided to the Mission, when the injured were transferred to al-
                                                 
<b>691</b> The Mission ascertained that on 28 December 2008, the second day of the air strikes by Israel, about 200 to 
300 prisoners were still held in the facility. Most of the almost 700 prisoners had been released in the previous days. 
According to a Human Rights Watch report based on the testimony of prisoners, &#8220;authorities &#8230; kept in custody 
roughly 115 alleged collaborators with Israel, about 70 Fatah supporters held on various charges, and some persons 
convicted of criminal offences who had been sentenced to death. Some of the remaining detainees escaped the 
following day when Israel bombed the prison, but were subsequently tracked down and killed by masked gunmen. 
The ICHR documented 20 cases of escaped prisoners being shot and killed by masked gunmen from December 28 
to January 31; at least 12 of the victims had been detained in the prison for allegedly &#8216;collaborating with the enemy.&#8217;  
Seventeen of the 29 people killed by gunmen that the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) reported from 
December 28 to February 27 were prisoners and detainees who had fled the prison compound after Israel&#8217;s attack, 
including 13 men sentenced to death for collaboration with Israel, three convicted of common crimes, and one man 
awaiting trial.&#8221; (Under Cover of War&#8230;.). The Gaza authorities informed the Mission (in correspondence of July 
2009) that only 11 persons accused or convicted of criminal offences remained in their custody and were transferred 
&#8220;under supervision&#8221; to a residential apartment. See also chap. VIII.

Shifa hospital, members of the security services there prevented medical staff from providing 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>1359. The Mission was informed that &#8211; although serious &#8211; this was only one of many incidents 
in which this family had been targeted by Hamas operatives. One year earlier, a member of the 
family had been abducted and shot in the legs.  
</p>
<p>1360. The Mission was also informed of an incident in which a group of armed, masked men 
broke into the house of a Fatah supporter in Gaza City, abducted him and took him to a nearby 
location, where he was tortured and shot in the leg. He was reportedly left unconscious and 
rescued by neighbours. The ordeal reportedly lasted about one hour. The same individual had 
previously been arrested by members of the security services and kept in detention for a month 
and a half. He was released only after signing a pledge not to participate in Fatah political 
celebrations or occasions.  
</p>
<p>1361. The Mission was informed that, in another incident, three armed, masked men wearing 
symbols of al-Qassam Brigades broke into the residence in Gaza City of an individual who is a 
Fatah supporter and on the payroll of a Fatah-controlled institution. The men started beating 
everyone inside, including a child, and were screaming insults. All the males were then 
reportedly made to go outside &#8211; where other masked men were waiting &#8211; and were beaten with 
metal bars and with rifle butts. After this, the masked men took one of the men to a nearby 
location, where they again beat him very violently. While he was being beaten, the masked men 
reportedly kept insulting him, accusing him of collaborating with Israel and calling him a traitor. 
In response to a question by the Mission, a witness stated that he had the feeling that there was a 
clear chain of command among the group of masked men. Shortly before meeting the Mission, 
the same individual had been summoned by the internal security in Gaza along with other Fatah 
affiliates and kept for four hours at an internal security detention centre in Gaza City before 
being released.  
</p>
<p>1362. Similarly, a group of people who were identified as belonging to the internal security 
stormed the residence of an individual in Gaza City and beat members of the family. The group 
was composed of masked men who left only after shooting him in the leg. The victim was 
allegedly prevented by members of the security services from getting treatment at al-Shifa 
hospital for his injuries. He had previously been arrested and detained by members of the 
security services. During his detention, he was allegedly subjected to different forms of torture, 
including beatings, <i>shabah</i>,<b>695</b> electric shocks and sleep deprivation. His captors did not 
reportedly question him or levy specific charges against him. Finally, towards the end of his 
detention, he was formally accused of &#8220;having contacts with the Ramallah government&#8221;. He was 
reportedly arrested again after the end of the conflict by members of the security services and 
again subjected to torture.  
</p>
<p>1363. The Mission was also informed of the case of another Fatah affiliate who had been 
summoned by the internal security in Gaza and detained on the basis of evidence provided by 
another member of his family who accused him of collaborating with Israel. Additional abuses 
allegedly committed by the security services include the confiscation of property from the 
                                                 
<b>695</b> A torture method in which the prisoner is tightly shackled for long periods. </p>

 <p> 
families of Fatah affiliates, as well as additional cases of torture while in detention in facilities 
that they operate. 
</p>
<p>1364. The Mission was informed that the movement of many Fatah members was restricted 
during Israel&#8217;s military operations in Gaza and that many were put under house arrest very early 
on and threatened with &#8220;action&#8221; should they disobey. Hundreds of cases in which house arrest 
was imposed without any kind of due process were reported to domestic human rights 
organizations during this period. Some individuals received a written order from the police or the 
internal security (the Mission has a sample of these orders), or a verbal order from the members 
of al-Qassam Brigades or the internal security. In some cases, those issuing these orders would 
not identify themselves. The Mission was informed of one case in which an individual put under 
house arrest in this way was allegedly shot dead by the security services when he and other 
members of his family were evacuated from their home owing to the presence of the Israeli 
armed forces.<b>696</b> 
</p>
<p>1365. The Gaza authorities denied that any arrests had taken place in Gaza between 
27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 owing to the insecurity created by the Israeli military 
operations.<b>697</b> They stated that arrests were made only after the end of these operations and only 
in relation to criminal acts, &#8220;security prevention and to restore public order&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>A. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>1366. The Mission finds that the statements provided to it in relation to abuses committed by the 
Gaza authorities&#8217; security services are credible and has no reason to doubt their veracity.  
</p>
<p>1367. As for violent attacks against individuals either in their homes or after being taken from 
their homes, this finding is reinforced by a number of factors. The pattern of armed and 
sometimes uniformed, masked men breaking into houses is described in almost all incidents 
reported to the Mission. Also, in most cases those abducted from their homes or otherwise 
detained were reportedly not accused of offences related to specific incidents, but rather targeted 
because of their political affiliation. When charges were laid, these were always linked to 
suspected political activities contrary to the perceived interest of the Gaza authorities. Some of 
the accounts also indicate that elements of hierarchical control were present within the groups of 
armed, masked men executing the attacks. The testimonies of witnesses and the reports provided 
by international and domestic human rights organizations bear striking similarities and indicate 
that these attacks were not randomly executed, but constituted part of a pattern of organized 
violence directed mainly against Fatah affiliates and supporters. 
</p>
<p>1368. In relation to the allegations that between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 more 
than 20 persons suspected of collaborating with Israel were killed or maimed by being shot in the 
leg or otherwise severely injured, the Gaza authorities stated that their investigations found these 
incidents to be the result of family feuds &#8220;or otherwise they were individual acts motivated by 
personal revenge.&#8221; In addition, they stated that &#8220;the Government, through its competent 
</p>

<b>697</b> Mission correspondence with the Gaza authorities, July 2009. </p>

 <p> 
agencies, opened investigations into these events immediately after the war, and submitted 
charges before the competent Courts.&#8221;<b>698</b> According to PCHR, however, on 2 February 2009 a 
spokesperson for the Gaza authorities stated that &#8220;the Government makes distinctions between 
abuses of law and the actions of the Palestinian resistance during the war, regarding the 
execution of some collaborators who are involved in collaborating with the [Israeli] 
occupation.&#8221;<b>699</b> The statement seems to express support for a number of acts of violence that 
occurred in the chaotic atmosphere created by the military operations.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>1369. Although not internationally recognized and therefore not able to be party to international 
human rights treaties, the Gaza authorities have an obligation to respect and enforce the 
protection of the human rights of the people of Gaza, inasmuch as they exercise effective control 
over the territory, including law enforcement and the administration of justice<b>700</b> (see chap. IV). 
</p>
<p>1370. Before Hamas took full control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, its leaders had publicly 
indicated that they would respect international human rights standards.<b>701</b> In July 2009, the Gaza 
authorities formally stated to the Mission that they accepted the obligation to respect human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, including those enshrined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and in the Palestinian Basic Law. They added that &#8220;the Government is in 
permanent contact with the Red Cross and human rights organizations, and listens to their 
observations and takes into account their recommendations as far as it can, and those institutions 
can testify on that&#8221;.<b>702</b>   
</p>
<p>1371. From the facts ascertained by it, the Mission finds that the actions by members of the 
security services described above constitute serious violations of human rights and are not 
consistent with either the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the Palestinian Basic Law. 
In particular, regarding the Universal Declaration &#8211; which has become part of international 
customary law &#8211; they are in violation of article 3 in relation to everyone&#8217;s right to life, liberty 
and security of the person; article 5 in relation to the freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment; article 9 stating that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary 
</p>

<b>698</b> Written reply from the Gaza authorities to the Mission; July 2009. 
<b>699</b> Taher al-Nouno, a spokesman of the Gaza authorities, attended the press conference with Ehab al-Ghusein, 
spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, and Islam Shahwan, spokesman of the Palestinian police in Gaza. See 
&#8220;Special report&#8230;&#8221;.  
<b>700</b> For example, in their joint report on Lebanon and Israel, a group of four United Nations Special Rapporteurs 
concluded that: &#8220;Although Hezbollah, a non-State actor, cannot become a party to these human rights treaties, it 
remains subject to the demand of the international community, first expressed in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, that every organ of society respect and promote human rights. [&#8230;] It is especially appropriate and 
feasible to call for an armed group to respect human rights norms when it exercises significant control over territory 
and population and has an identifiable political structure&#8221; (A/HRC/2/7, para. 19). See A/HRC/6/76, paras. 4-9, for a 
brief overview of relevant events leading up to Hamas&#8217; seizure of full control in the Gaza Strip. (See also Andrew 
Clapham, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Actors (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006), chap. 7.

 <p> 
arrest and detention; articles 10 and 11 regarding the right to fair and impartial legal proceedings; 
and article 19 regarding the freedom of opinion and expression, including the freedom to hold 
opinions without interference.  
</p>
<p>1372. The Mission takes note of the statement of the Gaza authorities of the opening of criminal 
investigations into some of the killings that happened between 28 December 2008 and 
18 January 2009. It is, however, concerned that &#8211; according to the Gaza authorities &#8211; these 
investigations concern only family feuds or individual acts motivated by personal revenge. The 
Mission also notes with concern that, at the time of drafting this report, appeals by international 
and domestic human rights organizations to the Gaza authorities to conduct serious 
investigations into all allegations of violations, to bring perpetrators to justice and to publish all 
of their findings remain unanswered. Failure to conduct credible investigations into these 
allegations and hold those responsible accountable will prevent the victims from accessing 
justice and encourage a culture of impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>THE WEST BANK, INCLUDING EAST JERUSALEM 
</b></p>
<p>1373. As explained above in chapter I, the Mission believes that the reference in its mandate to 
violations &#8220;in the context&#8221; of the military operations in Gaza required it to go beyond the 
violations that occurred in and around Gaza. it also believes that violations within its mandate in 
terms of time, objectives and targets, include those that are linked to the December 2008 &#8211; 
January 2009 military operations, and include restrictions on human rights and fundamental 
freedoms  related to the strategies and actions of Israel in the context of its military operations.  
</p>
<p>1374. Developments in Gaza and the West Bank are closely interrelated, in the Mission&#8217;s view, 
an analysis of both is necessary to reach an informed understanding of and to report on issues 
within the Mission&#8217;s mandate. On the one hand, the events in Gaza have consequences in the 
West Bank, on the other, pre-existing problems in the West Bank have been exacerbated by the 
Gaza military operations.  
</p>
<p>1375. In its examination of the West Bank with respect to actions taken by Israel, the Mission 
focused on four key aspects in their linkage to the Israeli military operations in Gaza: (a) the 
sharp increase in the use of force by Israeli security forces, including the military, in the West 
Bank; (b) the tightening and entrenchment of the system of movement and access restrictions; 
(c) the issue of Palestinian detainees and especially the increase in child detainees during and 
after the military operations; and (d) the Gaza corollary of the detention of Hamas members of 
the Palestinian Legislative Council.<b>703</b> While the treatment by the Gaza authorities of those 
opposing its policies is discussed in chapter XIX, similar issues with regard to the conduct of the 
Palestinian Authority in the West Bank also called for investigation.   Linkages with the Israeli 
operation in Gaza are elaborated in the respective chapters.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>703</b> The issue of Gazans detained by Israel during and following the operations from December 2008 to January 2009 
is discussed in chapter XV.  </p>

 <p> 
<b>Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1376. One consequence of the refusal by Israel to cooperate with the Mission was that it was 
unable to visit the West Bank to investigate alleged violations of international law. The Mission 
nonetheless received many oral and written reports and other relevant materials from Palestinian, 
Israeli and international human rights organizations and institutions. In addition, the Mission 
met with representatives of a number of human rights organizations and with members of the 
Palestinian legislature and other community leaders (see annex). It invited experts, witnesses and 
victims to participate in the public hearings held in Geneva on 6 and 7 July 2009. The Mission 
also conducted telephone interviews with affected individuals and witnesses, and reviewed 
relevant video and photographic material.   
</p>
<p>1377. Owing to the lack of access to the West Bank, the chapters in the section below rely on 
secondary information to a greater extent than in the previous sections.   
</p>
<p>1378. The Mission found the witnesses it heard in relation to the situation in the West Bank to 
be credible and reliable. The Mission is also satisfied that the reports it reviewed and to which it 
refers are credible and based on sound methodologies. 
</p>
<p>1379. The Mission also wrote to the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel seeking 
information and official positions on, inter alia, the issues addressed in this section.  The 
information received by the Palestinian Authority was taken into account in the present chapter. 
The Government of Israel has not responded to the Mission&#8217;s requests.  
</p>
<p>1380. Owing to the complexity of the issues relating to Palestinian detainees and of freedom of 
movement and access, the chapters on these issues include an explanatory introduction that sets 
out the factual parameters of the problems and explains some of the key terminology and 
concepts.  
</p>
<p><b>XX.  TREATMENT OF PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK BY ISRAELI 
SECURITY FORCES, INCLUDING USE OF EXCESSIVE OR LETHAL 
FORCE DURING DEMONSTRATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>1381. The information gathered by the Mission indicates an ongoing pattern of ill treatment and 
use of force by the Israeli security forces against Palestinians in the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem. Ill treatment and low levels of force are reported being common in encounters at 
checkpoints between Palestinians and the Israeli security forces (army, police and border 
police),<b>704</b> while a greater, sometimes lethal, degree of force has been used during 
demonstrations, incursions and search and arrest operations. With heavily armed Israeli military 
forces present throughout the West Bank, the possibility of violence always exists. As a witness 
reported to the Mission, &#8220;the use of force is part of the system of control of the occupation, 
where a key element is fear, which can only be sustained by the constant threat and the periodic 
act of violence&#8221;.<b>705</b>

 <p> 
1382. Violence against Palestinians in the West Bank does not only come from the security 
forces. The Israeli military operations in Gaza commenced when the West Bank was 
experiencing some of the worst acts of settler violence in several years.<b>706</b>  
</p>
<p>1383. Witnesses and experts informed the Mission of a sharp increase in the use of force by the 
Israeli security forces against Palestinians in the West Bank from the commencement of the 
Israeli operations in Gaza.<b>707 </b> A number of protesters were killed and scores were injured by 
Israeli forces during Palestinian demonstrations following the beginning of the,<b>708</b>the degree of 
violence employed in the West Bank during the operations in Gaza, has been sustained since 
18 January.<b>709</b> Reports from non-governmental organizations confirm this information.<b>710</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Settler violence in the West Bank in the period preceding the Israeli military 
operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1384. In early December 2008, Israeli settlers in the city of Hebron rioted and perpetrated acts of 
violence against the local Palestinian population. Although Israel, as the occupying power, has 
the responsibility to maintain public order and safety in the occupied territory,<b>711</b> the Israeli 
police did not intervene to protect Palestinians.<b>712</b> Settler violence is a regular occurrence, 
targeting primarily Palestinian civilians and their property but also, on occasion, Israeli 
soldiers.<b>713</b> According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, &#8220;a root cause

<b>707</b> The NGO Al-Haq reported another particularly disturbing case of &#8220;what appears to be a willful killing&#8221; of a 
farmer from Hebron on 17 January 2009. According to medical personnel who were asked to collect his body from 
the Israeli soldiers by whom he had been detained, the farmer appeared to have been shot at point blank in the

 <p> 
of the phenomenon is Israel&#8217;s decade-long policy of facilitating and encouraging the settling of 
its citizens inside occupied Palestinian territory, defined as transfer of population and prohibited 
by international humanitarian law.&#8221;<b>714</b> Israeli media attribute the increase in settler violence to 
the settler movement which became increasingly radicalized after the Gaza Disengagement in 
August 2005.<b>715</b> 
</p>
<p>1385. According to various sources,<b>716</b> rioting erupted in Hebron on 4 December 2008 after the 
evacuation by the Israeli security forces of Israeli settlers from the Rajabi family home in the old 
city of Hebron.  United Nations sources reported that, at first, clashes erupted between settlers 
and Israeli security forces, causing injuries on both sides; afterwards, &#8220;violence continued in 
Hebron city. Groups of settlers threw stones at Palestinian houses and set fire to vehicles, 
agricultural fields, houses and the contents of one mosque. Settlers also attempted to force entry 
into Palestinian homes.&#8221;<b>717</b> One incident in which Israeli settler Ze&#8217;ev Braude shot and injured 
three members of the al-Matariyeh family was filmed and broadcast by the international 
media.<b>718</b>  
</p>
<p>1386. The wave of violence continued for days.<b>719</b> Palestinian hospitals reported 17 injuries 
during the period, including five bullet wounds.<b>720</b> 
</p>

settlers attacking vulnerable targets (children, women and the elderly) mainly in the Hebron and Nablus areas. In 
January 2007, B'Tselem launched a camera distribution and video advocacy project focusing on the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory.  The project is aims at providing &#8220;Palestinians living in high-conflict areas with video 
cameras, with the goal of bringing the reality of their lives under occupation to the attention of the Israeli and 
international public, exposing and seeking redress for violations of human rights.&#8221; The B&#8217;Tselem project has 
resulted in footage of these kinds of attacks being publicized, such as the attack by settlers on herders in Susya, June 
2008..

</p><p>1387. The use of force against Gaza solidarity demonstrations in the West Bank during the 
Israeli operations in Gaza 
</p>
<p>1388. There was a significant increase in the use of force by Israeli security forces during 
demonstrations in the West Bank after the start of the Israeli operations in Gaza. The degree of 
force used against protests during the previous year had already been high, including during 
protests against the Wall in places such as Jayyous, al-Ma&#8217;sara, Bi&#8217;lin and Ni&#8217;lin.<b>721</b> The villages 
where demonstrations are regularly held have lost or stand to lose much of their land to Israeli 
settlements and the Wall.  A vibrant grass-roots, non-violent resistance movement has evolved 
that has attracted support from Israeli and international activists. New tactics and weapons used 
by the Israeli security forces aimed at suppressing the popular movement<b>722</b> have resulted in 
deaths and injuries. For example, in July 2008, Israeli border police killed two children, Ahmad 
Musa, aged 10,<b>723</b> and Yusef Amera, aged 17, both of whom were shot in the head.<b>724</b> 
</p>
<p>1389. Another cause of concern for the Mission were further allegations of the use of 
unnecessary, lethal force by Israeli security forces. At the public hearing in Geneva of 6 July 
2009, two witnesses, Mohamed Srour and Jonathan Pollak, described the fatal shooting, on 28 
December 2008, of two young men from the village of Ni&#8217;lin during a protest against the Israeli 
operations in Gaza. Mr Srour was himself shot in the leg during the same protest.<b>725</b> 
</p>
<p>1390. At the hearing on 6 July, Mr Srour stated that as a result of this war, many people all 
around the West Bank, but also in his village Ni&#8217;lin, wanted to demonstrate and express their 
solidarity with the people of Gaza. The demonstration included important participation of people 
from the different solidarity movements, from Israel as well from the international community.&#8221; 
The two witnesses spoke of the atmosphere that they had encountered in the confrontation with

Police vehicle, aimed his rifle and fired a live bullet. Shot from a distance of 50 metres, the bullet entered Ahmad 
Musa&#8217;s forehead and exited through the back of his skull. While two of the demonstration&#8217;s organisers attempted to 
carry Ahmad Musa to safety, they were fired upon by the Border Police. They succeeded in carrying the child to

report, July 2009. To illustrate the use of unusual weapons which, the report states, is aimed at creating lasting 
injury, on 13 June 2008, Ibrahim Burnat (aged 26) was shot three times in the thigh while in the weekly anti-Wall 
demonstration in Bi&#8217;lin. According to his medical report, he was shot with an explosive bullet. The report also states 
that, in the four villages mentioned, 1,566 people had been injured while six people had been killed at protests.

 <p> 
the soldiers and border police, which was markedly different from the situation before the 
operations in Gaza. Mr. Pollak stated:  
</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the incident, and during and after the start of the war generally was 
that all checks and balances had been removed. The soldiers were saying things related to 
the Gaza war, taunting things like, &#8221;It&#8217;s a shame we&#8217;re not in Gaza killing Arabs.&#8221; There 
seemed to be an enthusiasm to confront and the amount of live ammunition used shows 
this. The behaviour of the soldiers has escalated immensely &#8211; not that in the past the army 
was so gentle. 
</p>
<p>1391. According to the witnesses, the main demonstration had ended when the army and border 
police used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowd. The next sequence of events took 
place on the edge of the village, at a considerable distance from the site of the construction of the 
Wall. The two young men killed were part of a small group of demonstrators, some of whom had 
thrown stones at the soldiers. In video footage, four or five soldiers appeared to be casually 
walking around and not seemingly threatened. No tear gas was used at that stage. Dozens of 
rounds of live ammunition were fired in the direction of the group of young men, hitting three of 
them within minutes of each other. Mohamed Khawaja was shot in the forehead; Arafat 
Khawaja, who had turned to run away, was shot in the back, and Mohammed Srour was shot in 
the leg. Subsequently an ambulance was prevented from reaching the victims, who had to be 
carried some distance and were eventually put onto a pick-up truck, at which the army fired tear 
gas. Arafat Khawaja was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital and Mohamed Khawaja 
passed away a few days later. 
</p>
<p>1392. Two Palestinians were killed during other protests against the military operations in Gaza. 
On 4 January, Mufid Walwel was shot dead during a demonstration near Qalqilya, where the 
Wall is to be built. In Hebron, on 16 January, Mus&#8217;ab Da&#8217;na died after being shot in the head. 
According to an NGO report, the Israeli border police are believed to have been responsible for 
both incidents.<b>726</b>  
</p>
<p>1393. The Mission has asked the Government of Israel to explain the increased use of live 
ammunitions during demonstrations in the West Bank, but has received no reply.  
</p>
<p><b>B. The increased level of force since the end of the operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1394. Since the end of the December-January military operations in Gaza, the increased level of 
force has reportedly continued against demonstrators and in other situations. The Mission heard 
from an eye witness, how, on 13 March 2009, United States citizen Tristan Anderson was hit, 
while participating in an anti-Wall demonstration in Ni&#8217;lin, with a high velocity tear gas canister 
in the forehead. According to the witness, Mr. Anderson was taking pictures of Israeli soldiers 
and border police attacking the demonstrators. A high velocity long-range tear gas canister was 
used at short range, crushing his forehead. As he laid on the ground, the border police, who 
would have been able to seen him falling down and lying on the ground, continued to shoot tear 
gas in his direction. Video footage received by the Mission showed Palestinian paramedics in 
bright orange uniforms putting Mr. Anderson&#8217;s body on to a stretcher, a tear gas canister landing 
                                                 
<b>726</b> Al-Haq affidavit No. 4667/2009 and 4608/2009. </p>

 <p> 
directly beside them and a large cloud of gas developing.<b>727</b>  According to the witness, Israeli 
forces delayed Mr. Anderson&#8217;s transfer from the Palestinian ambulance to an Israeli ambulance 
at the checkpoint before entering Israel.<b>728</b>  At 1 August 2009, Mr. Anderson remains in a critical 
condition in an Israeli hospital. 
</p>
<p>1395. On 17 April 2009, in Bi&#8217;lin, Bassem Abu Rahma was killed by a high velocity tear gas 
canister which was shot at his chest from a distance of 30 to 40 metres. The killing, which took 
place during a peaceful demonstration against the Wall, was filmed.<b>729</b> The footage shows 
Mr. Abu Rahma standing on a small hill, clearly visible and not armed or otherwise posing a 
threat. 
</p>
<p>1396. Eye witnesses reported to the Mission that they felt that it had become almost a sport for 
snipers, who now routinely enter villages and occupy roofs of buildings, to aim at protesters in a 
manner that is inappropriate in the context of crowd control, with apparent disregard for the lives 
or limbs of the persons they hit.<b>730</b>   
</p>
<p>1397. On 5 June 2009, five people were shot by snipers in a demonstration in Ni&#8217;lin, of whom 
one, Aqel Srour, was killed, and another, a 15 year-old boy, was shot in the abdomen and will be 
permanently disabled.<b>731</b> Al-Haq described the shooting of Srour, who according to Al-Haq had 
run to assist the boy who was shot in the abdomen, as a case of &#8220;wilful killing&#8221;<b>732</b>.   
</p>
<p>1398. The weapons used by the security forces are also a cause for concern. Many of the injuries 
to protesters during anti-Wall demonstrations in recent months (in Ni&#8217;lin, Bi&#8217;lin, Jayyous, 
Bitunya and Budrus) and the death of Aqel Srour and that of a 14-year-old who was killed in 
Hebron in February<b>733</b>were reportedly inflicted by a .22 caliber Ruger rifle. B&#8217;Tselem has 
protested against the use of this weapon as a means of crowd control on the grounds that it is 
potentially lethal.<b>734</b> In its response to B&#8217;Tselem&#8217;s letter of 26 February, the Israeli Judge 
Advocate General wrote, that &#8220;the open-fire regulations applying to the .22 ammunition are

comparable, in general, to the open-fire rules applying to &#8220;ordinary&#8221; ammunition&#8221; and that 
&#8220;following your letter, we directed that the forces again be instructed with respect to the binding 
Open-Fire Regulations that apply to use of the Ruger rifle.&#8221;<b>735</b> However, from the nature of the 
killing of Aqel Srour and the injuries sustained by protesters in the months following the Judge 
Advocate General&#8217;s response, it is clear that the use of the Ruger rifle has not been tempered.<b>736</b> 
</p>
<p>1399. The Israeli armed forces&#8217; open-fire regulations for the West Bank provide that different 
rules apply in situations where Israeli citizens are present, as compared to situations where there 
are only Palestinians present.<b>737</b> For example, they provide for the use of live ammunitions under 
certain conditions, in the case of violent &#8220;disturbances&#8221;<b>738</b> near the Wall or in the nearby area. 
Where Israelis participate, however, the use of live ammunitions is forbidden. Similarly different 
provisions are found with regard to the use of warning shots and rubber bullets.  Witnesses 
indicated to the Mission, however, that the army no longer distinguishes between Palestinians 
and their Israeli and international supporters, and uses a greater degree of force against all.<b>739</b> 
</p>
<p>1400. The Mission asked the Government of Israel about the differences in open fire regulations 
applied in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in situations in which Israeli citizens are present as 
opposed to situations where none are present, but has received no reply. 
</p>
<p>1401. In a recent court hearing, Colonel Virob, an Israeli Brigade Commander in the West Bank, 
defended the routine use of force in achieving the goals of the occupation.<b>740</b> According to the 
Association for Civil Rights in Israel, when Colonel Virob was asked about using physical force 
during an investigation against people who are not suspects, he stated that &#8220;using violence and 
aggression to prevent the situation from escalating and the need to use even more violence is not 
only allowed but sometimes imperative (&#8230;), giving a blow, a push, in a situation even with 
people who are not involved in an operational situation, if it can advance the mission, is certainly 
possible.&#8221; He added that &#8220;the way you use violence should also be appropriate (&#8230;), a slap, 
sometimes a hit to the back of the neck or the chest, in cases that there is friction, a reaction from 
the Palestinian side, sometimes a knee jab or strangulation to calm someone down is 
reasonable.&#8221;<b>741</b> 
</p>
<p>1402. The Mission considers with concern reports of gratuitous abuse by Israeli soldiers. It 
heard testimonies in a video footage shown on Israeli television<b>742</b> that described a search and

detain operation by the Kfir brigade in the West Bank village of Haris. Hundreds of troops had 
participated in a nocturnal raid on a village aimed at finding boys who were thought to have 
thrown stones at settlers&#8217; cars some days previously. On 9 June 2009, <i>The Independent</i> reported 
on the operation, quoting soldiers of the Kfir Brigade involved. One was quoted as saying he saw 
many soldiers &#8220;just knee [Palestinians] because it's boring, because you stand there ten hours, 
you're not doing anything, so they beat people up.&#8221;<b>743</b> A second soldier described a &#8220;fanatical 
atmosphere&#8221; during the search operations. &#8220;We would go into a house and turn the whole thing 
upside down&#8221;, he recalled, but no weapons were found. &#8220;They confiscated kitchen knives.&#8221; The 
first soldier stated that numerous soldiers were involved. &#8220;There were a lot of reservists that 
participated, and they totally had a celebration on the Palestinians: curses, humiliation, pulling 
hair and ears, kicks, slaps. These things were the norm.&#8221; He described the beating of a child: 
</p>
<p>The soldiers who took [detainees] to the toilet just exploded [over] them with beatings; 
cursed them with no reason. When they took one Arab to the toilet so that he could 
urinate, one of them gave him a slap that brought him to the ground. He had been 
handcuffed from behind with a nylon restraint and blindfolded. He wasn't insolent, he 
didn't do anything to get on anyone's nerves ... [it was] just because he's an Arab. He was 
something like 15 years old.  
</p>
<p>1403. He stated that the incidents in the toilet were the &#8220;extreme&#8221; and added that the beatings 
did not draw blood. They were &#8220;dry beatings, but it's still a beating&#8221;.<b>744</b> 
</p>
<p>1404. Video footage uploaded to the internet by Israeli border police, and filed under &#8220;comedy&#8221; 
offers an insight into how wanton abuse is perceived by members of the security forces 
themselves.<b>745</b> The Mission has received reports of other, similar occurrences,<b>746</b> giving rise to 
the concern that an increased level of force and the dehumanization have become normalized in 
the practice of security forces. 
</p>
<p><b>C. The role of impunity 
</b></p>
<p>1405. Several witnesses told the Mission that, during the operations in Gaza, the sense in the 
West Bank was one of a &#8220;free for all&#8221;, where any behavior was permitted for Israeli forces. An 
even greater use of force than that used in the West Bank could be attributed to a change in 
atmosphere or attitude towards the &#8220;other&#8221; during time of war. There are indications that this 
shift in attitude was also apparent during the war in Lebanon in 2006.<b>747</b>  The concept of what is

<b>747</b> Mission telephone interview with Sarit Michael, 5 August 2009. In the video footage of the shooting of an Israeli 
demonstrator during the war in Lebanon in 2006, a border police member can be heard saying, after the order to

 <p> 
considered &#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;acceptable&#8221; conduct risks shifting to even higher levels, if those in 
positions of responsibility do not respond appropriately. In the face of the recently increase in 
violence by the Israeli security forces in the West Bank, B&#8217;Tselem stated that condemnations by 
Ministers and other officials 
</p>
<p>remain solely declarative. Security forces, meanwhile, misusing their power, continue to 
abuse and beat Palestinians, among them, minors (&#8230;). If a message is sent to security 
forces, it is that even if the establishment does not accept acts of violence, it will not take 
measures against those who commit them. The effect of such a message is that the lives 
and dignity of Palestinians are meaningless and that security forces can continue, 
pursuant to the function they serve, to abuse, humiliate, and beat Palestinians with whom 
they come into contact.<b>748</b> 
</p>
<p>1406. In the past, every case in which a Palestinian not participating in hostilities was killed was 
subject to criminal investigation. This policy changed in 2000.  Criminal investigations are now 
the exception,<b>749</b> these cases are now simply discussed in an &#8220;operational debriefing&#8221; by the 
military itself.<b>750</b> In 2003, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and B&#8217;Tselem filed a petition 
to reverse this policy change, demanding that every civilian death be independently investigated. 
The petition included demands for investigations into individual deaths as well as the principle 
question relating to the overall policy. The former were dismissed, while the principle question is 
still pending.<b>751</b>  
</p>
<p>1407. Yesh Din reports that over 90 per cent of investigations into settler violence are closed 
without an &#8220;indictment being filed&#8221;.<b>752</b> B&#8217;Tselem reported in June 2009 that the charges against 
Mr Braude, the Hebron settler who was filmed shooting and injuring three Palestinians in 
December 2009, would be dropped, as the court had ordered that &#8220;secret evidence&#8221; against him 
be disclosed, and the potential public harm of this disclosure would outweigh the harm done by a 
person, documented as having committed a violent crime, being released back into society.<b>753</b>

bleeding from his head injury, the commander ignored the calls by a woman to get an ambulance for the injured 
Israeli. He answers that there are many Israelis injured in Lebanon, too. As shown in the footage, the demonstrator 
was shot at close range from behind, as he was walking in front of the soldiers. See

Advocate General charged the officer who ordered the shooting with &#8220;conduct unbecoming&#8221;, 
Israeli international law Professor Orna Ben-Naftali stated that &#8220;the decision (was) indicative of 
a policy of tolerance towards violence against non-violent civilian protests against the 
construction of the Separation Wall&#8221;. She added that &#8220;the implication of such a policy is twofold: 
first, it might transform &#8216;conduct unbecoming&#8217; &#8211; which as a matter of law is a war crime &#8211; into a 
crime against humanity; second, it may well be construed as an invitation to the international 
community to intervene through the exercise of universal jurisdiction.&#8221;<b>756</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Legal analysis and conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1410. Israel has obligations to Palestinians in the West Bank under both international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law. With regard to the former, the obligations 
flow from the status of Israel as the occupying power and the consequent obligations concerning 
protected persons. With regard to the latter, specific human rights obligations to all individuals in 
the West Bank arise from both customary law and the obligations assumed by Israel under the 
various human rights conventions that it has ratified. The obligations under both bodies of law 
are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and provide a clear framework against which the 
facts outlined above may be analysed (see chapter IV above). With regard to the issues discussed 
in the present chapter, the most relevant obligations are set out below.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Violence by settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>1411. Israel has an obligation under customary law, as reflected in article 43 of the Hague 
Regulations, to ensure public order and safety in the West Bank:  
</p>
<p>Article 43. The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of 
the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as 
far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the 
laws in force in the country.

<b>756</b> &#8220;Whose &#8216;conduct unbecoming&#8217;? The shooting of a handcuffed, blindfolded Palestinian demonstrator, by Orna 
Ben-Naftali and Noam Zamir, <i>Journal of International Criminal Justice</i>, 3 March 2009 Recently, the Israeli Military 
Advocate General&#8217;s decision to charge commander Omri Bomberg and his subordinate with &#8220;conduct unbecoming&#8221; 
was overturned, the second time in recent decades that a decision by the Military Advocate General has been 
overturned.  The first being related to the demotion of General Tamir, who let his 14-year-old son drive his military 
vehicle, see &#8220;Neither an officer nor a gentleman&#8221;, <i>Ha&#8217;aretz</i>, 31 July 2008; and &#8220;Israeli High Court of Justice rules 
against Judge Advocate General&#8217;s &#8216;extremely unreasonable&#8217; decision&#8221;, B&#8217;Tselem press release, 1 July 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1412. This obligation is supported by the obligation by Israel under article 27 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention (set out in chapter XV above) to ensure that Palestinians, as protected 
persons, are protected against all acts or threats of violence. 
</p>
<p>1413. Israel also has obligations under international human rights law to protect Palestinians 
from violence by private individuals, and to investigate and punish acts of violence through the 
application of criminal law, without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>1414. Palestinians thus have &#8220;the right to security of the person&#8221; under article 9 (1) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the Human Rights Committee has 
read to mean that the State has an obligation to take reasonable and appropriate measures to 
protect individuals from threats to the life of persons under their jurisdiction, including threats 
from private actors.<b>757</b> Under article 2 of the Covenant, Israel has an obligation &#8220;to adopt such 
laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present 
Covenant&#8221; and to &#8220;ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are 
violated shall have an effective remedy&#8221;.  In applying the law, Israel has an obligation under 
article 26 of the Covenant to ensure that &#8220;all persons are equal before the law and are entitled 
without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law&#8221;.   Finally, insofar as acts of 
violence amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment are perpetrated by private 
individuals with the acquiescence of public officials (including security forces), Israel has an 
obligation under article 16 of the Convention against Torture to prevent such acts: 
</p>
<p>Article 16 (1). Each State party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its 
jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment &#8230;, when 
such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a 
public official or other person acting in an official capacity.  
</p>
<p><b>Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1415. With regard to violent acts perpetrated by settlers against Palestinians, such as those 
relating to the cases of December 2008 in Hebron reported above, the Mission concludes, on the 
basis of the reports received and the video footage viewed, that Israel has failed to fulfil its 
obligations to protect the Palestinians from violence by private individuals under both 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law.  In some instances, evidence 
of the acquiescence of the security forces in this violence could amount to a violation of the 
relevant obligations relating to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.   
</p>
<p>1416. Insofar as this acquiescence only occurs in respect of violence against Palestinians by 
settlers, and not vice-versa, there is a strong argument that the behaviour of the security forces is 
in breach of the obligations of Israel to not discriminate on the basis of national origin under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.    
</p>
<p>1417. The facts also suggest a violation of article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights guaranteeing equal protection of the law, particularly insofar as there is a failure 
to investigate Palestinians&#8217; allegations of assault by settlers.  
                                                 
<b>757</b> For example, <i>William Eduardo Delgado Paez v. Colombia</i>, Communication 195/1985, views adopted 12 July 1990. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1418. Finally, the failure by Israel to adequately investigate allegations of the failure of the State 
to protect Palestinians, and of the acquiescence of state actors before the violence of private 
actors and thus to provide an effective remedy for those suffering human rights violations also 
place Israel in violation of article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Actions by Israel with regard to Gaza solidarity demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>1419. All individuals in the West Bank enjoy the right to freedom of expression provided in 
article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:  
</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom 
to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. 
</p>
<p>1420. Israel has an obligation under article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights to recognize the right of peaceful assembly. While restrictions may be placed on 
the exercise of this right, they must be &#8220;in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a 
democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre 
public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of 
others&#8221;.  In accordance with article 2 of the Covenant, any restrictions on the right of peaceful 
assembly can only be imposed &#8220;without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other 
status&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1421. In dealing with Palestinian civilians, including in the context of public demonstrations, 
Israel has an obligation under articles 2 and 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights to ensure, without distinction of any kind, that no one is arbitrarily deprived of their life:  
</p>
<p>Article 2 (a). Each State party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure 
to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in 
the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 
</p>
<p>Article 6 (1). Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be 
protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. 
</p>
<p>1422. A further obligation on Israel is to ensure that no one is subject to torture or to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and articles 2 and 16 of the Convention against Torture), without 
discrimination.   
</p>
<p>1423. The Fourth Geneva Convention places a number of obligations on Israel relevant to the 
treatment of Palestinians participating in demonstrations. Under article 27, Israel must ensure 
that Palestinians as protected persons are &#8220;at all times &#8230; humanely treated, and &#8230; protected, 
especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity&#8221;. 
Treatment by Israel as the occupier must be &#8220;without any adverse distinction based, in particular, 
on race, religion or political opinion&#8221;. From article 32 derives the prohibition of &#8220;taking any </p>

 <p> 
measure of such a character as to cause the physical suffering or extermination of protected 
persons&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1424. Finally, Israel has obligations under articles 146 and 147, as set out in chapter IV, which 
include an obligation to: 
</p>
<p> bring before its courts persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be 
committed ... grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, including wilful killing, 
torture or inhuman treatment, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or 
health, extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military 
necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.  
</p>
<p>1425. The content of the international human rights obligations set out above has been clarified 
through a number of other sources, including the jurisprudence of the human rights treaty bodies 
(in this, particularly the Human Rights Committee), and various standards adopted under the 
auspices of the United Nations.  The most relevant in respect of the facts outlined above are set 
out below.  
</p>
<p>1426. The permissible use of force by those exercising police powers is narrowly construed 
under international human rights law. The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials,<b>758</b> 
states that law enforcement officials (which include military authorities when exercising police 
powers) &#8220;may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the 
performance of their duty&#8221; (art.  3).   Under the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials:<b>759</b>   
</p>
<p>law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or 
defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the 
perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a 
person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her 
escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. 
</p>
<p>1427. Whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials 
are obliged, inter alia, to &#8220;ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or 
affected persons at the earliest possible moment&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>1428. Insofar as the events involve individuals who are human rights defenders, the Declaration 
on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and 
Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders) is also relevant,<b>760</b> in particular article 5 which affirms the right of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>758</b> General Assembly resolution 34/169. 
<b>759</b> Adopted at the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, 
Havana, 27 August to 7 September 1990. 
<b>760</b> General Assembly resolution, 53/144, annex. Israel joined consensus when the Declaration was adopeted by the 
Assembly. </p>

 <p> 
everyone &#8220;to meet or assemble peacefully&#8221; for the purpose of promoting and protecting human 
rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p><b>Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1429. The dispersal by Israeli security forces of demonstrations in the West Bank is prima facie 
in violation of the rights to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly. Insofar as the 
protesters were protesting against the violation of human rights in Gaza, the activities of the 
security forces in dispersing demonstrations ran counter to the provisions of the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders.   
</p>
<p>1430. Regardless of whether the facts indicate that the above mentioned rights could be 
permissibly limited under the terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the methods and means of dispersal are questionable.  The use of force described to the Mission 
against peaceful demonstrations is clearly prohibited in such situations, in particular the lethal 
use of tear gas canisters against demonstrators, of live ammunition (including .22 ammunition), 
and of snipers.  It should be emphasized that the norms relating to the use of force by law 
enforcement officers outlined above, continue to apply even when the demonstrations are no 
longer peaceful, such as when stones are thrown, such as in the case of the Ni&#8217;lin demonstration 
of 28 December.  The situation described by the witnesses to the killings in Ni&#8217;lin suggests that 
firearms were used when there was no threat to the life of the Israeli security forces or others 
under their protection. According to the witnesses, both the deceased were shot in the upper body 
and one of them in the back.   
</p>
<p>1431. On the basis of the facts obtained, the Mission finds that the use of firearms resulting in 
the death of demonstrators constitutes a violation of article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights as an arbitrary deprivation of life. Reports that Israeli security forces 
delayed the provision of medical aid to the injured in at least two demonstrations also suggest 
that violations occurred under the Fourth Geneva Convention and Principle 5 of the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. 
</p>
<p>1432. The impermissible use of force that resulted in injury rather than death is in clear violation 
of a number of standards, including articles 7 and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>1433. The use of snipers and lethal ammunitions against demonstrators in situations where there 
is no threat to soldiers&#8217; lives or to the lives of others under their protection appears to indicate an 
intention, or at least recklessness, to cause harm to civilians, which may amount to wilful killing. 
Several of the incidents reported to the Mission raise concerns in this regard.  
</p>
<p>1434. The discrimination in the open-fire regulations for security forces dealing with 
demonstrations based on the presence of persons of a particular nationality, violates the principle 
of non-discrimination of article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. These violations are all the more serious insofar as 
the regulations reflect a State policy based on discrimination.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Violence by Israeli security forces outside the context of demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>1435. Reports on incidents such as the raid on Haris of March 2009 and the types of acts 
described by Colonel Virob, as well as those described in affidavits reviewed by the Mission 
raise concerns with regard to their compliance with article 32 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 16 of the 
Convention against Torture on the prevention of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.  
</p>
<p><b>4. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>1436. The Mission emphasizes that effective investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution 
resulting from acts by its agents or by third parties involving deprivation of life, serious injuries 
and torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and other possible violations of 
international humanitarian law and human rights law, is an obligation of the State of Israel. The 
Mission is concerned that the facts before it point to a failure by Israel to do so with regard to 
acts committed against Palestinians as reported above.  
</p>
<p><b>5. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1437. The Mission is alarmed at both the reported increase in settler violence over the past year 
and the failure of the Israeli security forces to prevent settler attacks against Palestinian civilians 
and their property.  
</p>
<p>1438. The Mission is also gravely concerned at the increased use of force, including the use of 
lethal force, in response to demonstrations, and at the generalized violence of security forces 
against Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank. Of particular concern is the 
apparent and systematic lack of accountability for acts of violence committed by Israeli security 
forces against Palestinian civilians.  
</p>
<p>1439. While the filming of incidents has led to the exposure of particular grave incidents of 
violence, the Mission is also concerned about violence that may have occurred out of sight gone 
unreported.  
</p>
<p>1440. In the opinion of the Mission, a line has been crossed, what is fallaciously considered 
acceptable &#8220;wartime behaviour&#8221; has become the norm. Public support for a more hard-line 
attitude towards Palestinians generally,<b>761</b> lack of public censure and lack of accountability<b>762</b> all 
combine to increase the already critical level of violence against the protected population.   
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>761</b> As stated by a number of interviewees, such as Sarit Michaeli during a telephone interview, 5 August 2009. 
<b>762</b> Michael Sfard, a prominent Israeli human rights lawyer, concludes in an article entitled &#8220;The price of internal 
legal opposition to human rights abuses&#8221;, in which he reviews 35 years of human rights practice in Israel, &#8220;by 
lodging petitions to the Israeli High Court, human rights lawyers act as public relations agents of the occupation by 
promoting the notion that Palestinian residents have a recourse to justice.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>XXI. DETENTION OF PALESTINIANS IN ISRAELI PRISONS 
</b></p>
<p>1441. According to estimates, as at 1 June 2009, there were approximately 8,100 Palestinian 
&#8220;political prisoners&#8221; in detention in Israel, including 60 women and around 390 children.<b>763</b> Most 
of these detainees are charged or convicted by the Israeli military court system that operates for 
Palestinians in the West Bank. The most common convictions are for stone-throwing. Being a 
&#8220;member of an illegal organization&#8221; is another common charge.<b>764</b> All but one of the Israeli 
prisons holding Palestinians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory are located inside Israel.<b>765</b> 
</p>
<p>1442. As at June 2009, of all the Palestinians held by Israel for reasons related to the occupation, 
512 were held without charge or trial, of whom 12 were held under the Israeli Unlawful 
Combatants Law and 500 as &#8220;administrative detainees&#8221;.<b>766</b>, <b>767</b> 
</p>
<p>1443. The military courts system has been specifically set up by Israel to deal with Palestinians 
from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, while Israeli citizens living or otherwise present in the 
West Bank, if arrested, are dealt with under the Israeli civilian legal system. The Palestinian 
Authority is not allowed to arrest or detain Israeli citizens.<b>768</b> 
</p>
<p>1444. It is estimated that during the past 43 years of occupation, approximately 700,000 
Palestinian men, women and children have been detained under Israeli military orders.<b>769</b> Israel 
argues that these detentions are necessary on grounds of security.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>763</b> Estimates vary. The Mission is using figures provided by Addameer, Prisoners Support and Human Rights 
Association at 1 June 2009. Its General Director, Ms. Sahar Francis, explained at the public hearing in Geneva on 
7 July 2009 that its statistics were based on monthly figures published by the Israeli prison authority and on its own 
monthly visits to detention facilities in Israel. The organization also attempted to collect direct information from the 
prisoners. Providing exact statistics was difficult as these figures changed daily, with new arrests and releases. She 
mentioned, for example, that in 2008, the Israeli military arrested more than 4,000 people, so the average was 
around 300 per day. Addameer defines as &#8220;political prisoners&#8221; those prisoners detained in relation with the 
occupation, as opposed to detainees suspected or convicted of crimes/offences unrelated to the occupation.  
<b>764</b> Ms. Sahar Francis, testimony at the public hearing, Geneva, 7 July 2009.  
<b>765</b> See &#8220;Yesh Din Petitions HCJ: Stop holding Palestinian detainees inside Israel. Yesh Din, along with the 
Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual, filed a 
petition to the HCJ on March 25, 2009 demanding that prisoners and detainees who reside in the West Bank not be 
held in facilities within Israel, and that arraignment hearings for such detainees also not be held in courts outside the 
West Bank&#8221;. See also, for instance, <i>Backyard Proceedings&#8230;</i>. See also http://www.hamoked.org/. See also Lisa 
Hajjar, <i>Courting Conflict: The Israeli Military Court System in the West Bank and Gaza</i> (University of California 
Press, 2005). 
<b>766</b>  Figures provided by Addameer for 1 June 2009. 
<b>767</b> The original military order dealing specifically with administrative detention is Military Order No. 1226. 
Subsequent amendments to it have each received different numbers. The most recent is: Order regarding 
Administrative Detentions (Temporary Order) [Combined version] (Judea and Samaria) (No. 1591), 2007. See also 
Addameer, &#8220;Administrative detention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: A legal analysis report&#8221;, November 2008. 
<b>768</b> The Palestinian-Israeli Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, annex IV, Protocol Concerning 
Legal Affairs, art. I.  
<b>769</b> A/HRC/7/17. </p>

 <p> 
1445. Due process rights for Palestinians in the Israeli military court system are severely limited. 
Military Order No. 378, which is the main source regulating detention and trial, allows for a 
Palestinian detainee from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including children as young as 12, 
to be held for up to eight days before being brought before a military judge (Israeli detainees 
must be brought before a judge within 48 hours). Moreover, Palestinian detainees can be held for 
up to 90 days without access to a lawyer<b> </b>(compared to 48 hours for Israeli detainees).<b>770</b> 
Palestinian detainees can be held for up to 188 days before being charged (an Israeli detainee 
must be charged within 30 days).<b>771</b>   
</p>
<p>1446. Accusations of torture and other ill-treatment during arrest, interrogation and detention are 
common, while the court system is criticized for the use of coerced evidence.<b>772</b> It is also alleged 
that complaints about the ill-treatment of detainees rarely lead to investigations or to prosecution, 
let alone conviction.<b>773</b> The Israeli military court system treats Palestinian children as adults from 
the age of 16.<b>774</b> Israeli citizens, however, are considered adults only from the age of 18. 
</p>
<p>1447. Palestinian prisoners are reportedly held in substandard detention facilities (for example, 
Ktziot prison houses prisoners in tents) with very limited access to health care and education.<b>775</b> 
Detention inside Israel also means that many detainees do not receive family visits, as their 
relatives are prohibited from entering Israel (see chap. XXII).  
</p>
<p>1448. During the Israeli military operations in Gaza, scores of Gazans were detained by the 
Israeli armed forces. A portion of those were taken to prisons inside Israel, where some remain at 
the time of writing. This is discussed in chapter XV. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Issues linked to Israel&#8217;s December-January military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Differential treatment of Gaza prisoners</b> 
</p>
<p>1449. After its disengagement from Gaza in August 2005, Israel ceased to apply its military 
orders to Gaza and began to prosecute Gaza detainees under domestic criminal law. In June 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>770</b> Articles 78c and d of Military Order No. 378 &#8220;Order Concerning Security Directives&#8221; and the Israeli Criminal 
Procedure (Powers of Enforcement &#8211; Detention) Law 1996. 
<b>771</b> See also, for instance, <i>Backyard Proceedings&#8230;</i>. See also http://www.hamoked.org. 
<b>772</b> In its review of Israel in May 2009, the United Nations Committee against Torture expressed concern inter alia at 
the &#8220;numerous, ongoing and consistent allegations&#8221; of the use of methods of interrogation contrary to the 
Convention (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4). See also the United Against Torture coalition&#8217;s three &#8220;Alternative Reports&#8221; to the 
Committee, September 2008; United Against Torture Report, April 2009; examples of torture practised in the 
briefing by PCATI and the World Organisation against Torture to the Committee (April 2009); Amnesty 
International&#8217;s report to the Committee.

<b>774</b> See Military Order No. 132. 
<b>775</b> On child detainees, see below; on female detainees, see, for instance, Addameer, &#8220;In need of protection: 
Palestinian female prisoners in Israeli detention&#8221;, November 2008. </p>

 <p> 
2006, the Knesset passed a law<b>776</b> which alters existing Israeli criminal law due process 
guarantees by, for example, allowing a detainee to be held incommunicado for 21 days (after an 
initial appearance before a judge within 96 hours).<b>777</b> 
</p>
<p>1450. The Law does not discriminate. However, in practice, it is applied only to Palestinian 
suspects, whether Palestinians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory or Palestinian citizens of 
Israel. According to estimates submitted to the Knesset&#8217;s Constitution, Law and Justice 
Committee by the head of the investigations unit of the General Security Services  concerning 
the applicability of the Law, &#8220;over 90 per cent of detainees (to whom this Law was applied) were 
from the Gaza Strip, but there were cases of detainees who are not from the Gaza Strip such as 
East Jerusalem and the Arab-Israeli&#8230; who are Israeli civilians.&#8221;<b>778</b> 
</p>
<p>1451. The Law was extended in January 2008. In January 2009 a petition submitted to the Israeli 
High Court of Justice by ACRI, PCATI and Adalah was heard. The Court criticized many 
aspects of the law, but the Government argued that it had secret materials that explained why 
such a law was necessary. In March 2009, the Court decided, on the basis of the secret evidence 
provided by the State, that the restrictions imposed by the Law were legal and proportionate.<b>779</b> 
In protest against the Court&#8217;s use of secret evidence to determine the constitutionality of the 
Law, the human rights organizations withdrew their petition.<b>780</b>

<p><b>(a) Unlawful Combatants Law 
</b></p>
<p>1452. The Israeli Internment of Unlawful Combatants Law 2002 provides for the indefinite 
detention of &#8220;foreign&#8221; nationals.<b>781</b> It offers a lower level of protection than the Law described 
above. In addition, it provides for a lower burden of proof and a higher threshold for judicial 
review.<b>782</b> In its submission to the Committee against Torture, the United Against Torture 
                                                 
<b>776</b> Criminal Procedure (Enforcement Powers &#8211; Detention) (Detainee Suspected of Security Offence) (Temporary 
Order) Law 2006. 
<b>777</b> Compared to detainees held under the regular criminal procedural law, who have to be brought before a judge 
within 24 hours, or 48 hours, as per the Criminal Procedure (Powers of Enforcement &#8211; Arrests) Law &#8211; 1996. The 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism commented, on 5 July 2006, following the adoption on 27 June 2006 by the Knesset of Law 5765 &#8211; 2006 
&quot;Criminal Procedure (Enforcement Powers &#8211; Detention) (Detainees Suspected of Security Offences) (Temporary 
Provision)&quot;: &#8220;The law still does not provide all the necessary procedural safeguards for individuals detained for 
security reasons. In particular, the law provides that an individual may be held in detention for up to 96 hours before 
being brought before a judge and may not be present in court when a decision on the extension of the detention is 
made during the period when he is barred from contact with a legal counsel. In addition, while the provisions on 
access to legal counsel have not been worsened by this new law, the 21 days of detention without access to legal 
counsel authorized by the detention law currently in force remain incompatible with international human rights law&#8221; 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.1).

 <p> 
coalition of NGOs concludes that &#8220;an examination of its provisions suggests that the goal behind 
the law is to allow Israel to hold suspects as hostages who can be used as bargaining chips in 
future negotiations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1453. According to this Law, a person is designated an &#8220;unlawful combatant&#8221; by the Chief of 
General Staff. The definition the Law gives to the concept of &#8220;unlawful combatant&#8221; is: 
</p>
<p>  a person who has participated either directly or indirectly in hostile acts against the 
State of Israel or is a member of a force perpetrating hostile acts against the State of Israel, 
where the conditions prescribed in article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention of 
12th August 1949 with respect to prisoners-of-war and granting prisoner-of-war status in 
international humanitarian law, do not apply to him (art. 2). 
</p>
<p>1454. The amendments made to the Law in July 2008, which included lengthening the time 
detainees can be held before they must be brought before a judge and before they must be 
allowed access to a lawyer, were challenged and upheld on appeal. Israel&#8217;s Court of Criminal 
Appeals considered the Law constitutional and consistent with international humanitarian law.<b>783</b> 
</p>
<p>1455. Detention under this Law does not require admission of guilt or the existence of evidence 
acceptable as part of fair trial standards. According to Al-Mezan, &#8220;this law essentially licenses 
the military to hold individuals arbitrarily and indefinitely, on the basis of assumed rather than 
proven guilt that they are conducting direct or indirect activities that could harm the security of 
Israel or are affiliated to groups working to harm the security of Israel.&#8221;<b>784</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Gaza and the ICRC Family Visits Programme 
</b></p>
<p>1456. On 6 June 2007, the Israeli authorities suspended the ICRC Family Visits Programme in 
the Gaza Strip, effectively barring all means of communication between Gazan prisoners and the 
outside world.<b>785</b> Before the new arrests of Gazan residents during Israel&#8217;s latest offensive in the 
Gaza Strip (see chapter XV), the ban affected approximately 900 prisoners and their families. In 
June 2009, ICRC called for the ban to be lifted.<b>786</b> 
</p>
<p>1457. According to Addameer, the timing of the decision to ban family visits coincided with 
factional fighting in the Gaza Strip which was followed by Hamas&#8217; seizing of control, a party 
which Israel does not recognize and defines as a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; organization. Therefore, the decision 
to suspend the programme appears to be a form of collective punishment intended to coerce 
Palestinians to respond to Israel&#8217;s demands in terms of Palestinian leadership.<b>787</b> On 17 June 
2008, Adalah filed a petition on behalf of Gazan prisoners&#8217; families, Al-Mezan and the

Association for the Palestinian Prisoners, challenging the legality of the ban on visits.<b>788</b> At the 
time of writing, this petition remained pending.<b>789</b> In October 2008, the Government of Israel 
submitted arguments to the Supreme Court to suggest that the State is not obliged to permit 
families from Gaza to visit their relatives incarcerated in Israeli prisons.<b>790</b> 
</p>
<p>1458. In addition, during the December-January military operations in Gaza, Adalah filed a 
petition demanding that Gazan prisoners should be allowed to use the telephone to contact 
family members. Not allowing this, Adalah argues, violates detainees&#8217; right to dignity and their 
right to family life, and &#8220;transforms their imprisonment to a humiliating and degrading 
experience that contradicts international norms and conventions, in particular the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.&#8221;<b>791</b> According to Adalah, the Prison Authority replied that they 
allowed each detainee to use the telephone once. Some prisoners confirmed to Adalah that they 
had been allowed to use the telephone, but others said that they were not allowed to do so on the 
grounds that they did not present a certificate proving that a close relative had passed away 
during the offensive.<b>792</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Increase in children from the West Bank arrested and detained  
during or after the military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1459. The Mission received information that during the Israeli military operations in Gaza the 
numbers of children from the West Bank detained by Israel increased. According to Defence for 
Children International &#8211; Palestine Section, the figures for January and February were 389 and 
423, compared with 327 and 307 the previous year and a monthly average of 319 in 2008. Many 
of these children were reportedly arrested on the street and/or during demonstrations.<b>793</b> Defence 
for Children International also found that their average age changed: for the 12&#8211;15 age range, the 
percentage is usually 23; in January&#8211;February 2009, it was 36.<b>794</b> In January&#8211;March, it 
represented 69 children in the Israeli military courts. As of 20 June 2009, eight of these children

Israeli military courts in pretrial hearings, while the normal monthly average is 10-15. Many of these children were 
arrested from the street and/or during demonstrations.&#8221;

were released without charge, while among the 61 charged, 47 were sentenced and 14 are still 
awaiting trial.<b>795</b> 
</p>
<p>1460. Defence for Children International also found that there was a change in the percentages 
of children charged with particular offences in the first three months of 2009: in 2008, 27 per 
cent of children had been charged with throwing stones, as opposed to 61 per cent in the period 
covered by the report. &#8220;During OCL, the army didn&#8217;t want to lose control of the West Bank, so 
they came down like a tonne of bricks on demonstrations.&#8221; It concludes &#8220;The fact that many of 
these children were younger than the average child detainee and the fact that the majority were 
charged with minor offences suggest that this increase is the result of children&#8217;s participation in a 
high number of demonstrations in the West Bank during Operation Cast Lead, and the increased 
use of force, including mass arrest, by Israeli authorities to suppress and discourage these 
protests.&#8221;<b>796</b>

</p>
<p>1461. One of the cases recorded by Defence for Children International is summarized as 
follows:  
</p>
<p><b>Ahmad Q.: 15-year-old boy arrested on 1 January 2009 and accused of 
throwing stones. </b>On 1 January 2009, Ahmad was protesting against the war in Gaza near 
Qalandiya checkpoint. He was arrested by soldiers and dragged 100 metres to a jeep. He 
was slapped and kicked, had his hands tied with plastic cords and he was blindfolded. He 
was transferred to Atarot for interrogation, made to sit outside in the cold until 4 a.m., 
transferred to Ofer prison, and then to prisons inside Israel. He was charged with throwing 
stones and sentenced to four and a half months in prison and fined NIS 1,000. 
</p>
<p>1462. The Israeli operations in Gaza caused a wave of demonstrations that did not end with the 
operations. Child detentions continued to be high in February and March, with the high 
percentage of children charged with stone-throwing indicating that they were detained during 
demonstrations. Defence for Children International reports two incidents of mass arrests of 
                                                 
<b>795</b> Submission to the Mission, p. 4. Defence for Children International &#8211; Palestine Section estimates that it

 <p> 
children after demonstrations in January and March 2009, including one in the village of Haris, 
where the Israeli armed forces entered the village at around midnight and rounded up about 90 
children, detaining them in a school for almost a day, before finally arresting four of them.<b>798</b> 
The same incident was referred to in the British media and included testimony by Col. Itai Virob 
commander of the Kfir Brigade:  
</p>
<p>The worst beatings were in the bathrooms, he said. &quot;The soldiers who took 
[detainees] to the toilet just exploded [over] them with beatings; cursed them with no 
reason. When they took one Arab to the toilet so that he could urinate, one of them gave 
him a slap that brought him to the ground. He had been handcuffed from behind with a 
nylon restraint and blindfolded. He wasn't insolent, he didn't do anything to get on 
anyone's nerves... [it was] just because he's an Arab. He was something like 15 years 
old.&#8221;<b>799</b> 
</p>
<p>1463. On 6 March 2009, the President of Defence for Children International wrote to the Israeli 
Minister of Justice, Daniel Friedmann, seeking an explanation for the sharp increase in the 
number of Palestinian children being detained by Israel and notified the United Nations 
Committee on the Rights of the Child of these developments. At the time of writing, there had 
been no response.<b>800</b> 
</p>
<p>1464. In its report on Israel&#8217;s detention of Palestinian children, Defence for Children 
International concluded that the abuse of Palestinian children by Israeli authorities is systematic 
and institutionalized.<b>801</b> 
</p>
<p>1465. In a statement issued in support of this report, UNICEF, WHO, OHCHR and local and 
international child protection agencies (together the 1612 Working Group on Grave Violations 
against Children) stated that, &#8220;Israeli military courts violate many basic fair trial rights according 
to international humanitarian and human rights law&#8230; For example, in almost all cases, the 
primary evidence used to convict children is a confession obtained through coercive 
interrogations carried out in the absence of a lawyer. The most common charge made against 
children was stone-throwing (about 27 per cent), which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
.... With the potential for harsh sentences, approximately 95 per cent of cases end in the child 
pleading guilty, whether the offence was committed or not.&#8221;<b>802</b> 
</p>
<p>1466. A former Israeli military commander told the BBC that Palestinian youngsters are 
routinely ill-treated by Israeli soldiers while in custody. The BBC website item included a video 
of a young Palestinian boy being arrested at night. Col. Efrati, who had left the army five months

previously, said: &#8220;I never arrested anyone younger than nine or 10, but 14, 13, 11 for me, they're 
still kids. But they're arrested like adults. Every soldier who was in the Occupied Territories can 
tell you the same story. The first months after I left the army I dreamed about kids all the time. 
Jewish kids. Arab kids. Screaming.&#8221;<b>803</b> He added, &#8220;Maybe [the kid is] blindfolded for him not to 
see the base and how we&#8217;re working... But I believe maybe we put the blindfold because we 
don't want to see his eyes. You don&#8217;t want him to look at us - you know, beg us to stop, or cry in 
front of us. It&#8217;s a lot easier if we don&#8217;t see his eyes.&#8221;<b>804</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council 
</b></p>
<p>1467. In September 2005, i.e. some months before the Palestinian Legislative Council elections, 
the Israeli military conducted a two-day arrest campaign in which 450 persons affiliated with the 
political parties Hamas and Islamic Jihad were detained. These individuals had been involved in 
either, or both, the municipal elections or the Council elections. Most were kept in administrative 
detention and many were released just before or after the Palestinian Legislative Council 
elections on 25 January 2006. Some candidates were elected while in detention. A number of 
those released were subsequently rearrested.<b>805</b> 
</p>
<p>1468. Hamas had taken part in municipal elections in 2005 and in Council elections in mid-
2005. While Hamas is considered an unlawful organization by Israel,<b>806</b> its candidates 
participated under a list named &#8220;Change and Reform Bloc&#8221;, underlining the main election pledge 
of reforming the system. Not all candidates and elected persons on that list were members of 
Hamas; some independent candidates joined the list, including a number of Palestinian 
Christians.<b>807</b> 
</p>
<p>1469. Israel had not banned the Change and Reform Bloc from participating in the elections, 
which were supported by the international community.<b>808</b> Reportedly, Israel had agreed the list of 
proposed candidates for the elections with the Palestinian Authority<b>809</b> and facilitated voting on 
the day.<b>810</b> However, the mass arrests in September 2005 hampered campaigning and

The Mission met Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the Council for the Palestinian National 
Initiative, who reported being arrested and beaten while attempting to campaign for the elections 
in Jerusalem.<b>811</b> 
</p>
<p>1470. Nevertheless, the &#8220;Change and Reform&#8221; list won the elections, gaining 74 seats out of 
132, which is said to have come as a surprise to all involved. The tenth Government was 
inaugurated on 20 March 2006 and included a number of non-Hamas ministers.<b>812</b> 
</p>
<p>1471. As referred to in chapters II and XVIII, on 24 June 2006, an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, 
was captured by Palestinian armed groups based in Gaza. The Government of Israel held the 
Palestinian Authority fully responsible for his capture &#8220;with all this implies&#8221;. It made it clear that 
it would &#8220;take all necessary actions&#8221; to bring about his release and that &#8220;no person or 
organization will have immunity at this time&#8221;.<b>813</b> On 29 June, the Israeli armed forces arrested 
some 65 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, mayors and ministers. Most were 
Hamas members.<b>814</b> They were taken from their homes during the night. Interviewees described 
situations where up to 20 jeeps surrounded a Council member&#8217;s home or where their homes were 
ransacked, and computers and papers taken.<b>815</b> 
</p>
<p>1472. According to Mr. Fadi Qawasme, lawyer to most of the detained Council members, the 
members detained on 29 June were prevented from having access to lawyers for a week, during 
which time they were interrogated. Some refused to cooperate; others openly admitted that they 
were members of Change and Reform. Some were released; others were kept in detention and 
charged with &#8220;membership of a terrorist organization&#8221;,<b>816</b> or held under administrative detention 
orders. The prosecution requested that all should be remanded in custody pending trial, a period 
which took two years. Mr. Qawasme protested against the charges on the grounds that members 
of the Council should have immunity from prosecution; that they did not recognize the 
jurisdiction of the court (those arrested should have come under the jurisdiction of the 
Palestinian Authority according to the Oslo Accords) and argued that Israel had accepted the 
participation of Change and Reform in the elections.<b>817</b> 
</p>
<p>1473. Also according to Mr. Qawasme, the Court initially accepted the arguments and proposed 
releasing all on bail. The prosecution appealed and rejected the lawyer&#8217;s arguments, claiming 
that Israel had not allowed Hamas to participate in the elections, and that &#8220;Change and Reform&#8221;

military jeep. They drove her to her office, which they entered by force and from which they 
took her computer hard disc and many papers. She was then taken to al-Maskobiya (an 
interrogation centre in Jerusalem), where she was held for a month. She reported being 
interrogated for three-day stretches from 8 a.m. to 5 a.m. the next morning. Dr. Saleh further 
reported that her son and husband were brought to the interrogation centre in order to pressure 
her into confessing that she was a member of Hamas.<b>820</b> 
</p>
<p>1475. The interviewees related that, as most members were in their fifties or sixties, detention 
was hard to cope with and a particularly humiliating experience.<b>821</b> They spoke of a lack of 
access to medical assistance and proper medication, of ailments worsening because of the dire 
detention conditions, of a lack of adequate food, and of specific dietary adjustment for a diabetic 
patient for instance. They further spoke of humiliation by prison guards (who initially found it 
amusing to have, for example, a minister as prisoner), of attempts to gain confessions by 
collaborators, of the use of stress positions and of sleep deprivation. They further reported 
extremely difficult transport conditions, being enclosed in a car with a dog, for example, or being 
shackled hands and feet inside a bus for 12 hours at a time with no water or access to a toilet. 
The trips from prison to court and back could take many days, with the bus stopping at a number 
of different prisons on the way picking up and dropping off passengers, and the detainees being 
tied up and crammed for lengthy periods despite some being elderly and in poor health. One

<b>821</b> According to PCATI, even seemingly innocuous measures such as cuffing (both hands and feet) are used in a 
deliberate way. Painful shackling is done for invalid and irrelevant reasons, which include causing pain and 
suffering, punishment, intimidation, and illegally eliciting information and confessions. The practice of shackling 
may be used by the various authorities as a tool for dehumanizing Palestinian detainees subject to the control of the 
occupying Power. PCATI, &#8220;Shackling as a form of torture and abuse&#8221;, Periodic Report, June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
interviewee reported having spent altogether about 350 days, &#8220;almost a year&#8221;, on such multi-day 
trips.<b>822</b> 
</p>
<p>1476. Interviewees reported extremely limited family visits, with one being told his mother was 
not considered &#8220;immediate family&#8221; and not being allowed a visit from her for three years.<b>823</b> 
</p>
<p>1477. The former detainees interviewed by the Mission feared rearrest, at times had been 
rearrested, on the same charges, and reported trying to minimize their travel and public 
appearances.<b>824</b> One interviewee reported that, during his last detention, he had been given a two-
year suspended sentence, which would take him past any prospective election date. He added 
that, in any case, no one could stand in these elections for Hamas or Change and Reform, since 
doing so had become punishable and subject to three years&#8217; imprisonment.<b>825</b> All interviewees 
also reported family and friends receiving threats and being harassed by Palestinian Authority 
security forces.<b>826</b> 
</p>
<p>1478. According to B&#8217;Tselem, Israeli officials have made public statements relating the arrests 
of the Council members to political goals: 
</p>
<p>in an interview with [Associated Press] a few hours after the first wave of arrests, on 
29 June 2006, Major-General Yair Naveh, OC Central Command, said that the decision to 
arrest senior Palestinian officials was made by the political echelon and that they would be 
released upon the release of Gilad Shalit. In an interview with the army radio station on 
24 May 2007, the day that the second wave of arrests took place, the then Defense 
Minister, Amir Peretz, stated that &#8220;the arrest of those heads of Hamas is to show the 
military organizations that we demand that the firing stop.&#8221;<b>827</b> 
</p>
<p>1479. The Inter-Parliamentary Union has recently adopted a number of resolutions protesting 
against the arrest and detention of the Palestinian parliamentarians, including those from the 
Change and Reform Bloc. It notes that the Council members were sentenced to much longer 
periods in detention than persons convicted of military action and that &#8220;clearly, the intention was 
to keep them in prison for the rest of their parliamentary term.&#8221; It &#8220;considers that the rearrest of 
four Change and Reform parliamentarians following the failure of the negotiations regarding the 
release of Gilad Shalit and the simultaneous restrictions of the rights of political prisoners 
suggests that Israel is in fact holding the [Palestinian Legislative Council] members concerned as 
hostages.&#8221;<b>828</b>

<b>(b) Associated measures 
</b></p>
<p>1480. In May 2006, the Israeli Minister of Interior at the time, Roni Bar-On, decided to revoke 
the permanent residency status (i.e. the right to reside in Jerusalem under Israeli law) of four 
Council members (including the then Minister of Jerusalem Affairs). The letter received stated 
&#8220;Pursuant to [the Law of Entry into Israel], you are deemed to be a resident in the State of Israel. 
You are obliged to pay allegiance to the State of Israel. Nonetheless, your actions prove 
otherwise and indicate that your allegiance is paid to the Palestinian Authority.&#8221;<b>829</b> The members 
petitioned the Israeli High Court, while ACRI and Adalah submitted an amicus curiae brief, 
arguing that the Jerusalemites&#8217; reduction to permanent resident status of the city after it was 
annexed by Israel could not be removed. The human rights organizations argued that the 
residency status of the members was cancelled because the Government of Israel did not 
welcome the election result.<b>830</b> The petition was filed at the Israeli High Court of Justice 
contesting the status removal or de facto exile, in 2006, but it is still pending.<b>831</b> Potentially, a 
ruling that Jerusalem residency can be revoked on the basis of a lack of loyalty to Israel could 
have extremely far-reaching consequences for the Palestinian residents of occupied East 
Jerusalem. Until now Israeli law has allowed the revocation of Jerusalem residency rights only of 
Palestinians who are unable to prove that their &#8220;centre of life&#8221; is in Jerusalem.<b>832</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>1481. In January 2009, during the Israeli operation in Gaza, the Israeli armed forces once again 
arrested a number of Hamas leaders on 1 and 9 January 2009. 
</p>
<p>1482. Addameer comments &#8220;the timing of the waves of arrests indicates that the arrests were 
intended to put pressure on the Palestinian people and its leadership.&#8221;<b>833</b> Interviewees have 
indicated that the arrest campaigns effectively work as deterrence. They report having family 
members, colleagues and employees arrested by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  
</p>
<p>1483. In March, two Council members and former detainees interviewed by the Mission 
reported that a group of detainees associated with Hamas were given mobile telephones and 
asked to meet as a group and to intervene in the negotiations surrounding the release of Gilad 
Shalit. According to the interviewees, detainees were gathered from different prisons for this 
meeting in Ktziot prison in the Negev. Some detainees were brought out of solitary confinement 
for this purpose, while solitary confinement is normally imposed because allowing these specific

<b>833</b> &#8220;The arrest and detention&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
detainees to meet and speak with others is considered a security risk.<b>834</b> On this occasion, the 
group of senior Hamas detainees (Council members and other leaders) were asked to call other 
Hamas leaders in Gaza and Damascus to influence the negotiations over Gilad Shalit and the 
prisoner exchange. However, they decided not to cooperate, stating that they were not free to 
confer or negotiate from detention.<b>835</b>  
</p>
<p>1484. According to Addameer, a few hours after Hamas declared an end to the negotiations for 
the release of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli armed forces conducted a series of raids into the West 
Bank towns of Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem, and arrested four Council members, 
the former Deputy Prime Minister of the 10th Government, a university professor and a Hamas 
leader.<b>836</b> For PCHR these arrests &#8220;could be acts of pressure exerted by Israel on the Hamas 
leadership in order to resolve the case of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and conclude the 
prisoner exchange.&#8221;<b>837</b> Ms. Sahar Francis of Addameer commented: 
</p>
<p>It is unthinkable that the Israeli Government first engages in a political process and 
negotiations with Hamas, and then kidnaps 10 political leaders, associated with the 
movement and uses them as bargaining chips. This is not only a form of collective 
punishment, which in itself is a violation of international humanitarian law, but also a 
politically counterproductive move.<b>838</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(d) The downgrading of Hamas prisoners&#8217; detention conditions 
</b></p>
<p>1485. On 18 March 2009, the Israeli Justice Minister, Daniel Friedmann, established a 
committee to &#8220;work to reduce privileges afforded Hamas and Islamic Jihad security 
prisoners&#8221;.<b>839</b> He reportedly announced in the media that the downgrade was intended &#8220;to match 
[these prisoners&#8217;] conditions of incarceration to those of Gilad Shalit&#8221;.<b>840</b> The Mission 
interviewed two former Hamas detainees who confirmed that from the end of March they had 
stopped receiving newspapers and books and had their &#8220;recreation&#8221; time reduced to 3 hours per

<b>840</b> Quoted by HaMoked in its &#8220;Position paper regarding the proposal for downgrading the incarceration conditions

 <p> 
day.<b>841</b> According to HaMoked, the decision to create the committee &#8220;establishes the use of a 
large group of prisoners as &#8216;bargaining chips&#8217; until the resolution of a matter to which they have 
no connection and which they cannot influence.&#8221;<b>842</b> According to Addameer, &#8220;on 29 March the 
Israeli Government accepted recommendations presented by a special Ministerial Committee 
aiming at downgrading detention conditions of prisoners identified with Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad.&#8221;<b>843</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Effect of the detention of the Palestinian Legislative Council&#8217;s members: disabling 
the legislative and enabling the executive 
</b></p>
<p>1486. The detention of the Council&#8217;s members has meant that it has been unable to function for 
three years and no laws have been passed. According to ICHR, it has not been able to exercise its 
oversight function over the Government&#8217;s administrative and financial performance, &#8220;whether 
through the questioning, granting/withholding confidence, or holding the Government 
accountable, or inquiry of finding the facts in cases of grave violations of Palestinian human 
rights during 2008.&#8221;<b>844</b> 
</p>
<p>1487. Conversely, the executive authority in the West Bank has played a major role in 
legislative policymaking &#8211; where the Government has referred a number of laws to the President, 
and the President issued 11 decisions with the power of law in 2008.<b>845</b> The Palestinian Basic 
Law provides that a caretaker government may, in exceptional circumstances which cannot be 
postponed, issue decisions with the power of law; however these must be submitted to the 
Council at the first available session and be approved or cease to have power of law. ICHR 
argues that some of the laws issued by the President of the Palestinian Authority represent a 
retreat from the legal guarantees for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of 
Palestinian citizens (see chap. XXIII). 
</p>
<p><b>B. Legal analysis and conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1488. The detention practices mentioned in the introduction to this chapter have been found by 
various United Nations bodies to be in violation of international human rights and humanitarian 
law. In the analysis that follows, the Mission has restricted itself to analysing the specific 
violations relevant to its mandate.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. The military court system and Israel&#8217;s detention of Palestinians  
from the Occupied Palestinian Territory in general 
</b></p>
<p>1489. International law gives the occupying Power the right to detain members of the protected 
population both for criminal offences and for imperative security reasons (see below under 
&#8220;administrative detention&#8221;). According to international humanitarian law, as an exception to the 
preservation of legal conditions in the occupied territory, the occupying Power can &#8220;subject the 
population of the occupied territory to provisions which are essential to enable the occupying 
Power to fulfil its obligations under the present Convention&#8221; (article 64 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention). It can establish military courts to prosecute local residents for violations of these 
provisions (art. 66), which should be &#8220;properly constituted, non-political&#8221;, a requirement 
intended to prevent the use of such courts for political or racist persecution, and they should &#8220;sit 
in the occupied territory&#8221;, a provision which is intended to ensure due process for detainees and 
accused persons brought before them.<b>846</b> 
</p>
<p>1490. Articles 67 to 75 of the Fourth Geneva Convention contain a number of fair trial 
guarantees the military courts should offer, including the right to choose a defence lawyer, who 
shall be able to visit freely (art. 72). However, based on information received by the Mission, 
even this most basic principle is not normally complied with in the Israeli military court system. 
</p>
<p>1491. Article 9 (3) of ICCPR requires anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge to be 
brought promptly before a judge and to be brought to trial within a reasonable time or to be 
released. The provisions of Israeli Military Order No. 378 are not in line with this requirement. 
</p>
<p><b>2. The use of detention in the context of the Mission&#8217;s mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1492. The detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and their conviction for 
being members of a particular political party violate the prohibition on discrimination based on 
political belief, contrary to article 26 of ICCPR:  
</p>
<p>All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to 
the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination 
and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any 
ground such as race, colour, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status.  
</p>
<p>1493. In addition they violate article 25: 
</p>
<p>Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the 
distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: (a) to take part in 
the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; (b) to vote 
and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal 
suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of 
the electors [&#8230;].  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>846</b> Jean S. Pictet (ed.), <i>Commentary: The Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
in Time of War </i>(Geneva, ICRC, 1958), pp. 335-336. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1494. The Mission finds that the detentions, insofar as they were carried out in response to 
political events unrelated to the individual members detained, may amount to collective 
punishment, contrary to article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention: 
</p>
<p>No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally 
committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism 
are prohibited. 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;] 
</p>
<p>Reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited. 
</p>
<p>1495. The facts gathered by the Mission also indicate a violation of the right not to be arbitrarily 
detained as protected by article 9 (1) of ICCPR: 
</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such 
grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Detention of children 
</b></p>
<p>1496. Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention requires that proper regard should be paid to 
the special treatment due to minors in detention. The facts gathered by the Mission indicate that 
Palestinian minors are not given the special treatment due to them, in particular minors aged 16 
and 17, who are treated as adults.  
</p>
<p>1497. Article 37 (b) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that &#8220;the arrest, 
detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only 
as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate time.&#8221; This requirement appears to 
have been violated by the detention of children in large numbers during or following 
demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>1498. The detention of large numbers of children and others participating in demonstrations may 
also be contrary to the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders relating to the 
protection of the right to protest against violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>1499. Reports of ill-treatment of children by Israeli security forces, described above, indicate 
violations of article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Additional legal issues 
</b></p>
<p>1500. The removal of residency status (of the Council members from East Jerusalem) based on 
their (implied) refusal to pay allegiance to Israel constitutes a violation of article 45 of the Hague 
Regulations which provides that &#8220;it is forbidden to compel the inhabitants of occupied territory 
to swear allegiance to the hostile Power,&#8221; which is also part of customary international law. 
</p>
<p>1501. The removal of residency status could additionally amount to deportation, which violates 
the Fourth Geneva Convention, article 49. In addition, it violates the individual&#8217;s freedom to 
choose his residency (article 12 of ICCPR), which, on the face of it, cannot be justifiably </p>

 <p> 
curtailed under the exceptions foreseen by article 12 (3). If such curtailment is based on political 
belief it is prima facie inconsistent with articles 2 (non-discrimination) and 19 (freedom of 
opinion) of ICCPR. In addition, the revocation could constitute an unlawful interference with 
family life, contrary to article 17, as well as the right to family life in article 23, where residency 
status revocation means the family can no longer live together as one unit.<b>847</b> 
</p>
<p>1502. The systematic discrimination, both in law and in practice, against Palestinians in 
legislation (including the existence of an entirely separate legal and court system which offers 
systematically worse conditions than that applicable to Israelis) and practice during arrest, 
detention, trial and sentencing compared with Israeli citizens<b>848</b> is contrary to ICCPR, article 2, 
and potentially in violation of the prohibition on persecution as a crime against humanity.<b>849</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1503. The Mission is concerned about the detention of children and adults on political grounds, 
in poor conditions and outside the occupied territory in violation of international humanitarian 
law. The Mission notes the very high number of Palestinians who have been detained since the 
beginning of the occupation (amounting to 40 per cent of the adult male population of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory) according to a practice that appears to aim at exercising control, 
humiliating, instilling fear, deterring political activity and serving political interests.  
</p>
<p>1504. The Mission is equally concerned by the reports of coercion and torture during 
interrogations, trials based on coerced confessions or secret evidence, and the reportedly 
systematic and institutionalized ill-treatment in prisons. 
</p>
<p>1505. The Mission is particularly alarmed at the arrest and detention of hundreds of young 
children, and the rise in child detention during and following the Israeli military operations in 
Gaza. The ill-treatment of children and adults described to the Mission is disturbing in its 
seemingly deliberate cruelty. 
</p>
<p>1506. The legal instruments allowing for the indefinite detention of &#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221;, as 
well as enshrining the deficient due process regimes, the differential treatment of Palestinian and 
Israeli prisoners (including the differential definition of a &#8220;child&#8221;), and the exemptions de facto 
allowing for harsher interrogation techniques raise concerns about the legal system being a part 
of this practice, rendering it deliberate and systematic. 
</p>
<p>1507. The Mission notes with concern the arrest and lengthy detention of democratically elected 
Palestinian parliamentarians, which appears to be a deliberate act to interrupt the democratic 
functioning and self-governance of Palestinians.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>XXII. ISRAELI VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHT TO FREE  
MOVEMENT AND ACCESS 
</b></p>
<p>1508. In the West Bank, Israel has imposed a system of interlocking measures, only some of 
which are physical barriers that restrict the movement and access of Palestinians within the West 
Bank. This includes movement between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, between the 
West Bank and Israel, between the West Bank and Gaza and between the West Bank and the 
outside world and vice versa.  
</p>
<p>1509. Movement is restricted by physical obstacles, such as roadblocks, checkpoints and the 
Wall, but also by administrative measures, such as identity cards, permits, assigned residence, 
laws on family reunification and policies on the right to enter from abroad and the right of return 
for refugees. The restriction on the ability to move freely, without obstacle or delay, or without 
another person&#8217;s authorization, is often perceived as a humiliating experience.<b>850</b>

who are designated by Israel as Jerusalem residents,<b>851</b> citizens of Israel and special permit 
holders<b>852</b>. Special permits are rarely granted.<b>853</b>

infrastructure, for use by settlements,<b>854</b> buffer zones, military bases and military training

Palestinians are forbidden to use. A number of tunnels have been built under the road to enable

</p>
<p><b>A. Movement restrictions affecting the Mission&#8217;s work 
</b></p>
<p>1515. At the public hearing in Geneva on 6 July 2009, Mr. Shawan Jabarin of Al-Haq reported 
that tens of thousands of Palestinians today are subject to a travel ban imposed by Israel, 
preventing them from travelling abroad. Mr. Jabarin, whom the Mission heard in Geneva by way 
of videoconference, had been subject to such a travel ban since he became the director of Al-
Haq, the West Bank&#8217;s oldest human rights organization. Mr Jabarin challenged his travel ban in 
the Israeli High Court after he was prevented from travelling to the Netherlands to receive a 
human rights prize, but the ban was upheld on the basis of &#8216;secret evidence&#8217;.<b>864</b> Mr. Jabarin 
believed that the ban was imposed as punishment. On 3 July 2009, the Mission also spoke with 
Khalida Jarrar, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council for the Palestinian Liberation 
Front Party, by telephone conference, as she too was unable to travel out of the West Bank 
because of an Israeli-imposed travel ban. Ms Jarrar, who prior to her election to the Palestinian 
Legislative Council in 2006 directed the prisoners&#8217; rights organization Addameer, told the 
Mission that she had not been allowed to travel out of the West Bank since attending the Human 
Rights Defenders Summit in Paris in 1998.<b>865</b>  
</p>
<p>1516. The Mission has already referred to the fact that the Palestinian Minister for Justice, 
Dr. Ali Khashan, was unable to leave the West Bank to meet the Mission in Amman, Jordan he 
had been prevented from crossing the border.<b>866</b>   
</p>
<p><b>B. Movement and access and the Israeli military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1517. The Mission received reports that, during the Israeli offensive in Gaza, movement 
restrictions in the West Bank were tightened. For several days, Israel imposed a &#8220;closure&#8221; on the 
West Bank, a restrictive measure in addition to those already in place. Given that it is an ad hoc 
measure, people cannot plan their movements around it. 
</p>
<p>1518. It was also reported to the Mission that, during and following the operations in Gaza, 
Israel tightened its hold on the West Bank through more expropriation, an increase in house 
demolitions, demolition orders and permits granted for homes built in settlements, and increased 
exploitation of the West bank&#8217;s natural resources. Various policies and decisions implemented in 
the first six months of 2009 relating to settlements, and Jerusalem&#8217;s demography, affected the 
access and movement of Palestinians, while increasing the overall control by Israel over the 
West Bank.  
</p>
<p>1519. Following the operations in Gaza, the Mission received reports that Israel had amended 
the regulations determining the ability of persons with a Gaza identity card to move to the West 
</p>

and Gaza.  
</p>
<p><b>C. West Bank closures during the Israeli operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1520. Information received by the Mission showed that, in addition to the everyday restrictions 
on movement and access during the Israeli operations in Gaza, Israel implemented a full closure 
of the West Bank for six days.<b>867</b> During a closure, Palestinians with West Bank identity cards 
(see below) and valid permits to enter East Jerusalem or Israel are prevented from doing so.<b>868</b>  
</p>
<p>1521. The closures affected thousands of workers, students, people needing to have access to 
Palestinian hospitals in East Jerusalem, worshippers and those visiting family and friends. 
Furthermore, according to reports received by the Mission, the number of checkpoints in the 
West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, was increased during  the operations, most being 
&#8220;flying&#8221; checkpoints (ad hoc checkpoints operating for anything between one hour and the 
duration of the operations in Gaza).<b>869</b> According to Shir Hever, an economist from the 
Alternative Information Centre, each day of closure costs the Palestinian economy $ 4.5 million 
and 276 jobs and drives 646 people below the poverty line.<b>870</b> 
</p>
<p>1522. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that, on 2 January 2009, 
the Israeli army prevented males aged between 16 and 50 from crossing Huwara checkpoint to 
travel south.<b>871</b> Huwara checkpoint is the main checkpoint on the main north-south route in the 
West Bank and lies between the cities of Jenin, Tulkarm, Qalqilia and Nablus in the north, and 
Ramallah, Jericho, Bethlehem and Hebron in the middle and south. Closing Huwara checkpoint 
effectively prevents Palestinians from this region from going south, as there are no other 
accessible roads. 
</p>
<p>1523. In addition, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in 
January 2009, Israel declared the area between the Wall and the Green line in Hebron, parts of 
Salfit, Ramallah, and in between the Wall and the Jerusalem municipality borders a &#8220;closed 
military area&#8221;, with serious consequences for the Palestinian population.<b>872</b> Prior to this, access 
to land beyond the Wall (the so-called &#8220;seam zone&#8221;, between the Wall and the Green Line<b>873</b>)

was already restricted as access required prior coordination with the Israeli army. The new 
measures meant that land owners had to provide proof of ownership (which is difficult to obtain) 
and apply for visitors&#8217; permits to be able to have access to their land. Applications for permits by 
farm labourers who are not land owners were routinely rejected. According to Mr. Shawan 
Jabarin, human rights monitors are not granted permits either.<b>874</b> Fewer than 20 per cent of those 
who used to farm their lands in 67 localities in the northern West Bank, which had been declared 
closed previously, are now reportedly granted permits. Those who do obtain permits face long 
waiting times, restricted gate opening hours, physical searches and restrictions on the kinds of 
farming equipment allowed to pass. In addition, thousands of people reside in the areas now or 
previously declared &#8220;closed military zones&#8221;. They now require permits to live in their own 
homes and must often pass through gates in order to have access to work, health care, education 
and other services. The area declared a closed military zone in January includes the Jerusalem 
suburb of Dahiet al-Barid. According to the Applied Research Institute of Jerusalem, around 
14,000 Palestinians in this suburb stand to lose their Jerusalem residency status as well as 
municipal services.<b>875</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. New measures to formalize the separation of Gaza and the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>1524. The Mission received reports about measures that further formalize the separation of Gaza 
and the West Bank. Following HaMoked&#8217;s petition to the High Court, a new Israeli Ministry of 
Defense procedure has been revealed detailing the very strict conditions under which a resident 
of the Gaza Strip may change her or his residency to that of the West Bank.<b>876</b> The procedure of 
8 March 2009states:  
</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the security/political situation in the Gaza Strip it has been 
decided on State level to limit the movement of residents between the Gaza Strip and the 
Judea and Samaria area to the necessary minimum, so that for all practical purposes entry 
of residents of Gaza into the Judea and Samaria areas shall only be allowed in the most 
exceptional humanitarian cases.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;the Deputy Minister of Defence&#8230;established that in 
every case involving the settlement of Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area one 
should adopt the most restrictive policy, which is derived a  fortiori from the general 
policy of restricting movement between the two Areas. The Deputy Minister clarified that 
a family relationship, in and of itself, does not qualify as a humanitarian reason that would 
justify settlement by Gaza residents in the Judea and Samaria Area.  
</p>
<p>1525. In the terms of the procedure, as reviewed by the Mission, one of the situations envisaged 
by the regulations, is where

 <p> 
</p>
<p>A minor resident of Gaza who is under 16 years old, where one of his parents, who was a 
resident of Gaza, passed away and the other parent is a resident of the Judea and Samaria 
Area and there is no other family relative who is a resident of Gaza who is able to take the 
minor under his wings. In the event that it is necessary, the nature and scope of the 
existing relationship with the parent who is a resident of the Judea and Samaria Area shall 
be examined in relation to the degree, nature and scope of the relationship with other 
family relatives in Gaza (para. 10 B).  
</p>
<p>1526. Furthermore, according to paragraph 15 of the procedure, a successful application is 
subject to periodic renewal and a seven-year &#8220;naturalization&#8221; period, after which there is an 
examination &#8220;as to whether to grant a permit of settlement in the Judea and Samaria Area and a 
change of the registered address in the copy of the file of the Palestinian population registry, 
which is in the possession of the Israeli side&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1527. In the reports reviewed by the Mission, HaMoked and Gisha call this regulation an 
additional measure in a deliberate Israeli policy to deepen the separation between the West Bank 
and Gaza &#8220;in the pursuance by Israel of political goals at the expense of the civilian population, 
in blatant violation of international humanitarian law.&#8221; It also &#8220;undermines the possibility of a 
two state solution&#8221;, and &#8220;contradicts a long list of Israeli undertakings to conduct negotiations for 
the establishment of an independent, viable Palestinian State, including an explicit commitment 
in the Oslo Accords to preserve the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a &#8216;single territorial 
unit&#8221;.<b>877</b>  
</p>
<p><b>E. Movement and access, current situation 
</b></p>
<p>1528. According to information available the Mission, in the past eight months certain measures 
by the Government of Israel have improved freedom of movement in certain places, in particular 
access to the cities of Nablus, Tulkarm, Hebron and Ramallah. For example, the permit 
requirement was removed for vehicles entering Nablus, two junctions near Hebron were opened 
and a checkpoint was removed outside Tulkarm. In Ramallah, a &#8220;fabric of life&#8221;<b> 878</b> alternative 
route was opened for access from the West.<b>879</b>  
</p>
<p>1529. United Nations sources observe, however, that during this time the restrictions on 
Palestinian traffic and the ease of Israeli and settler traffic in the West Bank have become 
entrenched. Checkpoints have also been expanded and some temporary checkpoints have 
become more permanent (for example with gates instead of earth mounds). In addition, the 
improvement or opening of &#8220;fabric of life&#8221; roads<b> </b>alternative roads to closed main roads still 
necessitates the confiscation of land.<b> </b>  
</p>

<b>877</b> Gisha and HaMoked position paper, available at www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications_/ 
WB_Gaza_Procedure-PositionP-Eng.pdf. 
<b>878</b> The concept of &#8220;fabric of life&#8221; was introduced by the Israeli army to denote alternative roads for Palestinians who 
are no longer allowed to use the &#8220;Israel only&#8221; main roads; see &#8220;Alternative roads for Palestinians&#8221;, B&#8217;Tselem, at

www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_movement_access_2009_june_english.pdf.  </p>

 <p> 
1530. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs maps 613 physical obstacles, 
including 68 staffed checkpoints and 541 unstaffed obstacles such as roadblocks.  This number 
excludes the 84 obstacles blocking Palestinian access and movement within the Israeli-controlled 
area of Hebron city (&#8220;H2&#8221;), 63 crossing points in the Wall and an average of 70 random (or 
&#8220;flying&#8221;) checkpoints deployed every week since the beginning of 2009.<b>880</b> In addition to the 
road obstacles, the Wall continues to be built; large areas between the Wall and the Green Line 
(the &#8220;seam zone&#8221;) have been declared closed to Palestinians.<b>881</b>  
</p>
<p>1531. Harsh military measures, such as prolonged curfews on individual villages in the northern 
West Bank, have further restricted movement, and approximately 28 per cent of the West Bank 
is now declared a closed military zone with recent stricter enforcement, especially affecting 
farmers and herders. 
</p>
<p>1532. The Mission has also received reports about the recent introduction by Israel of measures 
aimed at &#8220;modernizing&#8221; the access and movement restrictions which, by making monitoring and 
recording of movement of individuals easier, would have the effect of consolidating the 
restrictions. The measurers include the introduction of magnetic cards for use in automated 
checkpoints, the privatization of checkpoints and access gates and the computerization of certain 
checkpoints on or near the Green Line as of 1st May 2009.<b>882</b> The measures have raised a concern 
that permits for politically active individuals will be more frequently cancelled. In addition, 
considering the current open debate in international law on the liability of private security 
contractors, the privatization of checkpoints raises concerns about accountability.<b>883</b>  
</p>
<p>1533. Therefore, while there have been some (albeit limited) positive developments in the 
period between September 2008 and March 2009, the measures taken during this and previous 
periods indicate a further entrenchment of the system of movement and access restrictions, with 
the result that &#8220;the space available for Palestinian development is increasingly constrained&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1534. The Mission notes that it is misleading to look at the freedom of movement of the 
Palestinians of the West Bank without considering where they can actually. For example, recent 
reports have raised the Mission&#8217;s concern about broader policies leading to the &#8220;silent transfer&#8221; 
of Palestinians out of Jerusalem. The first six months of 2009 saw a dramatic rise in demolition

settlement construction in both East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank.  
</p>
<p><b>F. Jerusalem: accelerating the &#8220;silent transfer&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>1535. In May 2009, the <i>New York Times</i> reported that the Office Israeli Prime Minister of Israel 
and the Israeli-defined Jerusalem municipality, in cooperation with the Jerusalem Development 
Authority and settler organizations, were implementing an eight-year &#8221;confidential&#8221; plan to 
create a string of nine parks, pathways and sites, incorporating new or existing settlements  in 
and around East Jerusalem. The NGO Peace Now concluded that &#8220;the completion of the Israeli 
plan will change dramatically the map of East Jerusalem and might prevent a permanent status 
agreement and a compromise in Jerusalem.&#8221;<b>885</b> 
</p>
<p>1536. In a report reviewed by the Mission, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel stated that, 
in Jerusalem &#8220;discrimination in planning and building, expropriation of lands, and minimal 
investment in physical infrastructure and government and municipal services - these are concrete 
expressions of an Israeli policy designed to secure a Jewish majority in Jerusalem and push 
Palestinian residents outside the city's borders.&#8221;<b>886</b> </p>
<p>1537. In a report of April 2009, addressing &#8220;the failure of the Israeli authorities to provide 
adequate planning for Palestinian neighborhoods&#8221;, the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian affairs states that &#8220;some 60,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem &#8230; are at risk of 
having their homes demolished by the Israeli authorities. This is a conservative estimate and the 
actual number may be much higher.&#8221;<b>887</b>

<p>1538. In reports reviewed by the Mission, Peace Now stated in March 2009 that the Ministry of

19 animal pens, and 18 traditional <i>taboun</i> ovens in the Bedouin community of Khirbet ar Ras al Ahmar in the Jordan 
Valley. A water tank, tractor, and trolley were also confiscated Eighteen households were displaced, including at

Bank.<b>888</b> According to Peace Now, the building of 15,000 of these homes had already been 
approved, and, if all the plans are realized, the number of settlers in the occupied Palestinian 
territory will double.<b>889</b> 
</p>
<p>1539. Construction works on Maskiyot, a new settlement, were reportedly commenced in the 
Jordan Valley as of May 2009.<b>890</b> At the same time, Palestinians in the Jordan Valley and more 
generally in Area C are at risk of displacement. On 26 January 2009, the High Court of Justice of 
Israel rejected a petition submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and Rabbis for 
Human Rights on behalf of the Palestinian residents of Khirbet Tana, &#8220;effectively allowing the 
State to destroy all of the village's houses but one, despite the lack of viable planning alternatives 
for the area's Palestinian residents&#8221;.<b>891</b> In a recent report reviewed by the Mission, Bimkom 
concluded that the Israeli Civil Administration applied &#8220;a deliberate and consistent policy in 
Area C with the goal of restricting Palestinian construction and development and limiting its 
spatial dispersion&#8221;.<b>892</b> 
</p>
<p><b>H. Connecting the dots 
</b></p>
<p>1540. According to reports reviewed by the Mission, aside from the settlements themselves, 
much new infrastructure is being built to service the settlements, including roads, rail and tram 
lines, tunnels and waste dumps. Notable examples of these are the Jerusalem ring road (eastern 
section) a four-lane highway which will connect Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and run 
through Palestinian neighborhoods, requiring the confiscation of many dunums<b>893</b> of Palestinian 
land and demolitions of homes and businesses;<b>894</b>and the Jerusalem light rail project and train 
line between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem part of which will run through the West Bank.<b>895</b>  
</p>
<p>1541. Observers have noted that Israeli control over the movement and access of the West Bank 
Palestinians is necessary to maintain control over the West Bank&#8217;s land and natural resources.

 <p> 
Easing Palestinian access on alternative roads and the removal of some checkpoints would allow 
Israel to offer &#8220;transportational&#8221;, rather than territorial contiguity. At the same time, full Israeli 
access through the separate road system and full control over the border allow for a level of 
continuous population control. The increased movement and access limitations recently 
implemented by Israel in the West Bank, would seam to share with the military operations of 
December 2008 - January 2009 Israel&#8217;s objective of &#8220;getting rid of Gaza in order to consolidate 
its permanent hold on the West Bank&#8221;.<b>896</b>   
</p>
<p><b>I. Legal analysis and conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1542. The occupying Power may restrict the right to free movement in certain circumstances, 
but it must safeguard the fundamental rights of the protected people at all times. Any movement 
restriction, to be lawful under international humanitarian law, however, must be necessary and 
proportionate to the harm caused to the protected people. 
</p>
<p>1543. The right to freedom of movement is enshrined in article 13 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, and in article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
When the right is restricted, it affects the exercise of any number of other rights, including those 
set forth in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, such as the right 
to work (art. 6), the right to protection of family life (art. 10), the right to an adequate standard of 
living (art. 11), the right to health (art. 12) and the right to education (art. 13). 
</p>
<p>1544. If the decision to restrict movement is based on a person&#8217;s belonging to an ethnic or 
national group, this constitutes unlawful discrimination contrary to articles 1 and 2 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and article 75 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, which is part 
of customary international law. Israel allows Israeli citizens to move around the West Bank 
including the settlements, relatively freely. According to B&#8217;Tselem, the Israeli military has 
openly admitted that the restrictions on Palestinians are there to enable Jewish settlers to move 
about freely.<b>897</b>  
</p>
<p>1545. Where checkpoints become a site of humiliation of the protected population by military or 
civilian operators, this may entail a violation of article 75 (2) (b) of Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions (which is part of customary international law), which outlaws &#8220;outrages 
upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1546. Settlements are contrary to article 49 (6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention.<b>898</b> 
Furthermore, they violate Palestinian property rights and the prohibition on the occupying Power 
of changing the nature and legal status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (art. 55 of the 
Hague Regulations), may constitute direct discrimination against Palestinians, besides causing

 <p> 
restriction of movement, hindering economic and social development, and access to health, 
education and social services. In addition, the extensive destruction and appropriation of 
property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, amount to a 
&#8220;grave breach&#8221; of article 147 of the Geneva Convention. The Wall, which, to the extent it is built 
inside the West Bank is contrary to international law,<b>899</b> the de facto annexation of the parts of 
the West Bank that fall on the &#8220;Israeli side&#8221; of the Wall (9.5 per cent of the West Bank),<b>900</b> five 
years since the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice that the Wall must be 
dismantled, now amount to the acquisition of territory by force, contrary to the Charter of the 
United Nations.<b>901</b> 
</p>
<p>1547. From the facts ascertained by or available to it, the Mission believes that the movement 
and access restrictions to which West Bank Palestinians are subject are disproportionate to any 
military objective served, in general, particularly in light of the increased restrictions during and 
to some extent since the military operations in Gaza. The restrictions do not safeguard the 
fundamental rights of those protected as required by international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>1548. From the facts available to it, the Mission believes that in the movement and access policy 
there has been a violation of the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of race or 
national origin The Mission is concerned about the steps taken recently to formalize the 
separation of Gaza from the West Bank, and, as such, of two parts of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory. The Mission is also concerned that the increasingly entrenched array of movement and 
access restrictions, both physical and non-physical, amount to a deliberate policy of closely 
controlling a population in order to make use of areas of its land. From the facts available, the 
Mission believes that these restrictions constitute violations of fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>1549. Insofar that movement and access restrictions, the settlements and their infrastructure, 
demographic policies with regards to Jerusalem and Area C, and the separation of Gaza from the 
West Bank prevent a viable, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State from being created, they 
are in violation of the <i>jus cogens</i> right to self-determination.  
</p>
<p><b>XXIII. INTERNAL VIOLENCE, TARGETING OF HAMAS SUPPORTERS  
AND RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND 
EXPRESSION BY THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
</b></p>
<p>1550. The Mission has received allegations of violations relevant to its mandate committed by 
the Palestinian Authority in the period under inquiry. These include violations related to the 
treatment of (suspected) Hamas affiliates by the Preventive Security Service, the Military 
Intelligence and the General Intelligence, such as their unlawful arrest and detention, and ill-

<b>901</b>Paragraph 121 of the advisory opinion states that the &#8220;Court considers that the construction of the wall and its

notwithstanding the formal characterization of the wall by Israel, it would be tantamount to de facto annexation&#8221;.  </p>

treatment of political opponents while in detention. Other allegations are the arbitrary closure of 
charities and associations affiliated with Hamas and other Islamic groups<b>902</b> or the revocation and 
non-renewal of their licences,<b>903</b> the forcible replacement of board members of Islamic schools 
and other institutions and the dismissal of Hamas affiliated teachers.<b>904</b> 
</p>
<p>1551. There have also been allegations of the use of excessive force and the suppression by 
Palestinian security services of demonstrations, particularly those in support of the population of 
Gaza during the Israeli military operations.<b>905</b> On these occasions the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s 
security services allegedly arrested many individuals<b>906</b> and prevented the media from covering 
the events, at times breaking cameras or erasing footage.<b>907</b> The Mission also received 
allegations of harassment by Palestinian security services of journalists who expressed critical 
views of the Palestinian Authority.<b>908</b>  
</p>
<p>1552. The Mission noted the reluctance of some of the residents of the West Bank it approached 
to speak openly about these issues. A number of individuals expressed concern that there might 
be repercussions if they did so.<b>909</b> 
</p>
<p>1553. The Mission also received reports that highlight the lack of parliamentary oversight over 
acts and decisions by the executive. As noted in chapter XXIII, the arrest and detention by Israel 
of several members of the Palestinian Legislative Council has effectively curtailed such 
parliamentary oversight.<b>910</b> The executive has passed decrees and regulations<b>911</b> to enable it to

little confidence that the authorities will taken action (Mission telephone interview with WB/02, 16 July 2009) and

has resulted in the use of the security apparatus to suppress political opposition and of military 
courts to ignore any judicial challenge to arbitrary detention on political grounds.<b>912</b>  
</p>
<p>1554. The Mission asked the Palestinian Authority for information about the above allegations; 
however its reply does not address these issues.<b>913</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Crackdown by the Palestinian Authority on Hamas and other Islamic parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Arrest and detention by the security forces 
</b></p>
<p>1555. Before the Israeli military operations in Gaza, domestic human rights organizations were 
already reporting a practice of arbitrary arrest by the Palestinian Authority of members and 
(suspected) supporters of Hamas in the West Bank.<b>914</b> The practice has reportedly continued. 
According to ICHR, over 400 persons arrested by the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s security forces 
&#8220;primarily for reasons of political affiliation&#8221; were in detention, as of 31 May 2009. ICHR has 
confirmed the 400 cases individually through prison visits, but states that the total number is 
probably closer to 700,<b>915</b> The human rights NGO Al-Haq estimates that over 800 persons were 
being held as at mid-July 2009.<b>916</b> The Mission has asked the Palestinian Authority, inter alia, to 
confirm the numbers of persons held in detention by its Preventive Security Force, Military 
Intelligence and General Intelligence, and the legal basis for their detention, but has received no 
reply on this issue. 
</p>
<p>1556. The Palestinian Authority has a court system similar to most others, with civilian criminal 
and civil courts and a court of appeal, and military courts, which have jurisdiction over military 
matters.<b>917</b>   
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                             
<b>911</b> The executive has passed decrees to grant the Minister for Local Government the right to dissolve the local 
council or dismiss its head (Presidential Decree No. 9) and to limit the right to strike for civil servants (Decree

<b>916</b> Mission telephone interview with Al-Haq, 15 July 2009. ICHR states that only a very small number of non-
Hamas affiliated detainees are held by the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s security forces (Mission telephone interview with

<b>917</b> See, for instance, Birzeit University Institute of Law, &#8220;Legal system and legislative process in Palestine&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
1557. The Mission has received reports that arrests are often carried out without an arrest 
warrant or with a warrant issued by the Military Judicial Commission (a military court) rather 
than by a civilian court.<b>918</b> The Amended Basic Law of 2003, article 101 (2), states that military 
courts &#8220;shall not have any jurisdiction beyond military affairs&#8221;. On 30 August 2008, the 
Palestinian High Court of Justice confirmed that the Military Attorney General<b>919</b> and the 
Military Judicial Commission had no jurisdiction over civilians. In addition, in the past year 
many of its decisions have supported this view in individual cases relating to the arrest or 
detention of civilians. However, these civilian court rulings have mostly been ignored by the 
security forces and the military judiciary.<b>920</b>   
</p>
<p>1558. Information received by the Mission suggests that detainees held by the security forces do 
not know when they will be released, normally without being charged and tried, rarely have 
access to a lawyer or are allowed family visits.<b>921</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Torture and other ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>1559. Several Palestinian human rights organizations have reported that practices used by the 
Palestinian Authority&#8217;s security forces, particularly the Preventive Security Force, Military 
Intelligence and the General Intelligence service, against several people in the West Bank 
amount to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment. They have 
documented examples of such treatment during detention through testimonies of victims, some 
of whom have political affiliations with Hamas.<b>922</b> They have also reported a number of deaths in

<b>922</b> Various affidavits have been collected by Al-Haq, Addameer, PCHR and ICHR. For instance, Al-Haq&#8217;s 
testimony taken from Marwan Khaled Saleh al-Khalili reports ill-treatment he received at the hands of the 
Preventive Security force, which included the &#8220;shabeh&#8221;, a stress position involving a very small, slanted chair, to 
which he was bound for four days. He suffered two strokes and permanent injury, according to his testimony. He 
was released after being asked to sign a pledge to leave his work for the Hamas Social Committee (Al-Haq affidavit 
No. 4364/2008.). In another of Al-Haq&#8217;s testimonies, relating to October 2008,<b> </b>Muhammad Suleiman Mahmoud 
Dagher reports on the torture, death threats and beatings he and another man received at the hands of an unknown 
Palestinian Authority security agency. At one point during his detention, he was made to stand on a chair while his 
interrogator placed a rope, which was suspended from the ceiling, around his neck. The interrogator then reportedly 
said &#8220;if you do not confess, we will kill you&#8221;. He also had a gun put to his head and threatened (Al-Haq affidavit No. 
4460/2008). An additional example of abuse and intimidation is recorded by a lawyer of the Addameer Prisoner 
Support and Human Rights Association, relating to a visit of a detainee who was also a lawyer. &#8220;They told him that 
when he will get out from the prison he will be handicapped and that &#8216;you are no better than Majd al-Barghouti&#8217;

detention to which it is suspected that torture and other ill-treatment may have contributed or 
which they may have caused.<b>923</b>   
</p>
<p>1560. According to these organizations, complaints of such practices have not been investigated 
and because of the failure of the competent authorities to oversee these agencies or hold them 
accountable for their practices, impunity for serious violations of human rights prevails. One 
organization asserts that, &#8220;Silence, connivance and a failure to prevent or oversee such acts all 
manifest a definitive presumption of the consent or acquiescence of public officials to inflict 
such pain and suffering.&#8221;<b>924</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>1561. There have been reports that freedom of association, which is protected by the Palestinian 
Basic Law, has been violated with respect to several organizations, on the basis of their political 
views and affiliations. Hamas-affiliated organizations have been particularly targeted since 
2008.<b>925</b> On 14 July 2008, PCHR issued a report describing the &#8220;interference of the Ministry of 
Interior and Security Forces in election affairs of the Women&#8217;s Arab Union.&#8221; The report 
described how a committee consisting of Ministry of Interior officials, Preventive Security and 
General Intelligence staff banned five candidates from standing for election to the board of the 
Union.<b>926</b> It has reportedly become common for the Palestinian Authority to disapprove of the 
appointment of board members with specific political affiliations, to request their replacement 
with its own nominees, and to refuse the (re-)registration of associations that do not comply with 
this request.<b>927</b> Human rights organizations are reportedly not exempt from interference by the 
Palestinian Authority&#8217;s security forces. The Mission heard from one organization&#8217;s staff member 
that he and his colleagues received physical threats from the security forces. Furthermore, 
reported complications in administrative processes, such as delays in the opening of bank

<b>925</b> In July 2008, the <i>Financial Times</i> reported that &#8220;with almost the entire West Bank leadership of Hamas in jail, 
the [Palestinian Authority] and Israel have now taken aim at what is widely seen as a crucial source of the group&#8217;s 
political strength: the tight network of schools, orphanages, clinics, charities and businesses run by the Islamists&#8221; 
(&#8220;West Bank &#8216;tsunami&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;). Entire boards of NGOs have been replaced with committees appointed by the 
Palestinian Authority (&#8220;Palestine divided&#8230;&#8221;, p. 12.).

these organizations.<b>928</b>  
</p>
<p><b>4. Appointments 
</b></p>
<p>1562. According to ICHR, &#8220;the Caretaker Government continues to discharge a large number of 
civil and military service employees, or suspend their salaries, under the pretext of &#8216;non-
adherence to the legitimate authority&#8217; or &#8216;non-obtainment of security approval&#8217; on their 
appointments, which has become a pre-requirement for enrolment in public service&#8221;.<b>929</b> In effect, 
this measure excludes Hamas supporters or affiliates from public sector employment.<b>930</b> 
</p>
<p>1563. According to PCHR, at the start of the 2008 school year, &#8220;on 14 October, the Ministry of 
Education in Ramallah sent written notices to dozens of teachers, cancelling their employment 
contracts, and dismissing them without notice. The notices claimed that the Ministry of 
Education did not approve their employment any longer.&#8221;<b>931</b> Al-Haq reported that some teachers 
were asked to sign pledges to refrain from political activity.<b>932</b> ICHR reported that 200 teachers 
were dismissed (not reappointed) at this time. ICHR petitioned the Palestinian High Court of 
Justice to seek the reappointment of around 50 of them, and is still waiting for a decision.<b>933</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Freedom of the press, freedom of expression and opinion 
</b></p>
<p>1564. Allegations of violations of press freedom by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank 
in the past year are linked to reports of arrests of journalists, the closure of media offices, the 
forcible changing of newspaper and news website headlines,<b>934</b> attacks against photographers, 
some of whom have been forced to delete material and breaking or confiscating photographic 
equipment.<b>935</b> The journalists&#8217; association Palestinian Center for Development and Media

was informed, for example, that the Palestinian Authority censored television programmes and 
newspapers, and that editors were at times informed verbally not to use certain terms or words, 
or not to broadcast programmes that could be considered as incitement against the Palestinian 
Authority.<b>937</b> 
</p>
<p>1566. MADA reported that, on 2 January 2009, an Associated Press photographer covering a 
march in Ramallah in support of the people of Gaza was attacked by members of the Military 
Intelligence. The photographer said a security official in civilian clothing first shouted at him to 
stop taking pictures and then he was assaulted by two security agents and taken by force to a 
nearby building, where he was beaten until he lost consciousness. He was taken initially to the 
intelligence headquarters but then transferred to a hospital, where he was treated for a broken 
nose and subsequently released.<b>938</b> </p>
<p>1567. In another incident, on 18 January 2009, a well-known West Bank journalist was 
reportedly detained overnight at Preventive Security headquarters in Hebron and questioned 
about an interview he had given to the al-Quds Satellite Channel in which he was critical of the 
Palestinian Authority.<b>939</b> According to his affidavit, he was then brought before the Director of 
the Preventive Security in Hebron, who he said encouraged him to exercise self-censorship.<b>940</b> 
</p>
<p>1568. Between 24 and 27 January 2009, four correspondents of al-Quds Satellite Channel were 
arrested by the Preventiv&#8217;e Security Service, the Palestinian General Intelligence and the 
Palestinian Military Intelligence, and interrogated about their work.<b>941</b> 
</p>
<p>1569. On 22 April 2009, PCHR noted the arrest by the police in Nablus of a professor of 
political science at An-Najah University in Nablus who had expressed support for Hamas on a 
programme of the al-Aqsa television channel when asked to comment on the recent attack 
against members of the Palestinian Legislative Council by the security forces.<b>942</b> 
</p>
<p>1570. On 16 July 2009, the Prime Minister issued a decision to close the international television 
channel al-Jazeera in the West Bank, because it broadcast an interview with a senior Fatah 
leader, who accused senior Palestinian Authority officials of being implicated in the death of 
former President Arafat.<b>943</b> Although the ban was lifted on 18 July, the Prime Minister

</p>
<p><b>C. Freedom of assembly: repression of demonstrations during the  
Israeli military operations in Gaza of 27 December 2008-18 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p>1571. The Mission received information from various sources that demonstrations in support of 
Gaza were both prevented from taking place and, in some cases, violently repressed.<b>945</b>  
</p>
<p>1572. Security officers reportedly used excessive force during demonstrations on 2 January in 
Hebron and Ramallah. At both events, protestors suffered injuries after being beaten by security 
officers. Journalists at the Hebron protest were prevented from reporting on the event.<b>946</b>  
</p>
<p>1573. Al-Haq informed the Mission that a student demonstration at Birzeit on 5 January 2009, 
which had the stated aim of &#8220;showing the occupation forces that Palestinian students reject all 
aggression against Gaza&#8221;, saw a heavy deployment of Palestinian Preventive Security, General 
Intelligence and Military Intelligence services personnel. Many students were reportedly 
beaten;<b>947</b> 50 were injured, 9 of whom were hospitalized. Many were also detained, although 
most were released later the same day. Ms. Khalida Jarrar, a member of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council, informed the Mission that she had received a call from one of the students 
asking her to come to the hospital and witness the injuries.<b>948</b> 
</p>
<p>1574. According to Al-Haq, on 26 January, after the end of the Israeli military operations in 
Gaza, a peaceful sit-in was held near the security forces&#8217; headquarters in Hebron against 
detentions on political grounds. Reportedly, &#8220;security forces beat demonstrators, including 
children, with sticks. Although several demonstrators were injured, security forces impeded 
access of medical personnel.&#8221;<b>949</b> The affidavit of one eyewitness states that &#8220;Palestinian security 
officers demanded that we disperse and take our banners down. As demonstrators refused to 
disband, a group of female security officers started beating them with sticks. The security 
officers addressed the demonstrators, saying: &#8216;You are Shiite. In Gaza, you shot the legs of Fatah 
activists. You stole food supplies in Gaza.&#8217; Security officers also impeded access to a Palestinian 
ambulance and prevented medics from evacuating eight injured protestors.&#8221;<b>950</b> 
</p>
<p>1575. In another serious incident, a former student leader who used to be a well-known political 
activist informed the Mission that he was tortured by the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s security forces,

apparently because of his protest activities. During the Israeli military operations in Gaza, he 
took part in daily protests and was stopped several times by the security services. He reported 
that on 2 January 2009, after the Friday midday prayers, he was stopped by security personnel in 
plain clothes and in uniform in the centre of Ramallah. He was pushed into a car carrying the 
emblem of the Palestinian Authority, where electrical shocks were applied to his body. He was 
then taken to the Military Intelligence office and interrogated. He alleges that a high-ranking 
Military Intelligence official threatened him with six months&#8217; arrest under the emergency law 
and warned him not to criticize the Palestinian Authority and to refrain from talking about the 
resistance, Hamas and Gaza.<b>951</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Legal analysis 
</b></p>
<p>1576. The Palestinian Authority, inasmuch as it exercises control over the territory and people, 
has an obligation to respect and enforce the protection of human rights.<b>952</b> When assessing the 
aforementioned alleged violations, the terms of international human rights law, to the extent that 
it forms part of customary international law, must be examined. Most provisions of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights are considered part of customary international law and would, 
therefore, apply. In addition, the Palestinian Authority has declared its commitment to respect 
international human rights law. The Palestinian Basic Law contains a number of articles 
protecting human rights as well as a commitment to abide by major human rights instruments.<b>953</b> 
Article 10 (2) states that &#8220;The Palestinian National Authority shall work without delay to join 
regional and international declarations and covenants which protect human rights&#8221;. The Basic 
Law itself broadly encompasses the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.   
</p>
<p>1577. According to information received by the Mission, which it considers to be reliable, the 
Palestinian Authority has carried out arbitrary and unlawful arrests and detentions of political 
opponents in the West Bank, and regularly denied political detainees access to legal 
representation and basic due process rights, including the right to be brought promptly before a 
court and charged with a recognizable criminal offence, contrary to the norms contained in 
articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Arresting individuals based on 
their political opinions also constitutes a discriminatory practice contrary to article 1. 
</p>
<p>1578. Subjecting detainees to acts of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is prohibited 
by the customary international law norm reflected in article 5 of the Universal Declaration, and 
constitutes a violation of their right to security of the person as contained in article 3. Insofar as 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment can be established, individual criminal 
responsibility attaches to the perpetrator and any one else ordering, assisting or participating in 
the commission of the crime.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>951</b> Mission telephone interview with WB/02, 16 July 2009. 
<b>952</b> It is necessary to note in this respect that the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s control and law enforcement ability extend 
only to &#8220;Area A&#8221;, and that they are also subject to the ultimate control by the occupying Power, which thus retains 
overall control and responsibility (see Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 47).  
<b>953</b> See chap. IV. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1579. Death in detention as a result of wilful killing, torture or other forms of abuse constitutes a 
violation of the right to life reflected in article 3 of the Universal Declaration.  
</p>
<p>1580. Excessive force in policing demonstrations in the instances reported above contravenes 
the requirements of the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (art. 3) 
and the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials (principle 4) that law enforcement officials use force only when strictly necessary and 
to the extent required for the performance of their duty, and that they apply non-violent means 
first, using force only if other means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the 
intended result. In addition, it may violate the right to freedom of expression, the right to 
peaceful assembly (article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and the right not to 
be discriminated on the basis of political opinions.  
</p>
<p>1581. Reports that the Palestinian Authority interfered with the work of journalists and the 
media give rise to the concern that the right to freedom of opinion and expression has been 
interfered with. According to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this right 
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. 
</p>
<p>1582. The Mission considers that the information it received about the requirement for security 
approval and recognition of the &#8220;legitimate authority&#8221; as a prerequisite for public office, as well 
as for teaching and other posts in public schools and membership on boards of associations, 
suggests a violation of the right to hold public office and of the right not to be discriminated on 
the basis of political beliefs. 
</p>
<p>1583. Interference with the constitution of boards of associations, or the registration of certain 
associations on grounds of political allegiance, would, if confirmed, indicate a violation of the 
right to form associations (article 20 of the Universal Declaration). Dismissal from public 
appointment on the basis of (presumed) political affiliation violates the right to work, to just and 
favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment (art. 23) and the right to 
non-discrimination (art. 1).  
</p>
<p><b>E. Conclusions </b></p>
<p>1584. From the information available to it, the Mission finds that there are features of the 
repressive measures against actual or perceived Hamas affiliates and supporters in the West 
Bank that would constitute violations of international law. Furthermore, in efforts to minimize 
the power and influence of Hamas, the protection and the promotion of human rights have 
generally been eroded. The Mission notes that these measures and their objectives are relevant to 
the context within which the Israeli offensive in Gaza was launched, as analysed in chapter II.<b>954</b> 
</p>
<p>1585. The Mission is concerned that, by failing to take action to put an end to the practices 
described above, the Palestinian executive and judicial authorities are contributing to the further 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>954</b> &#8220;Leading security figures have taken to referring to Hamas in front of Israeli counterparts as a &#8216;common enemy&#8217; 
and speak in crudely violent terms of how they plan to treat it&#8221;<b> </b>(&#8220;Palestine divided&#8230;&#8221;).  </p>

 <p> 
deterioration of the fundamental rights and freedoms of Palestinians, the rule of law and the 
independence of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>1586. It appears from the information the Mission received that the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s 
actions against political opponents in the West Bank started in January 2006, intensified between 
27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, and is continuing until today.    
</p>
<p>1587. The Mission considers detentions on political grounds legally unacceptable for several 
reasons: the arrest and indefinite detention (without trial) by security services and under the 
military judiciary system are in violation of Palestinian law and international human rights law; 
and the arrests and detentions are apparently based on political affiliation, which would violate 
the right not to be arbitrarily detained, the right to a fair trial, and the right not to be 
discriminated against on the basis of one&#8217;s political opinion, which are both part of customary 
international law. Moreover, the reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment during arrest 
and detention, and the reports of deaths in detention raise further concerns and warrant proper 
investigation and accountability.  
</p>
<p>1588. The Mission is concerned about interference with the freedom of the media. 
</p>
<p>1589. It is a serious concern to the Mission that the normal system of checks and balances 
between the executive, the legislative and the judiciary branches in the area controlled by the 
Palestinian Authority appears to be flawed. There seems to be little evidence of a functioning 
accountability system to counter instances of torture and other forms of abuse of power. It is also 
of serious that, in the absence of governmental oversight, civil society organizations are 
receiving threats and being harassed and seeing their operations impeded by administrative 
obstacles.<b>955</b>

<b>955</b> Mission interview with Al-Haq, 2 July 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>PART THREE: ISRAEL 
</b></p>
<p>1590. The Mission, in examining, as required by its mandate, alleged violations occurring in the 
context of the Israeli military operations conducted in Gaza from 27 December 2008 to 18 
January 2009, whether before, during or after, also considered allegations of violations against 
Israeli citizens and residents.  The Mission focused on two areas that it considered particularly 
relevant:  (a) the launching of rockets and mortars from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel by 
Palestinian armed groups, and their effects on the civilian population; (b) the action taken by the 
Government of Israel to repress dissent among its citizens and residents vis-&#224;-vis its military 
operations in Gaza, and to limit independent and critical reporting on it by human rights 
organizations and media.   
</p>
<p><b>Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1591. One consequence of the lack of cooperation by Israel with the Mission was that it was 
unable to visit Israel to investigate alleged violations of international law, and in particular to 
visit relevant sites and interview victims and witnesses. The Mission has, however, received 
many reports and other relevant materials from Israeli organizations and individuals, including 
Palestinians living in Israel, and from international human rights organizations and institutions. 
The Mission, also, met with representatives of a number of Israeli human rights organizations 
(see annex). The Mission conducted telephone interviews with people either living in or working 
with communities in southern Israel, including the Bedouin Palestinian community in the 
unrecognized villages in the Negev. It also interviewed many people in relation to the other 
matters within its mandate. Israeli victims, witnesses, experts and representatives of southern 
Israel local authorities appeared at the public hearings held in Geneva on 6 July 2009. 
Representatives of Israeli civil society and non governmental organizations working on human 
rights inside Israel were contacted either via video link or telephone.  The issue of rocket and 
mortar attacks on Israel was also covered in interviews conducted in Gaza in May and June 2009 
and in communications with the Gaza authorities. 
</p>
<p>1592. Owing to the lack of access, the chapters in the section below rely more broadly on 
secondary information than the previous sections.   
</p>
<p>1593. The Mission found the witnesses it heard in relation to the situation in Israel to be credible 
and reliable. The Mission has also written to the Gaza authorities and the Government of Israel 
seeking information and official positions on, inter alia, the issues addressed in the section 
below.  The information received by the Gaza authorities is taken into account in this chapter. 
The Government of Israel has not responded.  
</p>
<p><b>XXIV.  THE IMPACT ON CIVILIANS OF ROCKET AND MORTAR ATTACKS  
BY PALESTINIAN ARMED GROUPS ON SOUTHERN ISRAEL</b> 
</p>
<p>1594. The Mission conducted telephone interviews with people either living in or working with 
communities in southern Israel. Five residents of southern Israel appeared at the public hearings 
in Geneva on 6 July 2009 while three representatives of the Israel Trauma Center for Victims of 
Terror and War (NATAL) appeared via videolink from Tel Aviv. The issue of rocket and mortar 
attacks on Israel was also covered in interviews conducted in Gaza in May and June 2009 and in 
communications with the Gaza authorities.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1595. The Mission was unable to conduct on-site investigations owing to the decision of the 
Government of Israel not to cooperate with the Mission. 
</p>
<p>1596. The Mission addressed questions to the Government of Israel regarding individuals who 
have been affected by rocket and other fire from the Gaza Strip. The request of information 
included data about any psychological, social and economic harm caused by the rocket and 
mortar shells that have been launched into Israel. The Mission did not receive any reply to its 
questions. 
</p>
<p>1597. Since April 2001, Palestinian armed groups have launched more than 8,000 rockets and 
mortars from Gaza into southern Israel.<b>956</b> Communities such as Sderot, the surrounding 
kibbutzim and some of the unrecognized villages in the Negev have been in range since that 
time. During the Israeli military operations in Gaza in December 2008 and January 2009, the 
range of the rockets and mortars increased significantly to nearly 40 kilometres from the Gaza 
border, encompassing the Israeli towns of Yavne 30 kilometres to the north and Beersheba 
28 kilometres to the southeast.  
</p>
<p>1598. Since the rocket and mortar fire does not often hit populated areas, and because of the 
precautions taken by the Government of Israel, the rockets and mortars have caused relatively 
few fatalities and physical injuries among the residents of southern Israel. Property damage, 
while by no means insignificant, has not been extensive. More widespread, however, has been 
the psychological trauma and the feeling of insecurity that living under rocket fire has caused 
and continues to cause, to people living in the affected towns and villages, as well as the erosion 
of the economic, social and cultural life of these communities. 
</p>
<p>1599. Every death and injury is not only a tragedy but a matter of utmost concern to the Mission. 
The Mission wishes to emphasize that the issues of concern, and indeed the consequences of any 
attack affecting civilians, cannot be reduced to a recitation of statistics, nor should they be.

fired during the ceasefire, which ended officially on 18 December 2008.<b>961</b>  
</p>
<p>1601. The Mission notes that 92 per cent (212) of the rockets and 93 per cent (279) of the 
mortars fired between 18 June and 26 December 2008 were fired after 5 November 2008.<b>962</b>  
</p>
<p>1602. While there were no fatalities inside Israel, two young Palestinian girls, aged 5 and 12 
years, were killed when a rocket fell short, landing in northern Gaza on 26 December 2008.<b>963</b> 
</p>
<p>1603. Media reports indicated that, during this period, six Israelis and one foreign worker were 
wounded as a result of rockets landing in built-up areas in southern Israel. Where rockets did not 
land in open space, property damage was sustained. As is discussed below, an unknown number 
of people in southern Israel were treated for shock following the sounding of the early warning 
system and the subsequent rocket strikes.<b>964</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2. 27 December 2008-18 January 2009

<p>1604. According to the Israeli authorities, armed groups in Gaza fired approximately 570 
rockets and 205 mortars into Israel during the 22 days of the military operations in Gaza.<b>965</b> On 
their websites, the al-Qassam Brigades and Islamic Jihad claimed to have fired over 800 rockets

 <p> 
Sderot, the Eshkol Regional Council and the surrounding kibbutzim, which had experienced 
rockets strikes since 2001. A total of 90 rockets struck Sderot during the 22 days of military 
operations in Gaza.<b>967</b> 
</p>
<p>1606. During the period of the operations, three civilian fatalities and one military fatality were 
recorded in Israel resulting from the rocket and mortar strikes launched from Gaza. According to 
Magen David Adom, 918 people were injured (17 critically injured, 62 medium injuries and 829 
lightly injured) in this time period.<b>968</b> There were also 1,595 people inside Israel treated for 
stress-related injuries.<b>969</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. 19 January 2009-31 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>1607. According to the Israeli authorities, more than 100 rockets and 65 mortars were fired into 
Israel after 19 January 2009.<b>970</b> No fatalities resulted from these rocket and mortar strikes. The 
Mission was unable to obtain any official statistics of civilians physically injured by rockets and 
mortars during this time. On 1 February 2009, one Israeli civilian was lightly wounded when 
mortar shells, fired from Gaza, exploded in the Sha&#8217;ar Hanegev region.  
</p>
<p>1608. The majority of the rockets and mortars were fired prior to 15 March 2009. On 12 March 
2009, the Ministry of the Interior of the Gaza authorities stated that rockets were being &#8220;fired at 
the wrong time&#8221; and that the Gaza authorities were investigating those responsible.<b>971</b> On 
20 April 2009, a member of Hamas called on other armed groups to stop firing rockets &#8220;in the

arrested two members of Islamic Jihad firing mortars at Israeli forces.<b>973</b> 
</p>
<p>1609. In July 2009, Hamas declared that it was entering a period of &#8220;cultural resistance&#8221;, stating 
that it was suspending its use of rockets and shifting its focus to winning support at home and 
abroad through cultural initiatives and public relations.<b>974</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Relevant Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>1610. The Palestinian armed factions operating in the Gaza Strip and claiming responsibility for 
the majority of the rocket and mortar launchings are the  Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades<b>975</b>, the al 
Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades and Islamic Jihad. A brief description of each group is given below.

 <p> 
1611. The &#8216;al Qassam Brigades&#8217; are the armed wing of the Hamas political movement. 
According to a June 2007 report of Human Rights Watch, the al-Qassam brigades initiated the 
manufacture of rockets, now generically known as &#8220;Qassams&#8221;, inside the Gaza Strip.<b>976</b> 
According to figures given on the Al-Qassam Brigades website, the group launched 335 Qassam 
rockets, 211 Grad rockets and 397 mortars into Israel during the Israeli military operations in 
Gaza.<b>977</b> 
</p>
<p>1612. The al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades were organized during the second intifada and claim 
affiliation with Fatah. This group too has claimed responsibility for rocket and mortar fire on 
Israel following the Egyptian brokered ceasefire (<i>tahdiya), </i>which started on 18 June 2008. 
</p>
<p>1613. Islamic Jihad wields considerably less political power than either Hamas or Fatah. Its 
military wing is known as Saraya al-Quds and the group calls the rockets it manufactures inside 
Gaza, &#8216;al Quds&#8217;. Islamic Jihad has made numerous claims of responsibility for the launching of 
rockets into Israel,<b>978</b> including the first spate of rocket fire after 18 June 2008.  
</p>
<p>1614. On its website, the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades,<b>979</b> the military wing of The Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine also claimed responsibility for launching 177 rocket attacks and 
115 mortars on several towns and villages inside Israel from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 
2009. 
</p>
<p>1615. The al-Naser Salah ad-Din Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Resistance 
Committee has stated that it too has launched rockets into Israel.<b>980</b> The Committee is a coalition 
of different armed factions who oppose what they perceive as the Palestinian Authority and 
Fatah&#8217;s conciliatory approach to Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Type of rockets and mortars held by Palestinian armed groups</b>981<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1616. There is little independent confirmation of the types of weaponry held by Palestinian 
armed groups or the number of weapons that may be stockpiled. According to an Amnesty 
International report, of February 2009, the arsenals held by armed groups in the Gaza Strip 
include: al-Qassam (or al-Quds), 122mm Grad and 220 Fadjr-3 rockets as well as the al-Battar, 
the Banna 1 and Banna 2 anti-armour rockets. 
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                             
<b>975</b> The group was named after a Syrian who worked with displaced Palestinians in what is now northern Israel, and 
died in a clash with British troops in 1935, sparking the Palestinian revolt of 1936-9.<b>

<b>977</b> See http://www.alqassam.ps/arabic/upload/forkan.pdf. 
<b>978</b> According to statistics provided on its website, the Saraya al-Quds Brigades claimed responsibility for the firing 
of 235 mortar and rockets during the military operations , See http://www.israj.net/vb/t1839/. 
</p>
<p><i>See</i> http://www.kataebabuali.ps/inf2/articles-action-show-id-223.htm.  
<b>980</b> During the operations in Gaza, the group claimed responsibility for launching 132 rockets and 88 mortars. See 
http://www.moqawmh.com/moqa/view.php?view=1&amp;id=300.  
<b>981</b> See the Amnesty International report &#8220;Fuelling the Conflict: Foreign arms supplies to Israel/Gaza&#8221;, 23 February 
2009; p. 15-16 and p. 30-31. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. al-Qassams 
</b></p>
<p>1617. There are thought to be at least three generations of Qassam rockets: (a) the Qassam 1, 
developed in 2001, with a range of 4.5 kilometres and an explosive load of 0.5 kilograms; (b) the 
Qassam 2, developed in 2002, with a range of 8-9.5 kilometres and an explosive load of 5-
9 kilogram; and (c) the Qassam 3, developed in 2005, and with a range of 10 kilometres and an 
explosive load of 20 kilograms.<b>982</b>  
</p>
<p>1618. The rockets manufactured in the Gaza Strip are fashioned from rudimentary materials, 
such as hollow metal pipes. They are relatively unsophisticated weapons and lack a guidance 
system, and so cannot be aimed at specific targets.<b>983</b> Jane&#8217;s Terrorism and Security Monitor has 
described them as &#8220;inaccurate, short-range and rarely lethal&#8221;.<b>984</b> Even so, Qassam rockets have 
inflicted both fatalities and injuries to residents of southern Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>2. 122 mm Grad rocket 
</b></p>
<p>1619. 122 mm Grad rocket is a Russian-designed missile with a range of approximately 20 
to25 kilometres. Given the higher level of technological sophistication and the fact that it is 
manufactured with material not easily (if at all) available in Gaza, it is likely that they are not 
made in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1620. While most 122 mm Grad rockets have a range of about 20 kilometres, some have landed 
40 kilometres inside Israel.<b>985</b> Global Security has concluded that on the basis of photographs, 
that the rockets that struck open space near Yavne and Bnei Darom on 28 December 2008 were 
Chinese-manufactured 122 mm WeiShei-1E rockets, which can travel distances of 20 to 
40 kilometres.<b>986</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. 220 mm Fadjr-3 rocket 
</b></p>
<p>1621. The 220 mm Fadjr-3 rocket is Iranian designed and is also thought to be smuggled into 
Gaza. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Anti-armour rockets 
</b></p>
<p>1622. Palestinian armed groups are also alleged to possess Chinese-designed rockets that have 
been smuggled into Gaza.<b>987</b> According to Jane&#8217;s Defence Weekly, Hamas is also in possession

2.<b>988</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Mortars 
</b></p>
<p>1623. Mortars are short-range weapons that are generally more accurate than rockets 
manufactured inside the Gaza Strip.<b>989</b> Mortars have rudimentary aiming systems, in which the 
coordinates of previous strikes can be used to better target subsequent launches. Most mortars 
have a range of 2 kilometres; according to the Jaffa Centre for Strategic Studies, however, the 
Palestinian Sariya-1 is a 240 mm mortar with 15 kilometre range.<b>990</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Rocket and mortar attacks by the Palestinian armed groups on Israel</b>991 
</p>
<p>1624. The Mission is providing a brief history of rocket and mortars attacks, as it is relevant to 
an understanding of the breadth and depth of the psychological trauma suffered by residents of 
communities closest to the border, such as Sderot, that have been in range since 2001. 
</p>
<p>1625. The first recorded rocket launch took place on 16 April 2001. On 10 February 2002, the 
first rocket struck territory inside Israel, when a Qassam 2 rocket fired from Gaza landed in a 
field six kilometres from the border, near Kibbutz Sa&#8217;ad, in the Negev.<b>992</b> The first recorded 
strike of a rocket from Gaza on an Israeli city was on 5 March 2002, when two rockets struck 
Sderot.<b>993</b> 
</p>
<p>1626. According to statistics compiled by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre at 
the Israel Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center an organization with links to the Government of 
Israel, 3,455 rockets and 3,742 mortar shells were fired into Israel from Gaza from 16 April 2001 
to 18 June 2008.  
</p>
<p>1627. The first civilian casualties from rocket fire were recorded on 28 June 2004 in Sderot, 
when Afik Zahavi (4 years old) and Mordehai Yosefof (49 years old) were killed by a Qassam 
rocket. Afik&#8217;s mother, Ruthie Zahavi (28 years old) was critically injured and nine others were 
wounded. Hamas claimed responsibility.<b>994</b>

 <p> 
</p><p>1628. From 28 June 2004, when the first fatalities from rocket fire were recorded, to 17 June 
2008, 21 Israeli citizens, including two Palestinian citizens of Israel, two Palestinians and one 
foreign worker were killed inside Israel as a result of rocket attacks and mortar fire. In addition, a 
Palestinian was killed in Gaza when a rocket landed short of the border, and 20 Palestinians were 
killed when a vehicle transporting rockets exploded in Jabaliya refugee camp. Eleven of those 
killed inside Israel were killed in Sderot, a town of just over 20,000 people situated just over a 
kilometre from the Gaza Strip border. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Statements by Palestinian armed groups concerning  
their launching of rockets into Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1629. The al-Qassam Brigades, al-Aqsa Brigades, Islamic Jihad and Popular Resistance 
Committee all claimed responsibility for rocket and mortar attacks during the time period under 
review by the Mission. Palestinian armed groups generally justify these attacks as a legitimate 
form of resistance to Israeli occupation and as acts of self-defence and reprisals for Israeli 
attacks.<b>995</b> </p>
<p>1630. On 5 January 2009, Hamas member Mahmoud Zahar was quoted as saying that &#8220;the 
Israeli enemy ... shelled everyone in Gaza. They shelled children and hospitals and mosques, and 
in doing so, they gave us legitimacy to strike them in the same way&#8221;.<b>996</b> </p>
<p>1631. On 6 January 2009, during the Israeli military operations in Gaza, Khaled Mashal, 
Chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau  wrote in an open letter that the demand to stop the 
Palestinian resistance was &#8216;absurd &#8230; our modest home made-rockets are our cry of protest to the 
world&#8221;<b>997</b>. Hamas, in a press release published on 28 December 2008,<b>998</b> declared:  
</p>
<p>We appeal to all factions of the Palestinian resistance and its military arm, especially the 
Brigades of the Martyr Izz el-Din al-Qassam to declare a state of general alert &#8230; and take 
upon themselves the responsibility to protect the Palestinian people, by striking with all 
the strength it has the Zionists enemy, its military barracks and colonies, and by using all 
forms of resistance &#8230; including the martyrdom operations and striking the Zionist 
depths&#8230;&#8221;  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>995</b> For example, on 24 June 2008, Islamic Jihad fired three Qassam rockets from Gaza into the Western Negev 
following the targeted assassination of one of its members, Tarek Abu Ghally and another in Nablus earlier that day. 
Islamic Jihad stated &#8220;&#8220;we cannot keep our hands tied when this is happening to our brother in the West Bank&#8221; (The 
Jerusalem Post, 24 June 2008).  See also chap. III.

<b>997</b> &#8220;This brutality will never break our will to be free&#8221; <i>The Guardian, </i>6 January 2009. It should be noted that couple 
of month after the end of OCL and in an interview with <i>the New York Times</i>, Mashal stated that &#8220;not firing the 
rockets currently is part of an evaluation from the movement which serves the Palestinians&#8217; interest. After all, the 
firing is a method, not a goal. Resistance is a legitimate right, but practicing such a right comes under evaluation by 
the movement&#8217;s leaders&#8221;. <i>See</i>  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/world/middleeast/05meshal.html.

 <p> 
1632. A spokesperson for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) stated two 
days before the end of the operations in Gaza that &#8220;the rockets are both practical and a symbolic 
representation of our resistance to the occupier&#8221;.<b>999</b>  </p>
<p>1633. On 25 May 2009, the Gaza authorities denied that they were preventing rocket attacks on 
Israel. A spokesman stated &#8220;we don&#8217;t make such decision without agreeing with all the resistance 
factions in a national consensus&#8230;The factions have the right to respond to any Zionist crime 
using any sort of resistance and there is no lull with the [Israeli] occupation&#8221;.<b>1000</b>  
</p>
<p><b>F. Statements by the Gaza authorities to the Mission 
</b></p>
<p>1634. In a meeting with the Mission on 1 June 2008, the Gaza authorities stated that they had 
taken the initiative to spare civilian lives when they renounced suicide attacks in April 2006.<b>1001</b> 
At the same meeting, a Government spokesperson stated that the resistance factions did not aim 
their rockets at civilians but rather at IDF artillery and other positions from which attacks against 
Gaza were launched. </p>
<p>1635. In response to questions by the Mission, on 29 July 2009, the Gaza authorities stated that 
they had &#8220;nothing to do, directly or indirectly, with al-Qassam or other resistance factions&#8221; and 
stated that they were able to exercise a degree of persuasion over the armed factions in relation to 
proposed ceasefires. While noting that the weaponry used by the armed factions was not 
accurate, the Gaza authorities discouraged the targeting of civilians. </p>
<p>1636. Despite various attempts, the Mission was unable to contact members of armed factions 
operating within the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p><b>G. Precautionary measures in effect in southern Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The Tseva Adom early warning system 
</b></p>
<p>1637. The <i>Tseva Adom</i> (or &#8216;Red Colour&#8217;) is an early warning radar system installed by the 
Israeli armed forces in towns in southern Israel. It was installed in Sderot in 2002 and in different 
areas of Ashkelon in 2005 and 2006. 
</p>
<p>1638. When the early warning system detects the signature of a rocket launch originating in 
Gaza, it automatically activates the public broadcast warning system in nearby Israeli 
communities and military bases. A two-tone electronic audio alert is broadcast twice, followed 
by a recorded female voice intoning the words &#8220;<i>Tseva Adom</i>&#8221;. The entire programme is repeated 
until all rockets have hit and launches are no longer detected. During the public hearings held in 
Geneva on 6 July 2009, Noam Bedein of the Sderot Media Center screened footage of the 
</p>
<p>

<b>1000</b> Xinhua News, 25 May 2005. 
<b>1001</b> The statement was widely reported in the international media. See, &#8220;Hamas in call to end suicide bombings&#8221;, 
<i>The Guardian,</i> 9 April 2006.  </p>

 <p> 
sounding of the early warning system in Sderot and its effect on the community, for the benefit 
of the Mission.<b>1002</b> 
</p>
<p>1639. In Sderot, the system gives residents a warning of approximately 15 seconds before an 
incoming missile strikes. The further residents are from the Gaza Strip, the longer the warning 
period. Residents of Ashkelon interviewed by the Mission estimated that the system gives them a 
20 second warning, while residents of the more northern city of Ashdod or of the town of 
Beersheba in the Negev estimate that the system gives them a warning of approximately 40 to 45 
seconds. 
</p>
<p>1640. It should be noted that the <i>Tseva Adom </i>system is not 100 per cent effective; according to 
Noam Bedein, the system failed to detect a rocket that struck Sderot on 21 May 2007, killing one 
and wounding two others.<b>1003</b> Moreover, the system may also give false alerts, a fact which led 
authorities in Ashkelon to switch off the system in May 2008. Consequently, no warning was 
given when a rocket struck a shopping centre on 14 May 2008, seriously injuring three people 
(including Dr. Emilia Siderer, who appeared before the Mission at the public hearings held in 
Geneva on 6 July 2009). 
</p>
<p>1641. The sounding of the <i>Tseva Adom</i> system and the knowledge that it does not provide a 
guaranteed forewarning of a rocket strike, have, according to organizations providing mental 
health services, also had a profound, adverse psychological effect on the communities living 
within the range of rocket and mortar fire. This issue is discussed in detail below. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Construction of fortifications and shelters 
</b></p>
<p>1642. In recent years, the Government of Israel has fortified towns in southern Israel with bomb 
shelters. Some residential homes contain &#8220;secure rooms&#8221;. In March 2008, the Government 
fortified 120 bus-stops in Sderot<b>1004</b> and, by January 2009, all schools in Sderot had been 
fortified against rocket attacks. 
</p>
<p>1643. According to an article published in <i>Haaretz</i>, approximately 5,000 residents of southern 
Israel, mostly elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, lacked proper reinforced rooms 
or reasonable access to public shelters.<b>1005</b> In interviews with residents of the affected 
communities in southern Israel, the Mission received reports of families abandoning the upper 
floors of their homes and living together in a room on the ground floor for fear of the failure of 
the early warning system and/or not being able to descend from the upper floors quickly enough 
reach a shelter.<b>1006</b>

 <p> 
1644. In March 2009, Sderot inaugurated a reinforced children's recreation centre, designed to 
provide a rocket-proof place for children to play.<b>1007</b> There are fortified playgrounds in Sderot, 
with concrete tunnels painted to look like caterpillars.<b>1008</b>  
</p>
<p>1645. The Government of Israel has stated that, on current information, spending on 
fortifications and shelters between 2005 and 2011 will amount to approximately $ 460 
million.<b>1009</b>  It should be noted, however, that the fortifications do not necessarily prevent rockets 
penetrating these buildings; for instance, on 3 January 2009, a Grad rocket penetrated the 
fortification of a school in Ashkelon, striking an empty classroom.<b>1010</b> 
</p>
<p>1646. The Mission is concerned about the lack of provision of public shelters and fortifications 
in the unrecognized villages in the Negev and in some of the recognized towns and villages 
populated by Palestinian citizens of Israel, living within the range of rocket and mortar fire (see 
paragraph X below). 
</p>
<p><b>H. Impact of rocket and mortar fire on communities in southern Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1647. The Mission notes that the impact on communities is greater than the numbers of fatalities 
and injuries actually sustained. The Mission also notes the information in the Government of 
Israel paper of July 2009, in which an article from <i>the Guardian</i> article was cited, stating that as 
at July 2009, 92 per cent of Sderot residents had seen or heard a rocket impact, 56 per cent had 
had shrapnel fall on their homes and 65 per cent knew someone who had been injured.<b>1011</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Fatalities 
</b></p>
<p>1648. Between 18 June 2008 and 31 July 2009, there were four fatalities in Israel as a 
consequence of rocket and mortar fire from Gaza, of which there were three civilian and one 
military casualties. 
</p>
<p>1649. On 27 December 2008, Beber Vaknin, 58 years of age, of Netivot was killed when a 
rocket fired from Gaza hit an apartment building in Netivot.  
</p>
<p>1650. On 29 December 2008, Hani al-Mahdi, 27 years of age, of Aroar, a Bedouin settlement in 
the Negev, was killed when a Grad-type missile fired from Gaza exploded at a construction site 
in Ashkelon. On the same day, in a separate incident, Irit Sheetrit, 39 years of age, was killed and 
several wounded when a Grad rocket exploded in the centre of Ashdod. The al-Qassam Brigades 
claimed responsibility for the attack.

 <p> 
</p><p>1651. On 29 December 2008, a member of the military, Warrant Officer Lutfi Nasraladin, 38 
years of age, of the Druze town of Daliat el-Carmel, was killed by a mortar attack on a military 
base near Nahal Oz. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Physical injuries 
</b></p>
<p>1652. According to Magen David Adom (MDA), during the period of the Israeli military 
operations in Gaza, a total of 918 civilians were wounded by rocket attacks. This figure includes 
27 critically wounded, 62 moderately wounded and 829 lightly wounded.<b>1012</b> From 19 January to 
19 March 2009, 10 people physically injured from rocket fire were treated by MDA.<b>1013</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Psychological trauma/ mental health 
</b></p>
<p>1653. In interviews with both residents of southern Israel and the organizations dealing with 
mental health issues, the issue of psychological trauma suffered by adults and children living in 
the zone of rocket fire was repeatedly raised. While news articles sometimes report on people 
being treated for shock following a rocket strike, both individuals and organizations have voiced 
a real frustration with the lack of focus on what they termed the &#8220;invisible damage&#8221; caused by 
rockets. According to MDA, 1,596 people were treated by health facilities in Israel between 
27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009.<b>1014</b> From 19 January to 2 August 2009, 549 people 
from Sderot alone were treated for stress-related injuries.<b>1015</b> 
</p>
<p>1654. A study of October 2007, commissioned by NATAL, on the impact of the ongoing 
traumatic stress conditions on Sderot<b>1016</b> found that 28.4 per cent of adults and between 72 and 
94 per cent of children in Sderot reported signs indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder.<b>1017</b> 
The study also found that children under the age of 12 years showed a high frequency of reported 
                                                 
<b>1012</b> MDA communication to the Mission, 9 August 2009. The Mission notes the figures given in the HRW report of 
August 2009 which outlined the number of people treated by MDA: 770 people including 3 fatalities, 4 severely 
wounded, 11 moderately wounded and 167 lightly wounded. See HRW report of August 2009, p. 8. 
<b>1013</b> HRW report of August 2009, p. 8. 
<b>1014</b> MDA communication to the Mission, 9 August 2009. Human Rights Watch quotes reports from MDA that it 
had itself treated 570 cases of people suffering from stress-related injuries: see HRW report of August 2009, p. 8 
This figure was confirmed in a meeting between MDA and representatives of the Mission in Geneva on 22 July 
2009.

traumatic stress symptoms&#8221;, <i>Haaretz</i>, 17 January 2008; These findings were confirmed by Dr. Rony Berger who 
spoke at the public hearings in Geneva on 6 July 2009. Dr Berger also stated that consumption of tranquillisers was 
2.5 times as high in Sderot than in communities of similar size and socio-economic status that did not live under 
bombardment. The Mission notes also the 29 July 2009 submission by Dr. Yechiel Lasry, Mayor of Ashdod in 
which he detailed similar symptoms in children in Ashdod following the rocket attacks on Ashdod during the 
military operations in Gaza. </p>

 <p> 
symptoms including fear, avoidance, behavioural problems, problems at school, somatic 
problems, regression and difficulty in sleeping.<b>1018</b> 
</p>
<p>1655. In a submission to the Mission, Dr. Rony Berger, a clinical psychologist and Director of 
Community Services described a January 2009 visit to a family in Ofakim, a town 12-15 
kilometres from the Gaza border, in the following terms: 
</p>
<p> The family was referred to the Community Staff for treatment by the father, who 
works at one of the factories in the south. He said that his house had &#8220;turned into a 
madhouse&#8221;, and that the level of stress was so high that &#8220;you could cut the air with a 
knife&#8221;&#8230;.When I reached the family home in Ofakim, I found a house full of children 
(12 children, aged one year to 22 years). It was a large house, and full of life; perhaps 
more accurately &#8211; frantic. I arrived exactly as the siren was sounding, and I saw a 
range of anxiety-related responses, some of which were certainly extreme. The mother 
was screaming at the top of her voice, her sister turned completely white, the younger 
children cried, the eldest daughter (22) froze and had difficulty moving towards the 
secure room, while her younger brother (14) seemed almost catatonic. The father, who 
had called me, moved towards the reinforced room slowly and apathetically, as he 
turned towards me, pointing towards his family members, and said: &#8220;You see what I 
have to deal with every day.&#8221; His daughter urged him, screaming, to move faster, but 
it seemed that the louder she shouted, the slower he moved towards the reinforced 
room. They started arguing very loudly, while all the rest of the family joined into the 
fray.<b>1019</b> 
</p>
<p>1656. Dalia Yosef of the Sderot Resiliency Center stated that the Center&#8217;s 18 therapists provided 
counselling to over 300 people in Sderot during the military operations in Gaza and noted that 
trauma symptoms were particularly noticeable in children. Ms. Yosef stated that trauma was 
triggered not only by the rocket strikes but also by the sounding of the early warning system 
alerts, even where no rocket strike subsequently occurred.<b>1020</b> 
</p>
<p>1657. The observations made by the organizations dealing with treating trauma were borne out 
in the descriptions of daily life made in the interviews held with residents in the affected 
communities.<b>1021</b> The Community Manager of Kibbutz Gevim, near Sderot, stated that 60 per 
cent of children in the kibbutz were in touch with psychological services.<b>1022</b>A resident of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1018</b> At a meeting with the Mission on 22 July 2009, MDA described similar symptoms of stress-related injuries that 
their paramedics had observed and treated when called out following rocket and mortar attacks in southern Israel. 
<b>1019</b> Submission by NATAL, &#8216;Description of a recent home visit by NATAL's Dr Rony Berger to a family in Ofakim 
&#8211; January 2009, submitted to the Mission on 3 July 2009.<b> 
1020</b> Telephone interview with Dalia Yosef, Sderot Resiliency Center, 2 July 2009. 
<b>1021</b> For example, Ofer Shinar during the public hearings in Geneva on 6 July 2009 described his observation of 
psychological trauma of civilians, including his students, in Sderot following rocket attacks during the time of the 
operation in Gaza.  
<b>1022</b> Telephone interview with Avi Kadosh, 26 June 2009. </p>

 <p> 
Beersheba described how she was unable to sleep in her apartment because of panic attacks and 
how she now lived with relatives.<b>1023</b>  
</p>
<p>1658. In a telephone interview on 29 July 2009, Avirama Golan, a journalist for <i>Haaretz </i>who 
lived in Sderot from April 2008 to May 2009, commented on the psychological impact of living 
under rocket fire:  
</p>
<p> You get used to it in a sense but it changes your perception of the world, of the 
way that the world functions. Your sense of what is normal becomes skewed. You 
cannot be sure of anything. All the authorities that children have - their mother, their 
father - they don&#8217;t count. Nothing can keep you safe. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Damage to property 
</b></p>
<p>1659. Where rockets have landed in towns and villages in southern Israel, they have caused 
localized property damage. This has included private houses<b>1024</b> and cars.<b>1025</b> During the 
operations in Gaza, a total of nine schools and kindergartens in Sderot, Beersheba, Ashdod, 
Ashkelon and Kiryat Ha Hinoch were hit and damaged by rockets.<b>1026</b> Two kindergartens were 
struck and damaged by rocket fire in Ashdod.<b>1027</b> On 8 January 2009, a Grad rocket hit a school 
in Ashkelon.<b>1028</b>  
</p>
<p>1660. On 26 February 2009, a rocket launched from Gaza damaged two houses in Sderot.<b>1029</b> On 
5 March 2009, a rocket hit a synagogue in Netivot, causing light damage.<b>1030</b>  
</p>
<p>1661. The Mission was not able to obtain an estimate of the financial cost of the damage to 
property caused by rocket and mortar fire. In its paper of July 2009, the Government of Israel 
stated, &#8220;for direct damage caused to buildings or property as a result of rocket or mortar attacks 
2,400 claims, amounting to a total of 31 million NIS ($7.95 million) were submitted in 2008, in 
</p>

<b>1025</b> On 17 December 2008, a rocket landed in the carpark of a shopping centre in Sderot, injuring three people and 
causing serious damage to a supermarket and to cars. See &#8220;Three injured in Kassam attack&#8221;, <i>JTA</i>, 17 December

Assembly, UN Doc S/2009/158, para. 90, dated 26 March 2009.  Details of the damage to Ashkelon schools were 
also given by Benny Vaknin, mayor of Ashkelon and Dr. Alan Marcus, Director of Strategic Planning, in their 
presentation to the Mission at the public hearings in Geneva on 6 July 2009.

 <p> 
addition to 2,300 additional claims between January and July 2009, of which a total of 
approximately 25 million NIS ($6.4 million) was granted thus far&#8221;.<b>1031</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Impact on the right to education 
</b></p>
<p>1662. The combination of the early warning systems alarms (and the move to the shelters), the 
rockets strikes and the ongoing psychological trauma caused by the alerts and the strikes had an 
adverse impact on the right to education of children and young adults in the affected 
communities in southern Israel.<b>1032</b> 
</p>
<p>1663. Most obvious is the disruption caused to education caused by the closure of schools 
during heightened hostilities. During the operations in Gaza, educational institutions in Sderot, 
Ashkelon and Ashdod and across areas within rocket range were closed.  
</p>
<p>1664. Even when classes are held in more peaceful times, education is disrupted by students 
having to move to secure areas every time that the early warning system sounds, at time from 
10 to 20 times a day, making it virtually impossible for classes to be held. When interviewed 
on 24 June 2009, Merav Moshe, a lecturer at Sapir College near Sderot, told the Mission:  
</p>
<p> At Sapir, the atmosphere is tense. Both the faculty and the students are in a state 
of fear and are perpetually anxious. It is impossible to teach or for students to 
concentrate on their studies when they have to run back and forth to the shelters. Even 
in classes that are protected, the students need to move forward and herd in the front of 
the room away from the windows. It is not a good learning or teaching environment. 
</p>
<p>1665. Commenting on the impact of the education of children in the kibbutzim near Sderot, Avi 
Kadosh, during a telephone interview on 29 June 2009, stated 
</p>
<p> Children here can&#8217;t run around and play. They have to stay close to a secure 
place. The older ones have grown up with it and know the drills. They know they have 
15 seconds to get inside to a protected place. Some children have been born into it and 
for them; they clap their hands and run to the safety room. It is also difficult for them 
to get to class. The rockets are disruptive and the atmosphere is not conducive to 
learning. 
</p>
<p>1666. Those who are experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder have a 
diminished ability to learn. In a telephone interview on 29 June 2009, Batya Katar, the Director 
of the Parents&#8217; Committee concerned with schools and kindergartens in Sderot, told the Mission 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1031</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, footnote 27. 
<b>1032</b> According to the Government of Israel, there were a total of 196,444 students within the rocket range; &#8220;The 
operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, para. 50.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> It is difficult to describe the suffering of the children when they hear the red alert. 
They do not even need to see the Qassam, just the alert is enough. Children start to 
cry, to wet themselves. Sometimes it is like people are having an epileptic fit: they 
start shaking uncontrollably. Immediately, when there is an alert near a school, a 
group of psychologists usually come to speak to the students.<b>1033</b> 
</p>
<p>1667.  In their interviews, three lecturers at Sapir College spoke of students who, following 
repeated rocket attacks on the school, felt unable to continue their studies.<b>1034</b> Ofer Shinar, during 
the public hearings in Geneva on 6 July 2009, gave a description of a student at Sapir College 
who had assisted in escorting residents of Sderot during the time of the military operations in 
Gaza, and later suffered from psychological trauma and stopped attending most of her classes. 
The issue of students either dropping out of their courses or transferring to colleges outside 
rocket range has had significant financial implications for Sapir College, which depends, in part, 
on student fees to fund itself.<b>1035</b> 
</p>
<p>1668. Similar statements were made during a telephone interview on 26 June 2009, by  the 
Community Director of Kibbutz Nir-Am and Kibbutz Gevim, Avi Kadosh, who stated that 
families with young children were increasingly leaving their homes in the kibbutzim to move to 
safer places and that this made it increasingly difficult to run the education system on the 
kibbutz.  
</p>
<p>1669. During a telephone interview on 2 July 2009, Dalia Yosef of the Sderot Resiliency Center 
stated: 
</p>
<p> The children do not have a routine life, in a safe place, and it affects their ability 
to learn and to be educated. Schools are not safe places for them, nor are their homes. 
The stress affects their behaviour and how it impacts them. There is increasing 
violence in the schools as the children act out. There is a lot of stress in the air and it is 
difficult to exist for a long time in this situation without being affected. It is of course 
the same for the children in Gaza. They do not have a chance to have a normal life.  
</p>
<p><b>6. Impact on the economic and social life of communities 
</b></p>
<p>1670. In the interviews conducted by the Mission, it was clear that the impact on  communities 
that had only recently come under the effect of rocket and mortar fire was different to that on 
those that had been living in that  situation for the past five to eight years. 
</p>
<p>1671. In towns such as Ashdod, Yavne and Beersheba, which experienced rocket strikes for the 
first time during the military operations in Gaza, there was temporary displacement of some of 
its residents, who chose to move northwards out of the range of fire for the duration of the

<b>1033</b> Mission also notes the submission of 29 July 2009 by Dr, Yechiel Lasry, mayor of Ashdod which quotes the 
head of the Ashdod Psychology Center, Mr. Haviv Galili, as saying that it took 6-8 weeks for a number of a classes 
&#8220;to return to stability and normal life&#8221;.

 <p> 
operations. In these towns, brief disruption to the economic and social life of the communities 
was experienced. 
</p>
<p>1672. In towns closer to the Gaza border, such as Sderot, the recent rocket fire has merely 
consolidated an exodus started in the previous years. In an interview with the Mission, Eli 
Moyal, former mayor of Sderot, stated: 
</p>
<p> Over 15 per cent of the people living in Sderot have left, moved away 
permanently. Mainly it was the people who could afford to move and it meant that a 
lot of business closed down &#8211; almost half the businesses that existed in 2001 have 
closed down. It also meant that the municipality was losing its tax base and it made it 
much more difficult to supply the services that we are supposed to. This includes 
kindergartens and other educational services.  
</p>
<p>1673. Stewart Ganulin, on behalf of Hope for Sderot, a non-profit organization which assists, 
financially and practically, those injured by rocket fire and families who have lost a member, 
stated to the Mission on 8 July 2009, that the organization alone was helping 576 people from 
133 families of the 3000 families on welfare in Sderot. 
</p>
<p>1674. The kibbutzim surrounding Sderot have also been particularly affected because tourists 
from abroad and other parts of Israel no longer come to stay there. Yeela Ranan, interviewed on 
9 July 2009, stated that house prices in Sderot had fallen by 50 per cent. Both residents of Sderot 
and the surrounding kibbutzim commented on the downturn in their livelihood resulting from 
living in a community under rocket and mortar fire.  
</p>
<p><b>7. The unrecognized Palestinian Arab Bedouin villages of the Negev 
</b></p>
<p>1675. The unrecognized villages in the Negev are Palestinian Arab Bedouin villages that are not 
recognized by Israel<b>1036</b> and have been subjected to demolitions by the Israeli authorities. They 
are not marked on any commercial maps and are ineligible for municipal services such as 
connection to the electricity grid, water mains or for garbage collection. According to the 
Director of the Regional Council for the Unrecognized Villages, Atwa Abu Fraih, in an 
interview on 30 July 2009, approximately 90,000 people live in these villages, including 17,000 
schoolchildren. 
</p>
<p>1676. According to Physicians for Human Rights - Israel, these villages are in range of rocket 
fire but have no early warning system, nor have any shelters been built to protect the residents 
who live there.<b>1037</b> As much was confirmed by the Director of the Regional Council of 
Unrecognized Villages, Atwa Abu Fraih, who told the Mission that most of the structures in the

<b>1036</b> Between 1948 and 1966, Israel imposed a military administration on Palestinian Israelis in the region and 
designated 85 per cent of the Negev as &quot;State land.&quot; All Bedouin habitation was retroactively termed illegal and 
consequently remains, with few exceptions, unrecognized under Israeli planning criteria and therefore subject to 
demolition and appropriation into regional plans under Jewish Agency criteria; (i.e., exclusively for &#8220;Jewish 
nationals&#8221;).

 <p> 
villages were made of zinc, including all the schools and that none of the unrecognized villages 
had any shelters from rocket or mortar fire. He also pointed out that none of the unrecognized 
villages was equipped with the early warning alarm system though seven recognized villages 
did. Unrecognized villages close to either recognized villages with an early warning system or 
Jewish Israeli towns could hear the alarms. He stated, however, that the early warning system 
was of little use if there were no shelters. The Director of the Regional Council stated that, if a 
rocket landed in the unrecognized villages, the consequences would be &#8220;disastrous&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1677. While no fatalities or injuries have been recorded in these communities, Physicians for 
Human Rights &#8211; Israel has confirmed that a number of the residents of these villages have been 
referred for psychological treatment in the aftermath of rocket and mortar strikes. 
</p>
<p><b>8. Recognized Palestinian towns and villages in southern Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1678. Where the towns and villages predominantly populated by Palestinian citizens of Israel 
are recognized (and consequently eligible for municipal services such as electricity), they still 
lack the public shelters commonly found in towns and villages populated predominantly by 
Israel&#8217;s Jewish citizens.  
</p>
<p>1679. Rahat is located 24 kilometres from Gaza and has a population of 45,000 residents. It has 
no public shelters and few houses have secure rooms. On 30 January 2009, a rocket exploded 
approximately half a mile from Rahat. The Government of Israel, in a report in the <i>Associated 
Press</i>, stated that it was conducting a public information campaign in Arabic in the broadcast and 
print media; according to residents, however, this was of little use if public shelters were not 
made available.<b>1038</b> 
</p>
<p>1680. In its recent paper, &#8220;The Operation in Gaza: Factual and Legal Aspects&#8221;, the Government 
of Israel stated that the 
</p>
<p> Israeli authorities took a variety of measures to protect its citizens and to reduce 
the risk to civilians, with special attention being given to sensitive facilities, such as 
educational institutions and hospitals. These efforts included the establishment of 
public shelters and fortifications of public institutions, as well as the instruction of the 
population in risk how to act in times of emergency.<b>1039</b> 
</p>
<p>1681. The Mission is concerned about the disparity in treatment of Jewish and Palestinian 
citizens by the Government of Israel in the installation of early warning systems and provision of 
public shelters and fortified schools between its Jewish and Palestinian citizens. This is 
particularly noticeable in the case of the unrecognized villages, some of which are within the 
now increased zone of rocket fire, and which have no means of protection from rocket and 
mortar attacks.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I. Legal analysis and conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1682. The Mission emphasizes the obligation of the Gaza authorities to respect international law 
(see chap. IV above), and is of the view that this requires the prevention and prosecution of 
violations of international law occurring within its area of de facto governmental authority.<b>1040</b> 
The issue of accountability is discussed below. The Mission considers that the international 
humanitarian law norms referred to below are relevant to an analysis of the situation described 
above. 
</p>
<p>1683. International law attributes a duty to parties to hostilities to protect and respect civilians. 
Such a duty is part of customary international law and is codified in treaty law through article 27, 
paragraph 1, of Geneva Convention IV. Furthermore, combatants have an obligation, under 
article 48 of Additional Protocol I, to distinguish between civilians and combatants and civilian 
objects and military objects during the conduct of hostilities. Article 51 (4) of Additional 
Protocol I explicitly prohibits indiscriminate attacks. Article 51 (6) of Additional Protocol I 
strictly prohibits reprisals against civilians. The relevant legal provisions are set out above in 
chapter XVI. 
</p>
<p>1684. Article 51(2) of Additional Protocol I prohibits &#8220;acts or threats of violence the primary 
purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population&#8221;. Article 13 (2) of Additional 
Protocol II contains a similar prohibition. Article 4 (2) (d) of Additional Protocol II prohibits acts 
of terrorism as a violation of the &#8220;fundamental guarantees&#8221; of humane treatment under the 
Additional Protocol.<b>1041</b> The same rule is considered a rule of customary law in international and 
non international armed conflicts.<b>1042</b> Such a crime has been charged in indictments both before 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the Special Court for Sierra 
Leone.  
</p>
<p>1685. At the Special Court for Sierra Leone, Trial Chamber 1, in the case of <i>Prosecutor </i>v.<i> Sesay 
et al.,</i> held that the elements of the above-mentioned offence were as follows: 
</p>
<p>(i) Acts or threats of violence; 
</p>
<p>(ii) The Accused wilfully made the civilian population or individual civilians not taking 
direct part in hostilities the objects of those acts or threats of violence;  
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1040</b> The Mission draws attention to the &#8216;Trail Smelter&#8217; arbitration in which the arbitration tribunal found that &#8220;under 
the principles of international law&#8230;.no state has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as 
to cause injury [by fumes] in or to the territory or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious 
consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence&#8221;; Trail Smelter Arbitration, (1938/1941) 
3 R.I.A.A. 1905.  
<b>1041</b> This prohibition was, in turn, based on article 33 of Geneva Convention IV, which prohibited &#8220;all measures of 
intimidation or of terrorism&#8221; of or against protected persons. 
<b>1042</b> Study on international humanitarian law, ICRC, Vol. 1, Rule 2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(iii) The acts or threats of violence were carried out with the specific intent of spreading 
terror among the civilian population.<b>1043</b> 
</p>
<p>1686. The Appeals Chamber of the ICTY in <i>Prosecutor v. Galic</i> held that: 
</p>
<p> The acts or threats of violence constitutive of the crime of terror shall not 
however be limited to direct attacks against civilians or threats thereof but may 
include indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks or threats thereof. The nature of 
the acts or threats of violence directed against the civilian population can vary; the 
primary concern [&#8230;] is that those acts or threats of violence be committed with the 
specific intent to spread terror among the civilian population.<b>1044</b>  
</p>
<p><b>J. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>1687. There is no justification in international law for the launching of rockets and mortars that 
cannot be directed at specific military targets into areas where civilian populations are located. 
Indeed, Palestinian armed groups, among them Hamas, have publicly expressed their intention to 
target Israel civilians.  The al-Qassam Brigades, on their website, claimed responsibility for the 
deaths of each of the Israeli civilians killed by rocket fire during the operations in Gaza.<b>1045</b> 
</p>
<p>1688. From the facts it ascertained, the Mission finds that the Palestinian armed groups have 
failed in their duty to protect and respect civilians. Even though the al-Qassam Brigades and 
other armed groups in Gaza have recently claimed that they do not intend to harm civilians, the 
fact that they continue to launch rockets at populated areas without any definite military targets 
and are aware of the consequences to civilians indicates an intent to target civilians. 
Furthermore, the launching of unguided rockets and mortars breaches the fundamental principle 
of distinction: an attack must distinguish between military and civilian targets. Where there is no 
intended military target and the rockets and mortars are launched into civilian areas, they 
constitute a deliberate attack against the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>1689. Given the apparent inability of the Palestinian armed groups to aim rockets and mortars at 
specific targets and, the fact that the attacks have caused very little damage to Israeli military 
assets, it is plausible that one of the primary purposes of these continued attacks is to spread 
terror &#8211; prohibited under international humanitarian law -among the civilian population of 
southern Israel.  
</p>
<p>

words &#8220;with the primary purpose&#8221;, rather than with the &#8220; specific intent&#8221;. 
<b>1044</b> <i>Prosecutor v. Galic,</i> Appeal Judgment, 30 November 2006,  para. 102. This position was endorsed by the

 <p> 
1690. The above view is supported by public statements of the armed groups, such as that made 
by Hamas on 5 November 2008. Following an Israeli raid in Gaza<b>1046</b> which resulted in the death 
of five Hamas militants<b>1047</b>, a Hamas spokesman stated &#8220;The Israelis began this tension and they 
must pay an expensive price&#8230; They cannot leave us drowning in blood while they sleep soundly 
in their beds&#8221;.<b>1048</b> As noted in chapter XVI, reprisal attacks cannot be carried out against a 
civilian population.  
</p>
<p>1691. From the facts available, the Mission finds that the rocket and mortars attacks, launched 
by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, have caused terror in the affected communities of southern 
Israel and in Israel as a whole. Furthermore, it is the Mission&#8217;s view that the mortars and rockets 
are uncontrolled and uncontrollable, respectively. This indicates the commission of an 
indiscriminate attack on the civilian population of southern Israel, a war crime, and may amount 
to crimes against humanity. These attacks have caused loss of life and physical and mental injury 
to civilians and damage to private houses, religious buildings and property and have eroded the 
economic and cultural life of the affected communities. 
</p>
<p><b>XXV. REPRESSION OF DISSENT IN ISRAEL, RIGHT TO ACCESS  
TO INFORMATION AND TREATMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
DEFENDERS 
</b></p>
<p>1692. In the course of its investigations, including in meetings, submissions and public 
testimonies, the Mission received allegations that sources of criticism of actions by Israel during 
and following the military operations of December 2008-January 2009 from inside Israel were 
subjected to attempted or actual repression, and that the rights of freedom of association and 
expression for individuals and groups had been violated. In this regard, concerns were also raised 
about the denial of access to the media and to human rights monitors prior, during and after the 
military operations in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1693. The Mission conducted telephone interviews with people who participated in protests or 
who worked for non-governmental organizations working on human rights inside Israel. Shir 
Hever of the Alternative Information Center appeared at the public hearings held in Geneva on 
6 July 2009 to speak specifically about the issue of repression of dissent inside Israel. This issue 
was also discussed in meetings with and submissions by human rights organizations, journalists 
and other relevant individuals.  
</p>
<p>1694. The Mission was unable to conduct on-site investigations owing to the decision by the 
Government of Israel not to cooperate with the Mission. Accordingly, it was not able possible to 
obtain the views of the police and other State authorities involved in some of the incidents. The 
Mission has taken this into account in its assessment of the available information. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1046</b> The Israeli forces declared that the incursion was aim at destroying a tunnel which they believed was being dug 
to kidnap Israeli soldiers. 
<b>1047</b> One militant was killed in the fighting while four others were killed following an Israeli air strike on rocket 
launchers after 30 Qassam rockets had been launched into Israel following the Israeli incursion.

 <p> 
</p><p>1695. The Mission addressed questions to the Government of Israel regarding Israeli citizens 
arrested during or as result of demonstrations during the military operations in Gaza. The 
Mission did not receive any reply to its questions. 
</p>
<p>1696. The Mission has identified five areas warranting further examination: (a) the matters 
arising from protests inside Israel; (b) the judicial responses to these actions; (c) the interrogation 
of political activists by the General Security Services (<i>Shabak</i>); (d) freedom of association and 
the treatment of human rights organizations inside Israel and (e) access of the media and of 
human rights monitors to Gaza prior to, during and after the military operations. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Protests inside Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. General 
</b></p>
<p>1697. While the majority of Jewish citizens in Israel supported military action in Gaza,<b>1049</b> 
demonstrations and vigils were held across Israel &#8211; daily in some areas - against the military 
operations.  As might be expected, smaller protests took place on weekdays, while larger ones 
were held on on the weekends. Protests took place in numerous towns and villages across Israel, 
the most important being: the demonstration of 150,000 people in Sakhnin,<b>1050</b> the largest 
demonstration of Palestinian Israelis since 1948; a 100,000-strong protest in Baqa al Gharbiyah 
in the &#8220;Triangle&#8221;;<b>1051</b>a demonstration of  15,000 people in Naqab; a protest by more than 10,000 
people in Tel Aviv and protests of a similar size in Haifa. Protests were also witnessed in 
southern localities, including Beersheba and Ararah.<b>1052</b> Daily protests took place not only in 
towns and villages populated mainly by Palestinian citizens of Israel, but also in Haifa<b>1053</b> and 
Tel Aviv.  
</p>
<p>1698. According to information received by the Mission, the protests against the Israeli military 
operations in Gaza were, in the main, attended by Palestinian Israelis; even though protests 
usually also included Jewish Israelis. In Tel Aviv, Jewish Israelis reportedly made up 30 to 40 
per cent of the larger weekend demonstrations.<b>1054</b>  The Mission took note of reports that in areas 
where mainly Jewish Israelis resided, such as Tel Aviv and Beersheba, counter protests were 
sometimes organized or spontaneously formed. While there were verbal confrontations between 
the two groups of protesters, physical violence was rare. 
</p>

<b>1051</b> The area commonly known as the &#8220;Triangle&#8221; is a concentration of  Palestinian Israeli towns and villages 
adjacent to the Green Line, located in the eastern Sharon plain. From the air, the towns and villages form a triangle, 
thus the name.  
<b>1052</b> Telephone interviews with Leah Shakdiel, 24 June 2009; Atwa Abu Fraih, 30 July 2009. 
<b>1053</b> Significantly, Haifa has a sizeable Palestinian Israel population. In 2003, the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics 
found that 9 per cent of the population of Haifa was Palestinian Israeli; see

<b>1054</b> Telephone interview with Haggai Matar, 24 July 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Police conduct 
</b></p>
<p>1699. According to information received by the Mission, in areas of northern Israel populated 
mainly by Israel&#8217;s Palestinian citizens (such as Sakhnin, Nazareth and Baqa al-Gharbiyah), the 
police did not enter the town during the protests but remained on the outskirts. This decision was 
apparently taken in coordination with town authorities,<b>1055</b> on the agreed view that the protests 
would be more orderly if the police remained out of sight. 
</p>
<p>1700. In Tel Aviv and Haifa, the police tended to be visible to protesters.<b>1056</b> With a few 
exceptions (see below) police interference was limited. In Haifa, smaller demonstrations were 
attended by almost as many police officers as protesters, and the number of cameras being used 
by the police to record the protest had an intimidating effect.<b>1057</b> Police blocked off streets 
around the demonstrations in both cities, with the consequence that protests took place in near 
deserted areas; one protester remarked that &#8220;it was as though we were demonstrating to 
ourselves&#8221;.<b>1058</b> While the media had free access, the Mission&#8217;s attention was drawn to the fact 
that there was little coverage of the protests by the international or Israeli media. 
</p>
<p>1701. In the south, in towns populated by Palestinian Israelis, police action mirrored that taken 
in the North; remaining on the outskirts of the town while the protests continued inside. There 
were report<b>s</b>, however, of significant difficulties for protesters in obtaining permits, even where 
the protests were being staged in areas outside the military zone in effect in the areas around 
Gaza. This compared unfavourably with reports from Tel Aviv and Haifa, where police generally 
allowed protests, regardless of whether permits had been obtained. 
</p>
<p>1702. In areas in the south populated by Jewish Israelis, such as Beersheba, police maintained a 
presence near the demonstrators and were apparently less tolerant of the protests against the 
military operations in Gaza than their colleagues policing protests in the north. One protester 
stated that this was because dissent in the south was an embarrassment to Israel, which claimed 
that the military operations in Gaza were motivated by the need to defend southern Israel.<b>1059</b> It 
should be noted, however, that there were significant episodes of counter protest in Beersheba, 
which had come under rocket fire during the operations in Gaza.<b>1060</b>  
</p>

</p>
<p><b>3. Arrests of protesters 
</b></p>
<p>1703. According to statistics that Adalah obtained from the police, 715 protesters were arrested 
inside Israel.<b>1061</b> This number included 277 people arrested in Jerusalem. Unfortunately, the 
statistics make no distinction between East and West Jerusalem.<b>1062</b>  
</p>
<p>1704. The Mission notes that, given the large number of people involved in the demonstrations, 
which it estimates to be in the hundreds of thousands, relatively few arrests were made. It was, 
however, struck by reports that no arrests seem to have been made of people participating in 
counter-demonstrations supporting the military operations in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>1705. According to the police statistics obtained by Adalah, 34 per cent of those arrested were 
under the age of 18.<b>1063</b> Of those charged with an offence, the majority were charged with 
&#8220;attacking police officers&#8221;, &#8220;unlawful assembly&#8221; and &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221;.<b>1064</b> While Adalah 
noted that only in a few cases were those arrested charged with &#8220;endangering life on a public 
road&#8221;,<b>1065</b> the Meezan Center for Human Rights in Nazareth noted that a large number of those 
arrested in the northern areas mainly populated by Palestinian Israelis had been charged with that 
offence.<b>1066</b>  
</p>
<p><b>4. Physical violence against protesters 
</b></p>
<p>1706. The Mission received several submissions about the beating of protesters by the police. 
These incidents appeared to have been a disproportionate response by the police either when 
they believed that the protesters were not complying, or not complying fast enough, with their 
orders and, in some instances, where protesters were themselves breaking the law (for example, 
by throwing stones at the police). 
</p>
<p><b>Ben Gurion street, Haifa, 1 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p>1707. On 1 January 2009, a silent candle-light vigil was held on Ben Gurion street in Haifa. A 
number of prominent Palestinian Israeli actors were present at the vigil, including Hanan Helu 
and Saleh Bakri. In a telephone interview on 29 July 2009, Mr. Bakri stated that, the police and 
members of the Israeli special forces requested that the group move, which it did before sitting 
further down the street. Protesters were then confronted by the police and beaten about their 
lower bodies; some of them were arrested.<b>1067</b> According to Adalah, the police refused to provide

<b>1062</b> The Mission considers East Jerusalem part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, with the consequence that 
had the Mission been able to distinguish arrests in East Jerusalem from those in West Jerusalem, the former would

medical assistance to the injured protesters who were detained.<b>1068</b> Those who were arrested and 
taken to the police station reported that the police verbally abused them and made sexual 
comments about female members of their families. At the police station, Mr. Bakri, well known 
in Israeli and Palestinian public life, was made to stand without moving for 30 minutes facing the 
Israeli flag while police officers took photographs and filmed him.<b>1069</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Egyptian embassy, Tel Aviv, 29 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>1708. On 29 December 2008, approximately 120 people protested in the vicinity of the Egyptian 
embassy in Tel Aviv. They <b>w</b>ere protesting against what they believed to be Egyptian support for 
the action by Israel in Gaza. The demonstration was being held in a designated area, as indicated 
both by Israeli police and, reportedly, members of the Israeli special forces at the scene.<b>1070</b> 
According to one protester, soon after the protest started, people passing by started to verbally 
abuse the protesters and waved Israeli flags at them. The police and members of the special 
forces asked the protesters to leave.<b>1071</b> According to the same protester, the police started to hit 
the other protesters about the lower body with sticks in an apparent effort to disperse them.<b>1072</b> 
Another protester stated that she had been released by the police once they realized that she was 
Jewish, while the Palestinian Israeli protesters were arrested.<b>1073</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Kofor Cana and Umm al-Fahem (dates unknown) 
</b></p>
<p>1709. During the Israeli military operations in Gaza, protests were held in Kofor Cana<b>1074</b> and 
Umm al-Fahem,<b> 1075</b> both throughout the week and on weekends. According to Hassan Tabaja, a 
lawyer at the Meezan Center for Human Rights, in both places there were instances of police 
violence and use of tear gas in reaction to stone throwing by some of the younger protesters. 
There were reports that the police also beat bystanders.<b>1076</b> Those arrested reported having been 
beaten both in police vans and at the police station, subjected to racial abuse and sexual 
comments made about female members of their families.<b>1077</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Other inappropriate conduct 
</b></p>
<p>1710. The Mission was informed that permission was denied for or attempts were made to 
prevent demonstrations, such as the &#8220;Critical Mass&#8221; bicycle protest on 1 January 2009 in Tel 
Aviv which was barred from moving beyond Rabin Square;<b>1078</b> in another instance, a bus in 
which protesters were travelling to participate in demonstrations was prevented by the police 
from reaching its destinations in Tel Aviv;<b>1079</b> the bus driver was intimidated by the police, his 
licence confiscated and the bus was impounded. On 16 January 2009, two buses of protesters 
accompanying a truck of medical supplies for Gaza donated by Physicians for Human Rights 
Israel were stopped near Ashkelon and prevented from entering the military zone, where 
gatherings of more than four people were not permitted for security reasons. The police, 
however, confiscated the drivers&#8217; licences, told the drivers to follow them and took the licences 
to Tel Aviv, where the drivers could collect them.<b>1080</b> The drivers were reportedly told that, if 
they proceeded further, they would lose their licences.  
</p>
<p>1711. In the case of one demonstration planned in Tel Aviv, the police had placed a condition 
that no Palestinian flags would be allowed at the demonstration. The organizers approached the 
Court on the grounds that there was no such restriction in the law. The police issued a permit 
before the case was decided, and the demonstration was held with Palestinian flags.<b>1081</b> Other 
demonstrations with protesters holding Palestinian flags were also held in Tel Aviv without any 
interference by the police.<b>1082</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Judicial responses following the arrests of protesters 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Detention pending trial 
</b></p>
<p>1712.  In his public testimony before the Mission, Shir Hever of the Alternative Information 
Center highlighted a worrying new trend in the way that arrests of protestors were dealt with in 
the Israeli legal system. In many cases, the Prosecutor requests that the Court order that the 
protester be detained pending conviction or release and that these submissions are generally 
accepted by the courts. According to Hever, detention pending trial is usually reserved for 
defendants thought to be dangerous, not for people arrested during protests. This has resulted in 
protesters being detained for weeks and months at a time.<b>1083</b>  
</p>
<p>1713. Hassan Tabaja stated that those arrested often faced &#8220;super-charged&#8221; indictments, where 
the most serious possible charge had been selected by the Prosecution.<b>1084</b> For example, for 
protesting on a road, instead of being charged with disturbing the peace or an illegal gathering, 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
people were sometimes charged with &#8220;endangering life on a public road&#8221;, a charge that carries a 
sentence of 20 years. The severity of the charge greatly increases the chance of being detained 
pending trial. 
</p>
<p>1714. On 12 January 2009, the Israeli Supreme Court decided that, given the ongoing military 
operations in Gaza, it could not allow certain persons to be released on bail.<b>1085</b>  This decision 
was subsequently followed by those of the lower courts, where petitions demanding the release 
of individuals arrested in connection with the demonstrations were refused.<b>1086</b>  
</p>
<p>1715. It is clear from statistics obtained by Adalah from the Israeli police that, of all the 
protesters arrested; it was the Palestinian Israelis who were disproportionately held in detention 
pending trial. For example, of the 60 people arrested in the Northern District of Israel (mainly 
populated by Palestinian Israelis), all were detained pending trial; in Tel Aviv, of the 27 people 
arrested, none were detained pending trial. According to the Meezan Center for Human Rights in 
Nazareth, there are still people being detained pending trial following their arrest at the protests 
against the military operations in Gaza.<b>1087</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Bail conditions 
</b></p>
<p>1716. Where people were released, the courts sometimes set bail conditions that affected not 
only the individual&#8217;s ability to attend protests, but also, in the case of students, their right to 
education.  
</p>
<p>1717. Ran Tzoref, arrested at a protest in Beersheba on 14 January 2009, was reportedly 
released on the condition that he did not leave his village in northern Israel for two to three 
months. Not only could he not attend subsequent protests, he could not attend classes at his 
university either.<b>1088</b> 
</p>
<p>1718. One of the protesters arrested in the demonstration near the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv 
on 29 December 2008 was a student from Tel Aviv University. As part of her bail conditions, the 
Mission was told that she was not allowed to enter Tel Aviv for one month, resulting in her being 
unable to attend classes.<b>1089</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C. The interrogation of political activists by the General Security Services</b> 
</p>
<p>1719. During the Israeli military operations in Gaza, members of Arab political parties and 
activists in various non-governmental organizations were invited in for interrogation by the 
General Security Services, commonly known as the Shabak. 
</p>
<p>

<b>1089</b> Telephone interview with Sahar Abdo, 26 July 2009. </p>

 <p> 
1720. According to Adalah, the Shabak incorrectly informed those invited that they were 
required by law to come. Ameer Makhoul, the Director of Ittijah and Chairperson of the Popular 
Committee for the Protection of Political Freedoms, declined the invitation to the interrogation 
because he was not legally required to do so. He stated that, shortly afterwards, police officers 
arrived at his office and took him to the interview.<b>1090</b>  
</p>
<p>1721. Mr. Makhoul was taken to the Shabak headquarters in Tel Aviv, where he was kept for 
four hours, during which time, he was questioned about the people he knew and their 
whereabouts. , On refusing to answer, he was told that, if he continued his political activities, he 
would be sent to prison and that, if he wished to go to Gaza, arrangements could be made to send 
him there. During his interview, it became apparent that the Shabak was aware of his address, 
and the car he drove, and referred to a speech that he had made in Haifa on 29 December 2008.  
</p>
<p>1722. The Mission received reports of 20 prominent activists and political figures within the 
Palestinian community being called in for interrogation by the Shabak and being questioned 
about their political activities.<b>1091</b> It has also received reports of younger political activists having 
been taken for interview and asked to collaborate with the Israeli authorities. In the case of 
student activists, the offer of collaboration was accompanied by the threat of arrest or of future 
difficulties in continuing their studies.<b>1092</b> 
</p>
<p>1723. According to those interviewed, the summoning and indeed taking of activists for 
interrogation by the Shabak created a climate of intimidation against dissent in Israel. Many 
activists appear to have been &#8220;invited&#8221; for interview following their attendance at protests 
against the military operations in Gaza and their presence at protests was noted by those 
interviewing them.<b>1093</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Freedom of association and treatment of human rights  
organizations inside Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. New Profile 
</b></p>
<p>1724. Israeli authorities initiated an investigation into activists working with New Profile, a non-
governmental feminist organization, accusing them of inciting Israelis to avoid military service. 
While &#8220;incitement to draft dodging&#8221; is an offence under Israeli law, it was the first time that any 
group had been investigated for that offence.<b>1094</b> 
</p>
<p>1725. On 26 April 2009, Israeli authorities raided the homes of six activists and seized their 
computers, detaining the activists and summoning 10 others for interrogation.<b>1095</b> Some activists 
</p>

 <p> 
were detained and interrogated about their ideological and political views; some were released 
on the condition that they have no contact with other members of their organization.<b>1096</b>  
</p>
<p>1726. As part of their investigation into New Profile, a search warrant was issued for the offices 
of HaMoked, a non-governmental human rights legal organization, for which a member of New 
Profile had previously worked. According to a published letter from New Profile&#8217;s attorney to 
the Deputy Attorney General of Israel, the breadth of the warrant meant that the investigators 
were able to search through legally privileged material.<b>1097</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Breaking the Silence 
</b></p>
<p>1727. On 15 July 2009, Breaking the Silence, an Israeli non-governmental organization of 
veteran Israeli soldiers that collects the testimonies of soldiers who serve in the occupied 
territories, published a booklet entitled &#8220;Soldiers&#8217; Testimonies from Operation Cast Lead, Gaza, 
2009&#8221;. The booklet contained testimonies of 54 soldiers who had served in Gaza during the 
military operations. On its website, Breaking the Silence, stated that the testimonies revealed 
&#8220;gaps between the reports given by the army following January&#8217;s events; the needless destruction 
of houses; firing phosphorous in populated areas and an atmosphere that encouraged shooting 
anywhere.&#8221;<b>1098</b> 
</p>
<p>1728. Breaking the Silence&#8217;s publication was widely reported in the media.<b>1099</b> The Government 
of Israel, through the IDF Spokesman Unit, stated that the report comprised &#8220;anonymous and 
general testimonies, without investigating their details or credibility&#8221;, and that &#8220;a considerable 
number of the testimonies in this report are also based on hearsay and word of mouth&#8221;.<b>1100</b> The 
Unit stated that the Israeli military authorities were committed to investigating thoroughly any 
claims made, where there was sufficient information to do so, and that &#8220;from testimonies which 
have been published, including those in this report, and from the investigations conducted by the 
IDF into the operation, it is clear that IDF soldiers operated in accord with international law and 
the orders they received, despite the complex and difficult fighting.&#8221;<b>1101</b> 
</p>
<p>1729. On 17 July 2009, the <i>Jerusalem Post</i> reported that Breaking the Silence&#8217;s published donor 
list included several European Governments.<b>1102</b> Later that week, <i>Haaretz</i> reported that the 
Israeli Ambassador to the Netherlands had met with the Director-General of the Foreign Ministry 
of the Netherlands to complain about that country&#8217;s funding of Breaking the Silence, urging that 
the funding be terminated.<b>1103</b> On 29 July 2009, <i>Haaretz</i> reported that, in a meeting with the

 <p> 
Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Israel, the Deputy Director-General of the Foreign 
Ministry of Israel asked &#8220;the reasons behind Britain's funding of the group and whether the 
money was used to fund the recent report on Operation Cast Lead.&#8221;<b>1104</b> 
</p>
<p>1730. On 31 July 2009, the Jerusalem Post published an article in which it reported that senior 
Israeli officials were looking into whether it would be possible to ban donations from foreign 
governments to political NGOs.<b>1105</b> On 2 August 2009, <i>Haaretz</i> reported that Israel had asked the 
Government of Spain to terminate its funding of Breaking the Silence.<b>1106</b> 
</p>
<p>1731. Breaking the Silence issued a statement in which it accused the Foreign Ministry of a 
&#8220;witch-hunt&#8221;, saying that it testified to the erosion of the &#8220;democratic culture&#8221; in Israel.<b>1107</b> 
</p>
<p>1732. The Mission is concerned that the actions of the Government of Israel with regard to these 
organizations may have the effect of intimidating other Israeli organizations working on 
documenting and reporting human rights violations.  The Mission underlines the importance that 
these organizations, who carry out essential work in a difficult environment, be able to operate 
freely.  
</p>
<p><b>E. The access of the media and human rights monitors to Gaza prior to,  
during and after the military operations 
</b></p>
<p>1733. The decision by Israel to deny access to the media and international human rights 
monitors to Gaza during -and indeed prior- to the start of its military operations in Gaza on 27 
December 2008, created a storm of protest from the international media and human rights 
NGOs.<b>1108</b>  Some human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and B&#8217;Tselem, are 
still denied access to Gaza to this day.<b>1109</b>  
</p>
<p>1734. The Mission notes that, during the military operations in Gaza, there were a number of 
Palestinian human rights organizations conducting independent monitoring of international 
human rights and international humanitarian law. As noted elsewhere in the present report, the 
Mission found the work of these organizations to be of very a high professional standard and one 
that deserved recognition given the extremely difficult circumstances under which they usually 
operated, particularly during the Israeli military operations. The Mission is of the view that the 
presence of international human rights monitors would have been of great assistance in not only 
investigating and reporting but also in the publicizing of events on the ground.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Media 
</b></p>
<p>1735. Israeli military authorities stopped allowing foreign journalists into the Gaza Strip, 
without prior notification to media organizations, on 5 November 2008 when hostilities 
escalated.<b>1110</b> . Israeli citizens, including journalists, have been barred from entering the Gaza 
strip since the abduction in 2006 of Gilad Shalit, on security grounds. One journalist, Amira 
Hass, has been arrested on two occasions, in December 2008 and in May 2009, for being in Gaza 
illegally.<b>1111</b> 
</p>
<p>1736. After the closure, on 5 November 2008, of the Gaza Strip to journalists (among other 
groups, including human rights monitors), there was international and domestic protest; the ban 
was lifted briefly on 4 December 2008, but reinstated the following day. At the start of the 
military operations in Gaza, Israeli defence officials indicated that there would be a complete ban 
on access of the media to Gaza for the duration of the operations. On 27 December 2008, the day 
military operations started, the Israeli authorities imposed a closed military zone inside Gaza and 
through a 2-kilometre strip around its perimeter.  
</p>
<p>1737. On 19 November 2008, the heads of many international news organizations, including the 
BBC, CNN and Reuters, protested against the ban on media access to Gaza in a letter to the then 
President Ehud Olmert.<b>1112</b> On 24 November 2008, the Foreign Press Association petitioned the 
Supreme Court to rule on the legality of such a ban.<b>1113</b>  
</p>
<p>1738. In an open letter, dated 29 December 2008, the Foreign Press Association stated that the 
denial of media access to Gaza was  
</p>
<p>an unprecedented restriction of press freedom. As a result, the world&#8217;s media is unable to 
accurately report on events inside Gaza at this critical time&#8230; Despite our protests, the 
Israeli authorities have refused to let journalists in&#8230; Never before have journalists been 
prevented from doing their work in this way. We believe it is vital that journalists be 
allowed to find out for themselves what is going on in Gaza. Israel controls access to 
Gaza. Israel must allow professional journalists access to this important story.<b>1114</b> 
</p>
<p>1739. On 31 December 2008, the Supreme Court ruled on the Association&#8217;s petition, ordering 
that the Government of Israel to grant 12 journalists entry into Gaza each time the Erez crossing 
opened.<b>1115</b> On 2 January 2009, the Court amended its order to state that eight journalists, rather 
than 12, should be admitted whenever the Erez crossing opened.<b>1116</b>

 <p> 
1740. On 8 January 2009, the Israeli authorities briefly gave the BBC and two Israeli channels 
access to accompany Israeli forces into Gaza. On 22 January 2009, access was granted to eight 
journalists to accompany Israeli forces into Gaza. The media and non-governmental 
organizations continued to complain about the lack of independent, unfettered access to Gaza.<b>1117</b> 
On the same day, the United Nations Chief of Communications and Public Information called on 
the Government of Israel to ensure immediate access to the international media to Gaza, 
stressing the need for &#8220;full and independent&#8221; coverage of events.<b>1118</b> 
</p>
<p>1741. On 23 January 2009, five days after its unilateral ceasefire, Israel removed all restrictions 
put in place in early November 2008 and the media was given free access to Gaza. 
</p>
<p>1742. On 25 January 2009, the Supreme Court of Israel issued its final ruling, overturning the 
blanket ban and stating that reporters should have access to Gaza &#8220;unless the security situation 
changes drastically in such a way that the Erez crossing has to be closed completely for security 
reasons, and we assume that this will happen only in dire circumstances of concrete danger&#8221;.<b>1119</b> 
</p>
<p>1743. There have been various explanations from the Government of Israel. A spokesman from 
the Embassy of Israel in London, speaking to <i>Press Gazette</i>, stated &#8220;Gaza is a war zone and so it 
is very difficult to allow people who are not soldiers in. Their presence might endanger both 
themselves and our operations there&#8221;.<b>1120</b> 
</p>
<p>1744. The Director of Press Office of the Government of Israel, Daniel Seaman, stated &#8220;Any 
journalist who enters Gaza becomes a fig leaf and front for the Hamas terror organization, and I 
see no reason why we should help that&#8221;.<b>1121</b> He was later quoted in the Associated Press as 
saying for foreign journalists were &#8220;unprofessional&#8221; and took &#8220;questionable reports at face value 
without checking&#8221;.<b>1122</b> 
</p>
<p>1745. On 7 January 2009, the Ambassador for Israel to the United Kingdom, Ron Proser, 
claimed that infighting at the Foreign Press Association about which journalists should be 
admitted was responsible for the press not entering Gaza;<b>1123</b> this was categorically denied by the 
Association.<b>1124</b> On 22 January 2009, <i>Haaretz </i>reported a split in the Government of Israel over 
press access to Gaza, stating the Ministry of Defense and the army had withdrawn their

 <p> 
opposition to media entry into Gaza, but that the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office had ordered that the 
media ban be maintained.<b>1125</b> 
</p>
<p>1746. The media ban, coupled with the comments made by the Director of the Government&#8217;s 
Press Office have raised concerns, aired in the media, that the ban was aimed at controlling the 
narrative of the conflict for political reasons.<b>1126</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. International human rights monitors 
</b></p>
<p>1747. The denial of access to Gaza had an impact not only on the media, but also international 
human rights monitors, who required access to report violations and, like journalists, make 
events in Gaza known to the public. The Mission also notes that the presence of international 
human rights monitors is likely to have a deterrent effect, dissuading parties to a conflict from 
engaging in violations of international law. 
</p>
<p>1748. On 31 December 2008, Amnesty International issued a statement calling for Israel to 
allow &#8220;humanitarian workers and observers&#8221; immediate access to Gaza.<b>1127</b> 
</p>
<p>1749. Human Rights Watch requested permission from the Israel military authorities to enter 
Gaza on 5 January 2009. The request was rejected on 9 February 2009 on the grounds that 
Human Rights Watch was not registered with the Ministry of Social Affairs.<b>1128</b> Human Rights 
Watch asked for clarification, given that it had never heard of such a requirement, even though it 
had received permission to enter Gaza on previous occasions, and was unsure of the basis in 
Israeli law or regulation for such a requirement. To date, Human Rights Watch has yet to receive 
a response from the Israeli authorities.<b>1129</b> At 2 August 2009, it had still not been granted 
permission by the Israeli authorities to enter Gaza to conduct investigations.<b>1130</b> 
</p>
<p>1750. On 20 January 2009, B&#8217;Tselem requested permission from the Israel military authorities 
for its fieldwork director to enter Gaza; the application was rejected on 29 January 2009.<b>1131</b> In a 
news update dated 19 January 2009, Amnesty International stated that it had made numerous 
applications to the Israeli authorities to enter Gaza, but had received no response.<b>1132</b>

 <p> 
</p><p>1751. To date, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and B&#8217;Tselem have been denied 
access to Gaza to collect data for their independent investigations into allegation of war crimes 
committed by both the Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b>F. Legal analysis and conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>1752. International human rights law, applicable during armed conflict, upholds the right to 
freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>1753. Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides 
that  
</p>
<p>1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.  
</p>
<p>2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include 
freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice. 
</p>
<p>1754. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special 
duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only 
be such as are provided by law and are necessary:  
</p>
<p>1. For respect of the rights or reputations of others. 
</p>
<p>2. For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of 
public health or morals.  
</p>
<p>1755. Articles 21 and 22 of ICCPR recognize the right to peaceful assembly and the right to 
freedom of association, respectively. 
</p>
<p>1756. Furthermore, article 10 provides that &#8220;All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated 
with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society 
to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>1757. This Declaration is also known by its abbreviated name &#8220;The Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1758. Article 5 of the Declaration recognizes the right (a) to meet or assemble peacefully; (b) to 
form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups; (c) to 
communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>1759. Article 6 states that  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others:  
</p>
<p> (a) To know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, including having access to information as to how 
those rights and freedoms are given effect in domestic legislative, judicial or 
administrative systems; 
</p>
<p> (b) As provided for in human rights and other applicable international 
instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and 
knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (c) To study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law 
and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these 
and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters. 
</p>
<p>1760. Article 12 states  
</p>
<p>1. Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to 
participate in peaceful activities against violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>2. The State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the 
competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, 
pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate 
exercise of the rights referred to in the present Declaration. 
</p>
<p>3. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in association with 
others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or opposing, 
through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, attributable 
to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well 
as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>1761. Article 13 of the Declaration recognizes that &#8220;Everyone has the right, individually and in 
association with others, to solicit, receive and utilize resources for the express purpose of 
promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms through peaceful means, in 
accordance with article 3 of the present Declaration.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>1. Protests 
</b></p>
<p>1762. The information received by the Mission indicates that there was no systematic policy to 
prevent street demonstrations against the military action being pursued in Gaza. The Mission 
notes, however, that there were occasions when protesters, reportedly, had difficulty in obtaining 
permits, particularly in areas populated mainly by Palestinian Israelis, and where the police 
placed obstacles in the way of protesters seeking to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and 
freedom of speech.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1763. Owing to the failure to cooperate by the Government of Israel, the Mission does not have 
sufficient information to determine whether there were sound public order or security reasons for 
the decisions made by the police. It however takes note of the reports received and urges the 
Government of Israel to ensure that the police authorities, throughout Israel, respect the rights of 
all its citizens, without discrimination, including the freedom of expression and the right to 
peaceful assembly, as guaranteed to them by the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>1764. The Mission views with particular concern the reported instances of physical violence 
against protesters and other forms of humiliation suffered by protesters at the hands of the police. 
It reminds the Government of Israel that those deprived of their liberty shall, as provided by 
article 10 of ICCPR, be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human 
person. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Judicial responses 
</b></p>
<p>1765. The Mission does not have sufficient information about individual cases brought to its 
attention to come to a definitive finding. Nevertheless, the element of discrimination between the 
and differential treatment of Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel by the judicial authorities, 
as reflected in the reports received, is a substantial cause for concern.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Interrogations by the General Security Services 
</b></p>
<p>1766. The Mission is concerned about activists being compelled to attend interviews with the 
General Security Services, in the absence of any legal obligation to do so. More broadly, the 
Mission expresses its concern at the alleged interrogation of political activists about their 
political activities. Of the interviews conducted by the Mission, the issue of interrogation by the 
Shabak was cited most prominently as creating intolerance of dissent in Israel. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Freedom of association and treatment of human rights organizations 
</b></p>
<p>1767. The Mission is greatly concerned about allegations of hostile retaliatory actions taken 
against civil society organizations for criticism of the Israeli authorities and for exposing alleged 
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the military operations. 
</p>
<p>1768. In the case of alleged attempts to interfere with the funding of Breaking the Silence, the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders guarantees the right &#8220;to solicit, receive and utilize 
resources for the express purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms through peaceful means&#8221;. While lobbying foreign Governments to terminate funding 
does not directly violate this right, such an action, if motivated by a reaction to the organization&#8217;s 
exercise of its freedom of expression, would be contrary to the spirit of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Access to information: access of media and human rights monitors to Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1769. With regard to the denial of media access to Gaza during the military operations there and 
the continued denial of access to Gaza to various international human rights monitors to the 
present day, the Mission notes that the presence of journalists and international human rights 
monitors aides the investigation and broad public reporting on the conduct of the parties to the 
conflict and that their presence can dissuade misconduct.  </p>

 <p> 
1770. According to the  1995 Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of 
Expression and Access to Information<b>1133</b>, Governments 
</p>
<p>may not prevent journalists or representatives of intergovernmental or non-
governmental organizations which monitor adherence to human rights or 
humanitarian standards from entering areas where there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that violations of human rights or humanitarian law are being, or have been, 
committed. Governments may not exclude journalists or representatives of such 
organizations from areas that are experiencing violence or armed conflict, except 
where their presence would pose a clear risk to the safety of others. 
</p>
<p>1771. The Mission is concerned about the near total exclusion of the media and human rights 
monitors from Gaza since 5 November 2008. While the media have been permitted access since 
23 January 2009, the Mission is very concerned that groups such as Human Rights Watch, 
Amnesty International and B&#8217;Tselem continue to be denied access to the Gaza Strip by the Israeli 
military authorities and therefore are obstructed in their investigations into alleged violations of 
law during the military operations. The Mission can see no viable reason for this denial of 
access. 
</p>
<p>1772. The Mission observes that Israel, in its actions against political activists, NGOs and the 
media, has attempted to minimise public scrutiny of its conduct both during its military 
operations in Gaza and the consequences that these operations have had for the residents of 
Gaza. The perception that the Israeli authorities, by denying access to the media and human 
rights monitors, sought to prevent investigation and reporting of the conduct of the operations by 
the Israeli military seems warranted. The burden of dispelling such a perception rests on the 
Government of Israel. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1133</b> The Principles (E/CN.4/1996/31)were endorsed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
opinion and expression, in his reports to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-second, fifty-fourth, fifty-fifth 
and fifty-seventh sessions, and referred to by the Commission in its annual resolutions on freedom of expression 
every year from 1996. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>PART FOUR: ACCOUNTABILITY AND JUDICIAL REMEDIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>XXVI. PROCEEDINGS AND RESPONSES BY ISRAEL TO ALLEGATIONS OF 
VIOLATIONS BY ITS ARMED FORCES AGAINST PALESTINIANS 
</b></p>
<p>1773. Investigations and, if appropriate, prosecutions of those suspected of serious violations are 
necessary if respect for human rights and humanitarian law is to be ensured and to prevent the 
development of a climate of impunity. States have a duty under international law to investigate 
allegations of violations. 
</p>
<p>1774. As seen in the preceding chapters, the Mission has investigated a large number of 
allegations of violations and has found that many of them have substance. The Mission was thus 
obliged to consider the extent to which Israel has complied with its obligations under 
international law to investigate those alleged violations. The Mission requested information from 
the Government of Israel on any inquiry it had conducted into the incidents the Mission had 
investigated, and the conclusions of such inquiries, if any, but did not receive any reply. 
</p>
<p>1775. Allegations concerning alleged serious violations of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law emerged almost as soon as the military operations began. Israel claims to have 
carried out limited investigations into these allegations, some of which are ongoing.  
</p>
<p>1776. In the aftermath of the military operations, a group of eight Israeli NGOs wrote to the 
Attorney General, Mr. Meni Mazuz, requesting the establishment of an independent and 
effective mechanism to investigate allegations of grave violations of the laws of war during the 
Gaza offensive. They requested that the investigation should also address &#8220;the legality of the 
actual orders and directives given to forces in the field&#8221; and held that the Military Advocate 
General&#8217;s office was not in a position to carry out a proper investigation because of his personal 
involvement and that of his office&#8217;s personnel &#8220;during stages of decision-making&#8221; in the conflict, 
which would compromise the neutrality and independence of the investigation.<b>1134</b>  
</p>
<p>1777. In replying to the letter, the office of the Attorney General explained that after the 
conclusion of the military operations &#8220;the IDF began to carry out its operational briefings&#8221;, 
which would also examine various events in which civilians were harmed. It did not accept the 
assertion that the Military Advocate General&#8217;s dual position, as legal adviser to the military 
authorities and as a person tasked with ensuring that military personnel charged with breaking 
the law are tried, disqualified him from participating in the investigation.<b>1135</b>  
</p>
<p>1778. The NGOs sent another letter,<b>1136</b> but this time the Attorney General did not reply. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1779. On 5 February 2009, a group of Israeli scholars and jurists wrote to the Attorney General 
also requesting the establishment of an independent body to investigate the actions that had taken 
place during the military operations. The Mission is not aware that they received any reply.  
</p>
<p>1780. The Mission also saw press statements regarding the opening of investigations into 
allegations reportedly made by soldiers at the &#8220;Rabin&#8221; Preparation Program. On 19 March 2009, 
the Military Advocate General, Brig. Gen. Avichai Mendelblit, instructed the Criminal 
Investigation Division of the military police to investigate alleged actions by soldiers during the 
military operations. The decision came in response to a letter sent to him a few weeks earlier by 
the head of the Rabin program reporting claims made by soldiers about firing at civilians.<b>1137</b> 
Eleven days later the investigation was closed on the basis that the crucial components of the 
allegations &#8220;were based on hearsay and not supported by facts&#8221;. According to the Israeli armed 
forces, the investigation found that the soldiers in question had not actually witnessed the alleged 
events.<b>1138</b> In a report released by the Government of Israel in July 2009, two of the incidents 
investigated were briefly discussed. Not having had access to the outcome of these 
investigations, the Mission is unable to evaluate the report.<b>1139</b> 
</p>
<p>1781. On 22 April the Israeli armed forces released publicly the results of five investigations 
carried out by teams headed by officers of the rank of colonel. The same information was later 
on reproduced in the report issued by the Government of Israel.<b>1140</b> The Israeli armed forces 
stated that the members of the team had had no direct involvement in the chain of command 
during the military operations in Gaza and had acted with independence, enjoying full access to 
information, persons and evidence. The process was described as involving &#8220;a series of 
operational investigations&#8221;.<b>1141</b> 
</p>
<p>1782. According to the same source, the five investigations addressed: 
</p>
<p>(a) Claims regarding incidents where United Nations and international facilities were 
fired upon and damaged;  
</p>
<p>(b) Incidents involving shooting at medical facilities, buildings, vehicles and crews;  
</p>
<p>(c) Claims regarding incidents in which many uninvolved civilians were harmed;  
</p>
<p>(d) The use of weaponry containing phosphorous;  
</p>
<p>(e) Damage to infrastructure and destruction of buildings by ground forces.

<b>1141</b> &#8220;Conclusion of investigations&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1783. The observations and conclusions of these investigations have been addressed elsewhere 
in this report. The conclusion, as stated in the Israeli armed forces&#8217; press release, was that 
&#8220;throughout the fighting in Gaza, the IDF operated in accordance with international law&#8221;. 
However, the &#8220;investigations revealed a very small number of incidents in which intelligence or 
operational errors took place during the fighting&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1784. The Israeli armed forces stated that the investigation was lengthy and that some specific 
issues were still being checked and additional allegations were being investigated. The &#8220;experts&#8217; 
investigations&#8221;, it was emphasized, were not a replacement for the central Israeli armed forces&#8217; 
operational investigation into the entire operation, which was under way and to be concluded in 
June 2009.  
</p>
<p>1785. In its response to a report by Amnesty International,<b>1142</b> the Israeli armed forces recalled 
the &#8220;number of investigations&#8221; it has conducted following the military operations. In addition to 
those ordered by the Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, the Israeli armed 
forces stated it was looking at complaints from various sources, and that &#8220;in certain cases, the 
Chief Military Advocate has already ordered the opening of a criminal investigation&#8221;.<b>1143</b> 
</p>
<p>1786. On 30 July 2009 there were media reports that the Military Advocate General had ordered 
the military police to launch criminal investigations into 14 cases out of nearly 100 complaints 
against soldiers about criminal conduct during the military operations. An official 
comprehensive report publicly released on the same day spoke of 13 cases, but no details of the 
cases were offered.<b>1144</b> 
</p>
<p>1787. The Mission is not aware of any other investigation or of any other action taken either by 
the Military Advocate General or the Attorney General in connection with the military 
operations. 
</p>
<p>1788. Regarding violence against Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip but in relation to the 
military operations of December 2008 &#8211; January 2009, the Mission has been unable to gather 
information about any investigations that may be taking place.  
</p>
<p><b>A. Israel&#8217;s system of investigation and prosecution

<p>1789. The Mission considers that in assessing Israel&#8217;s fulfilment of its duty to investigate regard 
should be had to its internal legal and judicial systems. In cases of suspected wrongdoing the 
Israeli armed forces may, by law, carry out investigations through: (a) disciplinary proceedings; 
(b) operational debriefings (also known as &quot;operational investigations&quot;); (c) special

investigations, by a senior officer at the request of the chief of staff; and (d) military police 
investigations, by the Criminal Investigation Division of the military police.<b>1145</b>   
</p>
<p><b>1. Disciplinary proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>1790. Disciplinary proceedings are usually instituted for minor infractions of military discipline 
and rules, and do not apply to investigations into serious violations of human rights or 
humanitarian law. They are not relevant to the alleged violations with which the Mission is 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>1791. Several actors play a role in this system of investigation and prosecution: the army, the 
military police, the Military Advocate General and the courts martial.  
</p>
<p>1792. The Israeli armed forces officially describe the mission of the Military Advocate 
General&#8217;s corps as follows: 
</p>
<p>The Military Advocate General&#8217;s Corps&#8217; supervises and enforces the rule of law 
throughout the IDF and provides legal advice to the Chief of Staff and all divisions of the 
IDF in areas relating to military, domestic and international law. Its mission is to instil the 
general principles of law and the values of justice in the IDF.<b>1146</b> 
</p>
<p>1793. The Mission notes that the Military Advocate General is a military officer, who provides 
legal advice to the military and at the same time investigates and prosecutes these same military. 
It also notes that the Government of Israel insists that, despite being part of the military corps, 
the Military Advocate General acts with full functional independence. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Operational debriefings 
</b></p>
<p>1794. Article 539 (A) (a) of the Law on Military Justice defines an operational debriefing as: &#8220;a 
procedure held by the army, according to the army orders and regulations, with respect to an 
incident that has taken place during a training or a military operation or with connection to 
them&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1795. The debriefings are reviews of incidents and operations conducted by soldiers from the 
same unit or line of command together with a superior officer. They are meant to serve 
operational purposes. Following every military operation &#8220;of any kind, a field investigation is 
conducted in order to examine the performance of the forces and to learn what aspects should be 
preserved and what aspects should be improved&#8221;.<b>1147</b> They are supposed to be confidential so 
that soldiers speak openly. The findings are forwarded to the Military Advocate General&#8217;s office, 
which may or may not find that there are grounds to suspect that a crime has been committed and 
order a full criminal investigation. However, if a criminal investigation is opened and the case

 <p> 
goes to trial the debriefing cannot be used as evidence in subsequent proceedings (article 539 (A) 
of the Military Justice Act). 
</p>
<p>1796. The use of military debriefings as a regular tool to address incidents emerging from 
military operations became the rule after an official change of policy was introduced in 2000.<b>1148</b> 
The new policy was consistent with a shift to armed conflict paradigm in addressing the intifada. 
This change of policy meant that criminal investigations were not necessarily the first step even 
in the face of credible allegations of serious offences committed by military personnel. 
</p>
<p>1797. The office of the Military Advocate General can consult the operational debriefing and if 
it considers that a criminal investigation is warranted on the basis of the testimony of soldiers 
during the debriefing, it can issue orders to that effect. A criminal investigation must start de 
novo. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Special investigations 
</b></p>
<p>1798. The Minister of Defense and the Chief of the General Staff may also appoint an officer or 
group of officers &#8211; often high-ranking officers &#8211; to investigate high-profile or sensitive matters. 
The material gathered in special investigations also remains confidential and may not be used as 
evidence in court proceedings. However, the special investigator makes findings and formulates 
recommendations. Criminal investigations can be initiated only after the special investigator&#8217;s 
work is complete.  
</p>
<p><b>4. Criminal investigations 
</b></p>
<p>1799. The Military Advocate General may order the Criminal Investigation Division to open a 
criminal investigation if he finds that there is &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that an offence may have 
been committed by military personnel.  
</p>
<p>1800. A summary of the operational debriefings is normally sent to the Military Advocate 
General&#8217;s office, but he may ask to view the full notes. To order the opening of a criminal 
investigation, the Military Advocate General normally consults with a major general (article 
539 (A)(b)(4)(b) of the Law on Military Justice). The materials of the operational debriefing will 
not serve in such a criminal investigation and will remain confidential from the investigative 
authorities (art. 539 (A)(b)(4)). 
</p>
<p>1801. A decision by the Military Advocate General to open or not to open a criminal 
investigation and his decision to indict or not to indict the suspects may be reviewed by the 
Attorney General. A complainant or an NGO can trigger this process by simply sending a letter

directly to the Attorney General. The Supreme Court may be petitioned to review the Military 
Advocate General&#8217;s or the Attorney General&#8217;s decisions.<b>1149</b> 
</p>
<p>1802. The investigation by the Criminal Investigation Division should produce a file, which is 
sent to the Military Advocate General&#8217;s office for completion. The Military Advocate General 
may decide to close the file for lack of evidence, return it for further investigation or issue an 
indictment. If an indictment is issued, the case proceeds to a court martial before the district and 
the special military courts, which are formed by three to five judges, the majority of whom have 
to be officers. Decisions are taken by majority vote and need not be reasoned &quot;unless the 
Military Justice Law prescribes otherwise&quot; (arts. 392&#8211;393).  
</p>
<p>1803. A decision by a district or special court martial can be appealed to the Military Court of 
Appeals, whose final decision may need to be confirmed by the Chief of General Staff after 
consultation with the Military Advocate General. Israel reported that in the past the Chief of 
General Staff had confirmed all sentences presented to him.<b>1150</b> Victims or their legal 
representatives may appeal decisions not to indict to the Military Advocate General and, if 
unsuccessful, to the High Court of Justice.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Legal assessment 
</b></p>
<p>1804. Both international humanitarian law and international human rights law establish a clear 
obligation for States to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute allegations of serious violations 
by military personnel whether during military operations or not. This rule finds expression in 
articles 49 of the First Geneva Convention, article 50 of the Second Geneva Convention, article 
129 of the Third Geneva Convention and article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention; in 
articles 2 and 6 of ICCPR and article 6 of the Convention against Torture. The Mission considers 
the obligations on States to investigate and, if appropriate, to prosecute war crimes and other 
crimes allegedly committed by their armed forces or in their territory as a norm of international 
customary law.<b>1151</b> 
</p>
<p>1805. International humanitarian law contains an obligation to investigate grave breaches of the 
Geneva Conventions. This obligation flows generally from their common article 1, but more 
specifically from their foregoing provisions. Article 146 (2) of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
provides that each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation &#8220;to search for persons 
alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall 
bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts&#8230;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1806. There is a parallel obligation to investigate under international human rights law. Article 2 
of ICCPR requires a State party to respect and ensure to all individuals within its territory and 
subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in it and also to ensure an effective remedy for 
any person whose rights have been violated. Failure to ensure the rights as required by article 2 
would give rise to an independent violation,

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8230; as a result of States parties' permitting or failing to take appropriate measures or to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by such 
acts by private persons or entities. 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;]<b> 
</b></p>
<p>A failure by a State Party to investigate allegations of violations could in and of 
itself give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant...<b>1152</b> 
</p>
<p>1807. In several decisions on individual communications concerning offences against the right 
to life and physical integrity, the Human Rights Committee has held that the failure to 
investigate and punish the perpetrators constitutes a violation of the Covenant. For instance, in 
Bautist<i>a de Arellana </i>v.<i> Colombia</i>, the Committee held:  
</p>
<p>&#8230; that the State party is under a duty to investigate thoroughly alleged violations of 
human rights, and in particular forced disappearances of persons and violations of the 
right to life, and to prosecute criminally, try and punish those held responsible for such 
violations. This duty applies a fortiori in cases in which the perpetrators of such violations 
have been identified.<b>1153</b> 
</p>
<p>1808. This obligation to investigate under human rights law applies equally to actions that take 
place during armed conflict. In <i>Isayeva </i>v.<i> Russia</i>, a case concerning a woman whose relatives 
were killed by indiscriminate shelling in Chechnya by Russian forces, the European Court of 
Human Rights held that the requirements of article 2 of the European Convention applied. This 
provision, read with article 1 (&#8220;to secure to everyone&#8230; the rights and freedoms defined in [the] 
Convention&#8221;) would require &#8220;by implication that there should be some form of effective judicial 
investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force&#8221;.<b>1154</b> 
</p>
<p>1809. The Court laid down a series of principles which such an investigation should observe: 
inter alia, that authorities must act on their own motion, act with independence, be effective and 
prompt. 
</p>
<p>1810. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has established similar jurisprudence.<b>1155</b> 
</p>
<p>1811. The Mission holds the view that the duty to investigate allegations of serious violations of 
the right to life and physical integrity under ICCPR extends equally to allegations about acts 
committed in the context of armed conflict. 
</p>

 <p> 
1812. The State&#8217;s duty to investigate is also firmly established in the jurisprudence of the 
Supreme Court of Israel. Thus, in the <i>Targeted killings</i> case, which addresses the use of armed 
force in a context regarded as armed conflict, it held: 
</p>
<p>&#8230; after an attack on a civilian suspected of taking an active part, at such time, in 
hostilities, a thorough investigation regarding the precision of the identification of the 
target and the circumstances of the attack upon him is to be performed (retroactively). 
That investigation must be independent<b>1156</b> 
</p>
<p>1813. The Mission notes that Israel does not question its duty to investigate allegations of 
serious offences by its armed forces. On the contrary, it has repeatedly stated that the 
investigation system that it has put in place is effective.<b>1157</b> 
</p>
<p>1814. It remains to be considered whether, in carrying out its duty to investigate allegations of 
serious violations, Israel has observed the universal principles of independence, effectiveness, 
promptness and impartially. These principles have been developed in the jurisprudence of 
international courts of human rights and are agreed upon by the States represented within the 
relevant United Nations bodies.<b>1158</b>  
</p>
<p>1815. The Mission finds that the system put in place by Israel, and described above, to deal with 
allegations of serious wrongdoing by armed forces personnel does not comply with all those 
principles.  
</p>
<p>1816. The system is not effective in addressing the violations and uncovering the truth. In this 
respect the Mission recalls the statements of Col. (res.) Ilan Katz, until March 2003 the Deputy 
Military Advocate General, criticizing the use of operational debriefings by commanders in order 
to prevent criminal investigations. In a meeting of the Israel Bar Association&#8217;s Military and 
Security Committee, Col. (res.) Katz was reported to have stated: 
</p>
<p> From the beginning of the uprising and as of August 2004, about 90 [Military Police 
Criminal Investigation Division] investigations were opened into the injuries and deaths 
of Palestinians. About 70 investigations were opened in the last year alone. That shows 
that they saw that the Operational Debriefing did not lead to uncovering the truth and then 
the [Military Advocate General] gave an order to begin [Military Police Criminal 
Investigation Division] investigations. I used to be part of the policy that allowed the 
Army to use the military debriefing, but the Army did not use the Operational Debriefing 
appropriately because of a failure to comply with regulations and orders. That tool did not 
prove itself. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1156</b> <i>Public Committee against Torture in Israel et al.</i> v. <i>Government of Israel et al.</i>, case No. 769/02, 13 December 
2006, para. 40. 
<b>1157</b> &#8220;The operation in Gaza&#8230;&#8221;, paras. 283 ff. 
<b>1158</b> <i>Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extrajudicial, Arbitrary and Summary Executions</i> 
(Economic and Social Council resolution 1989/65, annex), and <i>the Principles on the Effective Investigation and 
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</i> (General Assembly 
resolution 55/89, annex). </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1817. Col. (res.) Katz appears to admit that the system does not comply with the requirement of 
promptness. Even if a decision is made by the Military Advocate General to order the opening of 
criminal investigations, investigation is usually nearly impossible at that point: 
</p>
<p> The reason is that when the commanders conduct an operational debriefing they 
destroy the scene of the crime, and months later it is difficult to find traces of evidence on 
the ground. You cannot even check the gun from which the shots were fired because by 
the time the [Military Police Criminal Investigation Division] investigation begins many 
more shots have been fired by the same gun, or in some cases the gun changes hands and 
it is very hard to trace it. The debriefing law has a certain logic because it raises the level 
of credibility of the operational debriefings, but the way it is exploited by commanders in 
order to prevent [Military Police Criminal Investigation Division] investigations is not 
reasonable.<b>1159</b>  
</p>
<p>1818. The Mission notes that the report in which the above statements appear has not been 
contradicted by the Government of Israel. The statements are also consistent with other 
assessments. Human Rights Watch studied the cases that were investigated between 2000 and 
2004, and concluded that very few had actually gone to full criminal investigations and that even 
fewer had ended in indictments. When convictions did follow, the penalties were noticeably 
more lenient than those imposed on Palestinian offenders. The organization Yesh Din came to 
similar conclusions in its study of cases from 2000 to the end of 2007.<b>1160</b> 
</p>
<p>1819. Operational debriefing, to review operational performance, is not an appropriate tool to 
conduct investigations of allegations of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. 
It appears to the Mission that established methods of criminal investigations such as visits to the 
crime scene, interviews with witnesses and victims, and assessment by reference to established 
legal standards have not been adopted. The operational debriefings as well as the five &#8220;expert &#8220; 
investigations carried out by the Israeli armed forces into events during the December&#8211;January 
military operations in Gaza appear to have relied exclusively on interviews with Israeli officers 
and soldiers. As such, these investigations did not comply with required legal standards. 
</p>
<p>1820. The Israeli armed forces stated that it had conducted more than 100 &#8220;military 
investigations&#8221; into allegations of wrongdoing during the military operations in Gaza. Some 13 
criminal investigations have been opened. On the basis of the facts available to it and on the 
circumstances, the Mission finds that a delay of six months to start these criminal investigations 
constitutes undue delay in the face of the serious allegations that have been made by many 
people and organizations.  
</p>
<p>1821. Amnesty International has said about the public outcomes of Israeli armed forces&#8217; 
investigations into events during the military operations: 
</p>
<p>

Human Rights, <i>Exceptions: Prosecution of IDF Soldiers during and after the Second Intifada, 2000&#8211;2007</i>

investigations during the al-Aqsa intifada&#8221;, available at: 
http://www.btselem.org/English/Accountability/Investigatin_of_Complaints.asp.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The information made public only refers to a handful of cases and lacks crucial 
details. It mostly repeats claims made by the army and the authorities many times since 
the early days of Operation &#8220;Cast Lead&#8221;, but does not provide evidence to back up the 
allegations. It does not even attempt to explain the overwhelming majority of civilian 
deaths nor the massive destruction caused to civilian buildings in Gaza.<b>1161</b> 
</p>
<p>1822. In this regard, the Mission recalls the recommendations made to Israel by the Committee 
against Torture to &#8220;conduct an independent inquiry to ensure a prompt, independent and full 
investigation&#8221; into the responsibility of the State and non-State actors during the war. This 
recommendation was issued after Israel released the results of five &#8220;special investigations&#8221; in 
April 2009.<b>1162</b> 
</p>
<p>1823. On the basis of the information before it and the above considerations the Mission finds 
that the failure of Israel to open prompt, independent and impartial criminal investigations even 
after six months have elapsed constitute a violation of its obligation to genuinely investigate 
allegations of war crimes and other crimes, and other serious violations of international law. 
</p>
<p>1824. The obligation on Israel to prevent, investigate and punish violations of human rights 
applies also to its actions or omissions in the West Bank. Such obligation includes the duty to 
take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate or redress harm 
caused by private persons.<b>1163</b> As stated above, the Mission has not received any information 
indicating the initiation of criminal or other investigations into violence against Palestinians in 
the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, related to the military operations in the Gaza Strip. 
Israel appears to do little to protect Palestinians from settler violence and, if investigations into 
such violence are opened, they are reported to be prolonged and usually result in no action. Yesh 
Din reports that over 90 per cent of investigations into settler violence are closed without an 
indictment being filed.  
</p>
<p>1825. If settlers are convicted, the sentences are reported to be very light.<b>1164</b> This practice 
should be contrasted with the harsh treatment and punishment meted out to Palestinians who 
harm Israelis. This has been described as a discriminatory policy.<b>1165</b> Similarly, action against 
members of security forces who commit acts of violence, including killings, serious injuries and 
other abuses, against Palestinians is very rare. Information available to the Mission points to a 
systematic lack of accountability of members of the security forces for such acts.<b>1166</b> 
</p>
<p>1826. The Government of Israel also reports that, in October 2007, the Office of the Military 
Advocate for Operational Affairs was established to investigate cases of operational misconduct

 <p> 
by Israeli armed forces soldiers against Palestinian civilians. This special military prosecution 
unit allows the automatic opening of criminal investigations in all cases. As a result, the 
Government reports, the numbers of criminal investigations launched in 2007 and 2008 in 
relation to abuse against Palestinians have more than doubled, from 152 in 2006 to 351 in 2007 
and 323 in 2008.<b>1167</b> However, no figures are provided about how many of those investigations 
resulted in indictments and in convictions, and the offence for which the concerned persons were 
finally convicted. 
</p>
<p>1827. The same paper by the Government of Israel states that, in military courts as a whole, 
from January 2002 to December 2008 inclusive, there have been 1,467 criminal investigations, 
leading to 140 indictments. As of December 2008, 103 defendants had been convicted and 10 
cases were still pending. During the first six months of 2009, 123 criminal investigations were 
opened, leading to 10 indictments so far.<b>1168</b> This information is contradicted, in addition to 
being incomplete. 
</p>
<p>1828. Yesh Din points out that the limited number of indictments leads, in practice, to even 
fewer convictions. Most of those convictions are for offences that do not reflect the degree of 
gravity of the action. For instance, from September 2000 to the end of 2007, only 135 soldiers 
were indicted, of whom some 113 had been convicted by mid-2008. Only 22 underwent full 
criminal trials in courts martial and 95 were convicted on the basis of their confessions. But as 
many as 73 confessed to amended indictments and were therefore convicted of less serious 
offences than the original charges. This situation has been attributed partially to the system of 
plea-bargaining officially used in Israel and to the willingness of the Military Prosecutor to agree 
to lesser offences and penalties having due regard, inter alia, to the difficulties encountered in 
gathering sufficient evidence to back up the original charge.<b>1169</b>  
</p>
<p>1829. Another contributing factor is the unprofessional way in which criminal investigations are 
carried out, making it virtually impossible to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. Courts 
martial have criticized those investigations on several occasions. Military criminal investigators 
do not seem interested in interviewing victims or witnesses and the quality of evidence gathered 
is low.<b>1170</b> 
</p>
<p>1830. The change of policy instituted in 2000 determining that full criminal investigations are 
possible only after &#8220;operational debriefings&#8221; have been carried out means that in practice 
criminal investigations do not begin before six months after the events in question. By that time 
evidence may be corrupted or no longer available. 
</p>
<p>1831. The Mission holds the view that a tool designed for the review of performance and to 
learn lessons can hardly be an effective and impartial investigation mechanism that should be 
instituted after every military operation where allegations of serious violations have been made. 
It does not comply with internationally recognized principles of independence, impartiality,

 <p> 
effectiveness and promptness in investigations. The fact that proper criminal investigations can 
start only after the &#8220;operational debriefing&#8221; is over is a major flaw in the Israeli system of 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>1832. The Mission concludes that there are serious doubts about the willingness of Israel to 
carry out genuine investigations in an impartial, independent, prompt and effective way as 
required by international law. The Mission is also of the view that the Israeli system presents 
inherently discriminatory features that have proven to make the pursuit of justice for Palestinian 
victims very difficult.   
</p>
<p>1833. In this context, the Mission notes that on 21 January 2009 the Office of the Prosecutor of 
the International Criminal Court received a declaration in the following terms: 
</p>
<p>&#8216;Pursuant to the provisions of article 12, paragraph 3, of the Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, the Government of Palestine hereby recognizes the jurisdiction of the 
Court for the purposes of identifying, prosecuting and judging the authors and 
accomplices of acts committed in the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002.&#8217; 
</p>
<p>1834. Article 12 of the Rome Statute -  Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction - reads as 
follows: 
</p>
<p>1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the 
Court with respect to the crimes referred to in article 5.  
</p>
<p>2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction 
if one or more of the following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the 
jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with paragraph 3:  
</p>
<p> (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the 
crime was committed on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel 
or aircraft;  
</p>
<p> (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 
</p>
<p>3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under 
paragraph 2, that State may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise 
of jurisdiction by the Court with respect to the crime in question. The accepting State shall 
cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception in accordance with Part 9.  
</p>
<p>1835. The Prosecutor may determine that for the purposes of article 12, paragraph 3, under 
customary international law, Palestine qualifies as &#8220;a State&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>XXVII.  PROCEEDINGS BY PALESTINIAN AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Proceedings related to actions in the Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p>1836. The Gaza authorities are responsible for ensuring that effective measures for 
accountability for violations of IHRL and IHL committed by armed groups acting in or from the </p>

 <p> 
Gaza Strip are established. The Mission points out that such responsibility would continue to rest 
on any authority exercising government-like functions in the Gaza Strip.   
</p>
<p>1837. ICHR reports that actions in the Gaza Strip in respect of accountability are limited to the 
formation of committees to monitor and report on a number of human rights violations.<b>1171</b>  
</p>
<p>1838. However, there is no evidence of any system of public monitoring or accountability for 
serious IHL and IHRL violations. The Mission has heard credible reports of such violations that 
are discussed in other parts of this report. In particular, the Mission is concerned about the 
consistent disregard of IHL with which all armed groups in the Gaza Strip conduct their armed 
activities directed against Israel.  
</p>
<p>1839. The Mission notes that:  
</p>
<p>(a) On 10 July 2008, it was reported by BBC that &#8220;Hamas security forces&#8221; had arrested 
two members of al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades who had launched rocket attacks on Israel the day 
before.<b>1172</b> According to the same report, al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades said members of Hamas&#8217; 
security forces had chased and &#8220;abducted&#8221; two of their members. Reuters, later on 10 July 2008, 
reported that an additional four members of al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades were arrested by Hamas 
as they tried to fire rockets into Israel;<b>1173</b> 
</p>
<p>(b) On 9 March 2009, Islamic Jihad stated that the Internal Security had arrested 10 of 
its members and forced them to sign statements prior to their being released pledging that they 
would cease rocket fire on Israel;<b>1174</b> 
</p>
<p>(c) On 13 March 2009, an official of the Gaza authorities was reported as saying that 
security forces would track and arrest anyone suspected of firing rockets into Israel, stating &#8220;the 
rockets have been fired at the wrong time&#8221;;<b>1175</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1171</b> ICHR, <i>Fourteenth Annual Report</i>, pp. 179 ff. In relation to internal violence, Al-Mezan pointed out that 
&#8220;previous commissions of inquiry that were established to investigate these violations failed to make public their 
findings, which has contributed to the reoccurrence of violations&#8221; (&#8220;Al-Mezan welcomes decision of Prime Minister 
in Gaza to approve Commission of Inquiry recommendation to dismiss and bring to justice perpetrators of law and 
human rights violations&#8221;, 1 April 2009). Similarly, PCHR lamented &#8220;the failure of the Palestinian authorities to take 
any action to prosecute the perpetrators or to make available the results of any investigations. This contributes to the 
proliferation of such crimes&#8221; (&#8220;PCHR demands investigation into death of a civilian tortured by members of the 
Intelligence Services in Gaza&#8221;, press release, 25 March 2009).

<b>1175</b> <i>World Tribune</i>, &#8220;Hamas cracks down on the unauthorized, random firing of rockets at Israel&#8221;, 13 March 2009.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(d) On 11 July 2009, the Islamic Jihad released a statement in which asserted that two 
of its members had been arrested by &#8220;interior security officials&#8221; as they had been preparing to 
fire mortars into Israel.<b>1176</b> 
</p>
<p>1840. As far as incidents of killing, torture and mistreatment within the Gaza Strip in connection 
with or in the context of the military operations are concerned,<b>1177</b> the Gaza authorities stated that 
they had investigated allegations of abuse and found that the incidents were &#8220;family revenge 
cases&#8221; or individual acts motivated by revenge. Through its competent agencies, the authorities 
stated that they &#8220;had opened investigations into these events immediately after the war&#8221; and 
submitted charges before the competent courts.<b>1178</b> Notwithstanding this statement and any 
action that the Gaza authorities may have taken, of which the Mission is unaware, the Mission 
considers that allegations in this respect have gone largely without investigation. 
</p>
<p>1841. The Mission has taken into account the media reports referred to above, but remains 
unconvinced that any genuine and effective initiatives have been taken by the authorities to 
address the serious issues of violation of IHL in the conduct of armed activities by militant 
groups in the Gaza Strip. The Mission was also given no evidence of any arrests, investigation or 
prosecution connected with the serious violations of the peremptory norms of international law 
that have been alleged in information presented in other parts of this report, be these against 
Palestinian civilians in Gaza or against Israeli civilians. 
</p>
<p>1842. The Mission is aware that Hamas continues to view all armed activities directed against 
Israel as resistance to occupation and practices of the occupation, and, therefore, a legitimate 
right of the Palestinian people. The Mission fully recognizes the Palestinian people&#8217;s right to 
self-determination, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international human 
rights conventions. It also acknowledges that United Nations bodies and others have repeatedly 
pointed out practices of the Israeli occupation that deprive Palestinians of their human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, the Mission forcefully reiterates that the peremptory norms 
of customary international law, both of human rights law and humanitarian law, apply to all 
actions that may be undertaken in response to, or to oppose, human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Proceedings related to actions in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>1843. The Palestinian Authority has a duty to respect and ensure respect for human rights and 
humanitarian law in the areas under its authority and control. The duty to investigate and, if 
appropriate, prosecute alleged perpetrators of serious crimes is also incumbent upon it. It has a 
general duty to provide an effective remedy to those who allege that their rights have been 
infringed. 
</p>
<p>1844. Article 32 of the Palestinian Basic Law provides: 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1176</b> <i>Haaretz</i>, &#8220;Hamas nabs two Islamic Jihad preparing to fire mortars at Israel&#8221;, 11 July 2009.  
<b>1177</b> See chap. XX.  
<b>1178</b> Written reply to list of questions formulated by the Mission, July 2009, on file with the Mission secretariat. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Any violation of any personal freedom, of the sanctity of the private life of human 
beings, or of any of the rights or liberties that have been guaranteed by the law or by this 
Basic Law shall be considered a crime. Criminal and civil cases resulting from such 
violations may not be subject to any statute of limitations. The National Authority shall 
guarantee a fair remedy to those who suffer from such damage. 
</p>
<p>1845. In its 2008 report, ICHR addresses the system of accountability in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Victims of violations may 
submit a petition to the Attorney General, who should start investigations according to the law. 
Compensation can also be requested and obtained from the Palestinian Authority through a civil 
suit. The 1960 Jordanian Penal Code still applies in the West Bank. There is also provision for 
the enforceability of judicial rulings and sentences (article 106 of the Basic Law). 
</p>
<p>1846. The Basic Law grants the Palestinian Legislative Council the power to set up fact-finding 
committees to inquire into any matter of public concern (art. 58), including human rights and 
freedoms. ICHR observes that, of the few committees established to address human rights issues, 
none has found its recommendations or findings translated into criminal prosecutions.<b>1179</b> With 
few exceptions, it appears that there has been a degree of tolerance towards human rights 
violations against political opponents, which has resulted in a lack of accountability for such 
actions.<b>1180</b> 
</p>
<p>1847. The Ministry of Interior has also ignored the High Court&#8217;s decisions to release a number 
of detainees or to reopen some associations closed by the administration. The police put in place 
an internal disciplinary mechanism under which a total of 430 police were sanctioned during 
2008. But the Preventive Security agencies and the General Intelligence agencies have not taken 
any similar measures.<b>1181</b>  
</p>
<p>1848. The Mission requested information from the Palestinian Authority about any investigation 
it had initiated into allegations of violations by members of Palestinian security forces in areas 
under its jurisdiction. In its reply to the list of questions formulated by the Mission, the 
Palestinian Authority did not provide any information in this respect. In the circumstances, the 
Mission is unable to consider the measures taken by the Palestinian Authority as meaningful for 
holding to account perpetrators of serious violations of international law and believes that the 
responsibility for protecting the rights of the people inherent in the authority assumed by the 
Palestinian Authority must be fulfilled with greater commitment. 
</p>
<p><b>XXVIII.  UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION 
</b></p>
<p>1849. In their search for justice, victims of serious violations of human rights have often looked 
for accountability mechanisms in other countries when there were none at home or the existing 
ones did not offer an effective remedy. The principle of universality, which says that 
international crimes that violate fundamental human values are a concern for the entire 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>1179</b> ICHR, <i>Fourteenth Annual Report</i>, p. 182. 
<b>1180</b> See chap. XXIII.  
<b>1181</b> ICHR, <i>Fourteenth Annual Report</i>, p. 185. </p>

 <p> 
international community, underpins the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in many States. The 
exercise of criminal jurisdiction on the basis of the universality principle concerns especially 
serious crimes regardless of the place of commission, the nationality of the perpetrator or the 
nationality of the victim. This form of jurisdiction is concurrent with others based on more 
traditional principles of territoriality, active and passive nationality, and it is not subsidiary to 
them. 
</p>
<p>1850. It is uncontroversial today that States may confer upon their courts the right to exercise 
universal jurisdiction over international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity 
and genocide.<b>1182</b> However, there is lingering controversy about the conditions or requirements 
for the exercise of that jurisdiction and, in particular, about whether the alleged perpetrator 
should be physically in the territory of the prosecuting State or not.  
</p>
<p>1851. Universal jurisdiction is also established under certain conventions as an obligation for 
their States parties. Such is the case of the Fourth Geneva Convention, whose article 146 requires 
each high contracting party &#8220;to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered 
to be committed, such grave breaches&#8221; and to bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, 
before its own courts.  
</p>
<p>1852. Article 5 of the Convention against Torture requires States parties to take measures to 
establish jurisdiction over the offence of torture and of complicity or participation in torture 
when the alleged offender is in a territory under its jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p>1853. Many countries around the world incorporate the principle of universal jurisdiction into 
their national legislation, including Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Costa Rica and Spain.  
</p>
<p>1854. In connection with past events in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Mission is aware 
of one case pending before the Spanish courts. It concerns the killing of Hamas leader Salah 
Shehadeh on 22 July 2002 by a one-ton bomb fired from an Israeli F-16 aircraft. The strike also 
killed a number of other people in the same house and in the house next door. The investigating 
judge admitted the case for investigation on the basis of the universality principle and after 
determining that the Israeli internal investigation system did not satisfy the requirements of the 
right to an effective remedy. This decision was overturned by the Appeals Chamber, whose 
decision is, in turn, being appealed now to the Supreme Court.<b>1183</b> 
</p>
<p>1855. There are other cases pending before national courts of several European States, such as 
the Netherlands<b>1184</b> and Norway.<b>1185</b> In South Africa, a request for prosecution is being 
considered by the National Prosecuting Authority.<b>1186</b> 
</p>
<p>

de lo Penal Pleno, Audiencia Nacional. 
<b>1184</b> PCHR, &#8220;Torture victim seeks prosecution of former head of Israeli general security services&#8221;, press release, 
6 October 2008, available at http://www.pchrgaza.org/files/PressR/English/2008/92-2008.html. This case is brought 
under articles 6 and 7 of the Convention against Torture. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>1856. Criminal investigations and prosecutions by countries other than Israel are possible on the 
basis of the principle of nationality of the offender. Several countries provide their courts with 
jurisdiction over their own nationals regardless of the place where the offence has been 
committed. For instance, article 5 of the Convention against Torture requires States parties to 
establish jurisdiction over offences defined in it when the offender is a national. 
</p>
<p>1857. It is the view of the Mission that universal jurisdiction is a potentially efficient tool for 
enforcing international humanitarian law and international human rights law, preventing 
impunity and promoting international accountability. In the context of increasing unwillingness 
on the part of Israel to open criminal investigations that comply with international standards and 
establish judicial accountability over its military actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
and until such a time as clarity is achieved as to whether the International Criminal Court will 
exercise jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in Gaza, the Mission supports the reliance on universal jurisdiction as an avenue for 
States to investigate violations of grave breach provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1949, 
prevent impunity and promote international accountability. 
</p>
<p><b>XXIX.  REPARATION 
</b></p>
<p>1858. The extent of the damage and destruction inflicted on Palestinian lives and property, and 
on Palestinian civilian objects has been substantial. The Palestinian Authority estimated the total 
cost of early recovery and reconstruction at US$ 1,326 million in March 2009.<b>1187</b> To this 
amount should be added the indirect costs of the impact on human and animal health, the 
environment and market opportunities. These losses are still to be estimated. 
</p>
<p>1859. The international community, bilateral donors and multilateral agencies (including the 
United Nations specialized agencies, programmes and funds) have been responsive to the urgent 
needs of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. A number of development NGOs operating in 
the Gaza Strip have redoubled their efforts. The Gaza Flash Appeal 2009,<b>1188</b> prepared by aid 
agencies operating in the Gaza Strip, called for US$ 613 million to meet the requirements of 
urgent life-saving projects and initial crucial repairs to infrastructure over a period of nine 
months. By the middle of 2009 only a fraction of those requirements had been met. The United 
Nations Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has said that 
although donor countries had pledged billions of dollars for Gaza&#8217;s reconstruction, it cannot 
begin because of the ongoing Israeli blockade.<b>1189</b> In addition, some international donors are

<p>

 <p> 
reluctant to disburse funds in the current climate of uncertainty created by the rift between the 
two rival Palestinian political groups in Gaza and the West Bank.<b>1190</b> 
</p>
<p>1860. Notwithstanding the response by the Palestinian Authority and the international 
community to the crisis resulting from the combined effect of the blockade and the military 
operations of December 2008&#8211;January 2009, the Mission is more concerned about the 
individuals (women, men, children and the elderly) and their families, and their ability to rebuild 
their lives after this traumatic experience. The Mission is conscious that rebuilding Palestinian 
lives and livelihoods will not be fully possible until the effects of the occupation, the blockade 
and successive military incursions are eliminated. One should not lose sight, however, of the 
individual human dimension. That dimension flows from the right to a remedy and reparation 
that the Palestinian people and individual Palestinians have under international law. Palestinian 
lives, physical integrity and health have been affected, in many cases very seriously and 
irreparably. In addition to the loss of life and limb, considerable mental harm has been inflicted 
on many people who have lost relatives and often financial support. The psychological harm 
caused to the Palestinians in Gaza is still to be assessed and also requires reparation measures; 
so, too, the destruction of houses and private property. 
</p>
<p><b>A. The right to a remedy and reparation under international law 
</b></p>
<p>1861. The obligation to make full reparation for the loss or injury caused is an international 
obligation incumbent upon a State responsible for an unlawful act. International law also 
recognizes victims&#8217; rights to an effective remedy and reparations for damage or loss resulting 
from violations of their human rights. This obligation and these rights are recognized in 
international treaties and customary international law.  
</p>
<p>1862. As early as 1927, the Permanent Court of International Justice established the provision of 
reparation for the injury caused by an international wrongful act as a principle of international 
law: &#8220;Reparation therefore is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention 
and there is no necessity for this to be stated in the convention itself&#8221;.<b>1191</b> 
</p>
<p>1863. This principle was codified by the International Law Commission in article 31 of its draft 
articles on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts.<b>1192</b> 
</p>
<p>1864. The principle that a State responsible for breaching an international obligation should 
repair the damage or loss caused can also be found in international humanitarian law conventions 
and human rights treaties. These include article 3 of the 1907 Fourth Hague Convention, article 
51 of the First Geneva Convention, article 52 of the Second Geneva Convention, article 131 of 
the Third Geneva Convention and article 148 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. A similar rule is 
provided for in article 91 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. 
</p>
<p>

<b>1192</b> General Assembly resolution 56/83, annex; see also <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law&#8230;</i>, rule 150, 
p. 537. </p>

 <p> 
1865. Reparation as part of the right to a remedy has been enshrined in article 2 (3) of ICCPR, 
article 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, article 14 of the Convention against Torture and article 39 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. The Rome Statute also provides for the right of victims to participation 
in the proceedings (art. 68 (3)) and to reparations (art. 75).<b>1193</b>   
</p>
<p>1866. Reparation can take the form of restitution, compensation or satisfaction, but may also 
include measures of rehabilitation of victims and guarantees of non-repetition.<b>1194</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Compensation and reparations to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p>1867. According to news reports, UNDP and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement 
allocating US$ 270 million for the restoration of the agricultural sector in Gaza. This will allow 
for the payment of a compensation package to Palestinian farmers for property damaged during 
the most recent military operations in Gaza, repair of the damaged infrastructure, damaged 
orchards, fisheries, livestock, greenhouses, irrigation networks and roads.<b>1195</b> Cash assistance 
was also to be provided to some 10,000 non-refugee Palestinians whose houses have been 
destroyed or damaged.<b>1196</b> While in Gaza City, the Mission learnt that such compensation 
schemes were being implemented. 
</p>
<p>1868. These assistance and compensation schemes notwithstanding, the Mission is of the view 
that international law requires the State responsible for the internationally wrongful act to 
provide reparation and compensation to the victim. To the Mission&#8217;s knowledge, Israel has to 
date considered compensation to be paid only to the United Nations for the damage inflicted on 
United Nations personnel and facilities, without acknowledging responsibility.<b>1197</b> At the very 
least, similar compensation should be offered to Palestinian individuals. 
</p>
<p>1869. In its Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>, the International Court of Justice affirmed that &#8220;Israel has the

Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law (General Assembly resolution 60/147):

concerned.&#8221;<b>1198</b> The United Nations has established the United Nations Registry of Damages, 
which collects data on damage caused to Palestinians by the construction of the Wall.<b>1199</b> 
Domestic law of Israel would be one vehicle to make possible reparations for affected 
Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>1870. The possibilities for obtaining reparation and compensation in the Israeli legal system 
have been limited. A 2001 amendment to the Civil Wrongs Act extended the definition of &#8220;acts 
of war&#8221; and set procedural limitations on Palestinians&#8217; ability to bring claims against Israel. 
These limitations include the shortening of the period before the statute of limitations applies and 
the requirement to submit a &#8220;notice&#8221; of damage to the Israeli Defense Minister in advance of the 
claim and within two months after the damage occurred.<b>1200</b> Additional amendments passed in 
2002 and 2005 prevent the courts from hearing claims relating to actions by security forces in 
&#8220;conflict zones&#8221; proclaimed as such by the Minister of Defense, and give immunity to the State 
against claims by subjects of enemy States or members of &#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221;.<b>1201</b> Under the 
last two amendments the character of the harmful act, the circumstances under which harm was 
suffered and the causality link between the perpetrator and the harm have become irrelevant. The 
Mission received information that the amendments allowed the Minister of Defense to declare 
areas in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as &#8220;conflict zones&#8221; retroactively. 
</p>
<p>1871. The 2005 amendment No. 7 was challenged before the Supreme Court of Israel, which 
ruled in 2006 that section 5C of the Civil Wrongs Law (as amended in 2005) was not 
constitutional. Therefore, the provision that makes Israel immune from civil liability for acts of 
security forces in declared &#8220;zones of conflict&#8221; was struck down. However, the ruling did not 
pronounce on the constitutionality of section 5B of the Law, which grants immunity to the State 
against civil claims brought by subjects of a State enemy of Israel and persons active in or 
members of a terrorist organization.<b>1202</b> At the same time, other amendments passed prior to 
2005 have not been challenged and stand as law in force in the land. 
</p>
<p>1872. The Mission is concerned that the possibilities for civil compensation for damage and loss 
of property suffered by Palestinians during military operations are limited in Israeli domestic law 
since that damage is generally seen as the result of &#8220;acts of war&#8221; regardless of the nature of the 
action. In a recent decision concerning a claim on behalf of a Palestinian killed by helicopter fire 
on 16 April 2002 during the so-called Operation Defensive Shield, in Nablus, the Court ruled 
that this was an &#8220;act of war&#8221; designed to &#8220;vanquish the terrorist infrastructure&#8221;. The Jerusalem 
Magistrate's Court held that an air strike is clearly an act of war &#8220;that the legislator intended to

</p>
<p>1873. It is the view of the Mission that the current constitutional structure and legislation in 
Israel leaves very little room, if any, for Palestinians to seek compensation. The international 
community needs to provide an additional or alternative mechanism of compensation by Israel 
for damage or loss incurred by Palestinian civilians during the military operations. In this regard, 
the Mission notes that the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur and the Commission of 
Inquiry on Lebanon expressed similar concerns about the need for compensation for the 
victims.<b>1204</b>

</p>
<p><b>PART FIVE: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>XXX.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>1874. <b>An objective assessment of the events it investigated and their causes and context is 
crucial for the success of any effort to achieve justice for victims of violations and peace 
and security in the region, and as such is in the interest of all concerned and affected by 
this situation, including the parties to the continuing hostilities.  It is in this spirit, and with 
full appreciation of the complexity of its task, that the Mission received and implemented 
its mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>1875. <b>The international community as well as Israel and, to the extent determined by their 
authority and means, Palestinian authorities, have the responsibility to protect victims of 
violations and ensure that they do not continue to suffer the scourge of war or the 
oppression and humiliations of occupation or indiscriminate rocket attacks. People of 
Palestine have the right to freely determine their own political and economic system, 
including the right to resist forcible deprivation of their right to self-determination and the 
right to live, in peace and freedom, in their own State. The people of Israel have the right to 
live in peace and security. Both peoples are entitled to justice in accordance with 
international law. 
</b></p>
<p>1876. <b>In carrying out its mandate, the Mission had regard, as its only guides, for general 
international law, international human rights and humanitarian law, and the obligations 
they place on States, the obligations they place on non-State actors and, above all, the 
rights and entitlements they bestow on individuals. This in no way implies equating the 
position of Israel as the occupying Power with that of the occupied Palestinian population 
or entities representing it. The differences with regard to the power and capacity to inflict 
harm or to protect, including by securing justice when violations occur, are obvious and a 
comparison is neither possible nor necessary. What requires equal attention and effort, 
however, is the protection of all victims in accordance with international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. The Israeli military operations in Gaza: relevance to and links with Israel&#8217;s  
policies vis-&#224;-vis the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p>1877. <b>The Mission is of the view that Israel&#8217;s military operation in Gaza between 27 
December 2008 and 18 January 2009 and its impact cannot be understood or assessed in 
isolation from developments prior and subsequent to it. The operation fits into a 
continuum of policies aimed at pursuing Israel&#8217;s political objectives with regard to Gaza 
and the Occupied Palestinian Territory as a whole. Many such policies are based on or 
result in violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Military 
objectives as stated by the Government of Israel do not explain the facts ascertained by the 
Mission, nor are they congruous with the patterns identified by the Mission during the 
investigation.   
</b></p>
<p>1878. <b>The continuum is evident most immediately with the policy of blockade that 
preceded the operations and that in the Mission&#8217;s view amounts to collective punishment </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>intentionally inflicted by the Government of Israel on the people of the Gaza Strip. When 
the operations began, the Gaza Strip had been under a severe regime of closures and 
restrictions on the movement of people, goods and services for almost three years. This 
included basic necessities of life, such as food and medical supplies, and products required 
for the conduct of daily life, such as fuel, electricity, school items, and repair and 
construction material. These measures were imposed by Israel purportedly to isolate and 
weaken Hamas after its electoral victory in view of the perceived continuing threat to 
Israel&#8217;s security that it represented. Their effect was compounded by the withholding of 
financial and other assistance by some donors on similar grounds. Adding hardship to the 
already difficult situation in the Gaza Strip, the effects of the prolonged blockade did not 
spare any aspect of the life of Gazans. Prior to the military operation, the Gaza economy 
had been depleted, the health sector beleaguered, the population had been made dependent 
on humanitarian assistance for survival and the conduct of daily life. Men, women and 
children were psychologically suffering from long-standing poverty, insecurity and 
violence, and enforced confinement in a heavily overcrowded territory. The dignity of the 
people of Gaza had been severely eroded. This was the situation in the Gaza Strip when the 
Israeli armed forces launched their offensive in December 2008. The military operations 
and the manner in which they were conducted considerably exacerbated the 
aforementioned effects of the blockade. The result, in a very short time, was unprecedented 
long-term damage both to the people and to their development and recovery prospects.  
</b></p>
<p>1879. <b>An analysis of the modalities and impact of the December-January military 
operations also sets them, in the Mission&#8217;s view, in a continuum with a number of other 
pre-existing Israeli policies with regard to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The 
progressive isolation and separation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank, a policy that 
began much earlier and which was consolidated in particular with the imposition of tight 
closures, restrictions on movement and eventually the blockade, are among the most 
apparent. Several measures adopted by Israel in the West Bank during and following the 
military operations in Gaza also further deepen Israel&#8217;s control over the West Bank, 
including East Jerusalem, and point to a convergence of objectives with the Gaza military 
operations. Such measures include increased land expropriation, house demolitions, 
demolition orders and permits to build homes in settlements, greater and more formalized 
access and movement restrictions on Palestinians, new and stricter procedures for 
residents of the Gaza Strip to change their residency to the West Bank. Systematic efforts 
to hinder and control Palestinian self-determined democratic processes, not least through 
the detention of elected political representatives and members of Government and the 
punishment of the Gaza population for its perceived support for Hamas, culminated in the 
attacks on government buildings during the Gaza offensive, most prominently the 
Palestinian Legislative Council. The cumulative impact of these policies and actions make 
prospects for political and economic integration between Gaza and the West Bank more 
remote. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C. Nature, objectives and targets of the Israeli military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>1880. <b>Both Palestinians and Israelis whom the Mission met repeatedly stressed that the 
military operations carried out by Israel in Gaza from 27 December 2008 until 18 January 
2009 were qualitatively different from any previous military action by Israel in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory. Despite the hard conditions that have long been prevailing </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>in the Gaza Strip, victims and long-time observers stated that the operations were 
unprecedented in their severity and that their consequences would be long-lasting.  
</b></p>
<p>1881. <b>When the Mission conducted its first visit to the Gaza Strip in early June 2009, 
almost five months had passed since the end of the Israeli military operations. The 
devastating effects of the operations on the population were, however, unequivocally 
manifest. In addition to the visible destruction of houses, factories, wells, schools, hospitals, 
police stations and other public buildings, the sight of families, including the elderly and 
children, still living amid the rubble of their former dwellings &#8211; no reconstruction possible 
due to the continuing blockade &#8211; was evidence of the protracted impact of the operations 
on the living conditions of the Gaza population. Reports of the trauma suffered during the 
attacks, the stress due to the uncertainty about the future, the hardship of life and the fear 
of further attacks, pointed to less tangible but not less real long-term effects. 
</b></p>
<p>1882. <b>Women were affected in significant ways. Their situation must be given specific 
attention in any effort to address the consequences of the blockade, of the continuing 
occupation and of the latest Israeli military operations. 
</b></p>
<p>1883. <b>The Gaza military operations were, according to the Israeli Government, thoroughly 
and extensively planned. While the Israeli Government has sought to portray its operations 
as essentially a response to rocket attacks in the exercise of its right to self-defence, the 
Mission considers the plan to have been directed, at least in part, at a different target: the 
people of Gaza as a whole.  
</b></p>
<p>1884. <b>In this respect, the operations were in furtherance of an overall policy aimed at 
punishing the Gaza population for its resilience and for its apparent support for Hamas, 
and possibly with the intent of forcing a change in such support. The Mission considers this 
position to be firmly based in fact, bearing in mind what it saw and heard on the ground, 
what it read in the accounts of soldiers who served in the campaign, and what it heard and 
read from current and former military officers and political leaders whom the Mission 
considers to be representative of the thinking that informed the policy and strategy of the 
military operations. 
</b></p>
<p>1885. <b>The Mission recognizes that the principal focus in the aftermath of military 
operations will often be on the people who have been killed &#8211; more than 1,400 in just three 
weeks. This is rightly so. Part of the functions of reports such as this is to attempt, albeit in 
a very small way, to restore the dignity of those whose rights have been violated in the most 
fundamental way of all &#8211; the arbitrary deprivation of life. It is important that the 
international community asserts formally and unequivocally that such violence to the most 
basic fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals should not be overlooked and should 
be condemned. 
</b></p>
<p>1886. <b>In this respect, the Mission recognizes that not all deaths constitute violations of 
international humanitarian law. The principle of proportionality acknowledges that, under 
certain strict conditions, actions resulting in the loss of civilian life may not be unlawful. 
What makes the application and assessment of proportionality difficult in respect of many 
of the events investigated by the Mission is that deeds by the Israeli armed forces and 
words of military and political leaders prior to and during the operations indicate that, as a </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>whole, they were premised on a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed not at the 
enemy but at the &#8220;supporting infrastructure.&#8221; In practice, this appears to have meant the 
civilian population. 
</b></p>
<p>1887. <b>The timing of the first Israeli attack, at 11.30 a.m. on a weekday, when children were 
returning from school and the streets of Gaza were crowded with people going about their 
daily business, appears to have been calculated to create the greatest disruption and 
widespread panic among the civilian population. The treatment of many civilians detained 
or even killed while trying to surrender is one manifestation of the way in which the 
effective rules of engagement, standard operating procedures and instructions to the troops 
on the ground appear to have been framed in order to create an environment in which due 
regard for civilian lives and basic human dignity was replaced with disregard for basic 
international humanitarian law and human rights norms.  
</b></p>
<p>1888. <b>The Mission recognizes fully that the Israeli armed forces, like any army attempting 
to act within the parameters of international law, must avoid taking undue risks with their 
soldiers&#8217; lives, but neither can they transfer that risk onto the lives of civilian men, women 
and children. The fundamental principles of distinction and proportionality apply on the 
battlefield, whether that battlefield is a built-up urban area or an open field.  
</b></p>
<p>1889. <b>The repeated failure to distinguish between combatants and civilians appears to the 
Mission to have been the result of deliberate guidance issued to soldiers, as described by 
some of them, and not the result of occasional lapses. 
</b></p>
<p>1890. <b>The Mission recognizes that some of those killed were combatants directly engaged 
in hostilities against Israel, but many were not. The outcome and the modalities of the 
operations indicate, in the Mission&#8217;s view, that they were only partially aimed at killing 
leaders and members of Hamas, al-Qassam Brigades and other armed groups. They were 
also to a large degree aimed at destroying or incapacitating civilian property and the 
means of subsistence of the civilian population.  
</b></p>
<p>1891. <b>It is clear from evidence gathered by the Mission that the destruction of food supply 
installations, water sanitation systems, concrete factories and residential houses was the 
result of a deliberate and systematic policy by the Israeli armed forces. It was not carried 
out because those objects presented a military threat or opportunity, but to make the daily 
process of living, and dignified living, more difficult for the civilian population. 
</b></p>
<p>1892. <b>Allied to the systematic destruction of the economic capacity of the Gaza Strip, there 
appears also to have been an assault on the dignity of the people. This was seen not only in 
the use of human shields and unlawful detentions sometimes in unacceptable conditions, 
but also in the vandalizing of houses when occupied and the way in which people were 
treated when their houses were entered. The graffiti on the walls, the obscenities and often 
racist slogans, all constituted an overall image of humiliation and dehumanization of the 
Palestinian population. 
</b></p>
<p>1893. <b>The operations were carefully planned in all their phases. Legal opinions and advice 
were given throughout the planning stages and at certain operational levels during the 
campaign. There were almost no mistakes made according to the Government of Israel. It </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>is in these circumstances that the Mission concludes that what occurred in just over three 
weeks at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 was a deliberately disproportionate 
attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish 
its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an 
ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability. 
</b></p>
<p>1894. <b>The Mission has noted with concern public statements by Israeli officials, including 
senior military officials, to the effect that the use of disproportionate force, attacks on 
civilian population and the destruction of civilian property are legitimate means to achieve 
Israel&#8217;s military and political objectives. The Mission believes that such statements not only 
undermine the entire regime of international law, they are inconsistent with the spirit of 
the Charter of the United Nations and, therefore, deserve to be categorically denounced.  
</b></p>
<p>1895. <b>Whatever violations of international humanitarian and human rights law may have 
been committed, the systematic and deliberate nature of the activities described in this 
report leave the Mission in no doubt that responsibility lies in the first place with those who 
designed, planned, ordered and oversaw the operations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>D. Occupation, resilience and civil society 
</b></p>
<p>1896. <b>The accounts of more severe violence during the recent military operations did not 
obscure the fact that the concept of &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in the Gaza Strip has long been redefined 
owing to the protracted situation of abuse and lack of protection deriving from the 
decades-long occupation. 
</b></p>
<p>1897. <b>As the Mission focused on investigating and analysing the specific matters within its 
mandate, Israel&#8217;s continuing occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank emerged as 
the fundamental factor underlying violations of international humanitarian and human 
rights law against the protected population and undermining prospects for development 
and peace. Israel&#8217;s failure to acknowledge and exercise its responsibilities as the occupying 
Power further exacerbated the effects of occupation on the Palestinian people, and continue 
to do so. Furthermore, the harsh and unlawful practices of occupation, far from quelling 
resistance, breed it, including its violent manifestations. The Mission is of the view that 
ending occupation is a prerequisite for the return of a dignified life for Palestinians, as well 
as development and a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>1898. <b>The Mission was struck by the resilience and dignity shown by people in the face of 
dire circumstances. UNRWA Director of Operations, John Ging, relayed to the Mission the 
answer of a Gaza teacher during a discussion after the end of the Israeli military 
operations about strengthening human rights education in schools. Rather than expressing 
scepticism at the relevance of teaching human rights in a context of renewed denial of 
rights, the teacher unhesitantly supported the resumption of human rights education: 
&#8220;This is a war of values, and we are not going to lose it&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>1899. <b>The assiduous work of Palestinian non-governmental and civil society organizations 
in providing support to the population in such extreme circumstances, and in giving voice 
to the suffering and expectations of victims of violations deserves to be fully acknowledged. 
Their role in helping to sustain the resilience and dignity of the population cannot be </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>overstated. The Mission heard many accounts of NGO workers, doctors, ambulance 
drivers, journalists, human rights monitors, who, at the height of the military operations, 
risked their lives to be of service to people in need. They frequently relayed the anxiety of 
having to choose between remaining close to their own families or continuing to work to 
assist others in need, thereby often being cut off from news about the safety or whereabouts 
of family members. The Mission wishes to pay tribute to the courage and work of the 
numerous individuals who so contributed to alleviating the suffering of the population and 
to report on the events in Gaza. 
</b></p>
<p><b>E. Rocket and mortar attacks in Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1900. <b>Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets and mortars into 
Israel since April 2001. These have succeeded in causing terror within Israel&#8217;s civilian 
population, as evidenced by the high rates of psychological trauma within the affected 
communities. The attacks have also led to an erosion of the social, cultural and economic 
lives of the communities in southern Israel, and have affected the rights to education of the 
tens of thousands of children and young adults who attend classes in the affected areas. 
</b></p>
<p>1901. <b>Between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, these attacks left four people dead 
and hundreds injured. That there have not been more casualties is due to a combination of 
luck and measures taken by the Israeli Government, including the fortification of public 
buildings, the construction of shelters and, in times of escalated hostilities, the closure of 
schools.  
</b></p>
<p>1902. <b>The Mission notes, with concern, that Israel has not provided the same level of 
protection from rockets and mortars to affected Palestinian citizens as it has to Jewish 
citizens. In particular, it has failed to provide public shelters or fortification of schools, for 
example, to the Palestinian communities living in the unrecognized villages and some of the 
recognized villages. It ought to go without saying that the thousands of Palestinian Israelis&#8211; 
including a significant number of children &#8211; who live within the range of rocket fire, 
deserve the same protection as the Israeli Government provides to its Jewish citizens. 
</b></p>
<p><b>F. Dissenting voices in Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1903. <b>While the Israeli military offensive in Gaza was widely supported by the Israeli 
public, there were also dissenting voices, which expressed themselves through 
demonstrations, protests, as well as public reporting on Israel&#8217;s conduct. The Mission is of 
the view that actions of the Israeli Government during and following the military 
operations in the Gaza Strip, including interrogation of political activists, repression of 
criticism and sources of potential criticism of Israeli military actions, in particular NGOs, 
have contributed significantly to a political climate in which dissent with the Government 
and its actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is not tolerated. The denial of media 
access to Gaza and the continuing denial of access to human rights monitors are, in the 
Mission&#8217;s view, an attempt both to remove the Government&#8217;s actions in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory from public scrutiny and to impede investigations and reporting of 
the conduct of the parties to the conflict in the Gaza Strip.  </b></p>

 <p> 
1904. <b>In this context of increased intolerance for dissenting opinions in Israel, the Mission 
wishes to acknowledge the difficult work of NGOs in Israel, which courageously continue 
to express criticism of Government action that violates international human rights and 
humanitarian law. The work of these organizations is essential not only to ensure 
independent information to the Israeli and international public, but also to encourage a 
facts-based debate about these issues within Israeli society.   
</b></p>
<p><b>G. The impact of dehumanization 
</b></p>
<p>1905. <b>As in many conflicts, one of the features of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the 
dehumanization of the other, and of victims in particular. Palestinian psychiatrist Dr. Iyad 
al-Sarraj explained the cycle of aggression and victimization through which &#8220;the 
Palestinian in the eyes of the Israeli soldier is not an equal human being. Sometimes [&#8230;] 
even becomes a demon [&#8230;]&#8221; This &#8220;culture of demonization and dehumanization&#8221; adds to a 
state of paranoia. &#8220;Paranoia has two sides, the side of victimization, I am a victim of this 
world, the whole world is against me and on the other side, I am superior to this world and 
I can oppress it. This leads to what is called the arrogance of power.&#8221; As Palestinians, &#8220;we 
look in general to the Israelis as demons and that we can hate them, that what we do is a 
reaction, and we say that the Israelis can only understand the language of power. The same 
thing that we say about the Israelis they say about us, that we only understand the 
language of violence or force. There we see the arrogance of power and [the Israeli] uses it 
without thinking of humanity at all. In my view we are seeing not only a state of war but 
also a state that is cultural and psychological and I hope, I wish that the Israelis would 
start, and there are many, many Jews in the world and in Israel that look into themselves, 
have an insight that would make them, alleviate the fear that they have because there&#8217;s a 
state of fear in Israel, in spite of all the power, and that they would start to walk on the 
road of dealing with the consequences of their own victimization and to start dealing with 
the Palestinian as a human being, a full human being who&#8217;s equal in rights with the Israeli 
and also the other way around, the Palestinian must deal with himself, must respect himself 
and respect his own differences in order to be able to stand before the Israeli also as a full 
human being with equal rights and obligations. This is the real road for justice and for 
peace.&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>1906. <b>Israeli college teacher Ofer Shinar offered a similar analysis: &#8220;Israeli society&#8217;s 
problem is that, because of the conflict, Israeli society feels itself to be a victim and to a 
large extent that&#8217;s justified and it&#8217;s very difficult for Israeli society to move and to feel that 
it can also see the other side and to understand that the other side is also a victim. This I 
think is the greatest tragedy of the conflict and it&#8217;s terribly difficult to overcome it [&#8230;] I 
think that the initiative that you&#8217;ve taken in listening to [&#8230;] people [&#8230;] is very important. 
The message that you&#8217;re giving Israeli society is absolutely unambiguous that you are 
impartial that you should be able to see that the feeling of being a victim is something that 
characterizes both sides. What requires you to take this responsibility is the fact that you 
have to understand how difficult it is to get this message through to Israeli society, how 
closed the Israeli society is, how difficult it is for Israeli society to understand that the other 
side is not just the party which is infringing our own human rights, but how they are 
having their human rights infringed, how they are suffering as well.&#8221; </b></p>

 <p> 
1907. <b>The Mission, in fulfilling its mandate to investigate alleged violations of international 
law that occurred in the context of the December 2008 &#8211; January 2009 military operations 
in Gaza, spoke predominantly to those most affected by the most recent events in a conflict 
that has spanned decades. As may be expected, the Mission found societies scarred by 
living in conflict with significant psychological trauma stemming from a life that may 
rightly seem to those living in more peaceful countries to be unbearable.  
</b></p>
<p>1908. <b>Both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they 
are forced to lead. For the Palestinians, the anger about individual events &#8211; the civilian 
casualties, injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks, the blockade, 
the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders &#8211; feed into an 
underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation, its daily humiliations and their 
as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination. For the Israelis, the public statements of 
Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a 
deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under 
existential threat from which only it can protect its people. In this way, both the Israelis 
and the Palestinians share a secret fear &#8211; for some, a belief &#8211; that each has no intention of 
accepting the other&#8217;s right to a country of their own. This anger and fear are unfortunately 
ably represented by many politicians. 
</b></p>
<p>1909. <b>Some Israelis pointed out to the Mission that policies of the Israeli Government 
relating to the isolation of the Gaza Strip and the tighter restrictions on the movement of 
Palestinians within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and between the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and Israel, have contributed to increasing the distance between 
Palestinians and Israelis, reducing the opportunities to interact other than in situations of 
control and coercion such as checkpoints and military posts. 
</b></p>
<p>1910. <b>In this context, the Mission was encouraged by reports of exchange and cooperation 
between Palestinians and Israelis, for example with regard to mental health specialists 
working with Palestinians from Gaza and southern Israel&#8217;s communities, and with regard 
to cooperation between Magen David Adom and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, 
especially in the West Bank, as they fulfil a shared commitment to providing humanitarian 
assistance to the communities in which they work, regardless of the ethnicity of the patient 
who lies before them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>H. The intra-Palestinian situation 
</b></p>
<p>1911. <b>The division and violence between Fatah and Hamas, which culminated in the 
establishment of parallel governance entities and structures in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank, is having adverse consequences for the human rights of the Palestinian population in 
both areas, as well as contributing to erode the rule of law in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory in addition to the threats already linked to foreign occupation. Even with the 
narrow focus of the Mission on violations relevant to the context of the December-January 
military operations, the diminishing protections for Palestinians are evident from the cases 
of arbitrary deprivation of life, arbitrary detention of political activists or sympathizers, 
limitations on freedom of expression and association, and abuses by security forces. The 
situation is compounded by the ever reducing role of the judiciary in ensuring the rule of 
law and legal remedies for violations. A resolution of the internal divisions based on the </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>free will and decisions of Palestinians and without external interference would strengthen 
the ability of Palestinian authorities and institutions to protect the rights of the people 
under their responsibility. 
</b></p>
<p><b>I. The need for protection and the role of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>1912. <b>International law sets obligations on States not only to respect but also to ensure 
respect for international humanitarian law. The International Court of Justice stated in its 
Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i> that &#8220;all States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 have in addition the 
obligation, while respecting the United Nations Charter and international law, to ensure 
compliance by Israel with international humanitarian law as embodied in that 
Convention&quot;. 
</b></p>
<p>1913. <b>The 2005 World Summit Outcome document recognized that the international 
community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate 
diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and 
VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from, inter alia, war crimes and crimes 
against humanity. The document stressed that the Members of the United Nations are 
prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security 
Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII should peaceful means be 
inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations from 
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In 2009, the 
Secretary-General, in his report on implementing the responsibility to protect, noted that 
the enumeration of these crimes did not  &#8220;detract in any way from the much broader range 
of obligations existing under international humanitarian law, international human rights 
law, refugee law and international criminal law.&#8221;   
</b></p>
<p>1914. <b>After decades of sustained conflict, the level of threat to which both Palestinians and 
Israelis are subjected has not abated, but if anything increased with continued escalations 
of violence, death and suffering for the civilian population, of which the December-January 
military operations in Gaza are only the most recent occurrence. Israel is therefore also 
failing to protect its own citizens by refusing to acknowledge the futility of resorting to 
violent means and military power. 
</b></p>
<p>1915. <b>Israeli incursions and military actions in the Gaza Strip did not stop after the end of 
the military operations of December &#8211; January. 
</b></p>
<p>1916. <b>The Security Council has placed the protection of civilian populations on its agenda 
as a regular item, recognizing it as a matter falling within its responsibility. The Mission 
notes that the international community has been largely silent and has to date failed to act 
to ensure the protection of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip and generally the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory. Suffice it to notice the lack of adequate reaction to the 
blockade and its consequences, to the Gaza military operations and, in their aftermath, to 
the continuing obstacles to reconstruction. The Mission also considers that the isolation of 
the Gaza authorities and the sanctions against the Gaza Strip have had a negative impact 
on the protection of the population. Immediate action to enable reconstruction in Gaza is </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>no doubt required. However, it also needs to be accompanied by a firmer and principled 
stance by the international community on violations of international humanitarian and 
human rights law and long delayed action to end them. Protection of civilian populations 
requires respect for international law and accountability for violations. When the 
international community does not live up to its own legal standards, the threat to the 
international rule of law is obvious and potentially far-reaching in its consequences. 
</b></p>
<p>1917. <b>The Mission acknowledges and emphasizes the impressive and essential role played 
by the staff of the numerous United Nations agencies and bodies working to assist the 
population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory in all aspects of daily life. An additional 
disturbing feature of the December-January military operations was the disregard in 
several incidents, some of which are documented in this report, for the inviolability of 
United Nations premises, facilities and staff. It ought to go without saying that attacks on 
the United Nations are unacceptable and undermine its ability to fulfil its protection and 
assistance role vis-&#224;-vis a population that so badly needs it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>J. Summary of legal findings 
</b></p>
<p>1918. <b>Detailed legal findings by the Mission are included in each of the chapters of the 
report where specific facts and events are analysed. The following is a summary of those 
findings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Actions by Israel in Gaza in the context of the military operations  
of 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Precautions in launching attacks 
</b></p>
<p>1919. <b>The Mission finds that in a number of cases Israel failed to take feasible precautions 
required by customary law reflected in article 57 (2) (a) (ii) of Additional Protocol I to 
avoid or minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian 
objects. The firing of white phosphorus shells over the UNRWA compound in Gaza City is 
one of such cases in which precautions were not taken in the choice of weapons and 
methods in the attack, and these facts were compounded by reckless disregard for the 
consequences. The intentional strike at al-Quds hospital using high-explosive artillery 
shells and white phosphorous in and around the hospital also violated articles 18 and 19 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention. With regard to the attack against al-Wafa hospital, the 
Mission found a violation of the same provisions, as well as a violation of the customary law 
prohibition against attacks which may be expected to cause excessive damage to civilians 
and civilian objects.  
</b></p>
<p>1920. <b>The Mission finds that the different kinds of warnings issued by Israel in Gaza 
cannot be considered as sufficiently effective in the circumstances to comply with 
customary law as reflected in Additional Protocol I, article 57 (2) (c). While some of the 
leaflet warnings were specific in nature, the Mission does not consider that general 
messages telling people to leave wherever they were and go to city centres, in the particular 
circumstances of the military campaign, meet the threshold of effectiveness. Firing missiles 
into or on top of buildings as a &#8220;warning&#8221; is essentially a dangerous practice and a form of 
attack rather than a warning.  </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>(b) Incidents involving the killing of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>1921. <b>The Mission found numerous instances of deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian 
objects (individuals, whole families, houses, mosques) in violation of the fundamental 
international humanitarian law principle of distinction, resulting in deaths and serious 
injuries. In these cases the Mission found that the protected status of civilians was not 
respected and the attacks were intentional, in clear violation of customary law reflected in 
article 51 (2) and 75 of Additional Protocol I, article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
and articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In some 
cases the Mission additionally concluded that the attack was also launched with the 
intention of spreading terror among the civilian population. Moreover, in several of the 
incidents investigated, the Israeli armed forces not only did not use their best efforts to 
permit humanitarian organizations access to the wounded and medical relief, as required 
by customary international law reflected in article 10 (2) of Additional Protocol I, but they 
arbitrarily withheld such access.  
</b></p>
<p>1922. <b>With regard to one incident investigated, involving the death of at least 35 
Palestinians, the Mission finds that the Israeli armed forces launched an attack which a 
reasonable commander would have expected to cause excessive loss of civilian life in 
relation to the military advantage sought, in violation of customary international 
humanitarian law as reflected in Additional Protocol I, articles 57 (2) (a) (ii) and (iii). The 
Mission finds a violation of the right to life (ICCPR, article 6) of the civilians killed in this 
incident. 
</b></p>
<p>1923. <b>The Mission also concludes that Israel, by deliberately attacking police stations and 
killing large numbers of policemen (99 in the incidents investigated by the Mission) during 
the first minutes of the military operations, failed to respect the principle of proportionality 
between the military advantage anticipated by killing some policemen who might have 
been members of Palestinian armed groups and the loss of civilian life (the majority of 
policemen and members of the public present in the police stations or nearby during the 
attack). Therefore, these were disproportionate attacks in violation of customary 
international law. The Mission finds a violation of the right to life (ICCPR, article 6) of the 
policemen killed in these attacks who were not members of Palestinian armed groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Certain weapons used by the Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>1924. <b>In relation to the weapons used by the Israeli armed forces during military 
operations, the Mission accepts that white phosphorous, flechettes and heavy metal (such 
as tungsten) are not currently proscribed under international law. Their use is, however, 
restricted or even prohibited in certain circumstances by virtue of the principles of 
proportionality and precautions necessary in the attack. Flechettes, as an area weapon, are 
particularly unsuitable for use in urban settings, while, in the Mission's view, the use of 
white phosphorous as an obscurant at least should be banned because of the number and 
variety of hazards that attach to the use of such a pyrophoric chemical. </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>(d) Treatment of Palestinians in the hands of the Israeli armed forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Use of human shields   
</b></p>
<p>1925. <b>The Mission investigated several incidents in which the Israeli armed forces used 
local Palestinian residents to enter houses which might be booby-trapped or harbour 
enemy combatants (this practice, known in the West Bank as &#8220;neighbour procedure&#8221;, was 
called &#8220;Johnnie procedure&#8221; during the military operations in Gaza). The Mission found 
that the practice constitutes the use of human shields prohibited by international 
humanitarian law. It further constitutes a violation of the right to life, protected in article 6 
of ICCPR, and of the prohibition against cruel and inhuman treatment in its article 7.  
</b></p>
<p>1926. <b>The questioning of Palestinian civilians under threat of death or injury to extract 
information about Hamas and Palestinian combatants and tunnels constitutes a violation of 
article 31 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits physical or moral coercion 
against protected persons.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Detention 
</b></p>
<p>1927. <b>The Mission found that the Israeli armed forces in Gaza rounded up and detained 
large groups of persons protected under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Mission finds 
that their detention cannot be justified either as detention of &#8220;unlawful combatants&#8221; or as 
internment of civilians for imperative reasons of security. The Mission considers that the 
severe beatings, constant humiliating and degrading treatment and detention in foul 
conditions allegedly suffered by individuals in the Gaza Strip under the control of the 
Israeli armed forces and in detention in Israel, constitute a failure to treat protected 
persons humanely in violation of article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as 
violations of articles 7 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
regarding torture and the treatment of persons in detention, and of its article 14 with 
regard to due process guarantees. The treatment of women during detention was contrary 
to the special respect for women required under customary law as reflected in the article 76 
of Additional Protocol I. The Mission finds that the rounding-up of large groups of civilians 
and their prolonged detention under the circumstances described in this report constitute a 
collective penalty on those persons in violation of article 33 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and article 50 of the Hague Regulations. Such treatment amounts to measures 
of intimidation or terror prohibited by article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Destruction of property 
</b></p>
<p>1928. <b>The Mission finds that the attacks against the Palestinian Legislative Council 
building and the main prison in Gaza constituted deliberate attacks on civilian objects in 
violation of the rule of customary international humanitarian law whereby attacks must be 
strictly limited to military objectives. 
</b></p>
<p>1929. <b>The Mission also finds that the Israeli armed forces unlawfully and wantonly 
attacked and destroyed without military necessity a number of food production or food-
processing objects and facilities (including mills, land and greenhouses), drinking-water 
installations, farms and animals in violation of the principle of distinction. From the facts </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>ascertained by it, the Mission finds that this destruction was carried out with the purpose 
of denying sustenance to the civilian population, in violation of customary law reflected in 
article 54 (2) of the First Additional Protocol. The Mission further concludes that the 
Israeli armed forces carried out widespread destruction of private residential houses, water 
wells and water tanks unlawfully and wantonly.   
</b></p>
<p>1930. <b>In addition to being violations of international humanitarian law, these extensive 
wanton acts of destruction amount to violations of Israel&#8217;s duties to respect the right to an 
adequate standard of living of the people in the Gaza Strip, which includes the rights to 
food, water and housing, as well as the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 
protected under articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Impact of the blockade and the military operations on the Gaza population 
</b></p>
<p>1931. <b>The Mission concludes that the blockade policies implemented by Israel against the 
Gaza Strip, in particular the closure of or restrictions imposed on border crossings in the 
immediate period before the military operations, subjected the local population to extreme 
hardship and deprivations that amounted to a violation of Israel&#8217;s obligations as an 
occupying Power under the Fourth Geneva Convention. These measures led to a severe 
deterioration and regression in the levels of realization of economic and social rights of 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and weakened its social and economic fabric, leaving health, 
education, sanitation and other essential services in a very vulnerable position to cope with 
the immediate effects of the military operations.  
</b></p>
<p>1932. <b>The Mission finds that, despite the information circulated by Israel about the 
humanitarian relief schemes in place during the military operations, Israel has essentially 
violated its obligation to allow free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital 
objects, food and clothing that were needed to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the 
civilian population in the context of the military operations, which is in violation of article 
23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>1933. <b>In addition to the above general findings, the Mission also considers that Israel has 
violated its specific obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, including 
the rights to peace and security, free movement, livelihood and health.  
</b></p>
<p>1934. <b>The Mission concludes that the conditions resulting from deliberate actions of the 
Israeli armed forces and the declared policies of the Government with regard to the Gaza 
Strip before, during and after the military operation cumulatively indicate the intention to 
inflict collective punishment on the people of the Gaza Strip. The Mission, therefore, finds 
a violation of the provisions of article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and acts raising individual criminal 
responsibility under international criminal law 
</b></p>
<p>1935. <b>From the facts gathered, the Mission found that the following grave breaches of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention were committed by the Israeli armed forces in Gaza: wilful </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>killing, torture or inhuman treatment, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to 
body or health, and extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity 
and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. As grave breaches these acts give rise to 
individual criminal responsibility. The Mission notes that the use of human shields also 
constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</b></p>
<p>1936. <b>The Mission further considers that the series of acts that deprive Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their 
freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country, that limit their 
rights to access a court of law and an effective remedy, could lead a competent court to find 
that the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity, has been committed.  
</b></p>
<p><b>2. Actions by Israel in the West Bank in the context of the military operations  
in Gaza from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli security forces, including use 
of excessive or lethal force during demonstrations 
</b></p>
<p>1937. <b>With regard to acts of violence by settlers against Palestinians, the Mission concludes 
that Israel has failed to fulfil its international obligations to protect the Palestinians from 
violence by private individuals under both international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law. In some instances security forces acquiesced to the acts of 
violence in violation of the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
When this acquiescence occurs only in respect of violence against Palestinians by settlers 
and not vice versa, it would amount to discrimination on the basis of national origin, 
prohibited under ICCPR.    
</b></p>
<p>1938. <b>Israel also violated a series of human rights by unlawfully repressing peaceful public 
demonstrations and using excessive force against demonstrators. The use of firearms, 
including live ammunitions, and the use of snipers resulting in the death of demonstrators 
are a violation of article 6 of ICCPR as an arbitrary deprivation of life and, in the 
circumstances examined by the Mission, appear to indicate an intention or at least a 
recklessness towards causing harm to civilians which may amount to wilful killing. 
</b></p>
<p>1939. <b>Excessive use of force that resulted in injury rather than death constitutes violations 
of a number of standards, including articles 7 and 9 of ICCPR. These violations are 
compounded by the seemingly discriminatory &#8220;open fire regulations&#8221; for security forces 
dealing with demonstrations, based on the presence of persons with a particular 
nationality, violating the principle of non-discrimination in ICCPR (art. 2) as well as under 
article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.   
</b></p>
<p>1940. <b>The Mission finds that Israel failed to investigate, and when appropriate prosecute, 
acts by its agents or by third parties involving serious violations of international 
humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>1941. <b>The Mission was alarmed at the reported increase in settler violence in the past year 
and the failure of the Israeli security forces to prevent settlers&#8217; attacks against Palestinian 
civilians and their property. These are accompanied by a series of violations by Israeli </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>forces or acquiesced by them, including the removal of residential status from Palestinians, 
which could eventually lead to a situation of virtual deportation and entail additional 
violations of other rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Detention of Palestinians by Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1942. <b>The Mission analysed information it received on the detention of Palestinians in 
Israeli prisons during or in the context of the military operations of December 2008&#8211;
January 2009 and found those practices generally inconsistent with human rights and 
international humanitarian law. The military court system to which Palestinians from the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory are subjected deprives them of due process guarantees in 
keeping with international law. 
</b></p>
<p>1943. <b>The Mission finds that the detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative 
Council by Israel violates the right not to be arbitrarily detained, as protected by article 9 
of ICCPR. Insofar as it is based on political affiliation and prevents those members from 
participating in the conduct of public affairs, it is also in violation of its articles 25 
recognizing the right to take part in public affairs and 26, which provides for the right to 
equal protection under the law. Insofar as their detention is unrelated to their individual 
behaviour, it constitutes collective punishment, prohibited by article 33 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention. Information on the detention of large numbers of children and their 
treatment by Israeli security forces point to violations of their rights under ICCPR and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Violations of the right to free movement and access  
</b></p>
<p>1944. <b>The Mission finds that the extensive restrictions imposed by Israel on the movement 
and access of Palestinians in the West Bank are disproportionate to any legitimate 
objective served and in violation of article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and article 
12 of ICCPR, guaranteeing freedom of movement.  
</b></p>
<p>1945. <b>Where checkpoints become a site of humiliation of the protected population by 
military or civilian operators, this may entail a violation of the customary law rule reflected 
in article 75 (2) (b) of Additional Protocol I. 
</b></p>
<p>1946. <b>The continued construction of settlements in occupied territory constitutes a 
violation of article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The extensive destruction and 
appropriation of property, including land confiscation and house demolitions in the West 
Bank, including East Jerusalem, not justified by military necessity and carried out 
unlawfully and wantonly, amounts to a grave breach under article 147 of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>1947. <b>Insofar as movement and access restrictions, the settlements and their 
infrastructure, demographic policies vis-&#224;-vis Jerusalem and &#8220;Area C&#8221; of the West Bank, 
as well as the separation of Gaza from the West Bank, prevent a viable, contiguous and 
sovereign Palestinian State from arising, they are in violation of the <i>jus cogens</i> right to self-
determination.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Actions by Israel in Israel 
</b></p>
<p>1948. <b>In relation to alleged violations within Israel, the Mission concludes that, although 
there does not appear to be a policy in this respect, there were occasions when reportedly 
the authorities placed obstacles in the way of protesters seeking to exercise their right to 
peaceful assembly and freedom of speech to criticize Israel&#8217;s military actions in the Gaza 
Strip. These rights are protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Instances of physical violence against protesters and other humiliations, not rising 
to the level of physical violence, of the protesters by the police violated Israel&#8217;s obligations 
under article 10 of the Covenant. The Mission is also concerned about activists being 
compelled to attend interviews with the General Security Services (<i>Shabak</i>), which 
reportedly creates an atmosphere intolerant of dissent within Israel. Hostile retaliatory 
actions against civil society organizations by the Government of Israel for criticisms of the 
Israeli authorities and for exposing alleged violations of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law during the military operations are inconsistent with 
the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. 
</b></p>
<p>1949. <b>The Mission finds that the imposition of a near blanket exclusion of the media and 
human rights monitors from Gaza since 5 November 2008 and throughout the operations is 
inconsistent with Israel&#8217;s obligations with regard to the right to access to information.   
</b></p>
<p><b>4. Actions by Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>1950. <b>In relation to the firing of rockets and mortars into southern Israel by Palestinian 
armed groups operating in the Gaza Strip, the Mission finds that the Palestinian armed 
groups fail to distinguish between military targets and the civilian population and civilian 
objects in southern Israel. The launching of rockets and mortars which cannot be aimed 
with sufficient precisions at military targets breaches the fundamental principle of 
distinction. Where there is no intended military target and the rockets and mortars are 
launched into civilian areas, they constitute a deliberate attack against the civilian 
population. These actions would constitute war crimes and may amount to crimes against 
humanity. 
</b></p>
<p>1951. <b>The Mission concludes that the rocket and mortars attacks, launched by Palestinian 
armed groups operating from Gaza, have caused terror in the affected communities of 
southern Israel. The attacks have caused loss of life and physical and mental injury to 
civilians as well as damaging private houses, religious buildings and property, and eroded 
the economic and cultural life of the affected communities and severely affected economic 
and social rights of the population. 
</b></p>
<p>1952. <b>With regard to the continuing detention of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, the Mission 
finds that, as a soldier who belongs to the Israeli armed forces and who was captured 
during an enemy incursion into Israel, Gilad Shalit meets the requirements for prisoner-of-
war status under the Third Geneva Convention and should be protected, treated humanely 
and be allowed external communication as appropriate according to that Convention.   </b></p>

 <p> 
1953. <b>The Mission also examined whether the Palestinian armed groups complied with 
their obligations under international humanitarian law to take constant care to minimize 
the risk of harm to the civilian population in Gaza among whom the hostilities were being 
conducted. The conduct of hostilities in built-up areas does not, of itself, constitute a 
violation of international law. However, launching attacks &#8211; whether of rockets and 
mortars at the population of southern Israel or at the Israeli armed forces inside Gaza &#8211; 
close to civilian or protected buildings constitutes a failure to take all feasible precautions. 
In cases where this occurred, the Palestinian armed groups would have unnecessarily 
exposed the civilian population of Gaza to the inherent dangers of the military operations 
taking place around them. The Mission found no evidence to suggest that Palestinian 
armed groups either directed civilians to areas where attacks were being launched or that 
they forced civilians to remain within the vicinity of the attacks. The Mission also found no 
evidence that members of Palestinian armed groups engaged in combat in civilian dress. 
Although in the one incident of an Israeli attack on a mosque it investigated the Mission 
found that there was no indication that that mosque was used for military purposes or to 
shield military activities, the Mission cannot exclude that this might have occurred in other 
cases.  
</b></p>
<p><b>5. Actions by responsible Palestinian authorities 
</b></p>
<p>1954. <b>Although the Gaza authorities deny any control over armed groups and 
responsibility for their acts, in the Mission&#8217;s view, if they failed to take the necessary 
measures to prevent the Palestinian armed groups from endangering the civilian 
population, the Gaza authorities would bear responsibility for the damage arising to the 
civilians living in Gaza.  
</b></p>
<p>1955. <b>The Mission finds that security services under the control of the Gaza authorities 
carried out extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, detentions and ill-treatment of 
people, in particular political opponents, which constitute serious violations of the human 
rights to life, to liberty and security of the person, to freedom from torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to be protected against arbitrary arrest 
and detention, to a fair and impartial legal proceeding; and to freedom of opinion and 
expression, including freedom to hold opinions without interference.  
</b></p>
<p>1956. <b>The Mission also concludes that the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s actions against political 
opponents in the West Bank, which started in January 2006 and intensified during the 
period between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, constitute violations of human 
rights and of the Palestinians&#8217; own Basic Law. Detentions on political grounds violate the 
rights to liberty and security of person, to a fair trial and the right not to be discriminated 
against on the basis of one&#8217;s political opinion, which are all part of customary international 
law. Reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment during arrest and detention and of 
death in detention require prompt investigation and accountability.  
</b></p>
<p><b>K.  The need for accountability 
</b></p>
<p>1957. <b>The Mission was struck by the repeated comment of Palestinian victims, human 
rights defenders, civil society interlocutors and officials that they hoped that this would be 
the last investigative mission of its kind, because action for justice would follow from it. It </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>was struck, as well, by the comment that every time a report is published and no action 
follows, this &#8220;emboldens Israel and her conviction of being untouchable&#8221;. To deny modes of 
accountability reinforces impunity, and tarnishes the credibility of the United Nations and 
of the international community. The Mission believes these comments ought to be at the 
forefront in the consideration by Members States and United Nations bodies of its findings 
and recommendations and action consequent upon them. 
</b></p>
<p>1958. <b>The Mission is firmly convinced that justice and respect for the rule of law are the 
indispensable basis for peace. The prolonged situation of impunity has created a justice 
crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that warrants action.  
</b></p>
<p>1959. <b>After reviewing Israel&#8217;s system of investigation and prosecution of serious violations 
of human rights and humanitarian law, in particular of suspected war crimes and crimes 
against humanity, the Mission found major structural flaws that, in its view, make the 
system inconsistent with international standards. With military &#8220;operational debriefings&#8221; 
at the core of the system, there is no effective and impartial investigation mechanism and 
victims of such alleged violations are deprived of any effective or prompt remedy. 
Furthermore, such investigations, being internal to the Israeli military authority, do not 
comply with international standards of independence and impartiality. The Mission 
believes that the few investigations conducted by the Israeli authorities on alleged serious 
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and, in particular, alleged 
war crimes, in the context of the military operations in Gaza between 27 December 2008 
and 18 January 2009, are affected by the defects in the system, have been unduly delayed 
despite the gravity of the allegations, and, therefore, lack the required credibility and 
conformity with international standards. The Mission is concerned that investigations of 
relatively less serious violations that the Government of Israel claims to be investigating 
have also been unduly protracted.  
</b></p>
<p>1960. <b>The Mission noted the pattern of delays, inaction or otherwise unsatisfactory 
handling by Israeli authorities of investigations, prosecutions and convictions of military 
personnel and settlers for violence and offences against Palestinians, including in the West 
Bank, as well as their discriminatory outcome. Additionally, the current constitutional and 
legal framework in Israel provides very few possibilities, if any, for Palestinians to seek 
compensation and reparations. 
</b></p>
<p>1961. <b>In the light of the information it reviewed and its analysis, the Mission concludes that 
there are serious doubts about the willingness of Israel to carry out genuine investigations 
in an impartial, independent, prompt and effective way as required by international law. 
The Mission is also of the view that the system presents inherently discriminatory features 
that make the pursuit of justice for Palestinian victims extremely difficult. 
</b></p>
<p>1962. <b>With regard to allegations of violations of international humanitarian law falling 
within the jurisdiction of responsible Palestinian authorities in Gaza, the Mission finds that 
these allegations have not been investigated.  
</b></p>
<p>1963. <b>The Mission notes that the responsibility to investigate violations of international 
human rights and humanitarian law, prosecute if appropriate and try perpetrators belongs 
in the first place to domestic authorities and institutions. This is a legal obligation </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>incumbent on States and State-like entities. However, where domestic authorities are 
unable or unwilling to comply with this obligation, international justice mechanisms must 
be activated to prevent impunity.  
</b></p>
<p>1964. <b>The Mission believes that, in the circumstances, there is little potential for 
accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law 
through domestic institutions in Israel and even less in Gaza. The Mission is of the view 
that long-standing impunity has been a key factor in the perpetuation of violence in the 
region and in the reoccurrence of violations, as well as in the erosion of confidence among 
Palestinians and many Israelis concerning prospects for justice and a peaceful solution to 
the conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>1965. <b>The Mission considers that several of the violations referred to in this report amount 
to grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It notes that there is a duty imposed 
by the Geneva Conventions on all high contracting parties to search for and bring before 
their courts those responsible for the alleged violations. 
</b></p>
<p>1966. <b>The Mission considers that the serious violations of international humanitarian law 
recounted in this report fall within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the International 
Criminal Court. The Mission notes that the United Nations Security Council has long 
recognized the impact of the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian 
question, on international peace and security, and that it regularly considers and reviews 
this situation. The Mission is persuaded that, in the light of the long-standing nature of the 
conflict, the frequent and consistent allegations of violations of international humanitarian 
law against all parties, the apparent increase in intensity of such violations in the recent 
military operations, and the regrettable possibility of a return to further violence, 
meaningful and practical steps to end impunity for such violations would offer an effective 
way to deter such violations recurring in the future. The Mission is of the view that the 
prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law 
would contribute to ending such violations, to the protection of civilians and to the 
restoration and maintenance of peace. 
</b></p>
<p><b>XXXI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>1967. <b>The Mission makes the following recommendations related to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Reparations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Serious violations of human rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The blockade and reconstruction; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The use of weapons and military procedures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The protection of human rights organizations and defenders;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Follow-up to the Mission&#8217;s recommendations. </b></p>

 <p> 
1968. <b>To the Human Rights Council, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that the United Nations Human Rights Council 
should endorse the recommendations contained in this report, take appropriate action to 
implement them as recommended by the Mission and through other means as it may deem 
appropriate, and continue to review their implementation in future sessions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In view of the gravity of the violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law and possible war crimes and crimes against humanity that it has 
reported, the Mission recommends that the United Nations Human Rights Council should 
request the United Nations Secretary-General to bring this report to the attention of the 
United Nations Security Council under Article 99 of the Charter of the United Nations so 
that the Security Council may consider action according to the Mission&#8217;s relevant 
recommendations below; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Mission further recommends that the United Nations Human Rights 
Council should formally submit this report to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
Court; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Mission recommends that the Human Rights Council should submit this 
report to the General Assembly with a request that it should be considered;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Mission recommends that the Human Rights Council should bring the 
Mission&#8217;s recommendations to the attention of the relevant United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies so that they may include review of progress in their implementation, as may 
be relevant to their mandate and procedures, in their periodic review of compliance by 
Israel with its human rights obligations. The Mission further recommends that the Human 
Rights Council should consider review of progress as part of its universal periodic review 
process.  
</b></p>
<p>1969. <b>To the United Nations Security Council, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that the Security Council should require the 
Government of Israel, under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) To take all appropriate steps, within a period of three months, to launch 
appropriate investigations that are independent and in conformity with 
international standards, into the serious violations of international 
humanitarian and international human rights law reported by the 
Mission and any other serious allegations that might come to its attention; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) To inform the Security Council, within a further period of three months, 
of actions taken, or in process of being taken, by the Government of Israel 
to inquire into, investigate and prosecute such serious violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission further recommends that the Security Council should at the same 
time establish an independent committee of experts in international humanitarian and 
human rights law to monitor and report on any domestic legal or other proceedings 
undertaken by the Government of Israel in relation to the aforesaid investigations. Such </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>committee of experts should report at the end of the six-month period to the Security 
Council on its assessment of relevant domestic proceedings initiated by the Government of 
Israel, including their progress, effectiveness and genuineness, so that the Security Council 
may assess whether appropriate action to ensure justice for victims and accountability for 
perpetrators has been or is being taken at the domestic level. The Security Council should 
request the committee to report to it at determined intervals, as may be necessary. The 
committee should be appropriately supported by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Mission recommends that, upon receipt of the committee&#8217;s report, the 
Security Council should consider the situation and, in the absence of good-faith 
investigations that are independent and in conformity with international standards having 
been undertaken or being under way within six months of the date of its resolution under 
Article 40 by the appropriate authorities of the State of Israel, again acting under Chapter 
VII of the Charter of the United Nations, refer the situation in Gaza to the Prosecutor of 
the International Criminal Court pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Mission recommends that the Security Council should require the 
independent committee of experts referred to in subparagraph (b) to monitor and report 
on any domestic legal or other proceedings undertaken by the relevant authorities in the 
Gaza Strip in relation to the aforesaid investigations. The committee should report at the 
end of the six-month period to the Security Council on its assessment of relevant domestic 
proceedings initiated by the relevant authorities in Gaza, including their progress, 
effectiveness and genuineness, so that the Security Council may assess whether appropriate 
action to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators has been taken or is 
being taken at the domestic level. The Security Council should request the committee to 
report to it at determined intervals, as may be necessary;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Mission recommends that, upon receipt of the committee&#8217;s report, the 
Security Council should consider the situation and, in the absence of good-faith 
investigations that are independent and in conformity with international standards having 
been undertaken or being under way within six months of the date of its resolution under 
Article 40 by the appropriate authorities in Gaza, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter 
of the United Nations, refer the situation in Gaza to the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The Mission recommends that lack of cooperation by the Government of Israel 
or the Gaza authorities with the work of the committee should be regarded by the Security 
Council to be obstruction of the work of the committee. 
</b></p>
<p>1970. <b>To the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, with reference to the 
declaration under article 12 (3) received by the Office of the Prosecutor of the 
International Criminal Court from the Government of Palestine, the Mission considers 
that accountability for victims and the interests of peace and justice in the region require 
that the Prosecutor should make the required legal determination as expeditiously as 
possible.  
</b></p>
<p>1971. <b>To the General Assembly, </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that the General Assembly should request the 
Security Council to report to it on measures taken with regard to ensuring accountability 
for serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in relation to the 
facts in this report and any other relevant facts in the context of the military operations in 
Gaza, including the implementation of the Mission&#8217;s recommendations. The General 
Assembly may remain appraised of the matter until it is satisfied that appropriate action is 
taken at the domestic or international level in order to ensure justice for victims and 
accountability for perpetrators. The General Assembly may consider whether additional 
action within its powers is required in the interests of justice, including under its resolution 
377 (V) on uniting for peace; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission recommends that the General Assembly should establish an 
escrow fund to be used to pay adequate compensation to Palestinians who have suffered 
loss and damage as a result of unlawful acts attributable to Israel during the December&#8211;
January military operation and actions in connection with it, and that the Government of 
Israel should pay the required amounts into such fund. The Mission further recommends 
that the General Assembly should ask the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide expert advice on the appropriate modalities to establish the 
escrow fund; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Mission recommends that the General Assembly should ask the 
Government of Switzerland to convene a conference of the high contracting parties to the 
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 on measures to enforce the Convention in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and to ensure its respect in accordance with its article 1;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Mission recommends that the General Assembly should promote an urgent 
discussion on the future legality of the use of certain munitions referred to in this report, 
and in particular white phosphorous, flechettes and heavy metal such as tungsten. In such 
discussion the General Assembly should draw inter alia on the expertise of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The Mission further recommends that 
the Government of Israel should undertake a moratorium on the use of such weapons in 
the light of the human suffering and damage they have caused in the Gaza Strip. 
</b></p>
<p>1972. <b>To the State of Israel,  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that Israel should immediately cease the border 
closures and restrictions on passage through border crossings with the Gaza Strip and 
allow the passage of goods necessary and sufficient to meet the needs of the population, for 
the recovery and reconstruction of housing and essential services, and for the resumption 
of meaningful economic activity in the Gaza Strip; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission recommends that Israel should cease the restrictions on access to 
the sea for fishing purposes imposed on the Gaza Strip and allow such fishing activities 
within the 20 nautical miles as provided for in the Oslo Accords. It further recommends 
that Israel should allow the resumption of agricultural activity within the Gaza Strip, 
including within areas in the vicinity of the borders with Israel;  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Israel should initiate a review of the rules of engagement, standard operating 
procedures, open fire regulations and other guidance for military and security personnel. 
The Mission recommends that Israel should avail itself of the expertise of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and other relevant bodies, and Israeli experts, civil society organizations 
with the relevant expertise and specialization, in order to ensure compliance in this respect 
with international humanitarian law and international human rights law. In particular 
such rules of engagement should ensure that the principles of proportionality, distinction, 
precaution and non-discrimination are effectively integrated in all such guidance and in 
any oral briefings provided to officers, soldiers and security forces, so as to avoid the 
recurrence of Palestinian civilian deaths, destruction and affronts on human dignity in 
violation of international law;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Mission recommends that Israel should allow freedom of movement for 
Palestinians within the Occupied Palestinian Territory - within the West Bank, including 
East Jerusalem, between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and between the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory and the outside world - in accordance with international human 
rights standards and international commitments entered into by Israel and the 
representatives of the Palestinian people. The Mission further recommends that Israel 
should forthwith lift travel bans currently placed on Palestinians by reason of their human 
rights or political activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Mission recommends that Israel should release Palestinians who are 
detained in Israeli prisons in connection with the occupation. The release of children 
should be an utmost priority. The Mission further recommends that Israel should cease the 
discriminatory treatment of Palestinian detainees. Family visits for prisoners from Gaza 
should resume;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The Mission recommends that Israel should forthwith cease interference with 
national political processes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and as a first step release 
all members of the Palestinian Legislative Council currently in detention and allow all 
members of the Council to move between Gaza and the West Bank so that it may resume 
functioning;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The Mission recommends that the Government of Israel should cease actions 
aimed at limiting the expression of criticism by civil society and members of the public 
concerning Israel&#8217;s policies and conduct during the military operations in the Gaza Strip. 
The Mission also recommends that Israel should set up an independent inquiry to assess 
whether the treatment by Israeli judicial authorities of Palestinian and Jewish Israelis 
expressing dissent in connection with the offensive was discriminatory, in terms of both 
charges and detention pending trial. The results of the inquiry should be made public and, 
subject to the findings, appropriate remedial action should be taken; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) The Mission recommends that the Government of Israel should refrain from 
any action of reprisal against Palestinian and Israeli individuals and organizations that 
have cooperated with the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, in 
particular individuals who have appeared at the public hearings held by the Mission in 
Gaza and Geneva and expressed criticism of actions by Israel;   </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(i) The Mission recommends that Israel should reiterate its commitment to 
respecting the inviolability of United Nations premises and personnel and that it should 
undertake all appropriate measures to ensure that there is no repetition of violations in the 
future. It further recommends that reparation to the United Nations should be provided 
fully and without further delay by Israel, and that the General Assembly should consider 
this matter.  
</b></p>
<p>1973. <b>To Palestinian armed groups, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that Palestinian armed groups should undertake 
forthwith to respect international humanitarian law, in particular by renouncing attacks 
on Israeli civilians and civilian objects, and take all feasible precautionary measures to 
avoid harm to Palestinian civilians during hostilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission recommends that Palestinian armed groups who hold Israeli 
soldier Gilad Shalit in detention should release him on humanitarian grounds. Pending 
such release they should recognize his status as prisoner of war, treat him as such, and 
allow him ICRC visits.   
</b></p>
<p>1974. <b>To responsible Palestinian authorities,  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that the Palestinian Authority should issue clear 
instructions to security forces under its command to abide by human rights norms as 
enshrined in the Palestinian Basic Law and international instruments, ensure prompt and 
independent investigation of all allegations of serious human rights violations by security 
forces under its control, and end resort to military justice to deal with cases involving 
civilians; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission recommends that the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza 
authorities should release without delay all political detainees currently in their power and 
refrain from further arrests on political grounds and in violation of international human 
rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Mission recommends that the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza 
authorities should continue to enable the free and independent operation of Palestinian 
non-governmental organizations, including human rights organizations, and of the 
Independent Commission for Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>1975. <b>To the international community, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that the States parties to the Geneva Conventions of 
1949 should start criminal investigations in national courts, using universal jurisdiction, 
where there is sufficient evidence of the commission of grave breaches of the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949. Where so warranted following investigation, alleged perpetrators 
should be arrested and prosecuted in accordance with internationally recognized standards 
of justice; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) International aid providers should step up financial and technical assistance 
for organizations providing psychological support and mental health services to the 
Palestinian population;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In view of their crucial function, the Mission recommends that donor 
countries/assistance providers should continue to support the work of Palestinian and 
Israeli human rights organizations in documenting and publicly reporting on violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law, and advising relevant authorities on 
their compliance with international law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Mission recommends that States involved in peace negotiations between 
Israel and representatives of the Palestinian people, especially the Quartet, should ensure 
that respect for the rule of law, international law and human rights assumes a central role 
in internationally sponsored peace initiatives;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) In view of the allegations and reports about long-term environmental damage 
that may have been created by certain munitions or debris from munitions, the Mission 
recommends that a programme of environmental monitoring should take place under the 
auspices of the United Nations, for as long as deemed necessary. The programme should 
include the Gaza Strip and areas within southern Israel close to impact sites. The 
environmental monitoring programme should be in accordance with the recommendations 
of an independent body, and samples and analyses should be analysed by one or more 
independent expert institutions. Such recommendations, at least at the outset, should 
include measurement mechanisms which address the fears of the population of Gaza and 
southern Israel at this time and should at a minimum be in a position to determine the 
presences of heavy metals of all varieties, white phosphorous, tungsten micro-shrapnel and 
granules and such other chemicals as may be revealed by the investigation.  
</b></p>
<p>1976. <b>To the international community and responsible Palestinian authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that appropriate mechanisms should be established 
to ensure that the funds pledged by international donors for reconstruction activities in the 
Gaza Strip are smoothly and efficiently disbursed, and urgently put to use for the benefit of 
the population of Gaza; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In view of the consequences of the military operations, the Mission 
recommends that responsible Palestinian authorities as well as international aid providers 
should pay special attention to the needs of persons with disabilities. In addition, the 
Mission recommends that medical follow-up should be ensured by relevant international 
and Palestinian structures with regard to patients who suffered amputations or were 
otherwise injured by munitions, the nature of which has not been clarified, in order to 
monitor any possible long-term impact on their health. Financial and technical assistance 
should be provided to ensure adequate medical follow-up to Palestinian patients. 
</b></p>
<p>1977. <b>To the international community, Israel and Palestinian authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that Israel and representatives of the Palestinian 
people, and international actors involved in the peace process, should involve Israeli and </b></p>

 <p> 
<b>Palestinian civil society in devising sustainable peace agreements based on respect for 
international law. The participation of women should be ensured in accordance with 
Security Council resolution 1325 (2000);  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission recommends that attention should be given to the position of 
women and steps be taken to ensure their access to compensation, legal assistance and 
economic security. 
</b></p>
<p>1978. <b>To the United Nations Secretary-General, the Mission recommends that the 
Secretary-General should develop a policy to integrate human rights in peace initiatives in 
which the United Nations is involved, especially the Quartet, and request the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide the expertise required to 
implement this recommendation. 
</b></p>
<p>1979. <b>To the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Mission recommends that the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights should monitor the situation of persons who have 
cooperated with the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict and 
periodically update the Human Rights Council through its public reports and in other ways 
as it may deem appropriate; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Mission recommends that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights should give attention to the Mission&#8217;s recommendations in its periodic reporting on 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the Human Rights Council. </b></p>
