<p><b>  19</b>/&#8230;  <b>Rights of persons with disabilities: participation in political and 
public life 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
</p>
<p>all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be 
</p>
<p>guaranteed the full enjoyment of their rights and freedoms without discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the rights 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities, the most recent of which was resolution 16/15 of 24 March 
</p>
<p>2011, and welcoming the efforts of all stakeholders to implement these resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>further </i>the right to participate in political and public life, as set out in 
</p>
<p>article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that everyone has the 
</p>
<p>right to take part in the Government of his or her country directly, or through freely chosen 
</p>
<p>representatives, and the right of equal access to public service, as well as, inter alia, article 
</p>
<p>25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, most recently and with 
</p>
<p>regard to persons with disabilities, in article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
*
 Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recalling</i> that the above-mentioned article 29 of the Convention reaffirms the rights 
</p>
<p>of persons with disabilities in their participation in political and public life and that parties 
</p>
<p>to the Convention are required to guarantee political rights to persons with disabilities and 
</p>
<p>adopt all appropriate measures to ensure that they enjoy these rights on an equal basis with 
</p>
<p>others,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that progress has been made, yet deeply concerned that many persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities in all regions continue to be denied their right to participate in political and 
</p>
<p>public life on an equal basis with others, and noting that the exclusion or restriction of 
</p>
<p>political rights of persons with disabilities on the basis of disability constitutes 
</p>
<p>discrimination contrary to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasising</i> that full and effective participation and inclusion in society is a general 
</p>
<p>principle of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and thus that 
</p>
<p>participation in political and public life on an equal basis with others is closely interrelated 
</p>
<p>with and interdependent on other Convention provisions, including those that require States 
</p>
<p>parties to ensure non-discrimination and accessibility and to recognize legal capacity and 
</p>
<p>the right to participate in the community on an equal basis with others,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination, including in their participation in political and public life,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the fact that, to date, 153 States have signed and 109 States and 
</p>
<p>one regional integration organization have ratified or acceded to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and that 90 States have signed and 66 States have 
</p>
<p>ratified or acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention, and calls upon those States 
</p>
<p>and regional integration organizations that have not yet ratified or acceded to the 
</p>
<p>Convention and the Optional Protocol to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> States that have ratified the Convention and have submitted one 
</p>
<p>or more reservations to it to initiate a process to review regularly the effect and continued 
</p>
<p>relevance of such reservations, and to consider the possibility of withdrawing them;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the thematic study on participation in political and public life by 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights,1 and calls upon all stakeholders to consider the findings and 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the study; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities can 
</p>
<p>effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p>including the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and be elected, and 
</p>
<p>to participate in the conduct of public affairs; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> States parties to adopt and implement appropriate measures 
</p>
<p>to ensure that persons with disabilities can participate effectively and fully in political and 
</p>
<p>public life on an equal basis with others, including by, inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Providing persons with disabilities with access to the support they may 
</p>
<p>require in exercising their legal capacity and, where necessary, and at their request, 
</p>
<p>allowing assistance in voting by a person of their own choice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Providing reasonable accommodation and eliminating barriers that prevent or 
</p>
<p>limit effective and full participation in political and public life, including physical and 
</p>
<p>communication barriers, such as inaccessible polling stations or the lack of election 
</p>
<p>information or materials in an accessible format; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p> (<i>c</i>) Protecting the right to vote by secret ballot and the right to stand for elections 
</p>
<p>and to effectively hold office, and to have access to public service positions, including by 
</p>
<p>providing reasonable forms of accommodation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Promoting public awareness campaigns and training programmes relevant to 
</p>
<p>the exercise of political rights by persons with disabilities and ensuring an inclusive 
</p>
<p>education system directed to, inter alia, the strengthening of respect for human rights, 
</p>
<p>including political rights;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Adopting measures to encourage the active involvement of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in non-governmental organizations and associations concerned with public and 
</p>
<p>political life, including political parties, community-based organizations and public boards, 
</p>
<p>as well as the forming and joining of organizations of persons with disabilities at the local, 
</p>
<p>regional, national and international levels; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Further calls upon</i> States parties to ensure that measures to assist persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities in their participation in political and public life are consistent with the 
</p>
<p>Convention, including the general principle of inclusion in society; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges</i> States parties to review any existing exclusion or restriction of 
</p>
<p>political rights for persons with disabilities, including those persons with psychosocial, 
</p>
<p>mental or intellectual disabilities, and to take all appropriate measures, including 
</p>
<p>legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that 
</p>
<p>constitute discrimination against persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties, in adopting and implementing measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>that persons with disabilities have the opportunity to participate effectively and fully in 
</p>
<p>political and public life, including the conduct of public affairs on an equal basis with 
</p>
<p>others, to consult closely with and actively involve persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls upon</i> States and invites other relevant stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>national monitoring mechanisms, to collect appropriate information, including statistical 
</p>
<p>and research data, to allow for the formulation and implementation of policies relating to 
</p>
<p>the participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant actors in the design of products, environments, 
</p>
<p>programmes and services relating to participation in political and public life to pay due 
</p>
<p>attention to universal design, which requires the consideration of the needs of all members 
</p>
<p>of society in order to avoid the need for any subsequent adaptation or specialized design;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also encourages</i> all relevant actors in taking measures of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation, between and among States and, as appropriate, in partnership with relevant 
</p>
<p>international and regional organizations and civil society, to consider appropriate and 
</p>
<p>effective measures to support national efforts to enhance the enjoyment of political rights 
</p>
<p>by persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others, such as by facilitating the use of 
</p>
<p>assistive and new technologies relevant to participation in political and public life; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides</i> to continue to integrate the rights of persons with disabilities into its 
</p>
<p>work, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 7/9 of 27 March 2008; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Also decides</i> that its next annual interactive debate on the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities will be held at its twenty-second session, and that it will focus on the work 
</p>
<p>and employment of persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to prepare a study on the work and employment of persons with disabilities, in 
</p>
<p>consultation with States and other relevant stakeholders, including the International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization, regional organizations, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission for Social 
</p>
<p>Development for monitoring the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization </p>


<p>of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, civil society organizations, including 
</p>
<p>organizations of persons with disabilities, and national human rights institutions, and 
</p>
<p>requests that the study be made available on the website of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, in an accessible format, prior to the twenty-second session of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Encourages</i> organizations of persons with disabilities, national monitoring 
</p>
<p>bodies and human rights institutions to participate actively in the session referred to in 
</p>
<p>paragraph 13 above, as well as in regular and special sessions of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and its working groups; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue to ensure that the mandate of the 
</p>

</p>
<p>fulfilment of their tasks;
