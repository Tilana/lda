We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Western Copper Corporation as at 
December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated statements of loss and deficit and cash 
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards 
and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test 
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 
2006 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Western Copper Corporation 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006
(expressed in Canadian dollars)
1 Nature of operations
Western Copper Corporation (Western Copper or the Company) is an exploration stage company that is 
directly engaged in exploration and development of mineral properties in Mexico and Canada. The 
recoverability of the amounts shown for mineral property assets is dependent upon the existence of 
economically recoverable reserves, and the Company’s ability to secure and maintain title and beneficial 
interest in the properties, to obtain the necessary financing to continue the exploration and future development 
of the properties, or to realize the carrying amount through a sale.
2
Significant accounting policies
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in Canada.  As described in note 17, these principles differ in certain material respects from 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
financial statements and the related notes.  Significant areas where management’s judgement is applied include 
the assessment of impairment to the carrying value of mineral properties, the determination of the likelihood 
that  future income tax benefits can be realized, the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of warrants and 
stock-based compensation, and the allocation methodologies used to determine results of operations and the 
value of purchased assets.  Actual results could differ from the estimates by a material amount.
Principles of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries:  Carmacks 
Copper Ltd. (100%), Lurprop Holdings Inc. (100%), CRS Copper Resources Corp. (100%), Moraga Resources 
Ltd. (100%), Minera Sierra Almoloya S.A. de C.V. (100%), and Minera Costa de Plata S.A. de C.V. (100%).  
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash deposits held at banks.
Short-term investments
Short-term investments include all highly liquid money market instruments.
Western Copper Corporation 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006
(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Computer equipment 
Office furniture and equipment 
Leasehold improvements
5 years 
5 years 
over the term of the lease
Mineral properties
Direct costs related to the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties held or controlled by the Company 
are deferred on an individual property basis until the viability of a property is determined or until the property 
is sold, abandoned, or impaired.  Administration costs and general exploration costs are expensed as incurred.  
When a property is placed in commercial production, deferred costs will be depleted using the units-of 
production method.
The Company reviews the carrying value of mineral properties and deferred exploration costs when there are 
events  or  changes  in  circumstances  that  may  indicate  impairment.  Where  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  are 
available, an impairment charge is recorded if the undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying 
amount.  Reductions  in  the  carrying  value  of  properties  are  recorded  to  the  extent  the  net  book  value  of  the 
property  exceeds  the  discounted  value  of  future  cash  flows.  Where  estimates  of  future  cash  flows  are  not 
available  and  where  other  conditions  suggest  impairment,  management  assesses  if  carrying  value  can  be 
recovered and provides for impairment if so indicated.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these 
procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title.  Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or 
transfers, or title may be affected by undetected defects.
Asset retirement obligation
The  fair  value  of  a  liability  for  an  asset  retirement  obligation,  such  as  site  closure  and  reclamation  costs,  is 
recognized  in  the  period  in  which  it  is  incurred  if  a  reasonable  estimate  of  fair  value  can  be  made.    The 
Company is required to record the estimated present value of future cash flows associated with site closure and 
reclamation as a liability and increase the carrying value of the related assets for that amount.  Subsequently, 
these asset retirement costs will be amortized to expense over the life of the related assets.   At the end of the 
each period, the liability is revised to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows 
underlying any initial fair value measurements.
Translation of foreign currency
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars using period-end exchange rates. 
Non-monetary items are translated at rates prevailing at acquisition or transaction dates. Expense and other 
items are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the related transaction. 
All exchange gains or losses arising on translation are included in results of operations for the period.
Western Copper Corporation 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006
(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Income taxes
Income  taxes  are  calculated  using  the  liability  method of  accounting.  Temporary  differences  arising  from  the 
difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are used to 
calculate future income tax liabilities or assets. Future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax 
rates and laws that are expected to apply when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation 
allowance  is  applied  to  the  extent  that  it  is  not  more  likely  than  not  that  the  future  income  tax  assets  will  be 
realized.

Plan of arrangement – Glamis Gold Ltd. and Western Silver Corporation
Western Copper was incorporated on March 17, 2006 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Silver 
Corporation (Western Silver).  On May 3, 2006, Western Silver and Glamis Gold Ltd. (Glamis) entered into a 
plan of arrangement.  As part of the agreement, Western Silver transferred its cash and cash equivalents, its 
marketable securities (1.498 million shares of Quaterra Resources Inc.) in-lieu of cash, two of its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries - Carmacks Copper Ltd. and Minera Costa de Plata, S.A. de C.V, its interests in the Sierra 
Almoloya property, and certain property and equipment relating to Western Silver’s corporate office to 
Western Copper.  In consideration, Western Copper issued 49,246,413 common shares to Western Silver, 
representing one Western Copper common share for each Western Silver common share issued and 
outstanding.  Western Silver shareholders then exchanged each of their Western Silver common shares for one 
common share of Western Copper and 0.688 of a Glamis common share.  Upon conclusion of the transaction, 
Western Copper was owned exclusively by existing Western Silver shareholders.

Pursuant to the plan of arrangement, each Western Silver stock option holder received one stock option of 
Western Copper.  A total of 2,013,168 stock options were granted as a result of the transaction.  Each had an  
exercise price of $0.88.
As part of the agreement, Western Copper was also required to grant a warrant to Glamis Gold Ltd. (Glamis) 
providing for the acquisition of 5% of the fully diluted Western Copper shares as of May 3, 2006 at a price per 
Western Copper share of $3.50.  This warrant gives Glamis the right to acquire 2,562,979 common shares of 
Western Copper.  The warrant expires on May 3, 2008.  Western Copper did not receive any direct 
consideration for the warrants.  The warrants were part of the overall consideration agreed upon by Western 
Silver and Glamis when negotiating the terms of the plan of arrangement.

The fair value of stock options granted and warrants issued pursuant to the plan of arrangement was calculated 
at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes option and warrant pricing model.
The valuation of the stock options granted May 3, 2006 was based on the following assumptions:
Average risk-free interest rate 
Expected dividend yield 
Expected stock price volatility 
Expected option term, in years
2.79%
-

Assumptions used to determine the fair value of the warrants issued pursuant to the plan of arrangement are 
disclosed in note 10.
Western Copper Corporation began operations on May 3, 2006.  Financial statement information prior to this 
date reflects the financial position, statements of loss and deficit and cash flows of the related copper business 
of Western Silver.  The statements of loss and deficit for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 include 
the direct exploration expenses incurred on  the Carmacks property and an allocation of Western Silver’s 
general and administrative expenses incurred in each of these years. The statements of loss and deficit for the 
year ended December 31, 2006 include the aforementioned allocations up to May 3, 2006 and the expenses 
incurred directly by Western Copper for the remainder of the year.
The allocation of Western Silver’s general and administrative expenses was calculated on the basis of the ratio 
of costs deferred by Western Silver on the Carmacks and Almoloya mineral properties in each year presented 
as compared to the costs deferred on all mineral properties in each of these years. The consolidated financial 
statements have been presented under the continuity-of-interests basis of accounting with balance sheet 
amounts based on the amounts recorded by Western Silver.
We caution users of these financial statements that the allocation of expenses does not necessarily reflect future 
general and administrative expenses as the allocations represent only a small portion of Western Silver’s total 
general and administrative expenses.  As a separate entity, management anticipates that Western Copper will 
have significantly higher general and administrative expenses.

Plan of arrangement - Lumina Resources Corporation
On November 30, 2006, Western Copper acquired Lumina Resources Corporation (Lumina) through a plan of 
arrangement.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Lumina shareholders received one common share of 
Western Copper Corporation for each Lumina common share held at that date.  In addition, each Lumina stock 
option was exchanged for one Western Copper stock option.  All outstanding Lumina stock options vested 
upon change of control.  Other than the vesting date, the stock option terms were unchanged
Western Copper issued 21,301,442 common shares to Lumina shareholders and granted 1,185,000 stock 
options to Lumina stock option holders.  In return, Western Copper gained three copper and precious metal 
properties (note 8) and $269,643 in net working capital.
For accounting purposes, the acquisition of Lumina constitutes an acquisition of specific assets and liabilities 
rather than the acquisition of a business.  Accordingly, the purchase consideration has been allocated to the 
estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the effective date of the purchase.
The total purchase price of $30,539,440 was determined as follows:

The fair value of a Western Copper stock option presented above is the weighted average of  the fair value 
of the individual stock option grants.  The weighted average figure has been rounded for  its presentation 
above.
The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the Western Copper stock options granted as 
a result of the plan of arrangement with Lumina:
Western Copper closing price per share on November 30, 2006 
Expected stock price volatility 
Expected option life, in years 
Risk free rate of return

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006
(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Carmacks (100% - Yukon, Canada)
The Carmacks project was transferred to Western Copper as a part of the plan of arrangement between Western 
Silver and Glamis Gold in May 2006 (note 3).
Archer, Cathro and Associates retains, at Western Copper’s election, either a 15% net profits interest or a 3% 
net smelter royalty.   If Western Copper elects the net smelter royalty, it has the right to purchase the royalty for 
$2.5 million, less any advance royalty payments made to that date.  The Company is required to make an 
advance royalty payment of $100,000 for any year in which the average daily copper price reported by the 
London Metal Exchange is US$1.10 per pound or greater.  As at December 31, 2006, Western Copper has 
made $300,000 in advance royalty payments and has accrued $100,000 relating to 2006.  The amount accrued 
was paid on January 1, 2007.
The  Carmacks  project  was  previously  written  down  to  its  estimated  fair  value  based  on  feasibility  study 
information available and what management believed the property could be sold for at that time.  The Company 
is  in  the  process  of  updating  its  feasibility  study  and  has  not  yet  been  able  to  conclude  that  there  has  been  a 
change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Carmacks  Property.    Accordingly,  Western  Copper  is  expensing  all  ongoing 
costs related to exploration of the Carmacks property.  This position will be revisited upon completion of the 
Carmacks 43-101 compliant reserve study and the related feasibility study.
Casino (100% - Yukon, Canada)
The option on the Casino property was acquired as a result of the plan of arrangement between Western Copper 
and Lumina Resources in November 2006 (note 4).  The Casino porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum property s 
located in the west- central Yukon. The property comprises 161 mineral claims.
To maintain its interest in the Casino claims, the Company must pay Great Basin Gold Ltd. $1 million in cash 
or in Western Copper shares by July 15, 2007.  The payment method is at the option of Western Copper.
If a production decision made, Western Copper will be required to make an additional cash payment of $1 
million to Great Basin Gold Ltd.
The claims are also subject to a 5% net profits royalty.
Hushamu (100% - British Columbia, Canada)
The  Hushamu  property  was  acquired  as  a  result  of  the  plan  of  arrangement  between  Western  Copper  and 
Lumina  Resources  in  November  2006  (note  4).    The  Hushamu  property  is  located  on  northern  Vancouver 
Island.
The  property  consists  of  222  mineral  claims  consisting  of  two  principal  blocks  of  claims  in  a  prospective 
copper/gold porphyry belt.  One block consists of 138 claims held by Moraga Resources Ltd. (Moraga) and 63 
claims held by Electra Gold Ltd. (Electra).  A second, separate block of claims called the Rupert Block consists 
of 21 mineral claims held by Moraga.  The two blocks cover approximately 37,000 hectares (91,000 acres).
Western Copper Corporation 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006
(expressed in Canadian dollars)
Should  a  production  decision  be  made  on  the  first  block,  the  Company  shall  be  required  to  make  a  cash 
payment of $1 million within 60 days of the production decision.  These claims may also subject to a 10% net 
profits interest.
The  Company  made  an  option  payment  of  $60,000  to  Electra  on  February  3,  2007  and  will  make  a  further 
payment of $80,000 on February 3, 2008, to retain its interest in the property.  Upon the last payment, Western 
Copper will have a 100% interest in the metallic minerals in the property.
Should a production decision be made on the second block, the Company is required to pay $800,000, in cash 
or in Western Copper stock to Electra.   The payment method is at the election of Western Copper.
Redstone (100% - Northwest Territories, Canada)
The Redstone property was also acquired as a result of the plan of arrangement between Western Copper and 
Lumina Resources in November 2006 (note 4).  The property comprises five mining leases (13,990 acres) and 
55 claims (73,000 acres) in six distinct areas.
Should production be achieved, the 5 mining leases are subject to a net smelter royalty of between 3-4% 
depending on the monthly average of the final daily spot price of copper reported on the New York 
Commodities Exchange relating to each production month, as follows:
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
3%, if the price is less than, or equal to US$0.75 per pound; 
3.5% if the price is greater than US$0.75 per pound, but less than, or equal to US$1.00 per pound; and 
4% if the price is greater than US$1 per pound.
Sierra Almoloya (100% - Chihuahua, Mexico)
The Sierra Almoloya property was transferred to Western Copper as a part of the plan of arrangement between 
Western Silver and Glamis Gold in May 2006 (see note 3).   The property is located northeast of the city of 
Parral in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico.
On July 28, 2005, the Company and Queenston Mining Inc. signed an option and joint venture agreement. 
Pursuant to the option and joint venture agreement, Queenston Mining Inc. can earn a 60% interest in the 
property through staged exploration expenditures of US$1.5 million over a four year period, with minimum 
expenditures of:
(cid:120) US$200,000 to June 30, 2006; 
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
an additional US$300,000 on or before June 30, 2007; 
an additional US$400,000 on or before June 30, 2008; and 
an additional US$600,000 on or before June 30, 2009.
Queenston can earn an additional 15% interest by completing a feasibility study and making a production 
decision at which time the Company can either elect to convert its 40% interest into a 25% participating interest 
or a 15% net profits interest.  If the Company elects the 25% participating interest, further preproduction and 
exploration costs to place the properties into commercial production shall be incurred by each party to the joint 
venture at participating interest rates.

Share capital and contributed surplus
a)
Share capital
Authorized - Unlimited common shares without par value
Issued – 71,524,036 common shares
Western Silver Corporation received 100,000,000 Class A voting shares when it incorporated Western Copper 
Corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary on March 17, 2006.  The class A voting shares were redeemed at 
their par value of $0.00001 per Class A voting share as part of the plan of arrangement on May 3, 2006 (note 
3).
On May 3, 2006, the carrying value of Western Silver’s copper business assets transferred as a part of the plan 
of arrangement was allocated to share capital (note 3).
Loss per share figures for years ended prior to December 31, 2006 are not available because Western Copper 
did not become an independent entity until May 3, 2006.  Results prior  to May 3, 2006 represent the direct 
exploration expenses incurred on  the Carmacks property by Western Silver and an allocation of Western 
Silver’s general and administrative expenses incurred in each of these years (note 3).
b) Contributed surplus
Contributed surplus represents the fair value of stock options and warrants recorded over their vesting period.
The fair value of stock options and warrants is transferred to share capital when the stock options or warrants 
are exercised.   In the event that stock options are cancelled or forfeited prior to vesting, the associated fair 
value recorded to date is reversed from the statement of loss or balance sheet item to which the fair value was 
originally charged in the period in which the stock options are cancelled or forfeited.  The fair value of any 
vested stock option that expires, is cancelled, or is forfeited remains in contributed surplus. The fair value of 
any warrant that expires or is forfeited also remains in contributed surplus.
The historical contributed surplus balance at May 3, 2006 includes amounts paid by Western Silver to finance 
its copper business since 1989, when the rights to the Carmacks property claims were acquired.

10 Stock options and warrants
a)
Stock options
Based on the Company’s Stock Option Plan, the Company may issue stock options for the purchase of up to 
10% of issued capital.  The exercise price of the stock options shall be greater than, or equal to, the market 
value of the Company’s common shares on the last trading day immediately preceding the date of grant.  Stock 
options vest over a two year period from the date of grant unless otherwise determined by the directors.  The 
maximum stock option term is 10 years.  At December 31, 2006, the Company could issue an additional 
3,545,570 stock options.

b)
Stock-based compensation
The fair value of all stock options granted by the Company to employees, and non-employees, is treated as 
compensation costs in accordance with CICA Handbook section 3870 Stock-based Compensation.  These costs 
are charged to the statement of loss or, if appropriate, are capitalized over the stock option vesting period.  The 
Company’s allocation of stock-based compensation is consistent with its treatment of other types of 
compensation for each recipient.
Stock-based compensation has been allocated to the following line items:
Exploration  
Administrative expenses
Office and administration 
Promotion and travel

The value of stock-based compensation awards is determined at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model.
In addition to the stock option grants made pursuant to the plans of arrangement with Glamis Gold and Western 
Silver (note 3) and with Lumina (note 4), the Company granted 1,470,000 stock options to employees and 
directors on May 16, 2006.  The fair value of these stock options was $1,821,477.  This value was calculated 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:
Average risk-free interest rate 
Expected dividend yield 
Expected stock price volatility

The fair value of the warrants was determined at the time of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing

-
69.97%

Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price 
volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and 
therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the 
Company’s stock options and/or share purchase warrants granted and/or vested during the period.
11 Commitments
The Company has an agreement to sublease office space which expires October 29, 2009. The total amount of 
payments remaining during the course of the agreement is $769,232, of which $271,494 is due over the next 12 
months. The remaining $497,738 is due between January 1, 2008 and October 31, 2009.

16 Income taxes
As at December 31, 2006, the Company has accumulated non-capital losses available for carry-forward of 
approximately $2,600,000, which will expire between 2007 and 2013. The Company also has available 
Canadian Exploration and Development Expenditures, which are available to reduce future taxable income. In 
addition, the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries have accumulated tax balances that may give rise to future tax 
benefits. No future tax benefit has been recognized in the accounts for these losses or accumulated tax balances.   
Western Copper Corporation was incorporated on March 17, 2006 and, as such, there are no income tax figures 
for periods prior to incorporation.
a)
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company does not have any current or future income tax 
expense or recovery.  This differs from the amounts obtained by applying statutory rates to the loss before 
provision for income taxes due to the following:
Statutory tax rate
Loss for the year
Recovery of income taxes based on statutory Canadian 
combined federal and provincial income tax rates
Non-deductible items 
Losses for which no income tax benefit has been
recognized

cannot be viewed as more likely than not. Accordingly, no future income tax asset has been recognized for 
accounting purposes.
Western Copper Corporation 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006

The future income tax liability arising from the difference between each mineral property’s carrying value 
and its tax basis has been allocated to the related mineral property (note 4 and 8).
17 Material differences between Canadian and United States generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP)
Western Copper prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in Canada (Canadian GAAP), which differ in certain material respects from those principles 
that the Company would have followed had its financial statements been prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The effects of significant 
measurement differences between Canadian and U.S. GAAP are described below.

(expressed in Canadian dollars)
a) Mineral property exploration expenditures
Mineral property exploration expenditures are accounted for in accordance with Canadian GAAP as 
disclosed in note 2.
For U.S. GAAP purposes, exploration expenditures relating to mineral properties for which commercial 
feasibility has not yet been established and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Mineral property acquisition costs, including periodic option payments, and development expenditures 
incurred subsequent to the determination of the feasibility of mining operations are deferred until the 
property to which they relate is placed into production, sold, allowed to lapse or abandoned, or when 
impairment in value has been determined to have occurred.
Mineral property acquisition costs include the cash consideration and the fair value of common shares and 
warrants issued for mineral property interests, pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreement.  Mineral 
properties are written off if the property is sold, allowed to lapse, abandoned, or when impairment in the 
value has been determined to have occurred.  Mineral property sales proceeds or option payments received 
for exploration rights are treated as cost recoveries.
b) Comprehensive Income
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of comprehensive income (loss) which is intended to reflect all other 
changes in equity except those resulting from contributions by, and payments to owners.

In March 2005, the EITF issued EITF 04-6, “Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining 
Industry”.  The consensus indicated that costs of removing overburden and waste materials 
(“stripping costs”) after production begins, represent variable production costs and should be 
considered a component of mineral inventory cost subject to the guidance in Chapter 4 of 
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43 “Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research 
Bulletins”.  EITF 04-6 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and upon 
adoption, can be applied by either retroactively restating prior periods or using a cumulative catch-
up adjustment.  The Company believes that this Statement will have no impact on its consolidated 
financial statements.
In September 2005, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, 
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB 
Statement No. 3” (“SFAS 154”).  SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ 
financial statements of a change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so.  This is 
a change from the existing practice that requires most accounting changes to be accounted for by 
including in net income in the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new 
accounting principle.  SFAS 154 will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors 
made in fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2005.  The impact of SFAS 154 cannot be 
determined until such time the Company makes a change in accounting policy.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income 
Taxes” (“FIN 48”).  This interpretation clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement of a 
tax position taken on a tax return, and requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty 
in income taxes.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.  The 
adoption of FIN 48 will have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and 
related disclosure.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair 
Value Measurements” (SFAS 157).  This statement defines fair value, establishes guidelines for 
measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements.  SFAS 157 does 
not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance 
found in various prior accounting pronouncements.  SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years 
beginning after November 15, 2007.  The Company expects that adoption of SFAS 157 will not 
have a material effect on is financial condition or results of operation.
In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 123R-4 “Classification of 
Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash 
Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event.”  FSP FAS 123R-4 addresses the 
classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for 
cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event and amends paragraphs 32 and A229 of 
SFAS 123R.  The Company was required to apply the guidance in FSP FAS 123R-4 in the current 
year. Its adoption has not had a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements.
d) Recent Canadian accounting pronouncements
CICA Handbook Section 3831 “Non-Monetary Transactions” will be applicable to the Company 
commencing with the 2006 financial year.  Reporting of the Company’s results is not expected to be 
materially affected by this standard.
In January 2005, the CICA issued three new standards relating to financial instruments.  These standards 
are applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2006.  The Company is currently reviewing 
the impact of these new standards.  These standards are as follows:
Financial instruments – Recognition and Measurement, Section 3855:
This standard prescribes when a financial asset, financial liability, or non-financial derivative is to be 
recognized on the balance sheet and whether fair value or cost-based measures are used.  It also specifies 
how financial instruments gains or losses are to be presented.
Hedges, Section 3865:
This standard is applicable when a company chooses to designate a hedging relationship for accounting 
purposes.  It builds on the existing Accounting Guideline AcG-13 “Hedging Relationships”, and Section 
1650 “Foreign Currency Translation”, by specifying how hedge accounting is applied and what 
disclosures are necessary when it is applied.

Comprehensive Income, Section 1530:
This standard introduces new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income.  
Comprehensive income, which is currently reported under US GAAP, is the change in shareholders’ 
equity (net assets) of an enterprise during a reporting period from transactions and other events and 
circumstances from non-owner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those 
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  These items include minimum pension 
liability adjustments, holding gains and losses on certain investments, gains and losses on certain 
derivative instruments and foreign currency gains and losses related to self-sustaining foreign operations 
(cumulative translation adjustment).
