<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination visited Somalia 
from 8 to 14 December 2012 at the invitation of the Federal Government. In accordance 
with its mandate, the Working Group gathered information on the activities of private 
military and security companies (PMSCs), including the effect of such activities on the 
enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group commends the efforts of the Federal Government of Somalia to 
establish a peaceful, democratic, safe and secure society in Somalia after 23 years of 
conflict. One of the principal human rights concerns articulated to the Working Group was 
that as rebuilding efforts in Somalia get underway, there will be an influx of foreign 
PMSCs without sufficient regulation and control by the Government. This would be 
accelerated if the Security Council lifts the arms embargo that has thus far made it difficult 
for international PMSCs to operate in Somalia. Such an influx of PMSCs could increase 
instability in an already fragile security environment and, as PMSC employees interact with 
the civilian population, raise the scepter of human rights violations of the type documented 
by the Working Group in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>  
 * The summary of the present report is circulated in all official languages. The report itself, 
</p>
<p>which is annexed to the summary, is circulated in the language of submission only.

</p>
<p> In this regard, the Working Group notes with approval the ongoing efforts of the 
Government to set rules governing the registration and regulation of PMSCs in Somalia 
through the National Commission. In addition to adopting regulations, the Working Group 
recommends that the Government ensure that any licensing regime it establishes is not 
limited to one-time vetting, but includes ongoing monitoring, and that sufficient resources 
are allocated to allow the system to function. The National Commission should also ensure 
that there are mechanisms to ensure the accountability of PMSCs in the event of human 
rights violations. The Working Group would welcome the opportunity to provide the 
Government of Somalia with information on other national licensing regimes to assist it in 
designing an effective system. The Working Group also recommends that the Somali 
Government make provision for the collection and dissemination of information about the 
activities of PMSCs operating in the country. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group further notes that the principal responsibility for the security of 
the Somali people lies with the Government, and cautions that the outsourcing of security 
functions to private actors should not distract from the essential work of building the 
official Somali security sector. 
</p>
<p> With regard to companies providing military training, the Working Group notes that 
the particularly sensitive nature of these assignments underscores the need for strict 
regulation. These types of operations should be brought within the ambit of any regulatory 
scheme developed by the National Commission. At the very least, the contractual 
arrangements for such training should include strict vetting and training requirements, as 
well as rules to ensure that trainers and mentors do not participate in kinetic operations 
(e.g., a requirement to maintain a certain distance from the front line or area of hostilities). 
</p>
<p> As detailed by the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea, the 
PMSC Saracen provided military training and equipment to the Puntland Maritime Police 
Force (PMPF) in violation of Security Council regulations. There are allegations of human 
rights abuses of trainees by Saracen, some of which have been substantiated by the 
Monitoring Group. While the bulk of Saracen&#8217;s training activities appear to have been 
concluded, foreign contractors continue to support the PMPF in various capacities without 
any clear accountability structure. Moreover, since the PMPF operates outside the legal 
framework for security forces, there is a risk &#8211; which has been borne out by several 
incidents reported to the Working Group &#8211; that it will be used for purposes other than its 
anti-piracy mission . The Working Group urges the authorities to integrate the force into the 
agreed Somali national security structure and ensure that it is used strictly for the purposes 
for which it is intended. Any PMSC employees providing training to the PMPF should be 
subject to regulation and oversight by the appropriate authorities. 
</p>
<p> With regard to maritime security companies, the Working Group was provided 
information about circumstances suggestive of unreported human rights violations. The 
Working Group is of the view that binding international regulations should be developed to 
regulate the use of armed guards on board ships.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Federal Government of Somalia, the Working Group on the 
use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
right of peoples to self-determination (Working Group) visited Somalia from 8 to 14 
December 2012. The Working Group was represented by two of its members, Faiza Patel 
and Anton Katz.1   
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/2 and Human 
Rights Council resolution 15/12, the Working Group is called upon to monitor mercenaries 
and mercenary-related activities in all their forms and manifestations in different parts of 
the world, as well as to study the effects on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly the 
right of peoples to self-determination of the activities of private companies offering military 
assistance, consultancy and security services in the international market.  
</p>
<p>3. A private military and/or security company (PMSC) is understood to be a corporate 
entity which provides, on a compensatory basis, military and/or security services by 
physical persons and/or legal entities. Military services include specialized services related 
to military actions, including strategic planning, intelligence, investigation, land, sea or air 
reconnaissance, flight operations of any type &#8211; manned or unmanned &#8211;, satellite 
surveillance, any kind of knowledge transfer with military applications, material and 
technical support to armed forces and other related activities. Security services include 
armed guarding or protection of buildings, installations, property and people, any kind of 
knowledge transfer with security and policing applications, development and 
implementation of informational security measures and other related activities.2  
</p>
<p>4. During the visit, the Working Group held meetings with several government 
officials. In Mogadishu, the Working Group met with the Minister of Interior and National 
Security, the Head of the Security Department in the Ministry, as well as the Police 
Commissioner. In Bossaso (Puntland), it met with President Farole, representatives of the 
Ministry of Maritime Transport, Ports and Counter Piracy, the Ministry of Planning and 
International Cooperation, the Ministry of Interior and National Security and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. It also met with the Chief of Staff and Puntland Security Forces, the 
Puntland Police Commissioner, the Deputy Commander and the Coordinator of the 
Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF).  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group also held meetings with the Deputy Force Commander, the 
Marine Commander and the Chief of Training of the African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM).  
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the 
diplomatic community in Nairobi, and international organizations, notably the Deputy 
Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Somalia, the Deputy 
Humanitarian Coordinator, the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea 
(Monitoring Group), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United 
Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in Somalia, the United Nations Support Office for 
AMISOM (UNSOA), the World Food Programme (WFP), the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities: 
</p>
<p>Anton Katz (South Africa), Chairperson-Rapporteur for the period January to December 2013, 
Patricia Arias (Chile), Faiza Patel (Pakistan), El&#380;bieta Karska (Poland) and Gabor Rona (United 
States of America).  
</p>
<p> 2 See Draft of a possible Convention on Private Millitary and Security Companies (PMSCs) for 
consideration and action by the Human Rights Council, A/HRC/15/25, annex, art. 2.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
Following the country visit, the Working Group sent written requests for information to 
UNMAS and one security provider, to which replies were received. The Working Group 
would like to thank the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), especially 
it&#8217;s Human Rights Unit, for facilitating the mission.  
</p>
<p>7. Meetings were also held with representatives of PMSCs in Bossaso and Mogadishu.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group commends the efforts of the Federal Government of Somalia to 
establish a peaceful, democratic, safe and secure society in Somalia, after 23 years of 
conflict.   </p>
<p>9. In 1992, the Security Council responded to the ongoing conflict and alarming 
humanitarian situation in Somalia by imposing an arms embargo through its resolution 
733(1992). In subsequent resolutions, the Council:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Authorized exemptions to the embargo for supplies of non-lethal military equipment 
for use in humanitarian operations;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Clarified that the embargo prohibited the financing of arms acquisitions, as well as 
the direct or indirect sale or supply of technical advice or military training; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Authorized the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and African 
Union member States to deploy the African Union Mission in Somalia to protect 
Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and to arm and train its security 
forces; and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Limited the embargo to non-State actors, allowing for the supply of weapons and 
military equipment intended solely for the purpose of helping develop Somali 
security sector institutions.   
</p>
<p>10. The Security Council also established a sanctions committee on Somalia, which 
must be notified in advance about a country&#8217;s intention to avail itself of exemptions and has 
the power to prevent them. In 2008, Security Council resolution 1844 (2008) amended the 
arms embargo to specify sanctions for entities that violated the arms embargo or obstructed 
the delivery of humanitarian assistance to or in Somalia.   
</p>
<p>11. The Security Council established the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia 
(Monitoring Group) through its resolution 1519 (2003) with a mandate focusing on arms 
embargo violations.3 The Working Group appreciates the reports of the Monitoring Group 
which contain a wealth of factual information and were helpful in preparing the country 
visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights commitments  
</b></p>
<p>12. Somalia has ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>  
 3 Following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1907 (2009), the Monitoring Group changed its 
</p>
<p>name to the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Somalia is not a party to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries.4 It is also not a party to the Organization of African  
Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Private military and security companies operating in Somalia  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Security context   
</b></p>
<p>14. Somalia is divided into three regions: Somaliland (a self-proclaimed independent 
state, not internationally recognized), Puntland (a semi-autonomous region) and the South 
Central Region. After more than two decades of conflict, the general security situation in 
Somalia remains very tense. The biggest security threat is the insurgent group, Al-Shabaab, 
which has controlled significant territory in the South Central Region. Recently, AMISOM 
and the Somali National Security Forces fighting alongside them have made significant 
territorial gains in the South Central Region. Nonetheless, the security situation in many 
areas of the South Central Region remained unpredictable in 2012, with insurgents 
increasingly resorting to dangerous asymmetric attacks and intimidating locals. Several Al-
Shabaab fighters have moved from the South Central Region to Somaliland and Puntland, 
although it appears that they are more interested in recruitment than gaining control of these 
areas.5 Puntland also faced continuous challenges from the Al-Shabaab-linked Galgala 
insurgents, freelance militias, and pirates.6 
</p>
<p>15. The security situation remains particularly volatile in Mogadishu. Although 
AMISOM and the Somali National Security Forces have maintained their hold on the city, 
Al-Shabaab attacks occurred frequently, including targeted killings and hand grenade 
attacks, with an increase in outlying districts. While incidents on the use of improvised 
explosive devices (IEDs) has decreased recently, periodic suicide attacks, such as those 
carried out on 12 September 2012 at the Jazeera Hotel while President Mohamud was 
present, and at the Village Restaurant on 20 September 2012, demonstrate Al-Shabaab&#8217;s 
persistent infiltration of the city.7 On 14 April 2013, a nine-man suicide commando unit 
attacked Mogadishu's courthouse leaving 29 civilians dead, while a separate bomb attack 
killed five more civilians. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack that was 
strongly condemned by the Security Council.8 Al-Shabaab became more active in Puntland 
from late November 2012, undertaking several attacks. Killings and arrests of suspects, 
discoveries of ordnance and continued reports of troop movements demonstrated the 
insurgents&#8217; enduring presence in the region and neighbouring Galmudug.9   
</p>
<p>16. The volatile security situation in Somalia has led some intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations to enter into contracts with PMSCs to ensure their safety. At 
this point, personal protection &#8211; such as armed guards &#8211; is primarily provided by local 
companies.  
</p>
<p>17. Thus far, international PMSCs have operated in Somalia only in a limited number of 
situations. The Working Group is aware of three major instances of such activity:

</p>
<p> (b) Providing weapons and training to the Puntland Maritime Police Force 
(PMPF); 
</p>
<p> (c) Bancroft &#8211; which is registered as a non-profit, and performs functions similar 
to that of a PMSC &#8211; provides training and mentoring to AMISOM and Somali forces, as 
well as mine removal assistance to the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>18. Piracy off the coast of Somalia has also emerged as a security issue of concern to the 
international community. Since 2008, three Security Council resolutions have addressed 
piracy in these waters, providing a legal basis for anti-piracy patrols and escorts involving 
the navies of most of the world&#8217;s major maritime powers. From 2008 to 2011, piracy 
</p>
<p>increased considerably.10 During that time, Somali pirates carried out more than 800 attacks 
on ships from private yachts to oil supertankers, hijacking over 170 vessels. Some 3,500 
seafarers were taken hostage and 62 have been killed. According to some estimates, in 
2011, pirates took in about US$160 million in ransom payments and the cost to the global 
economy was US$7 billion.11 According to the most recent information12 available from the 
International Maritime Bureau (IMB), however, piracy may be abating. From 1 January 
through 12 July 2012, the IMB received reports of 69 hijacking incidents by Somali pirates, 
a reduction of 32 per cent compared with the same period in 2011. Pirate activity may have 
morphed into other areas; there have been several reports of kidnapping of humanitarian 
workers and civilians by networks involved in piracy.13

<p><b> B. Overview of private military and security companies operating in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Somalia, including types of services  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Armed protection  
</b></p>
<p>19. Armed protection is largely provided by local PMSCs to international organizations 
and NGOs in Mogadishu. For example, the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) has 
contracted Duguf Enterprise Security Services Inc. (Duguf). This company is officially 
licensed and, according to the head of Duguf, its staff are trained in international 
humanitarian law. Duguf provides a wide range of security services, including armed 
security escorts and guarding services, threat and risk assessments, communications, 
logistics and dispatch services. They have been engaged by UNDP as a technical adviser 
and provide pick-up trucks with armed personnel in order to facilitate UNDP personnel 
movements between Mogadishu International Airport, the UNCC compound, Villa Somalia 
and other areas in Mogadishu.14 Personnel from other United Nations entities, such as the 
United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), are escorted by AMISOM when 
they travel outside Mogadishu or in sensitive neighbourhoods.

<p>20. Peace Hotel Security Services, also located in Mogadishu, provides armed security 
services to visitors staying at its hotel as well as to NGOs.  
</p>
<p>21. TAC Force, an international consultancy firm established in 1997 with  headquarters 
in the Middle East, also operates in Mogadishu. During its meeting with the Working 
Group in Mogadishu, TAC Force indicated that it specialized in crisis management, close 
personal protection and logistical support in high-risk environments. It was licensed by 
TFG in 2009 for a five-year period as the first private security company permitted to 
operate in Somalia, as indicated in the document that TAC provided to the Working 
Group.15 It owns a guest house and has a protection team providing security to clients. It 
employs 100 people, 50 of whom provide security. It has a license to import armoured 
vehicles. The company informed the Working Group that since 2012, it has also been 
licensed to operate in Puntland.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group was informed that several local security providers in Somalia 
are clan-based militia which operate behind a corporate fa&#231;ade in order to conceal the 
involvement of individual warlords. Although the Working Group was unable to verify this 
information, it notes that this pattern has been seen in other countries and is an issue that 
international organizations and NGOs should be cognizant of when they enter into 
agreements for the provision of private security.  
</p>
<p>23.  In Puntland and Somaliland, special protection units (SPUs) of the police force 
provide armed protection to convoys, and guard the compounds of international 
organizations and NGOs. In addition to their salaries as members of the police force, SPUs 
also receive remuneration from the clients to whom they provide security. 
</p>
<p>24.  The Exploration Security Unit (ESU) is a special branch of the Puntland security 
forces established to protect oil exploration and exploitation companies. Its primary client is 
the Africa Oil Corporation, a company registered in Canada (and licensed by the Puntland 
authorities)16 that leads a consortium of foreign oil companies. It acquired a licence and 
commenced exploration activities in the Dharoor Valley Exploration Area and the Nugaal 
Valley Exploration Area located in Puntland. The ESU provides convoy security and site 
protection, and their armed guards are seconded to oil companies. Like SPUs, the ESU, 
although part of the police force, provide security services to third parties for which they 
are remunerated. As such, these units may also be regarded as semi-private.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other security services  
</b></p>
<p>25. As of August 2011, Africa Oil has contracted Pathfinder Corporation, a company 
based in Southern Africa. Both Africa Oil and Pathfinder informed the Working Group that 
the latter does not provide any training or security services to Africa Oil, but that its 
primary role is to conduct risk analyses and coordinate the protection provided by the ESU. 
Pathfinder took over Africa Oil&#8217;s security contract from Salama Fakira, a private security 
contractor based in East Africa which previously provided risk assessment advice to Africa 
Oil.17 In addition, local security contractors provide logistics and transportation of 
equipment for oil companies.   
</p>
<p>26. AMISOM provides security for the heavily fortified compound which serves as a 
major base for African Union forces, and within which the Adan Abdulle International 
Airport is situated. The surrounding area is considered one of the safest parts of Mogadishu 
and includes the United Nations compound, as well as facilities used by other international 
</p>

<p>organizations and NGOs. In addition, in December 2010, SKA, a Middle East-based 
provider of aviation services and logistics, entered into a ten-year contract with TFG to 
manage Mogadishu international airport.18 It is reported that SKA invested over US$6 
million in airport equipment and support services in Mogadishu to raise the standards at the 
airport. It has undertaken large-scale rehabilitation of the airport infrastructure, including 
installing electronic check-in systems and improving security. SKA hires local private 
security companies to ensure protection of its accommodation facilities within the protected 
air field of the AMISOM-controlled base.  
</p>
<p>27. Physical Risk Solutions (PRS) operates in Somaliland and is registered and managed 
by a former South African military operative. According to the company&#8217;s website, PRS 
provides &#8220;extensive services&#8221; to its clients, including &#8220;armed guarding&#8221;. However, 
according to the Monitoring Group , the company manager has indicated that restrictions 
imposed by Somaliland authorities do not allow armed guarding activities and PRS is 
currently contracted by international organizations and NGOs to provide internal security 
services with reportedly trained but unarmed personnel, operating security screening and 
monitoring compound security with the relevant equipment, including x-ray machines, 
metal detectors and close-circuit television (CCTV) systems.19 The Working Group did not 
visit Somaliland and is therefore unable to reach any independent conclusion on the matter. 
PRS also operates in Puntland and provides unarmed guard services to the United Nations 
compounds. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Military services  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Saracen  
</i></p>
<p>28. The best known example of an international company involved in military 
operations in Somalia is Saracen,20 contracted to train and equip the Puntland Marine Police 
Force (PMPF). The PMPF was established by President Farole of Puntland, with the stated 
goal of providing a land-based response to piracy.  
</p>
<p>29. According to the Monitoring Group, between May 2010 and February 2011, Saracen 
International SAL, working with a number of other private companies in Africa and the 
Middle East, provided military training as well as equipment and vehicles to the PMPF. 
The Monitoring Group report presents evidence that the military equipment and vehicles 
procured for the PMPF included armoured vehicles with turrets for gun mounts and 
ammunition.21  
</p>
<p>30. In terms of training, the Monitoring Group reported that Saracen personnel, many of 
whom are South African, were engaged to recruit, train and mentor a PMPF battalion in all 
phases of war, including land, sea and airmobile operations. The job description for 
personnel recruited by Saracen indicated that the trainers would also lead forces on the 
ground, as mentors, in military campaigns that include kinetic operations. In other words, 
the trainers were expected to act not only as instructors, but as fighters participating in 
combat operations on Somali territory.22

 20 Reports indicate that in late 2011, Saracen&#8217;s assets, personnel and operations were transferred to 
</p>
<p>Sterling Corporate Services, a company registered in the Middle East, which continued to provide 
large-scale military training, technical assistance and support to the PMPF.

</p>
<p>31. These activities were found by the Monitoring Group to constitute violations of the 
arms embargo.23 The Monitoring Group also considered that Saracen&#8217;s activities 
represented a threat to peace and security in Somalia24 because they were operating outside 
of all international and multilateral frameworks for support to the Somali security sector. 
Consequently, there was no way to ensure that forces trained and equipped by Saracen were 
in fact employed for the declared purpose of anti-piracy. Indeed, there have been 
allegations that the Puntland authorities may have used the PMPF for purposes other than 
combating piracy, as discussed in paragraph 33 below.25  
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group visited the PMPF facility in Bossaso where it met with the  
Deputy Commander and the Coordinator of the force. They stated that Saracen had left 
Puntland and was no longer training or mentoring the PMPF. They informed the Working 
Group that 12 South African private contractors remained as pilots, logistics and 
communications contractors and to provide maintenance. The PMPF Coordinator indicated 
that although the training activities may have ceased, or at least diminished, the equipment 
acquired by the PMPF remains. The Working Group also observed the presence of four 
planes that were reportedly used for surveillance in the context of counter-piracy 
operations, as well as a number of rigid-inflatable boats (RIBs) on the PMPF site in 
Bossaso. The Working Group did not observe many soldiers at the PMPF compound. They 
were reportedly conducting a counter-piracy operation near Gara'ad village on the coast in 
Mudug region, which according to the Puntland authorities resulted in the release of 22 
hostages.  
</p>
<p>33. Saracen&#8217;s activities vis-&#224;-vis the PMPF raise a number of concerns. Most 
fundamentally, they raise the question of how a PMSC could influence the balance of 
power in a region and undermine agreed security arrangements. The Working Group is of 
the view that Saracen assisted in building the best equipped and trained force in Puntland 
(after AMISOM in Somalia), but it falls outside the constitutional framework for security 
institutions. The fact that the PMPF reports directly and solely to the President of Puntland 
has created fears that it will be deployed in an internal security role and not just for anti-
piracy operations.26 Indeed, the Working Group was informed that the PMPF had taken part 
in activities that seemed aimed at political opponents of President Farole. One example, 
which was also reported in the Somali press,27 was the deployment of the PMPF in October 
2012 to prevent Abdiweli Ali Gaas, former Prime Minister of Somalia and considered as a 
potential rival to President Farole, from campaigning in Bossaso by surrounding his 
residence and blocking road access.  
</p>
<p>34. During the country visit, the Working Group repeatedly heard concerns in respect of 
the future of the PMPF. It has been widely reported that the training and equipping of the 
PMPF was financed by a Middle Eastern country, although this has not been acknowledged 
as being the case.28 Regardless of the original source of financing for the endeavour, the 
Working Group learned that financing for the PMPF has now dried up and that the 
Government of Puntland is seeking ways of continuing to finance its operations. The 
existence of a well-trained and well-equipped force, which is not being paid, in the fragile 
security situation in Somalia raises obvious concerns. In particular, some sources expressed

<p>concern that the PMPF may join the Al-Shabaab insurgency or engage in piracy if the 
situation is not resolved.  
</p>
<p>35. There have been allegations of human rights violations during the time that Saracen 
was running the PMPF camp. The Monitoring Group discovered photographic evidence 
from an internal Saracen source that showed a Somali trainee &#8220;wearing the typical Saracen 
blue training uniform, laying down face on the ground, being bound hand and foot with a 
rope, in the presence of Saracen international staff.&#8221;29 The Monitoring Group concluded 
&#8220;based on these images, and according to the testimony of a credible source with access to 
Saracen trainees, the trainee died of his injuries on 16 October 2010.&#8221;30 The Monitoring 
Group also identified two cases of severe corporal punishment &#8211; one trainee who had his 
hands broken before being fired and another who died after being beaten with rocks while 
tied up31 &#8211; but as of the date of its report (July 2012) had not been able to substantiate these 
allegations.  
</p>
<p>36. During the visit, the Working Group was informed that a foreign Saracen trainer was 
killed in Iskushuban on 27 April 2012 by members of his own unit. This incident was also 
reported by the Monitoring Group and the Puntland authorities.32 According to several 
confidential security reports received by the Monitoring Group, the trainer was not killed 
during a &#8220;counter-piracy operation&#8221;, as stated by the Puntland authorities, but during an 
argument with members of his unit. The Working Group has no information as to what, if 
any, steps were taken against the alleged perpetrator by the Puntland authorities.  
</p>
<p><i>  Bancroft Global Development  
</i></p>
<p>37. One of the most significant non-governmental players in the security sector in 
Somalia is Bancroft Global Development. Bancroft is registered as a charity in the United 
States and has emphasized to the Working Group that it is not a PMSC. Nonetheless, 
Bancroft is treated as a PMSC for purposes of this report because it provides the same, or at 
least similar, types of services as those provided by PMSCs, and it does so on the basis of 
compensatory contracts (as described below). Whether Bancroft provides these services out 
of humanitarian motives or to turn a profit does not bear on the issues of accountability and 
the potential for human rights violations that are of concern to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>38. Bancroft started its activities in Mogadishu in 2007, at a time when very few private 
security providers were present in Somalia. According to information provided by the 
company to the Working Group, Bancroft&#8217;s current presence in Mogadishu does not exceed 
</p>
<p>50 staff. To Bancroft&#8217;s credit, the United Nations Monitoring Group identified it as the only 
private company providing assistance to Somali security sector institutions in conformity 
with the Security Council regime.33   
</p>
<p>39. Bancroft informed the Working Group that it implements training and mentoring 
activities in the following areas: financial accountability systems development and 
management, engineering, construction, explosive detecting canine operations, explosive 
ordinance disposal, emergency medicine, public health, law and judicial systems.  
According to Bancroft, its past and present partners in Somalia include essentially all of the

</p>
<p>members of the United Nations Country Team in Somalia, the African Union, and a 
number of Western countries.  
</p>
<p>40. During its visit, the Working Group learned about Bancroft&#8217;s activities under three 
main sets of contracts.  
</p>
<p>41. Firstly, Bancroft informed the Working Group that it provided training and 
mentoring to AMISOM, under a contract with the Ugandan Government, which in turn is 
reimbursed by the Government of the United States of America. According to information 
provided by Bancroft, their services to AMISOM include training canines to detect 
explosives, port security, education about mine risks, as well as training on how to safely 
remove IEDs. The company&#8217;s experts include medical personnel, engineers, dog trainers, 
and IED experts. Bancroft reported that as mentors, its personnel accompany AMISOM 
troops to the field, but that they are unarmed and do not take part in kinetic operations.  
</p>
<p>42. Secondly, as reported by the Monitoring Group and confirmed by Bancroft, it 
provided technical expertise to AMISOM and, under its auspices, to the TFG military.34 In 
2010, Bancroft assisted AMISOM in modernizing its sight system for mortar fire, and took 
an active part in training TFG soldiers (on matters ranging from infantry tactics to 
administration and accountability), and the presidential guard in charge of the TFG 
President&#8217;s personal security detail.35 The Ministry of Interior and National Security 
informed the Working Group that Bancroft&#8217;s agreement with the TFG was being reassessed 
in the context of the review of all previous contracts signed by the TFG with private 
security contractors. The review is being conducted by the National Security Commission 
established to regulate the activities of PMSCs, as described in paragraph 53 below.  
</p>
<p>43. Finally, the AMISOM Marine Commander and the Chief of Training, with whom 
the Working Group met in Mogadishu, indicated that Bancroft was contracted by UNMAS 
to work with AMISOM and the Somali National Forces under the auspices of AMISOM. 
Conversations and correspondence with UNMAS indicate that Bancroft was hired to 
provide training on explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and counter-IED to the Somali 
National Army for the last two years.36 UNMAS explained that Bancroft was contracted 
through the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). It confirmed that 
Bancroft is working with AMISOM as mentors for the Somali forces on IEDs.  
</p>
<p>44. Bancroft also operates (generally in partnership with other entities) a number of 
facilities in the Mogadishu area. Perhaps best-known among these are the two residential 
facilities that Bancroft operates within the Adan Abdulle International Airport. According 
to Bancroft, these premises were granted to AMISOM in accordance with the Status of 
Mission Agreement between the African Union and the Government of Somalia and 
&#8220;provide accommodation only to persons and organizations directly supporting the 
</p>
<p>AMISOM mission or its mandate, per authorization from the Force Headquarters.&#8221; 
Information from various sources indicated that, in addition, representatives of NGOs and 
the press, among others, have stayed at the facility at the invitation of Bancroft.  
</p>
<p>45. UNMAS informed the Working Group that security for its compound at the Adan 
Abdulle International Airport was provided by a company called African Skies, which is in 
turn contracted by Bancroft. Bancroft also informed the Working Group that it had entered 
into an agreement with the Government of Somalia to develop an international zone at 
Mogadishu&#8217;s old seaport and had commenced construction. Apparently, one of the intended 
residents of the facility subsequently took over the facility.

<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>46. There has been considerable speculation that Bancroft would take over from Saracen 
to train the PMPF. Although President Farole of Puntland indicated that he had reached 
some type of agreement with Bancroft in this regard, the Working Group was informed by 
Bancroft that it has not signed any agreements in connection with the PMPF. In September 
2012, Bancroft conducted a thorough audit and evaluation of the PMPF, including facilities 
assessments, equipment inventory, cantonment of significant military equipment, and 
personnel medical checks. During the course of that audit, Bancroft personnel noted 
ongoing violations of Security Council resolution 1425 (2002) regarding notifications 
pertaining to the arms embargo by certain non-Somali entities. On that basis, Bancroft 
requested, and received from AMISOM, concurrence to withdraw from any involvement 
with the PMPF. Bancroft informed the Working Group that its assessment report as well as 
multiple subsequent briefings, were delivered to the AMISOM Force Commander, Deputy 
Force Commander for Operations, and the Sector 1 Contingent Commander between 
September and the end of November 2012. Pending authorization from AMISOM Force 
Headquarters, Bancroft&#8217;s assessment document has been offered, but not yet delivered, to 
</p>
<p>the European Union EUCAP NESTOR project, the IMO, UNODC and UNDP. The 
Working Group did not seek, and Bancroft did not offer, access to the report.  
</p>
<p>47. Bancroft&#8217;s training and mentoring activities mean that it operates in or in close 
proximity to conflict zones and there have been reports of its employees&#8217; involvement in 
</p>
<p>kinetic operations. The Working Group did not find substantiated evidence of such 
allegations. Nonetheless, the question arises as to what procedures Bancroft &#8211; and the 
entities with which it works &#8211; have in place to ensure that Bancroft personnel do not 
become part of combat operations. In response to queries from the Working Group, 
Bancroft indicated its personnel were &#8220;as a matter of policy unarmed and by contractual 
commitment prohibited from taking any action that could compromise their status as non-
combatants.&#8221; With regard to Bancroft personnel who serve in proximity to, or engagement 
with, active members of AMISOM or Somali Defense Forces, Bancroft indicated &#8220;that they 
serve only in an advisory capacity&#8221; and that the only circumstance in which they could use 
</p>
<p>force &#8220;is when invoking their inherent right of self-defense using a weapon furnished on a 
temporary basis, <i>in extremis</i>, by AMISOM.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group welcomes Bancroft&#8217;s policy, but notes that it received reports 
of their personnel carrying weapons during at least some operations. Indeed, Bancroft&#8217;s 
Code of Conduct itself provides for the eventuality that its employees will be issued 
weapons &#8220;for training or self-defense purposes.&#8221; The Working Group also notes that 
Bancroft&#8217;s advisory role, particularly when it involves &#8220;mentoring&#8221; trainees in the field, can 
easily bleed into active participation in hostilities. In this regard, attention should be paid by 
both Bancroft and those who engage its services to develop rules to prevent such situations 
and to institute procedures to ensure that they are complied with. The Working Group was 
informed by UNMAS that to avoid this problem, their agreement with Bancroft requires 
that when conducting EOD and counter-IED operations, Bancroft employees must remain a 
minimum of 500 metres behind any front line. This type of rule might serve as an 
appropriate safeguard in other contracts as well.   
</p>
<p>49. Given the sensitivity of Bancroft&#8217;s operations, it is critical that it ensures that its 
employees are properly vetted and trained. Bancroft told the Working Group that their 
recruitment process includes a rigorous vetting process, but the Working Group has not 
been able to verify that claim.  
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group notes that at least one employee of Bancroft pleaded, and was 
found, guilty in a South African court of, inter alia, recruiting persons for mercenary </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>activities in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire37 and providing logistical support for the venture. Although this 
is only one individual, the nature of his activities naturally raises questions with regard to 
the adequacy of Bancroft&#8217;s vetting process.  
</p>
<p>51. Bancroft&#8217;s Code of Conduct requires its employees to comply with international 
human rights and humanitarian law, as well as national laws. The Working Group has no 
information, however, on what training, if any, is provided to Bancroft employees operating 
in Somalia on these matters.  
</p>
<p>52. In sum, Bancroft&#8217;s proximity to combat and the military nature of the training and 
mentoring that it provides requires that both Bancroft and those who engage its services 
exercise the utmost care in ensuring that these matters are clarified and memorialized. 
Transparency would of course be enhanced if these types of arrangements were made 
public.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>53. The Somali Parliament adopted a new Constitution in August 2012 that foresees the 
establishment by federal law of an independent National Security Commission composed of 
security experts from all sectors. Under article 111.H of the Constitution, the National 
Security Commission will be tasked with presenting proposals to ensure that human 
security is prioritized and incorporated into the national security framework; provide 
redress for abuses by security personal; demobilize militias and reintegrate them into 
society; and ensure civilian control of the armed forces. In accordance with article 130, 
Parliament is required to enact a law governing the structure, functions and levels of the 
security agencies in Somalia, as well as their purpose, and to enact amendments to the 
Constitution regulating PMSCs, which are yet to be adopted.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Registration and licensing process  
</b></p>
<p>54. In Somaliland, the Ministry of Interior conducted an analysis of the operations of 
PMSCs in Somaliland and released a Ministerial Decree on 20 October 2012. The decree 
announced a national policy on the registration and operation of Private Security 
Companies pending completion of the Somaliland Private Security Act (which is still being 
drafted). The decree states that the Somaliland administration is solely responsible for the 
safety and security of the United Nations, other international organizations and NGOs, and 
bans armed private security companies in Somaliland. It also provides that foreign security 
companies may not own more than 30 per cent of a Somaliland security company, and 
institutes a registration procedure with a set of criteria that must be met before security 
companies can be issued with a temporary license to operate in Somaliland.  
</p>
<p>55. This Ministerial decree was promulgated soon after international criticism over 
Saracen&#8217;s operations in Puntland. The Working Group was informed that according to an 
official of the Somaliland Ministry of Interior, this decree is aimed at preventing 
Somaliland from becoming a playground for foreign security companies, especially in 
anticipation of the possible start-up of oil-exploration operations.  
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group was informed that Puntland has no formal regulations or 
policies governing the registration and licensing of PMSCs. Foreign PMSCs are registered 
</p>
<p>  
 37 See High Court of South Africa (Transvaal Provincial Division), case number A2850/03 of 2 and 20 
</p>
<p>May 2005 (ZAGPHC 248).  </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>in their home countries and operate in Puntland with permission from Puntland  
Authorities. 
</p>
<p>57. In Mogadishu, the Minister of Interior and National Security informed the Working 
Group that in accordance with the Constitution, the Federal Government of Somalia has 
established a National Commission tasked with setting up rules and regulations for PMSCs. 
The current Government has requested the Commission to undertake an assessment of how 
licenses were granted to international PMSCs by the TFG, as well as a review of the 
agreements that the TFG had entered into with these companies. The Working Group was 
informed of the strong commitment of the Federal Government to ensure that regulations 
are in place to oversee PMSC activities in Somalia. The Minister expressed concern that the 
activities of companies may constitute a security threat for the country in light of the fragile 
security situation.  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group was informed that currently, the Ministry of Interior is 
responsible for issuing licenses to PMSCs after a review of the company&#8217;s profile, internal 
</p>
<p>regulations, its equipment and past experience. Companies&#8217; profiles and employees are 
reportedly checked by the Somali Police for verification of their criminal records. Licenses 
are subsequently issued for a specific activity. According to the Ministry of Interior, 
preference is given to local PMSCs. If a particular activity cannot be performed by 
domestic security companies, then foreign companies may be licensed to perform a 
particular task. The Working Group also met with the Somali Police Commissioner who 
indicated that once an application is received, he meets with the concerned PMSC and 
scrutinizes the employees. He then advises the Ministry of Interior on whether or not a 
license can be issued. The Working Group was informed that many applications had been 
submitted and were under review at the Ministry of Interior.  
</p>
<p>59. The Ministry of Interior shared with the Working Group a draft set of regulations 
governing the licensing process. The draft states that in order to be eligible for a license to 
operate in Somalia, a company must be Somali-owned. It must have a clear structure and 
bylaws, and be composed of Somali personnel who have not committed any crime against 
the public or the State. The structure of the company must be free from tribalism and 40 per 
cent of the security staff are required to have wide experience and expertise in security 
issues. The files of the staff hired by the company must be submitted to the Ministry for 
approval after verification by the police of whether they have a criminal record. They must 
also have adequate security training equivalent to the one given to the national security 
forces by institutions recognized by the State. The draft guidelines also state that the staff 
must wear a special uniform with a clear identification and badge. Their weapons and 
communications equipment must be licensed and registered by the Ministry. Only light 
weapons will be allowed and they can only be used for authorized purposes. A registration 
fee of US$2,000 is required.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Use of armed security aboard vessels  
</b></p>
<p>60. As governments have struggled to contain the spread of piracy in the Indian Ocean, 
shipping companies have turned to private military security companies to guarantee the 
safety of their crews and cargo. Maritime PMSCs have greatly expanded their operations 
protecting commercial shipping. Over 140 firms now operate in the region. No less than 26 
per cent of civilian ships transiting the Gulf of Aden officially declare the use of armed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>PMSCs on board. Meanwhile, some governments are hiring out their own national 
militaries as security guards on board ships.38  
</p>
<p>61. Financial considerations play an important role in the use of private security 
companies.39 Many insurance companies require shipowners to pay exorbitant surcharges 
on premiums if their vessels pass through pirate territory, or they refuse to insure the ships 
unless they have armed security personnel on board. Given the vast expanses of ocean 
involved, not to mention fiscal constraints, national navies are not well positioned to 
provide effective protection against pirates. But the use of armed guards aboard vessels 
raises difficult human rights issues as well, not least among which are the need to ensure 
that those performing these tasks are properly vetted and trained, clarity about the rules for 
the use of armed force and the reporting of incidents at sea, and how to achieve 
accountability in the event of human rights violations. Concerns have been expressed that 
deliberate and accidental violence could escalate as a result of allowing armed guards on 
ships and some have argued that the use of armed operatives could encourage pirates to use 
more violence when hijacking a ship.40 The recent high-profile incident in which Italian 
marines allegedly shot and killed Indian fishermen in the belief that they were pirates 
illustrates some of the issues raised by the use of armed security (whether provided by 
PMSCs or governments) aboard ships.   
</p>
<p>62. In the absence of clear and specific rules, the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) has taken the lead in developing guidance. IMO&#8217;s Interim guidance to private 
maritime security companies providing privately contracted armed security personnel on 
board ships in the high risk area (MSC.1/Circ.1443), issued May 2012, calls on PMSCs to 
have verifiable, written internal policies and procedures for determining the suitability of 
persons to be deployed as such personnel (PCASP), including checking their criminal 
records and employment history. Further to the guidance, PMSCs should ensure that 
personnel working for them have a complete understanding of, and fully comply with, the 
applicable laws governing the use of force. In particular, they should take all reasonable 
steps to avoid the use of force and, if force is used, it should be used as part of a graduated 
response plan, and not exceed what is strictly necessary and reasonable in the 
circumstances. Care should be taken to minimize damage and injury and to respect and 
preserve human life; and PMSC personnel should only use firearms against persons in self-
defence or in defence of others.  
</p>
<p>63. IMO&#8217;s Revised interim guidance to shipowners, ship operators and shipmasters on 
the use of privately contracted armed security personnel on board ships in the high risk area<b> </b> (MSC.1/Circ.1405/Rev.2), dated May 2012,  requires the shipmaster to maintain a log of 
every circumstance in which firearms are discharged, whether accidental or deliberate. 
Such actions should be fully documented in sufficient detail in order to produce a formal 
written report of the incident, for the shipowner/operator to forward to the flag State. The 
guidance indicates that a formal written report should include the time and location of the 
incident; details of events leading up to the incident; and written statements by all witnesses 
and those involved from the ship's crew and security team in the incident; the identity and 
details of personnel involved in the incident; details of the incident; injuries and/or material 
damage sustained during the incident; and lessons learned from the incident and, where 
applicable, recommended procedures to prevent the recurrence of the incident. In the event 
that an armed guard uses force, his or her team leader should be advised to photograph (if 
appropriate), log, report and collate contemporaneous written statements from PCASP 
present at the incident in anticipation of legal proceedings. In addition to incident reporting, 
</p>
<p>  
 38 James Brown, &#8220;Pirates and Privateers&#8221;, (see footnote 10).  
 39 Ibid. 
 40 House of Commons, <i>Piracy off the coast of Somalia</i>, (see footnote 11), p. 23, para. 28.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>the guidance suggests that following a tour of duty, the PCASP team should submit a full 
report to the shipowner/ship operator via their employers, if required, giving full details of 
the deployment, operational matters, any training and/or ship hardening conducted, and 
offering advice as to any further enhancements to security that may be considered.  
</p>
<p>64. In search of operational guidance, 238 maritime PMSCs have signed the 
International Code of Conduct for private security service providers41 even though the Code 
does not include specific rules for this context.  
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group is of the view that the maritime security industry requires a 
binding regulatory regime that is consistent with the rules for PMSC activities on land, but 
takes into account the specific context in which these companies operate.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights impact  
</b></p>
<p>66. There are a number of ways in which the human rights impact of the activities of 
PMSCs operating in Somalia can be measured. To begin with, the activities of PMSCs 
could be regarded as broadly deleterious to the security situation in the country. The 
activities of Saracen vis-&#224;-vis the PMPF discussed in detail above are an example of such 
activity, both in terms of being outside the approved Somali security structure and with 
regard to the human rights violations that have been reported.  
</p>
<p>67. Several stakeholders expressed concern that the improving security situation in 
Somalia could lead to an influx of international PMSCs, particularly if the Security Council 
arms embargo on Somalia (which acts as a deterrent) were lifted. Concerns were expressed 
that much-needed reforms of Government security forces would receive less attention and 
resources because the security of international actors would be assured through the use of 
private guards.   
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group notes the ongoing efforts of the Federal Government of 
Somalia to regulate the activities of PMSCs operating in Somalia. At the moment, however, 
the regulatory structure is minimal and requires significant improvements.   
</p>
<p>69. With regard to maritime security companies, the Working Group was provided with 
information about circumstances suggestive of unreported human rights violations, 
including instances where skiffs had been found drifting at sea carrying dead bodies, with 
their engines showing traces of gun shots. In other instances, the bodies found had been 
shot and left at sea. It was pointed out that the combination of cost incurred when ships are 
required to bring imprisoned pirates to shore and the lack of binding and enforceable 
reporting obligations for PMSCs may incentivize armed guards to kill rather than capture. 
While the IMO guidance discussed above suggests stringent reporting requirements, these 
may not be implemented which leaves a potentially large accountability gap.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>As Somalia rebuilds its security institutions after more than two decades of 
internal conflict, PMSCs often fulfil a demand for protection from a wide variety of 
</b></p>
<p><b>clients, including multinational companies, governmental and non-governmental 
</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>organizations. The majority of these actors told the Working Group that they would 
</b></p>
<p><b>not be able to operate in Somalia without the assistance of PMSCs.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>One of the principal human rights concerns articulated to the Working Group 
was that as rebuilding efforts in Somalia get underway, there will be an influx of 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign PMSCs without sufficient regulation and control by the Government. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>result would be hastened if the Security Council lifts the arms embargo that has thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>far made it difficult for international PMSCs to operate in Somalia. This could 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase instability in an already fragile security environment and, as PMSC 
</b></p>
<p><b>employees interact with the civilian population, raise the sceptre of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of the type documented by the Working Group in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>In this regard, the Working Group notes with approval the ongoing efforts of 
the Federal Government to set rules governing the registration and regulation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>PMSCs in Somalia through the National Security Commission. In addition to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopting regulations, the Working Group recommends that the Government ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that any licensing regime it establishes is not limited to one-time vetting, but includes 
</b></p>
<p><b>ongoing monitoring, and that sufficient resources are allocated to allow the system to 
</b></p>
<p><b>function. The National Security Commission should also ensure that there are 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms to ensure the accountability of PMSCs in the event of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations. The Working Group would welcome the opportunity to provide the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Federal Government of Somalia with information on other national licensing regimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>to assist it in designing an effective system. The Working Group also recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Somali Government provide for the collection and dissemination of information 
</b></p>
<p><b>about the activities of PMSCs operating in the country. The Working Group urges the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Federal Government to ensure that initiatives taken to develop legal regimes or 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish institutions include the involvement and participation of regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrations. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group further notes that the principal responsibility for the 
security of the Somali people lies with the Government and cautions that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>outsourcing of security functions to private actors should not distract from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential work of building the official Somali security sector.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>With regard to companies providing military training, the Working Group 
notes that the particularly sensitive nature of these assignments underscores the need 
</b></p>
<p><b>for strict regulation. These types of operations should be brought within the ambit of 
</b></p>
<p><b>any regulatory scheme developed by the National Commission. At the very least, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>contractual arrangements for such training should include strict vetting and training 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements (e.g. to maintain a certain distance from the front line or area of 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostilities), as well as rules to ensure that trainers and mentors do not participate in 
</b></p>
<p><b>kinetic operations. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>As detailed by the Monitoring Group, the PMSC Saracen provided military 
training and equipment to the Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) in violation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Security Council regulations. There are allegations of human rights abuses of trainees 
</b></p>
<p><b>by Saracen, some of which have been substantiated by the Monitoring Group. While 
</b></p>
<p>the bulk of Saracen&#8217;s training activities appear to have been concluded, foreign 
</p>
<p><b>contractors continue to support the PMPF in various capacities, without any clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability structure. Moreover, since the PMPF operates outside the legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework for security forces, there is a risk </b>&#8211;<b> which has been borne out by several 
</b></p>
<p><b>incidents reported to the Working Group </b>&#8211;<b> that it will be used for purposes other than 
</b></p>
<p><b>its anti-piracy mission. The Working Group urges the authorities to integrate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>force into the agreed Somali national security structure and ensure that it is used 
</b></p>
<p><b>strictly for the purposes for which it is intended. Any PMSC employees providing </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>training to the PMPF should be subject to regulation and oversight by the appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group welcomes the United Nations</b>&#8217;<b> efforts to ensure that 
private security providers have a clean human rights record and encourages all 
</b></p>
<p><b>elements of the United Nations to take a proactive approach to this issue. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group takes note of the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy (HRDDP) 
</b></p>
<p><b>endorsed by the Secretary-General in July 2011 which constitutes a landmark 
</b></p>
<p><b>measure to ensure that the United Nations lives up to its own normative standards by 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteeing that its support to national and regional security forces is consistent with 
</b></p>
<p>the organization&#8217;s purposes and principles in the Charter and its obligations under 
</p>
<p><b>international law to respect, promote and encourage respect for international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. The Working Group recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations also consider applying the principles contained in the HRDDP 
</b></p>
<p><b>when hiring private security contractors.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>With regard to maritime security companies, the Working Group was provided 
with information about circumstances suggestive of unreported human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations. The Working Group is of the view that binding international regulations 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be developed to regulate the use of armed guards on board ships.   
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>In the light of the above observations, the Working Group recommends that 
the Federal Government of Somalia:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Require PMSCs to obtain an operating license, valid for a limited and 
</b></p>
<p><b>renewable period or for specific services, or individuals to register or obtain a license 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to carry out military or security services for PMSCs; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Allocate adequate resources and trained personnel to handle 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorizations properly and timely; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Take into account, within available means, the past conduct of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>PMSCs and their personnel, which includes ensuring that all PMSCs have no reliably 
</b></p>
<p><b>attested record of involvement in serious crime (including organized crime, violent 
</b></p>
<p><b>crime, sexual offences, violations of international humanitarian law, bribery and 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Obtain assurance that all PMSC personnel are sufficiently trained, both 
</b></p>
<p><b>prior to any deployment and on an ongoing basis, to respect relevant national law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law and human rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that the contractual arrangements with PMSCs providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>military training include strict vetting and training requirements, as well as rules to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that trainers and mentors do not participate in kinetic operations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Provide for the collection and dissemination of information about the 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities of PMSCs operating in the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Have in place appropriate rules on the use of force and firearms by 
</b></p>
<p><b>PMSCs and their personnel, such as:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>using force and firearms only when necessary in self-defence or defence 
</b></p>
<p><b>of third persons, 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>immediately reporting to and cooperation with competent authorities in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the case of use of force and firearms;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(h) Monitor compliance with the terms of the authorization, in particular:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)  establish or designate an adequately resourced monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>authority; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii)  ensure that the civilian population is informed about the rules of 
</b></p>
<p><b>conduct by which PMSCs have to abide and available complaint 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii)  requesting local authorities to report on misconduct by PMSCs or 
</b></p>
<p><b>their personnel;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv)  investigate reports of wrongdoing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Impose administrative measures, if it is determined that a PMSC has 
</b></p>
<p><b>operated without or in violation of an authorization; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Consider establishing corporate criminal responsibility for crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed by a PMSC, consistent with the Somalia national legal system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Strengthen its control over the security sector and ensure that the PMPF 
</b></p>
<p><b>is integrated into the national Somali forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Consider ratifying the International Convention against the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries and the Organization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenaries in Africa.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Working Group recommends that the international community ensure 
adequate oversight of all PMSCs contracted, in particular by making regular 
</b></p>
<p><b>background checks of PMSCs hired, by screening PMSC</b>s&#8217;<b> records, and regarding any 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations, by practising transparent bidding processes and ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency by publicly releasing the operative clauses of contracts with PMSCs.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Working Group further recommends that binding international 
regulations should be developed to regulate the use of armed guards on board ships.</b>
