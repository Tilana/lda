<p><b>Comments by the Government of the Sudan on the Report of 
the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in 
the Sudan (A/HRC/27/69) 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to the HRC resolution 24/28 of 8 October 2013, the Government of the 
Republic of Sudan welcomed the two visits of the Independent Expert to the Sudan in 
February and June 2014. The Government fully cooperated and positively engaged with the 
Independent Expert and allowed him full access to different states of the country upon his 
request, and provided him with the necessary information to determine the technical 
assistance needs. 
</p>
<p>2. The Government of the Republic of Sudan welcomes and appreciates the thankful 
words expressed by the Independent Expert in the report to the government for granting 
access and facilitating his visits to Khartoum, North Darfur, East Darfur, Central Darfur, 
South Kordofan, and Blue Nile that reflects the spirit of cooperation. The degree and level 
of Government engagement is clearly reflected in paragraph (7) of the report. The 
Independent Expert was able to meet and discuss with five relevant Federal Ministers, an 
assistant to the President of the Republic, Governers of the States, as well as many other 
senior officials.  
</p>
<p>3. The Government of the Republic of the Sudan notes with regret that the considerable 
information, the written and verbal data, the response for the urgent appeals which were 
provided to the Independent Expert during his visit to the country including presentations 
by senior officials are merely reflected in the report. However, more attention is given to 
other resources such as NGOs and other entities. 
</p>
<p>4. The report identified many positive and promising steps and measures undertaken by 
the Government and other stakeholders during the reporting period, that such as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establishment of villages for IDPs with facilities to encourage the voluntary 
return with the support of the State of Qatar (Par 10, page 6) 
&#8226; The national  initiate of linking development to human  rights particularly  in 
rural areas, especially after the success of this initiative in South Kordofan State 
(Para 16). 
&#8226; NCHR four years National Strategic Plan for the protection and promotion of 
human rights, described as &quot;promising&quot;.(Para 26) 
&#8226; Ministry of Education programme regarding human rights education, as a 
part of the implementation of the ten years National Action Plan on protecting and 
promoting human rights. (Para 26) 
</p>
<p>The potential seen in the above mentioned points requires a strong call of support to 
International community to provide technical assistance to these promising steps, however, 
such a call is not detected in the recommendations of this report to the different parties 
particularly the international Community. The government regrets the negligence of these 
important steps and measures, particularly, because providing recommendations on 
technical assistance represents the core of the mandate of the Independent Expert as 
specified in HRC resolution 24/28. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/69/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>. </b>3 
</p>
<p><b> II. Comments 
</b>5. Paragraph (4): the report indicates that the Government of the Sudan did not give 
authorization to the Independent Expert to visit Kassala and Khor Abeche IDP camp due to 
security and administrative concerns. As mentioned above the Independent Expert was 
given full access to all parts of the Sudan during his two visits in 2014,it is important to add 
some clarifications regarding the reasons that hinders realization of the Independent Expert 
request to visit Both Kassala state, and Khor Abeche IDP camp. 
</p>
<p>a. Regarding the Kassala state, the visit was not conducted due to time 
constraint. As a practical alternative the Government arranged a meeting with the 
Commissioner of Refugees in which detailed and thorough presentations were 
presented to the Independent Expert by the Commissioner of Refugees and senior 
and technical staff of the Commission of Refugees regarding the situation in 
Refugee Camps and related challenges and efforts exerted by the government to 
address them, as well as the needs of technical assistance and capacity building. lt is 
regrettable that the report failed to mention neither the meeting nor the information 
provided. 
</p>
<p>b. Regarding the Khor Abechi case, the visit was not requested in the 
Independent Expert's programme, security reasons was also a major factor that was 
clearly explained. 
</p>
<p>6. Paragraph (7): During his last visit to Sudan the Independent Expert had an 
official meeting in Khartoum with Dr. Amin Hassan Omar Government chief negotiator 
for peace in Darfur. The report missed to mention this important meeting. 
</p>
<p>7. Paragraph (8): line 4 of the report: mentioned &quot;victims of human rights violations ...&quot; 
since it is not decidedly proved that the ones mentioned in that phrase are &quot;victims&quot; or that 
they are victims of &quot;human rights violations&quot;. The word &quot;victims&quot; has to be qualified by 
adding a word like &quot;alleged&quot; for the sake of accuracy and professionalism. 
</p>
<p>8. Paragraph (9): While agreeing to the emphasis put on the impact of armed conflicts 
as a major factor in human rights challenges the Government regrets that the report failed to 
mention or analyze the ample information rendered to the Independent Expert by the 
Special Prosecutor for Darfur, including the measures taken to prevent impunity. 
</p>
<p>9. Paragraph (11): The Government would like to clarify that it is the aim and 
commitment of the Government to improve the situation of all the prisons in the country to 
perform their reformatory role similar to the example of Alhuda prison commended in the 
report, the ministry of interior put an ambitious plan that does not exclude Zalenje. The 
situation of Zalenje prison reflects the negative impact of the armed conflict on the 
institutions in affected states. 
</p>
<p>10. Paragraph (18): the conclusion of this paragraph seems to reverse the correlation 
between the effective implementation of his recommendations to the Government and 
international community's responsibility in supporting technical assistance and capacity 
building, by implying that implementation by the Government comes first and then the 
latter follows; whereas such assistance is needed for the very objective of implementing 
those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>11. Paragraph (19): the last three lines of this paragraph (about 25 words) summarily 
reached the inculpating conclusion that denies any significant improvement in the 
protection of human rights, in antecedence of the premise and adequate <i>ratio decidendi.</i> 
</p>
<p>12. Paragraph 23: the Government responded to the urgent appeal concerning Mohamed 
Salah and three others by the ACHR Rapporteur dated 2 June 2014. A copy of the response </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/69/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>4<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>was delivered to the Independent Expert during his 5th visit to Sudan. However, all the 
three mentioned young persons were released on 11 July 2014 after the investigations with 
them were completed. The Independent Expert is requested to reflect with full transparency 
all the important information that provided to him (verbally or by documents) during his 
meeting with the Sudanese officials. 
</p>
<p>13. Paragraph (28): It is important to stress that the state has indeed a duty to defend its 
citizens, territories and institutions. The Government, here, also regrets that the report does 
not give consideration to the information presented to the Independent Expert by the 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) representatives in an official meeting during his visit to 
Sudan in February 2014, on the rules that govern the work of armed forces and its 
compliance with international humanitarian law, SAF professionalism. The 
accountability and disciplinary measures of SAF members in cases of infringement are also 
reflected as well as the system for victim compensation. 
</p>
<p>14. Paragraph (29): While discussing the implementation of Independent Expert 
recommendations the report neglects to mention the information (verbal and documental) 
rendered to the Independent Expert during his official meetings with different officials and 
stakeholders. These include enlightenment on the guarantees provided for by the National 
Security Act by senior NlSS officers, as well as briefing on women empowerment policy by 
the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security. 
</p>
<p>15. Paragraph (40): The briefing made to the Independent Expert was a summary on the 
ongoing investigation process including measures taken, and facts found to that date. It was 
not a final and complete report. The briefing did not state that the investigation had been 
finalized, it is continuing and a considerable progress has made in the process of 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>16. Paragraph (36): It is worth mentioning that the case submitted for trial referred to in 
paragraph 36 of the report, in which the court discharged the accused for lack of sufficient 
evidence and hence an appeal was lodged by the public prosecution, has been reopened by 
the Court of Appeal in its decision made on 26 August 2014. The Court decided that the 
court of first instance was wrong in weighing the evidence adduced by the prosecution, and 
ordered that the accused be re-arrested and the trial be continued. lt was not stated in the 
brief report that &quot;it was not impossible to locate any of those who shot and killed..&quot;, it was 
just mentioned that the prosecution authorities have been encountered with a difficulty in 
identifying the forces operating in the location concerned, for the reasons given in the 
report.  So the Independent Expert's judgment that it is &quot;morally and legally unacceptable&quot; 
is hasty and unjustifiable. 
</p><p>17. Paragraph (41): The call by the Independent Expert on the Government to form 'an 
independent judicial public enquiry' in the report does not include the reasons for it since 
the public prosecution is competent and willing to assume such investigation. 
</p>
<p>18. Paragraph (42): (shooting of a University of Khartoum student); the paragraph does 
not refer to the U. Of K Vice-chancellor's affirmation to the Independent Expert during the 
mentioned official meeting that no police forces are allowed to enter the University campus 
and that the shooting incidence occurred from within the mob which comprised intra-mural 
students, graduates and students from other universities. However the case was actually 
seized of by the public prosecution, entered as criminal information at the police northern 
section in Khartoum on 11 March 2014 and investigation of the case is on-going. 
</p>
<p>19. Paragraph (43): The citation quoted from the Sudan's 2nd periodic report to the 
ICCPR Human Rights Committee in 1997 that &quot;section 126 of the Criminal Act 1991 does 
not make conversion from Islam an offense, but only the manifestation of such conversion 
is such manifestation adversely affect public safety&quot;, has been well recognized and affirmed 
by the Court of Appeal in the case of Abrar Alhadi (known in the media as Meriam </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/69/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>. </b>5 
</p>
<p>Ibrahim). The Court in interpreting section 126 of the Criminal Act 1991 quoted the jurist 
Dr. Awad H. Alnour that &quot;the Sudanese law does not punish for bare conversion unless 
such conversion is incorporated into propagation, and this element is raised by Islamic 
Scholars whose opinion is that apostasy is not applicable save to combatant apostate and 
not to a Muslim who merely changes his/her religion, and the Sudanese law adopted this 
view&quot;. Since this ruling has become final, and according to section 3 (a) (iv) of the 
Principles of Judicial Verdicts 1983, it constitutes a judicial precedence to be followed by 
courts in any potential similar cases. 
</p>
<p>20. Paragraph (46): The detention of Ibrahim At-Sheikh, as in the case of former 
detention of Al Sadiq Al Mahdi, is not a produce of an administrative arrest or detention. A 
pending criminal proceeding was initiated against him in accordance with the Criminal Act, 
the Criminal Procedures Act and the due process of law. Ibrahim Al- Sheikh's case is now 
submitted for trial by a competent court of law. The two abovementioned political leaders 
were not arrested by the NISS, complaints were filed against them under the Criminal Act. 
After the due process, the detention of Al Sadig Elmahadi was terminated in June 2014 by a 
decision of the Minister of justice under the criminal procedures Act (1991). The case of 
Ibrahim El Sheikh is now submitted for trial by a competent court. 
</p>
<p>21. Paragraph (49-53) (National dialogue): on 9 August 2014, the President of the 
Republic announced the start of the Societal dialogue Initiative in furtherance of the 
previously declared national dialogue. A road map has been agreed upon, which identified 
the aims and objects of the dialogue and the requests for making a conducive sphere for the 
dialogue including, inter alia, release of all political detainees, guarantee of fundamental 
political freedoms and freedom of expression, ensure the personal safety guarantees to 
leaders of rebel movements to engage in the dialogue with the view to maintain peace and  
security  in the  pockets  of rebel  movement  activities  in  Darfur,  South  Kordofan  and 
Blue Nile. 
</p>
<p>22. Paragraph (54): Salmah Center was not registered as a non- profitable association or 
an NGO at the Registrar of Voluntary Organizations of the Humanitarian Aid Commission. 
It was registered as a limited company under the Companies Act 1925, and was struck out 
of the register by the General Registrar of Companies in accordance with the provisions of 
this Act. 
</p>
<p>23. Paragraph (60): no reference is made in this paragraph to the provisions in the 
National Security Act 2010 that bestow on the detainee all the rights and guarantees and the 
availability of a considerable number of mechanisms and modalities of means of control 
and remedy, although all these guarantees and mechanism were well explained to the 
Independent Expert during his meeting with NISS. The commanding formula that &quot;the 
Government should revoke the NSA 2010&quot; is a bit unfair to be directed to a sovereign State 
in exercising its rights in the protection of its security and public safety like all other States, 
in accordance with  international  law and covenants. 
</p>
<p>24. Paragraph (61): General statements made on upsurge in armed conflicts, 
deterioration of the humanitarian and human rights situations, increased incidence of SGBV 
without specification of statistics. Regrettably, this is not an evidence based statement 
expected in an expert report. 
</p>
<p>25. Paragraph (66): The report states that the incidents of SGBV remain high in IDP's 
camps without specification. With regard to the specific case of five women who were 
killed the report gives no details about the incident or the resource of credible information 
on which it is based. Furthermore, this case was never raised during the Independent 
Expert's visits to Sudan and his meetings with the officials concerned. Both the local 
traditional leaderships and official authority in Hajer and the surroundings denied their 
knowledge of the story of those five women. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/69/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>6<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>26. Paragraph (67): The report mentioned the absence of government security forces in 
many IDP camps, the Government would like to clarify that in respect to Kalma IDP camp, 
upon a mutual agreement  it is under the responsibility  of the UNAMID. The Government 
welcomes revising the situation if recommended by the Independent Expert for the sake of 
enhancing security inside the camp. Police forces are present at the perimeter of the camp. 
</p>
<p>The government is working with UNAMID to develop a manual for training female police 
on criminal investigation, and 500 jobs of female police officer have been assigned to the 
state of Western Darfur in 2013, in addition to the establishment of two offices for female 
investigation police including officer ranks in Nyala (Southern Darfur) and Al- Fasher 
(Northern Darfur). 
</p><p>27. Paragraphs (69 - 71): (humanitarian access and Government's suspension of ICRC 
activities); the report gave no consideration to the information presented to the Independent 
Expert by government officials on the measures taken by the government to guarantee and 
facilitate humanitarian access. The Independent Expert was informed that an agreement 
being negotiated with ICRC and expected to be signed soon. Fortunately enough the said 
agreement was signed on 28 August 2014 as expected. With regard to the vaccination 
access to conflict areas, hindrance of access is mainly caused by lack of cooperation of the 
rebel movements in this regard.
