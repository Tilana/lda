Our Philosophy 
 
We work for our shareholders. 
 
Our share price is the only measure of our success. 
 
If we make profit we must share it with our shareholders. 
 
Diversification provides stability.   
 
Strong and un-geared balance sheet – wary of debt.

The Rear View Mirror 
 
Diggers 2015 – Last Year
• Metals X had lost its market relevance.
• Metals X moved into gold in a counter-cyclical move.  
    The market rewarded this move and rewarded our shareholders. 
 
• Metals X moved into copper in a counter-cyclical move.  
 
 
•
The market hated that and punished as for it.
I also talked about our philosophy’s:
-   Performance, Dividends and Growth. 
 -   That we worked for our shareholders.
• A CEO’s only true KPI is the share price.

Aditya Birla Acquisition Strategy
Nifty - another mine where we believed we could make significant 
improvement and make some money for our shareholders. 
Nifty - another acquisition where we buy a massive amount of plant 
and infrastructure at a fraction of its replacement cost. 
Nifty - an underperforming mine purchased on a going-concern basis 
with excellent upside and hugely under-explored potential to find more. 
A Bargain !! - Where we pay just above net cash and working capital. 
The commodity – Copper, which we believe is about to turn following 
massive supply cuts in response to low prices. 
A good fit in our base metals division and a catalyst to consider strategic 
and structural change of the group asset portfolio.
