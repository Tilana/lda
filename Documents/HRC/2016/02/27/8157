<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/36 and 16/4. The Special 
Rapporteur undertook a mission to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory from 6 to 17 
December 2011 to examine the situation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
In the present report, the Special Rapporteur outlines his main issues of concern in Israel, 
the West Bank, and Gaza vis-&#224;-vis the respective obligations of the Government of Israel, 
the Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities.  
</p>
<p> In Israel, the Special Rapporteur raises his concern regarding recent attempts to 
diminish the space for criticism within Israel regarding its policies and practices of 
occupation, including the adoption of a series of restrictive laws by the Knesset. He also 
notes the discriminatory treatment of Palestinian citizens of Israel and attempts to curtail 
their right to freedom of opinion and expression.

<p>In the occupied Palestinian territory, the Special Rapporteur highlights the obstacles 
faced by journalists in undertaking their work, primarily as a result of restrictions to their 
freedom of movement imposed by the Government of Israel, and the internal division 
between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the de facto authorities in Gaza.  
</p>
<p> In the West Bank, the Special Rapporteur express his concern regarding the 
worrying trend of an increasing number of journalists, human rights defenders and bloggers 
who are arbitrarily detained and interrogated by the security forces of the Palestinian 
Authority for expressing critical views. He also highlights undue restrictions imposed on 
the right to freedom of assembly by the Israel Security Forces as an area of concern.  
</p>
<p> In East Jerusalem, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the restrictions imposed 
by the Government of Israel on the right of Palestinians to seek, receive and impart ideas 
and opinions.  
</p>
<p> In Gaza, the Special Rapporteur raises his concerns regarding various restrictions 
imposed by the de facto authorities on the rights to freedom of expression and of assembly.  
</p>
<p> The report concludes with recommendations to the Government of Israel, the 
Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities in Gaza regarding the main issues of 
concern.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, carried out a visit to Israel and the occupied 
Palestinian territory from 6 to 17 December 2011, at the invitation of the Government of 
Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In Israel, he visited West Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Be&#8223;er 
Sheva and other surrounding villages in the Negev desert. In the occupied Palestinian 
territory, he visited East Jerusalem, Ramallah, Nabi Saleh and Gaza.  
</p>
<p>2. The visit was undertaken with a view to contributing, through effective engagement 
with all interlocutors, to efforts aimed at enhancing the enjoyment of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression for all, without discrimination of any kind. The Special Rapporteur 
thanks both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority for their invitation and 
the cooperation extended to him before and during the visit.  
</p>
<p>3. In Israel, the Special Rapporteur met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of Intelligence and Atomic Energy, Dan Meridor; Spokesperson of the Prime Minister&#8223;s 
Office; Deputy Foreign Minister, Daniel Ayalon; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs; Deputy Director General for International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Eviatar Manor; Minister of Improvement of Government Services; Spokeswoman 
for the Minister of Internal Security; Director of the Human Rights Unit at the Ministry of 
Justice; Director-General of the Ministry of Communications; Minister of Education; Judge 
Eliakim Rubinstein of the Supreme Court; the Speaker and three Members of the Knesset; 
State Comptroller (Ombudsman); Deputy Mayor of Tel Aviv; and Head of the Central 
Command of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).  
</p>
<p>4. In the occupied Palestinian territory, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the 
Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice, Minister of 
Telecommunications and Information Technology, Minister of Women&#8223;s Affairs, Deputy 
Minister of Information and Media Affairs, Chief Justice of the Higher Judicial Council, 
representatives of the Palestinian Broadcasting Authority, members of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council, Head of Preventive Security, Deputy Minister of Interior, and Head of 
General Intelligence Services. He also met with the representatives of the de facto 
authorities in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>5. In addition, the Special Rapporteur met with journalists, human rights defenders, 
lawyers, and community leaders in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, as well as 
with representatives from the United Nations country team and the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Ramallah. He wishes to express his sincere 
appreciation for the outstanding support provided to him by the staff of OHCHR and its 
office in the occupied Palestinian territory.  
</p>
<p><b> II. International legal standards  
</b></p>
<p>6. In carrying out his assessment of the situation regarding the enjoyment of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, the 
Special Rapporteur is guided primarily by article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which provides that: 
</p>
<p>(a)  Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference; 
</p>
<p>(b)  Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice; 
</p>
<p>(c)  The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries 
with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, 
but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: 
</p>
<p>(i)  For respect of the rights or reputations of others; 
</p>
<p>(ii)  For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of 
public health or morals. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, where relevant, given that peaceful assemblies and demonstrations 
constitute a form of expressing grievances and opinions, particularly in situations where 
media freedom is limited, article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights is also relevant to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>8. The legal framework of the mandate also includes relevant provisions of 
international humanitarian law, in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their 
Additional Protocols. As emphasized for example by the Human Rights Committee in its 
general comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general legal obligation imposed on 
States parties to the Covenant, the application of international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law is not mutually exclusive, but is complementary (para. 11). 
With regard to the applicability in the occupied Palestinian territory of certain rules of 
international humanitarian law and human rights instruments, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to refer to the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004, 
where this issue is discussed in detail.1  
</p>
<p><b> III. International human rights obligations  
</b></p>
<p>9. Israel has acceded to the main United Nations human rights instruments,2 including 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. With regard to the applicability of 
the Covenant in the occupied Palestinian territory, the Special Rapporteur underscores that 
the international human rights obligations of Israel continue to apply in territories under its 
effective control, as well as during armed conflict.3  
</p>
<p>10. The Palestinian Authority, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian 
Legislative Council have made numerous statements and undertakings through which they 
have declared themselves bound by international human rights obligations.4  
</p>
<p>11. Although control over the Gaza Strip was officially transferred from Israel to the 
Palestinian Authority in 2005, it has been under the control of the de facto authorities 
following the Palestinian Legislative Council elections of January 2006. At the same time, 
despite the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza strip, the legal responsibility of Israel 
as the occupying power in Gaza has not ceased, as it continues to exercise control over 
Gazan airspace, territorial waters and land access.  
</p>

para. 5.  
</p>

occupied Arab territories, A/HRC/8/17, para. 8; and A/HRC/12/37, para. 7.   </p>

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>12. Additionally, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank remains 
limited, as Israel exercises exclusive control over approximately 62 per cent of the 
territory.5 The Palestinian Authority only exercises control over security and civil matters in 
Palestinian urban areas (&#8220;Area A&#8221;) and civil matters in Palestinian rural areas (&#8220;Area B&#8221;), 
while the remainder of the territories, including bypass roads between Palestinian 
communities in the West Bank, is under the exclusive control of the Government of Israel 
(&#8220;Area C&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>13. With respect to the de facto authorities in Gaza, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights has stressed that &#8220;non-State actors that exercise 
government-like functions and control over a territory are obliged to respect human rights 
norms when their conduct affects the human rights of the individuals under their control&#8221; 
(A/HRC/12/37, para. 7). The de facto authorities have also made public statements that they 
are committed to respect international human rights and humanitarian law (A/HRC/8/17, 
paras. 8&#8211;9). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main issues of concern in Israel  
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the vibrant media landscape in Israel, 
where divergent opinions are openly exchanged. However, he underscores the importance 
of preventing undue media dominance or concentration by privately controlled media 
groups, as noted by the Human Rights Committee.6 He would also like to raise the 
following issues of concern in Israel. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Lack of sufficient protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression in domestic legislation 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the absence of a formal constitution, Israel has enacted a set of Basic Laws that 
set forth the State&#8223;s main institutions and fundamental rights. Among these, the most 
important is the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty (1992), amended in 1994. 
However, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, as well as a general provision for 
equality and non-discrimination, are lacking in the Basic Law. Furthermore, the Penal Code 
of 1977 contains several vaguely and broadly worded definitions of incitement, in 
contravention of international standards.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur notes that despite the lack of an explicit reference to the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression in the Basic Law on Human Dignity and 
Liberty, the Supreme Court has contributed to safeguarding the right through its case law. 
For example, in response to the ban imposed by the Israeli Film Board on a film entitled 
<i>Jenin, Jenin</i> on the premise that it presented a distorted version of events, the Supreme 
Court in 2003 affirmed that &#8220;the fact that the film includes lies is not enough to justify a 
</p>
<p>ban&#8221;, and that the film board&#8223;s decision &#8220;infringes on freedom of expression above and 
beyond what is necessary&#8221;. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur underscores that, as a 
</p>

</p>
<p> 6 CCPR/C/GC/34, para.40.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Israel is required to 
fully guarantee this right in its domestic legislation.7  
</p>
<p>17. The Israeli Penal Code contains several provisions that restrict the right to freedom 
of expression, including expression that constitutes incitement to racism, violence or terror. 
Publication of materials to incite racism, as well as any calls to &#8220;commit an act of violence 
or terror, or praise, words of approval, encouragement, support or identification with an act 
of violence or  terror&#8221;, is subject to five years&#8223; imprisonment (art. 1 A, paras. 144B and 
144D2, respectively). Moreover, possession of publication that incites violence or terror is 
punishable by one year of imprisonment (para. 144D3). Furthermore, if a person &#8220;acts by 
speech in a public place or at a public gathering or by publishing to incite hostile acts 
against the Government of a friendly state&#8221;, the individual is liable to three years&#8223; 
imprisonment (art. 5, para. 166). 
</p>
<p>18. In addition, under article 7, paragraph 173, of the Penal Code, a person who 
&#8220;publishes any printed, writing, picture, or effigy calculated to outrage the religious feelings 
</p>
<p>or belief of other persons&#8221;, or who &#8220;utters in a public place and in the hearing of another 
</p>
<p>person any word or sound calculated to outrage his religious feelings or belief&#8221; is liable to 
</p>
<p>one year&#8223;s imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>19. While article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires 
States to prohibit by law any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, the Special Rapporteur is concerned 
about the vague and broad terms used in the aforementioned provisions, such as &#8220;words of 
approval&#8221; or &#8220;identification&#8221; with an act of violence or terror, inciting &#8220;hostile acts against 
the Government of a friendly state&#8221;, and prohibition of expressions which &#8220;outrage the 
religious feelings or belief of other persons&#8221;. Moreover, he finds that making mere 
possession of a publication which may incite violence or terror an offence punishable by 
imprisonment is excessive. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that any legislation which restricts the right to 
freedom of expression must comply with the conditions set out in article 19, paragraph 3, of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: the law must be narrowly defined 
and justified as being necessary and the least restrictive means to serve a legitimate aim. 
Additionally, an individual whose right to freedom of expression has been restricted must 
be able to challenge the legal basis of the restriction in an independent court. To avoid 
arbitrary application of the law, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure that 
all domestic legislation which restricts the right to freedom of expression is in compliance 
with such criteria. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prior censorship on issues related to national security  
</b></p>
<p>21. The Israeli Military Censor is a unit in the IDF Directorate of Military Intelligence, 
which is headed by the Chief Censor, an officer directly appointed by the Minister of 
Defense. The Chief Censor is mandated to screen and censor materials related to national 
security issues before publication.  
</p>
<p>22. According to an agreement signed between the Israeli Editors&#8223; Committee and the 
Ministry of Defense in 1949, Israeli editors may voluntarily submit articles that relate to 
specific military issues or strategic infrastructure issues to the Chief Censor. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that there were initially 65 topics subject to censorship, but that 
this has been reduced to 35 in the fifth agreement between the Editors&#8223; Committee and the 
</p>
<p>  
 7 See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 34 on article 19, para. 8.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>Ministry of Defense. Foreign journalists are exempt from this agreement and the need to 
seek prior authorization for publication on national security matters. The Censor&#8223;s decision 
may be appealed to the High Court of Justice, and the Censor cannot appeal a court 
judgment. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Chief Censor that when materials are 
submitted by journalists, a threat assessment is undertaken, based on the criterion of 
&#8220;imminent certainty of actual harm to State security&#8221;. According to the Chief Censor, the 
list of topics provided to journalists provides sufficient guidance to journalists and editors 
to determine whether they will need to submit certain articles for prior screening and 
censorship. 
</p>
<p>24. Journalists and editors can also reportedly challenge the decision of the Chief 
Censor by submitting an appeal to an arbitration committee known as the &#8220;Committee of 
Three&#8221;, which is headed by a former judge. Journalists or editors concerned may also 
appeal the decision of the Committee to the Supreme Court of Israel. 
</p>
<p>25. While the Special Rapporteur has been informed that there have been very few 
articles that have been censored by the Chief Censor, and that foreign journalists are free to 
report on national security matters without her review, he is concerned by the very 
existence of such a body for prior censorship. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, such a 
body should not exist in any country. In addition, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
remind Israel that any restriction on the right to freedom of expression must be clearly 
established in law, which must be accessible, unambiguous, drawn narrowly and with 
precision, and justified as being necessary and the least restrictive means available to 
protect a specific and legitimate national security interest. He regrets that such a law is 
currently lacking in Israel. 
</p>
<p>26. Moreover, he would also like to remind the Government of Israel that journalists 
should not be held accountable for receiving, storing and disseminating classified data 
which they obtained in a way that is not illegal, including leaks and information received 
from unidentified sources (see the thematic report of the Special Rapporteur, 
A/HRC/20/17). Furthermore, journalists should not be forced to reveal their sources of 
information. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Restrictive bills and laws which threaten the right to freedom of opinion 
</b></p>
<p><b>and expression  
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by various bills and laws that have been 
proposed or have been adopted by members of the Knesset which contravene international 
standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression. These include three laws that 
have already been adopted, namely the Budget Principles Law (Amendment No. 40) (the 
Nakba Law); the Law Preventing Harm to the State of Israel by Means of Boycott, 2011 
(the Anti-Boycott Law); and the Law on Disclosure Requirements for Recipients of 
Support from a Foreign State Entity (the Foreign Funding Law). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Nakba Law  
</b></p>
<p>28. The Nakba Law, which is an amendment to the Budget Principles Law of 1985, was 
adopted by the Knesset on 22 March 2011. This amendment empowers the Minister of 
Finance to fine public bodies that receive public funding, such as schools, universities or 
local authorities, if they hold events that commemorate &#8220;Independence Day or the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the state as a day of mourning&#8221;. Additionally, fines could also be imposed 
if such institutions hold events that aim to revoke &#8220;the existence of Israel as a Jewish and 
democratic State&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that this law is inherently 
discriminatory towards Palestinian citizens of Israel, who refer to Israeli Independence Day 
as the &#8220;Nakba&#8221;, meaning catastrophe or tragedy, to commemorate those who died and were 
displaced following the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948. The law severely 
undermines their right to freely express their opinion, preserve their history and culture, and 
to their right to commemorate the Nakba, which is an integral part of their history. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that &#8220;laws that penalize the expression 
of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant 
imposes on State parties &#8230; Restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion should never be 
</p>
<p>imposed &#8221; (Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 34, para. 49).  
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, given the vagueness and ambiguity of the wording of the law, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that fines could be imposed for holding events at which 
the Nakba is mentioned, or for criticism of the definition of Israel as a Jewish and 
democratic State. In order to avoid sanctions, individuals may self-censor themselves or 
refrain from organizing events which could be in breach of the law. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also expresses his regret that, on 5 January 2012, the High 
Court, in response to a petition challenging the constitutionality of the law, avoided ruling 
on the matter until a concrete case arises. Given that the mere existence of the law itself 
encourages self-censorship and that the law itself is incompatible with the international 
obligations of Israel to fully guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression of all 
individuals, the Special Rapporteur strongly urges that the law be annulled. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Boycott Law 
</b></p>
<p>32.  The so-called Boycott Law, passed by the Knesset on 11 July 2011, makes it a civil 
offence to call for a boycott against Israel and its products and those produced in the 
settlements in the West Bank. Parties filing lawsuits do not have to prove that a call to 
boycott has resulted in actual damages, as courts can order people or organizations calling 
for a boycott to pay compensation independently of the damages caused. In addition, the 
law allows the Minister of Finance to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) calling for a boycott. Furthermore, companies or organizations 
participating in a boycott may also be disqualified from applying for Government contracts. 
</p>
<p>33. On 29 August 2011, the Special Rapporteur submitted a joint allegation letter 
regarding this law, together with the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders (see communications report of special procedures, A/HRC/19/44, p. 70).  
</p>
<p>34. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply received from the Government of 
Israel dated 15 December 2011,8 the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the law violates 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, as calling for or participating in a peaceful 
boycott is a legitimate form of expression which is internationally recognized. Moreover, 
given that lawsuits can be brought against individuals without any proof of damages, it 
creates further incentives for self-censorship, including on the Internet, to avoid litigation. 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports that, since the adoption of the law, the 
ability of individuals to freely discuss boycott-related issues via social media platforms has 
diminished significantly. 
</p>
<p>35. As explained in the response from the Government of Israel, the Special Rapporteur 
looks forward to the decision of the High Court of Justice regarding the legality of this law.

</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Foreign Funding Law 
</b></p>
<p>36. The law known as the Foreign Funding Law, adopted by the Knesset on 2 March 
2011, requires NGOs to report quarterly to the Registrar of Associations on any funding 
received from foreign Governments or any other foreign entities. While the declared 
purpose of the law is to increase transparency, it appears redundant, given that every non-
profit organization in Israel is already required by law to list its donors and other financial 
information publicly on its website and to submit annual reports on donations received. The 
Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the discriminatory impact of the law on Israeli 
human rights NGOs who rely upon foreign Government funding, while other groups that 
receive private funding, such as Israeli Jewish settler groups, remain unaffected. 
</p>
<p>37. Additionally, there are two other bills which have been combined into the Bill on 
Income of Public Institutions Receiving Donations from a Foreign State Entity, which 
would deprive NGOs that receive foreign funding of the legal right to be exempted from 
income tax. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that this bill has been put on hold, 
given that if adopted, it would have further restricted the work of Israeli human rights 
NGOs. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Amendment to the defamation law  
</b></p>
<p>38. The bill on the amendment to the defamation law, which passed its first reading in 
the Knesset on 21 November 2011, increases the fine for defamation from NIS 50,000 to 
NIS 300,000 without proof of damages. Due to the dramatic increase in financial penalties, 
the bill, if adopted, will create a significant chilling effect and will discourage investigative 
journalists, human rights NGOs and individuals expressing critical views. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that such initiatives constitute an attempt 
to undermine the work of Israeli human rights NGOs who are critical of the Government, 
particularly in relation to the occupation. The Special Rapporteur underscores the 
importance of facilitating the work of human rights defenders in Israel by creating a 
conducive environment and enabling them to peacefully exercise their legitimate right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>40. Finally, while he has raised these concerns with the Speaker of the Knesset, Reuven 
Rivlin, and members of the Knesset, Faina Kirshenbaum and Ahmad Tibi, he would like to 
call upon all members of the Knesset to ensure that any legislative proposals presented to 
the Knesset are in compliance with the international human rights obligations of Israel. The 
Special Rapporteur would also like to underscore that all branches of the State &#8211; executive, 
legislative and judicial &#8211; and other public or governmental bodies, at whatever level, are in 
a position to engage the responsibility of Israel for any actions taken in contravention of 
international norms and standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
(Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 34, para. 7). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression of 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority groups in Israel  
</b></p>
<p>41. The right to freedom of opinion and expression constitutes a key vehicle through 
which individuals and communities can draw attention to their grievances and combat 
situations of inequality and discrimination. Hence, the right is particularly important for the 
empowerment of vulnerable sectors of society, including minorities. In this regard, article 
4, paragraph 2, of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities stipulates that States shall take measures to create 
favourable conditions to enable persons belonging to minorities to express their 
characteristics and to develop their culture, language, religion, traditions and customs, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>except where specific practices are contrary to international standards. Additionally, as a 
State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Israel has a positive 
obligation under article 19 to promote media pluralism and diversity, including in minority 
languages.  
</p>
<p>42. However, as briefly mentioned earlier, the Basic Law on Human Dignity and 
Liberty does not explicitly guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and 
also lacks a general provision for equality and the prohibition of racial discrimination. With 
regard to the latter, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has 
repeatedly called upon the Government of Israel to ensure that the prohibition of racial 
discrimination and the principle of equality are included in the Basic Law and that a 
definition of racial discrimination is duly incorporated into the law (CERD/C/ISR/CO/13, 
para. 16; CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para.13).  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that Palestinian citizens of Israel are 
frequently regarded and treated as &#8220;an enemy from within&#8221;, given their ethnic and religious 
ties to the Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory and the surrounding Arab and 
Muslim States, and consequently suffer from various discriminatory policies and treatment. 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has also expressed concern that 
&#8220;excessive emphasis upon the State as a &#8222;Jewish State&#8223; encourages discrimination and 
</p>
<p>accords a second-class status to its non-Jewish citizens&#8221; (E/C.12/1/Add.27, para. 10; 
E/C.12/1/Add.90, para. 16). 
</p>
<p>44. As mentioned earlier, recent legislation passed by the Knesset, in particular the 
Nakba Law, infringe upon the right of Palestinian citizens of Israel to freely express their 
opinions and to commemorate a historically significant event. In relation to Arab Members 
of the Knesset, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports that following their 
participation in public events in defence of the rights of Palestinians and the exercise of 
their right to freedom of expression, certain parliamentary privileges have been revoked.  
</p>
<p>45. During his visit to the Negev desert, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the 
Bedouin community lacks clubs, meeting places and public places of worship to express 
and develop its culture, religion and traditions. In the city of Be&#8223;er Sheva, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the &#8220;Big Mosque&#8221;, and was informed that it has been converted into a 
museum, and that the Israeli High Court ruled in June 2011 that it should be used as an 
Islamic museum for the Muslim community. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
municipal authorities of Be&#8223;er Sheva implement this decision of the court, and also allow it 
to be used as a site for public prayer to allow the Muslim community to collectively express 
and maintain their culture and religion.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Main issues of concern in the occupied Palestinian territory  
</b></p>
<p>46. Individuals living in the West Bank face difficulties in exercising their right to 
freedom of opinion and expression by the Israeli security forces and by the growing 
intolerance of criticism by the Palestinian Authority, while those living in Gaza face 
interference and harassment by the de facto authorities. The situation in the occupied 
Palestinian territory is further compounded by an unclear domestic legal system which 
comprises a patchwork of British, Jordanian and Egyptian laws and Israeli military orders, 
as well as internal inter-factional conflict between the Palestinian Authority and the de facto 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>47. The following section outlines the main issues of concern in the occupied 
Palestinian territory, and are examined vis-&#224;-vis the respective obligations of the 
Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Restrictive provisions in the Press and Publications Law of 1995 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Palestinian Basic Law, passed by the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1997 
and ratified by the President in 2002, serves as a temporary constitution for the Palestinian 
Authority, and guarantees basic human rights and liberties. In particular, article 19 of the 
Basic Law provides that &#8220;freedom of opinion may not be prejudiced. Every person shall 
have the right to express his opinion and to circulate it orally, in writing or in any form of 
expression or art, with due consideration to the provisions of the law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>49. In addition, article 27 of the Basic Law guarantees the establishment of all media as 
a right for all, protects media freedom, and prohibits censorship of the media, by stipulating 
that &#8220;no warning, suspension, confiscation, cancellation or restriction shall be imposed 
upon the media except by law, and pursuant to a judicial ruling&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>50. However, despite these provisions guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression, 
the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the existence of provisions that unduly restrict the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression in the Press and Publications Law of 1995.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. While the intended purpose of the Press and Publications Law is to provide guidance 
to the media, guarantee journalists&#8223; right to access information and to ensure every 
individual&#8223;s right to freedom of expression, it contains various provisions which contravene 
the Palestinian Basic Law and international standards on the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression. These include excessive Government control over the media, including 
licensing of print media and censorship of publication, and broad restrictions on the content 
of what may be published, many of which are vague. For instance, publication materials 
that contradict principles of freedom, national responsibility, or are &#8220;inconsistent with 
morals&#8221; or which may &#8220;shake belief in the national currency&#8221; are prohibited under articles 7 
and 37. Furthermore, materials must be submitted for review by the Government prior to 
publication, in contravention of article 27 of the Palestinian Basic Law which prohibits 
media censorship. In addition, the Press and Publications Law provides harsh sanctions, 
including imprisonment, for breach of its provisions.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the acknowledgement by Government officials of 
such problematic elements in the Press and Publications Law and efforts made by the 
Ministry of Information to amend the law in consultation with civil society representatives. 
He has been informed that the final version of proposed amendments to the Press and 
Publications Law will be submitted to the President for approval. He would like to reiterate 
his willingness to provide technical assistance in the reform process to bring the law into 
conformity with international standards, and to establish a clear regulatory framework for 
the media which would facilitate the work of journalists in Palestine and prevent any undue 
or excessive interference with their work.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Defamation as a criminal offence  
</b></p>
<p>53. The Jordanian Penal Code of 1960, which remains applicable in the West Bank, 
provides for criminal penalties of up to two years in prison for defamation, including in 
relation to Government officials (arts. 189 and 191). The Special Rapporteur has 
consistently called for decriminalization of defamation as a criminal offence, which is 
inherently harsh and encourages self-censorship. He has also stressed that all public figures 
are legitimately subject to criticism and should exercise a higher degree of tolerance, given 
their functions to serve the public.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by recent reports of detention and 
investigation of individuals who have expressed criticism of Palestinian officials, including 
unfavourable comments regarding President Mahmoud Abbas posted on Facebook.9 Such 
cases reveal a worrying trend of growing intolerance of criticism and monitoring of 
Palestinian users&#8223; Facebook accounts. Although individuals may not be formally prosecuted 
and convicted for defamation, the Special Rapporteur stresses that arrests, questioning and 
investigation themselves constitute a form of intimidation and harassment that engender a 
climate of fear and discourage individuals from criticizing authorities.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur thus calls upon the Palestinian Authority to decriminalize 
defamation and refrain from prosecuting individuals for defamation when it involves 
expression of opinion or criticism or matters of public interest which, even if false, was 
done without malicious intent. Moreover, the Palestinian Authority should take measures to 
promote a culture that is tolerant of diverse views, opinions and criticism.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Ensuring the independence and effective functioning of the Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Broadcasting Corporation  
</b></p>
<p>56. The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) was established in 1993 under the 
direct control of the Palestinian Authority to offer public television and radio in Palestine, 
which was forbidden prior to its establishment. As a Government institution, its employees 
are civil servants and appointed by the Palestinian Authority. However, following a 
presidential decree of 2009, PBC has been undergoing a series of reforms to become an 
independent and autonomous public service institution. To this end, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed that initiatives have been taken to promote cultural diversity in broadcasting 
and provide airtime for private and independent programmes, including satirical 
programmes. In particular, he is pleased to note that PBC is willing to provide the space for 
all individuals to express their opinions regardless of their political affiliation.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is cognizant of the difficulties and challenges faced by PBC 
in transforming into an independent and autonomous body, including the political climate, 
paralysis of the Palestinian Legislative Council, and resistance from within PBC and from 
certain sectors of society who deem certain programmes to be contrary to cultural values 
and traditions. While many of the initiatives have yet to be implemented, including the 
establishment and appointment of the Board of Trustees, the Special Rapporteur welcomes 
the gradual transformation of PBC and looks forward to receiving information on the 
progress of reform. He also hopes that the availability of independent and satirical 
programmes will create a culture of openness and tolerance towards criticism.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Restrictions on the distribution of certain newspapers in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Gaza  
</b></p>
<p>58. As a consequence of the inter-factional division between the Palestinian Authority 
and the de facto authorities in Gaza following the Palestinian Legislative Elections of 2006, 
certain newspapers, perceived to be sympathetic towards either Fatah or Hamas, have been 
banned in Gaza and the West Bank, respectively. For example, <i>Al-Quds al-Arabi</i>, <i>Al-
Hayaat al-Jadida</i> and <i>Al-Ayyam </i>are banned in Gaza, while <i>Al-Risala</i>, <i>Falastine</i> and <i>Minbar 
al-Islah </i>are prohibited in the West Bank.  
</p>
<p>  
 9 Details of these cases will be included in the next joint communications report of special procedures. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>59. Restrictions on the distribution of newspapers in Gaza and the West Bank constitute 
a clear breach of domestic law, including article 27 of the Palestinian Basic Law, which 
guarantees media freedom and prohibits restriction of publications without legal basis and 
judicial ruling. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that any restriction on dissemination of 
information must be based on law and clearly justified as being necessary to pursue a 
legitimate aim. The banning of newspapers is not only a violation of the right to impart 
information, but the right of the public to receive information.  
</p>
<p>60. Moreover, the legitimacy of the prohibition of the aforementioned newspapers is 
further undermined by the fact that the content of newspapers is available online in both the 
West Bank and Gaza. As such, the Special Rapporteur recommends that these politically 
symbolic restrictions be lifted by both parties to create a more conducive environment for 
dialogue and mutual understanding.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Restrictions on freedom of movement of journalists and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders imposed by Israel  
</b></p>
<p>61. Palestinians living in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza face daily 
obstacles and humiliation to travel both inside and outside of the occupied Palestinian 
territory, as a result of the construction of the Wall and other barriers, coupled with the 
imposition of military checkpoints, permit requirements and travel bans by Israel. The work 
of journalists and human rights defenders in the occupied Palestinian territory is 
particularly hindered by these restrictions to movement, as documenting and collecting 
information is central to their work.  
</p>
<p>62. In this regard, the Human Rights Committee has stressed that it is incompatible with 
the obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to &#8220;restrict 
the freedom of journalists and others who seek to exercise their freedom of expression 
(such as persons who wish to travel to human rights-related meetings) to travel outside the 
State party, to restrict the entry into the State party of foreign journalists to those from 
specified countries or to restrict freedom of movement of journalists and human rights 
investigators within the State party&#8221; (Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 34, 
para. 45).  
</p>
<p>63. In addition, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the imposition of travel bans, 
which are often justified on the basis of secret evidence. For instance, joint urgent appeals 
have been sent to the Government of Israel regarding a travel ban imposed on Shawan 
Jabarin, Executive Director of <i>Al-Haq</i>, a human rights NGO.10  
</p>
<p>64. Following his meeting with Mr. Jabarin during his visit, the Special Rapporteur 
extended an invitation to him to participate in an event at the nineteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council, which enabled Mr. Jabarin to appeal to the High Court of Israel 
regarding his travel ban. On 22 February 2012, the State Prosecutor approved a &#8220;temporary 
exception&#8221; to the ban to allow Mr. Jabarin to travel to Geneva, albeit with strict conditions. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that upon his return to the West Bank on 1 March 2012, the 
travel ban has been reinstated for an indefinite period.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur urges the Israeli authorities to lift the travel ban against Mr. 
Jabarin altogether and carefully review the necessity of travel restrictions imposed on other 
human rights defenders and journalists so as to enable them to exercise their right to 
freedom of expression. In the light of the disturbing information that travel bans are 
justified on the basis of secret evidence, he would like to emphasize that any travel 
</p>
<p>  
 10 A/HRC/7/14/Add.1, paras.348-350; A/HRC/14/23/Add.1, paras.1287-1296.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>restriction imposed on an individual on the grounds of national security must allow the 
affected individual the opportunity to challenge the justifications for applying the 
restrictions, including the evidence supporting it, in a timely and open process.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Attacks against journalists, human rights defenders and bloggers 
</b></p>
<p>66. Local journalists in the occupied Palestinian territory face difficulties in undertaking 
their work not only as a result of their restrictions to movement as described earlier, but 
also due to arbitrary arrests and detention, physical attacks and raids of their offices by the 
security personnel of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the de 
facto authorities in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>67. In the West Bank, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by the actions taken 
by the Palestinian Authority to arrest journalists and bloggers for critical comments 
regarding senior political officials, as noted in the preceding section. While the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the announcement on 27 March 2012 of an annual press freedom 
prize recognizing exemplary journalism, he urges the Palestinian Authority to respect 
media freedom in practice.  
</p>
<p>68. Journalists in the West Bank are not only subjected to restrictions imposed by the 
Palestinian Authority, but by Israel, including arbitrary closure of radio and television 
stations, arbitrary arrests and detention, and attacks while covering demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>69. Recent cases of interference with Palestinian media include a raid by Israeli security 
forces on 2 April 2012 of a Palestinian radio, television and online media network 
established by Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem, when equipment and personal files 
were confiscated and two employees arrested. Similarly, Israeli security forces carried out 
night raids on 29 February 2012 of two Palestinian television stations in Ramallah and Al-
Bireh, and confiscated broadcasting equipment, over 20 computers, two servers, hard drives 
containing the channel&#8223;s archives and physical administrative and financial files. The 
Special Rapporteur expresses concern that such action may constitute an attempt by Israel 
to prevent the establishment of free and independent Palestinian media in occupied 
Palestinian territory. He urges the Government of Israel to refrain from such arbitrary 
interferences and return any seized equipment without any undue delay.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur also expresses deep concern over arbitrary arrests of 
journalists by Israeli security forces, including the recent arrest of Mohammad Anwar 
Muna on 3 April 2012 in Nablus. He notes with concern that journalists are among those 
held in administrative detention by the Israeli authorities.  
</p>
<p>71. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports of deliberate attacks 
against Palestinian, Israeli and foreign journalists covering demonstrations in the West 
Bank by the Israeli security forces. He would like to remind the Government of Israel to 
allow journalists to perform their functions to monitor and report on demonstrations, and to 
investigate all allegations of attacks by the Israeli security forces and to bring those 
responsible to account to prevent impunity.  
</p>
<p>72. In Gaza, journalists, bloggers and human rights defenders face restrictions on 
monitoring, documenting and reporting freely on matters such as human rights violations 
committed by the de facto authorities and calls for Palestinian unity. He has also been 
informed of cases of attacks against journalists, such as confiscation of their cameras and 
equipment while covering demonstrations, which in some cases are followed by raids, 
arrests and beatings, including torture allegedly. For example, following a public assembly 
in support of Palestinian unity, the security personnel of the de facto authorities raided the 
offices of Reuters, destroyed equipment, beat two employees and confiscated a camera (see 
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/19/20, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>para. 14). Journalists who are detained or summoned for an interview with the internal 
security apparatus are often allegedly coerced to sign a document to refrain from acts of 
incitement against the authorities (ibid.). These forms of harassment have an intimidating 
effect and constitute a clear breach of article 27 of the Palestinian Basic Law.  
</p>
<p>73. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur notes that journalists working for local news 
agencies in Gaza are at particular risk of such forms of harassment and avoid reporting on 
human rights violations for fear of being summoned or penalized by the Government Press 
Office of the de facto authorities. Hence, local journalists reportedly tend to make reference 
to reports or statements already published by human rights organizations to avoid being 
identified as a major source. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. Furthermore, the ability of journalists to report freely in Gaza has been threatened by 
a new practice adopted by the de facto authorities requiring foreign journalists to name a 
local contact in order to enter Gaza. The Special Rapporteur has been informed by 
representatives of the de facto authorities that such a requirement has been introduced for 
security reasons, following the death in April 2011 of an Italian activist, Vittorio Arrigoni. 
However, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that such practice encourages visiting 
journalists to avoid reporting on sensitive issues and to apply self-censorship, as the named 
local may be placed at risk of reprisals. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur urges the de facto authorities in Gaza to ensure that both 
local and foreign journalists can carry out their legitimate work without intimidation, 
harassment and interference by officials from the Internal Security Agency and the General 
Intelligence Service. This includes halting the practice of short-term detentions; abolishing 
the requirement for foreign journalists to name a local contact in Gaza; and creating an 
atmosphere of openness towards criticism. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p>76. Peaceful assemblies and demonstrations constitute a means for individuals to 
publicly express their opinions or to raise legitimate concerns and grievances. As such, 
undue restrictions on the right to freedom of assembly may also constitute violations of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>77. In the West Bank, regular demonstrations have been taking place to express 
grievances against the practices of occupation by Israel in areas under the security control 
of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In such areas, IDF Order No. 101 Regarding Prohibition 
of Incitement and Hostile Propaganda Actions, also known as Military Order 101, has been 
used to restrict Palestinians&#8223; rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  
</p>
<p>78. Military Order 101, issued in August 1967 by the then Officer Commanding of the 
Central Command and Commander of IDF in the West Bank, criminalizes political 
expression and activities, including organizing and participating in protests; taking part in 
assemblies or vigils; holding, waving, or displaying flags or other political symbols; and 
printing and distributing any material &#8220;having a political significance&#8221;. Any breach of the 
order is punishable by 10 years of imprisonment and/or a fine. One of the main problems 
with the order is the sweeping prohibition of expression deemed to be &#8220;political&#8221;, which is 
vague and subject to interpretation. Additionally, the use of &#8220;required degree of force&#8221; to 
enforce the order is permitted, which leaves considerable room for discretion and the 
potential for excessive use of force.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by the IDF practice of preventing 
peaceful demonstrations from taking place by stopping demonstrators gathering by setting 
up temporary checkpoints prior to scheduled demonstrations and declaring the area a closed 
military zone. As a consequence, anyone who enters the area despite the military closure is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>considered to have violated Military Order 101. Further, protesters are frequently dispersed 
by IDF using crowd control methods, even though the demonstrations are peaceful. The 
Special Rapporteur also expresses concern that IDF allegedly intimidate and collectively 
punish villagers of the site of demonstrations through night raids, using sound or gas bombs 
aimed at villagers&#8223; houses and declaring an entire village a closed military zone.  
</p>
<p>80. During his mission on 9 December 2011, the Special Rapporteur observed one 
demonstration in the village of Nabi Saleh in the West Bank. Since 2009, Palestinian, 
Israeli and international human rights defenders have been peacefully demonstrating 
against the construction of illegal Israeli settlements and the obstruction of access to Eing 
al-Qaws spring, which has been used by residents of Nabi Saleh for farming and 
recreational purposes. Despite the restraining effect that his presence at the site may have 
had on the large contingent of IDF forces, who withdrew from the main road leading to the 
village shortly after his arrival, the Special Rapporteur noted the use of tear gas and was 
informed of a young man who had been injured while he was in a meeting with the 
villagers in another area. The Special Rapporteur enquired about the fate of the 
demonstrator with the crew of an ambulance as he was passing the gate of a nearby 
checkpoint, and was informed that he had already been taken away for medical attention. 
The next day, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the young man, by the name of 
Mustafa Tamimi, had died in hospital as a result of his injuries caused by a tear gas canister 
fired from a short range directly into his face.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by the use of disproportionate and excessive use 
of force by the Israeli security forces to repress peaceful protests, including the use of tear 
gas, rubber-coated metal bullets and stun-grenades. He notes that the Secretary-General has 
also expressed concern regarding frequent and excessive use of force against unarmed 
demonstrators by Israeli security forces, including live ammunition and &#8220;tear gas canisters 
being fired as projectiles at protesters, resulting in severe injuries&#8221; (report of the Secretary-
General, A/66/356, para. 20).  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur raised such concerns during the meeting with Major General 
Mizrahi, Head of Central Command of IDF, including the specific case of Mr. Tamimi&#8223;s 
death. He was informed that there are two ongoing investigations into Mr. Tamimi&#8223;s death, 
one of which was to be concluded by 20 December 2011. The Special Rapporteur 
expressed his interest to receive the results of these investigations, which should also be 
made public, but regrets that he has not received such information.  
</p>
<p>83. In addition to the death of Mr. Tamimi, the Special Rapporteur has been informed 
that since 2003, a total of around 20 individuals have died while participating in 
demonstrations. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Israel to take effective 
measures to ensure prompt, impartial and effective investigations into every loss of life, 
which is essential to ensure accountability and to prevent impunity. He also emphasizes that 
any use of force against demonstrators or rioters must be strictly minimal and proportionate 
to the threat posed. For example, while the use of tear gas to disperse a crowd may be 
legitimate under certain circumstances, tear gas canisters should never be used at short 
range or aimed directly at protesters. While it has been alleged that IDF open-fire 
regulations prohibit such use, the Special Rapporteur has been informed of repeated 
infractions by members of IDF, who are rarely sanctioned or criminally held to account.  
</p>
<p>84. In the West Bank, the Special Rapporteur has also been informed of instances where 
security officials of the Palestinian Authority forcibly dispersed peaceful protests and 
journalists, photographers and human rights monitors were assaulted. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Palestinian Authority to fully guarantee the rights of the Palestinian 
people to protest peacefully to express their views, including by investigating all attacks 
against protesters and journalists and holding perpetrators to account. <b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>85. In Gaza, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports of excessive use of force by 
the security forces of the de facto authorities to disperse peaceful protests, as well as of 
arbitrary arrests and detention of protesters and journalists monitoring demonstrations. For 
instance, during a public assembly in support of Palestinian unity on 15 March 2011, at 
least 100 participants and observers were reportedly beaten, tents were destroyed and 
approximately 50 individuals were detained. Other smaller demonstrations in support of 
Palestinian unity during the following days were also allegedly violently dispersed.  
</p>
<p>86. Moreover, workshops and seminars in Gaza, including on human rights issues, are 
frequently disrupted by the security forces of the de facto authorities and prevented from 
taking place. For instance, the internal security personnel prevented the Palestinian 
Journalists&#8223; Syndicate from holding a workshop in commemoration of the International Day 
to End Impunity on 23 November 2011. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by 
information received that organizers of events frequently receive phone calls from the 
internal security forces prior to the meeting telling them to cancel the event, or there will be 
&#8220;consequences&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>87. In other instances, offices of human rights-oriented organizations have been closed 
by the police, including the offices of Sharek Youth Forum, a non-governmental 
organization funded by the United Nations Development Programme that seeks to create 
space for Palestinian youth to engage actively in the development of local communities. On 
30 November 2010, the Attorney General of the de facto authorities ordered the offices to 
be closed on the grounds of &#8220;moral misconduct&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
closure order remains in place at the time of submission of the report.  
</p>
<p>88. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur expresses deep concern over reports of 
individuals facing reprisals by the security forces of the de facto authorities as a result of 
participating in academic conferences or workshops outside of Gaza. These include 
arbitrary detention, summons for interrogation and, in some cases, threats and ill-treatment 
(A/HRC/19/20, para. 13).  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur stresses that peaceful demonstrations and assemblies should 
not be viewed as a threat, and urges the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, 
and the de facto authorities to promote a culture of tolerance of divergent and opposing 
views, which is essential for any democratic society.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression in East 
</b></p>
<p><b>Jerusalem imposed by Israel  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Loyalty to the State of Israel  
</b></p>
<p>90. Palestinians who were residing and physically present in East Jerusalem at the time 
of illegal annexation by Israel in 1967 (A/66/356, para. 34; Security Council resolution 478 
(1980)) were designated permanent residents and issued with different identity documents 
to Palestinians living in other areas of the West Bank. However, following their election in 
2006 to the Palestinian Legislative Council, the residency status of four Palestinian 
Members of Parliament, Mohammad Totah, Ahmad Attoun, Mohammad Abu Teir, and 
Khaled Abu Arafeh,<b> </b>was revoked due to their affiliation with a &#8220;hostile entity&#8221;. On 8 
December 2010, Mr. Abu Teir was forcibly transferred from East Jerusalem to another part 
of the West Bank by Israeli security forces, while Mr. Attoun was arrested in September 
2011 and transferred on 7 December 2011. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur met with the two remaining members of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council who have been seeking refuge at the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, Mr. Totah and Mr. Abu Arafeh. He is disturbed by the news that they were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>arrested by the Israeli police inside the premises of the Red Cross on 23 January 2012. As 
emphasized by the Secretary-General, the requirement of &#8220;loyalty to the State of Israel&#8221; is 
not only a violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the imposition of 
swearing &#8220;allegiance to the hostile power&#8221;,11 but also undermines the right of Palestinian 
residents in East Jerusalem to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression (see 
A/66/356).  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur appeals to the Government of Israel to reinstate the 
residency status of the four members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and enable them 
to peacefully exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression in East Jerusalem. 
He also calls upon the Israeli authorities to fully ensure that all Palestinians living in East 
Jerusalem are able to peacefully express dissent and criticism of Israel without fear of 
revocation of their residency status or other forms of reprisals.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Censorship of textbooks  
</b></p>
<p>93. According to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
Arrangements, the Palestinian Authority has jurisdiction over educational matters in East 
Jerusalem. However, the Special Rapporteur has been informed that sections of textbooks 
used in Palestinian schools have been censored by the Israeli Ministry of Education. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that Palestinians in East Jerusalem have the 
right to form their own opinions by following their own curriculum and determining the 
content of their textbooks. In addition, they should be able to maintain, express and impart 
their version of historical events.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Ban on cultural activities in East Jerusalem  
</b></p>
<p>95. Various Arab cultural events and activities in East Jerusalem have reportedly been 
prohibited by the Israeli authorities. For instance, in 2009, a number of cultural activities 
were prevented from taking place when Jerusalem was declared the Arab Capital of Culture 
as part of the Cultural Capitals Programme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization. Other examples were brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteur during his meeting with community leaders of Silwan, who informed him of 
various instances where cultural activities organized by the community members were 
banned by the Israeli authorities.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Israel to ensure that all cultural 
activities, which are an important element of the right to seek and share information, can be 
held without undue restrictions in East Jerusalem.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government of Israel  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned by recent threats to openness and 
acceptance of divergent views in Israel as a result of an increasing emphasis on Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>as a Jewish State and growing intolerance of criticism regarding the policies and 
</b></p>
<p>  
 11 Article 45 of the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague 
</p>
<p>Regulations). Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention also prohibits the forcible transfer of 
civilians of an occupied territory, except when necessary to ensure the security of the civilians 
involved.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices of occupation. This has been manifested through a series of laws adopted by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the members of the Knesset, including the prohibition of the commemoration of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Israeli independence day as a day of mourning; creation of additional, yet redundant, 
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting obligations for Israeli human rights NGOs; prohibition of boycotts or 
</b></p>
<p><b>calling for a boycott of Israeli products, including those produced in the settlements in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the West Bank; and a six-fold increase of financial penalties for defamation.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Members of Knesset to refrain from 
adopting laws that are inconsistent with the obligations of Israel under international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law, including article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political Rights. While the Supreme Court can rule such laws to be incompatible with 
</b></p>
<p><b>Israeli Basic Laws, the proposal and adoption of restrictive laws generates a climate of 
</b></p>
<p><b>self-censorship. He would also like to underscore that all branches of the State </b>&#8211;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>executive, legislative and judicial </b>&#8211;<b> and other public or Governmental bodies, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>whatever level, are in a position to engage the responsibility of Israel for any actions 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken in contravention of international norms and standards on the right to freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>of opinion and expression.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>As recommended by various United Nations treaty bodies, the Basic Law on 
Human Dignity and Liberty should be amended to include principles of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination and equality and the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government amend or 
repeal the vaguely worded provisions in the Penal Code, as highlighted in Chapter IV, 
</b></p>
<p><b>section A.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the post of Chief Censor be 
abolished in Israel, and that restrictions on the right to freedom of expression on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>grounds of national security be prescribed by law. Such law must be accessible, 
</b></p>
<p><b>unambiguous, drawn narrowly and with precision, and justified as being necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the least restrictive means available to protect a specific and legitimate national 
</b></p>
<p><b>security interest. The law should also provide for adequate safeguards against abuse, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including prompt, full and effective judicial scrutiny of the validity of a particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>restriction by an independent court.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The right of individuals in the West Bank to express themselves through 
peaceful assemblies must be fully respected by the Israeli Security Forces. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur urges the Government of Israel to repeal Military Order 101, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that there is no excessive use of force against peaceful protesters. Every injury 
</b></p>
<p><b>or death resulting from the use of force by the Israeli security forces must be swiftly 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated and the individual responsible held accountable.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of Israel to ensure that all 
journalists in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, can perform their 
</b></p>
<p><b>professional duties without undue interference. This includes halting the practice of 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrary raids of and seizure of equipment from media offices, arbitrary arrests and 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention of journalists, and deliberate attacks against journalists monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>demonstrations. He urges the Israeli authorities to return all confiscated equipment 
</b></p>
<p><b>without undue delay, release journalists who have been arbitrarily arrested or ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they are promptly brought before a court in accordance with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards on the right to a fair trial, and investigate all attacks against journalists and 
</b></p>
<p><b>bring perpetrators to account in order to prevent impunity.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The right to freedom of movement is crucial to the work of human rights 
defenders and journalists to access information and monitor, record and report on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations and other matters of public interest. The Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Israel has an obligation to justify the continued need for the imposition of travel bans </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>on human rights defenders and journalists, including presentation of evidence to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable individuals to challenge bans in court.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of Israel to ensure that 
Palestinian citizens of Israel can fully exercise their right to freedom of opinion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression, including through their own media and language. The requirement of 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;loyalty to the State of Israel&#8221; in East Jerusalem is in cl<b>ear violation of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>law and undermines the right to freedom of opinion and expression and should thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>be repealed.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The right to freedom of opinion and expression of Arab Knesset members, as 
with all individuals in Israel, should be fully respected.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur appeals to the Government of Israel to reinstate the 
residency status of the four members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable them to peacefully exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression in 
</b></p>
<p><b>East Jerusalem. He also calls upon the Israeli authorities to fully ensure that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are able to peacefully express dissent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>criticism of Israel without fear of revocation of their residency status or other forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>reprisals.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of Israel to refrain from 
interfering with the content of text books used in Palestinian schools in East 
</b></p>
<p><b>Jerusalem. Moreover, he calls upon the Government of Israel to ensure that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural activities can be held without undue restrictions in East Jerusalem.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Palestinian Authority  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>While recognizing the difficulties in implementing legislative reforms due to the 
paralysis of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian Authority to revise the Press and Publications Law of 1995, in consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b>with civil society representatives, for ratification by the President.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Palestinian Authority to decriminalize 
defamation. He also urges public officials to exercise a higher degree of tolerance for 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical comments and refrain from filing defamation lawsuits.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Palestinian Authority halt the 
practice of detaining and interrogating individuals for legitimate criticism of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials. He also appeals to the Palestinian Authority to ensure that the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of expression on the Internet is fully guaranteed. Moreover, measures should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be taken to promote tolerance of diverse opinions.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Palestinian Authority facilitate 
and support the reform of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation into an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent institution.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Palestinian Authority to lift the ban on 
newspapers affiliated with the de facto authorities, and ensure that journalists 
</b></p>
<p><b>working for such newspapers can freely undertake their work in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p><b>without fear of harassment or intimidation.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Peaceful demonstrations should be allowed to take place in the West Bank 
without undue restrictions.  </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> C. De facto authorities in Gaza  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the de facto authorities to promote a culture 
of tolerance of divergent views, including criticisms, which is essential for any healthy 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. To this end, he urges the de facto authorities to stop the practice of arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrests, detention and interrogation of individuals expressing critical views, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>raids of offices, and interference with human rights related conferences and events.

<p>116. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the de facto authorities lift the ban
