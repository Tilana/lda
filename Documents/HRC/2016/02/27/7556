<p><b>  Note by the secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 23/24, requested the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the situation of human rights in South 
</p>
<p>Sudan and to work with the Government of South Sudan to provide technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>identify additional areas of assistance to strengthen the capacity of South Sudan to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations and commitments. It also requested the High Commissioner to 
</p>
<p>submit an interim report to the Council at its twenty-sixth session on progress in technical 
</p>
<p>assistance and capacity-building in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>2. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights carries out its human rights 
</p>
<p>programme in South Sudan through the Human Rights Division of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). The Division has a mandate to monitor, investigate 
</p>
<p>and report on the human rights situation and to provide technical assistance, as well as to 
</p>
<p>help to build the capacity of national institutions. Pursuant to Security Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>1996 (2011) and 2057 (2012), UNMISS was entrusted with a robust human rights mandate 
</p>
<p>to strengthen the capacity of national stakeholders through the enhancement of their skills 
</p>
<p>and knowledge. A technical cooperation programme under the auspices of the Office of the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights has been embedded in the work of the Division as 
</p>
<p>an important component of the Mission&#8217;s mandate. The programme has been implemented 
</p>
<p>through activities geared towards building the human rights capacity of specific 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including of government ministries, the Human Rights Commission, the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly, the South Sudan National Police Service, the Sudan People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Liberation Army, correction officers, civil society organizations, human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>and media groups. These activities, conducted at the national, State and at times county 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
* 
</p>
<p>Late submission. 
</p>

<p>levels, range from advice and recommendations on the human rights aspects of legislation 
</p>
<p>to capacity-building workshops. 
</p>
<p>3. On 15 December 2013, South Sudan was plunged into a severe crisis triggered by an 
</p>
<p>internal political conflict within the ruling Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement. The 
</p>
<p>conflict that ensued has resulted in the loss of thousands of innocent lives and the 
</p>
<p>destruction of such major towns as Bor, Malakal and Bentiu. More than a million people 
</p>
<p>have been displaced or have sought refuge abroad. Security institutions, especially the 
</p>
<p>Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army, have partially disintegrated and their legitimacy has been 
</p>
<p>eroded by the human rights violations committed by their members. A cessation of 
</p>
<p>hostilities agreement signed by the parties to the conflict, in Addis Ababa in January 2014,  
</p>
<p>under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development has proved 
</p>
<p>ineffective, as both parties have continued attacks.  
</p>
<p>4. At the request of the Secretary-General, the High Commissioner, together with the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Prevention of Genocide, visited 
</p>
<p>South Sudan from 28 to 30 April 2014. The visit provided the High Commissioner with an 
</p>
<p>opportunity to witness first-hand the human rights situation in the country and to engage 
</p>
<p>with the country&#8217;s leaders with regard to their responsibilities to bring an end to the 
</p>
<p>violence and protect civilians from violations of human rights law and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights also visited South Sudan in January 
</p>
<p>2014 during the initial stages of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>5. In the light of the crisis, UNMISS has adjusted its posture and proceeded with a 
</p>
<p>strategic shift from its original mandate of support for peacebuilding, state-building and the 
</p>
<p>extension of State authority to one of strict impartiality in its relations with the parties to the 
</p>
<p>conflict. The Mission has put on hold its operational and capacity-building support, which 
</p>
<p>may enhance the capacity of the parties to engage in conflict, commit human rights 
</p>
<p>violations and abuses and undermine the Addis Ababa agreement. Under a new Security 
</p>
<p>Council mandate, the main focus of the Mission will be the protection of civilians, human 
</p>
<p>rights monitoring and investigations, the creation of conditions for the delivery of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance, and support for the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.  
</p>
<p>6. In the absence of any capacity-building programmes in South Sudan, the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, pursuant to Council resolution 23/24, draws the Council&#8217;s attention to the 
</p>
<p>report by the UNMISS Human Rights Division to the Council.1 It provides an overview of 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in South Sudan since the outbreak of the conflict on 15 
</p>
<p>December 2013. Based on more than 900 interviews with victims and witnesses, the report 
</p>
<p>describes the widespread negative impact that the conflict has had on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in many parts of the country, in the form of extrajudicial killings, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances, rape and other forms of sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and detention, 
</p>
<p>targeted attacks against civilians and attacks on hospitals, as well as against United Nations 
</p>
<p>facilities, the peacekeeping mission and its staff.
