<p><b>11/&#8230; Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations and that 
recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the 
human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 
by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), the World Conference reiterated 
the principle of &#8220;First Call for Children&#8221; and emphasized that the rights of the child should be a 
priority in the United Nations system-wide action on human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the almost universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and the ratification by more than 120 States of each of the two Optional Protocols to the 
Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of Council resolution 10/14 of 26 March 2009, in which the Council 
celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and called for 
effective implementation of the Convention by all States parties to ensure that all children may 
fully enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with interest </i>general comment No. 5 (2003) of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, in which the Committee emphasized that children&#8217;s special and dependent status creates 
real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that procedures allowing for individual communications have been established for 
other core international human rights treaties, namely, the International Covenants on Civil and 
Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and for the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also</i> that children and their representatives lack a communications procedure under 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child by which communications concerning the effective 
implementation of the rights set out in the Convention can be considered by an appropriate 
committee of independent experts, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the view of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, expressed by its 
Chairperson in her oral report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, that the 
development of a communications procedure for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
would significantly contribute to the overall protection of children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Decides</i> to establish an Open-ended Working Group of the Human Rights Council to 
explore the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child to provide a communications procedure complementary to the reporting procedure under 
the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also</i> <i>decides </i>that the Working Group shall hold its first session for five working days 
in Geneva before the end of 2009, within existing resources; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further decides </i>to invite a representative of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child to attend the session as a resource person and, where appropriate, relevant United Nations 
special procedures and other relevant independent experts, and also invites them to submit inputs 
to the Working Group for its consideration; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests </i>the Working Group to submit a report on progress made to the Council for 
consideration at its thirteenth session.
