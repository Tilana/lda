For the Period Ended June 30, 2016
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2015 contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this document
include, among others, statements regarding our capital needs, business plans and expectations.
Such forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties regarding, among
others, the success of our business plan, availability of funds, government regulations, operating
costs, our ability to achieve significant revenues, our business model and products and other
factors. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed
to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”,
“predict”, “potential” or “continue”, the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. In
evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the assumptions,
risks and uncertainties set forth in reports and other documents we have filed with or furnished to
the SEC. These factors or any of them may cause our actual results to differ materially from any
forward-looking statement made in this document. While these forward-looking statements, and
any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current
judgment regarding future events, our actual results will likely vary, sometimes materially, from
any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested
herein. The forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date of this
document and we do not intend or undertake to update any of the forward-looking statements to
conform these statements to actual results, except as required by applicable law, including the
securities laws of the United States.

therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of

three-month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be
expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.

IMAGE INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2015
(Expressed in U.S. dollars)
(unaudited)
1.Basis of Presentation
The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Image International
Group, Inc. (the “Company”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. In the
opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments of a
recurring nature considered necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods shown.
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates. The results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal
course of business. The Company has not generated revenues since inception and is unlikely to
generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a
going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the
ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the
attainment of profitable operations. As at June 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital
deficiency of $362,367 and has accumulated losses of $1,161,367 since inception. These factors
raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
2.Significant Accounting Policies
(a)Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in U.S. dollars.
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-
owned subsidiary, Owlhead Minerals (BC) Corp. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated on consolidation.
(b)Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These
pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.
3.Loans Payable
As at June 30, 2016, the Company owed $92,667 (March 31, 2016 - $92,667) to non-related
parties, which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.
4.Related Party Transactions
(a)
As at June 30, 2016, the Company owes $144,000 (March 31, 2016 - $144,000) to a company
controlled by the President of the Company which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due
on demand.
 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company owes $123,000 (March 31, 2016 - $123,000) to a company
controlled by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company which is non-interest bearing,
unsecured, and due on demand.
 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company is owed $1,093 (March 31, 2016 - $nil) from the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due on
demand.
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred management fees of
$nil (2015 - $12,000) to a company controlled by the President of the Company.
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred management fees of
$nil (2015 - $10,500) to a company controlled by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016
During the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $18,780
(2015 - $75,459).
Consulting fees for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $nil (2015 - $18,500).
Transfer agent and filing fees in the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 were $13,143
(2015 - $28,179).
Expenses during the quarter were for:
-Renewal of listing on the OTCQB stock exchange; and
  
-Financial statement audit.
Management fees in the three month period ended June 30, 2016 were $nil (2014 - $22,500) as
management has agreed to forgo charging any fees until a substantial financing has been
completed.
Professional fees for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 were $3,846 (2015 - $3,930)
relating to audit fees.
Following extensive research and discussion with an experienced gemstone and jewelry
consultant, the Company decided to expand its business focus to include the acquisition of
gemstone and other precious mineral resources and retail jewelry and gemstone outlets. In order
to appropriately reflect the Company’s expanded and more comprehensive and inclusive
business plan, the Company changed its name to Image International Group, Inc. on December
23, 2014.
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to
pursue exploration activities. For these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial
doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
The Company has limited financial resources as at June 30, 2016 with funds on hand of $1,832
(March 31, 2016 - $12,994). As at June 30, 2016 the Company has a working capital deficit of
$362,367 compared to $343,587 as at March 31, 2016.
Amounts due to related parties were $267,000 as at June 30, 2016 (March 31, 2016 - $267,000).
Loans payable as at June 30, 2016 was $92,677 (March 31, 2016 - $92,677). The loans are non-
interest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.
The Company has no employees other than officers and uses consultants as and when
necessary.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its available cash and its
ability to raise additional funds in the near future to support corporate operations and the
exploration of our mineral property.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our
performance. We have no revenue generating assets. We cannot guarantee we will be
successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the
establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services.
9
The Company is aware that additional financing will be required in order to continue its pursuit of
a mineral property opportunity or comparable opportunity in a related field. There is no assurance
that additional funding will be successfully completed.
We will require additional financing to cover our costs that we expect to incur over the next twelve
months. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding our operations, as
we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that additional
funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we
cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our
common stock to fund our plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, we will not be
able to continue and our business plan will fail.
Cash used in Operating Activities
During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company used $11,162 (2015 -
$54,401) to fund operations. Management fees have not been paid in order to maintain funds.
Cash from Financing Activities
We have funded our business to date primarily from sales of our common stock but did not sell
any common stock during the three month period ended June 30, 2016. During the three month
period ended June 30, 2016, the Company received loan proceeds of $nil (2015 - $59,700).
There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any
other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue
our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our operations and our business will
fail.
Future Financing
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund
our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing
shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity
securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of June 30, 2016 (the “Evaluation
Date”). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of the Evaluation Date as a result of the material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting discussed below.
Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
10
Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our
consolidated financial statements contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 fairly present our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in
all material respects.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, for the Company.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of
internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material
misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in
future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of
compliance with our established policies and procedures.
A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that
results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting, as of the Evaluation Date, based on the framework set forth in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation under this framework, management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the Evaluation
Date.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of Evaluation Date and identified the following material weaknesses:
1.
Inadequate Segregation of Duties: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly
implement control procedures.
2.
Insufficient Written Policies & Procedures: We have insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting.
3.
Inadequate Financial Statement Closing Process: We have an inadequate financial statement
closing process.
4.
Lack of Audit Committee: The lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of
outside directors on the Company’s Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures.
11
Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party
specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and
finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant
accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel
and (3) prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists for financial reporting and
closing processes and (4) may consider appointing outside directors and audit committee
members in the future.
Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has
discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting
firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that
misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur
that would not be prevented or detected.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, do not
expect that the our controls and procedures will prevent all potential errors or fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
