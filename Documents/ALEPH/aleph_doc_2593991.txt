RNEST processing record in July
Rio de Janeiro, August 17, 2016 – Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras hereby announces that the Abreu e Lima
Refinery (RNEST) beat its processed feedstock record in July 2016, reaching 99.18 thousand barrels per day (bpd),
2.3% more than the previous record achieved in June (96.96 thousand bpd). In total, 3.07 million barrels were
processed, 4.6% up on the May 2016 record of 2.94 million barrels. This was the third consecutive monthly record of
the Refinery, which is located in the Suape Port Industrial Complex in Ipojuca, Pernambuco.
The Refinery’s oil product output in July was also its best ever, with Diesel S-10 production of 373.57 thousand m³,
the country’s biggest figure, corresponding to 32% of national output of this product, and 1.7% more than the previous
record in March 2016 (367.39 thousand m³). Production of petrochemical naphtha also reached the record level of
46.64 thousand tons, 1.6% up on May 2016.
In addition, operational changes and project modifications have been increasing the profitability of Petrobras’ Brazilian
refineries, with the generation of an additional US$ 355 million in revenues through 2015, an estimated US$ 572
million accumulated until the end of 2016 and an estimated US$ 759 million until 2019. The initiatives are part of the
Intermediate Products and Gasoline Production Program (Promega) and based on capital discipline, focus on
profitability and strengthened performance management.
