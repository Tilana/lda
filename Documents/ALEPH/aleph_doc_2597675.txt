3.3 Overview of Lith NRG and Tenement Applications
The Lithium Triangle Project
The Tenement Applications are located within the prolific Andean Lithium Triangle of
northern Chile and north west Argentina, which includes approximately 45% of global
annual production of lithium sourced from lithium brine-bearing salt lakes‘ The
Tenement Applications cover part of extensive potential lithium brine-bearing salt lakes
in the high Andes of north west Argentina. The Tenement Applications comprise 53
mining lease applications in the Lithium Triangle area ofJujuy and Catamarca Provinces,
Argentina, known as the Lithium Triangle Project:
Activity in the immediate area includes Orocobre Limited and Lithium Americas
Corporation: Orocobre have recently commenced production from one of best known
lithium brine projects at Olaroz-Cauchari and Lithium Americas have recently signed a
joint venture with one of the world's largest lithium brine producers, SQM, with the
stated aim to develop the identified significant lithium resource in the Olaroz-Cauchari
area: Orocobre is targeting production of approximately 17,500t/year LCE (Lithium
Carbonate equivalent), with potential expansion options, from a published exploration
target at Olaroz of 75 million tonnes of Lithium Carbonate at 700mg/L with a thickness
of 126 metres with a specific yield of 20% (Upper Assumption Estimate — Orocobre
Annual Report 2015). The identification of resources on neighbouring properties
provides no assurance that any resource will be identified on the Lithium Triangle
Project:
Rights to the Tenement Applications will be held by two wholly owned Argentine
subsidiaries of Lith NRG, titled Minerales Australes SA. and Morena del Valle Minerals
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement Page 10 of 50


3.4
S.A.  Establishment  of  Argentine  entities  is  currently  nearing  completion,  with  the 
subsidiaries of Lith NRG aimed to be controlling the rights to the Tenement Applications 
prior to the date of the Meeting. 
Entities associated with Lith NRG’s Argentine subsidiaries have applied for or have rights 
to approximately 18,700 Ha area (21 applications) on a 100% basis over the potential 
lithium  brine-bearing  Cauchari/Olaroz  basins  in  Jujuy  Province,  Argentina,  located 
within and around the Orocobre and Lithium Americas projects. Although data is limited 
within  the  properties,  the  tenements  may  cover  potential  extensions  to  the 
Cauchari/Olaroz projects with potential extensions to aquifers, although this provides 
no assurance that any resource will be identified on the Lithium Triangle Project. 
Entities associated with Lith NRG’s Argentine subsidiaries have also applied for or have 
rights  to  an  area  of  approximately  29,500  Ha  (10  applications)  over  the  basin 
immediately west of the Orocobre’s Olaroz project, called the Paso project. 
In Catamarca province, an area of approximately 45,400 Ha (22 applications) has been 
applied for over a potential lithium brine-bearing basin, called the Kachi project. 
It  is  contemplated  that  further  areas  will  be  applied  for  and  agreements  with  third 
parties may be entered into in the future. 
The  map  set  out  in  Schedule  7  shows  the  location  of  the  Tenement  Applications  in 
relation to lithium producers and lithium projects in development in the Argentine part 
of the Andean Lithium Triangle. 
Argentina and Lithium 
The  Andean  Lithium  Triangle  of  northern  Chile,  north  west  Argentina  and  southern 
Bolivia currently produces approximately 45% of the world’s supply of lithium, all from 
lithium  brine  filled  lakes,  and  has  the  world’s  lowest  cost  producers  (Roskill  2015), 
together with representation by the ‘Big 3’ of Lithium production, SQM, Albemarle and 
FMC. The Lithium Triangle hosts the largest known undeveloped lithium brine resources 
(USGS 2015). 
Argentina was considered a promising opportunity because it has a number of lithium 
brine-bearing salt lakes (‘salars’) and lithium brine-bearing aquifers in the high Andes 
(‘the  Puna’)  in  NW  Argentina  (Jujuy,  Salta,  Catamarca  provinces)  which  were  either 
significantly under-explored or in various stages of development. Lake Resources had 
previously  operated  and  explored  in  Argentina  and  is  familiar  with  the  business 
environment.  However,  Argentina  had  become  a  difficult  investment  destination  in 
recent years until a presidential election in November/December 2015 led to a change 
in government where a successful businessman, Mauricio Macri, became president. Mr 
Macri and his government immediately began opening Argentina to foreign investment, 
liberating  the  convertibility  of  the  local  currency,  resolving  a  15-year  deadlock  on 
defaulted government bonds and starting a series of reforms to place the country back 
into the mainstream of global economies. 
Lith NRG was also familiar with the business environment and technical aspects of the 
Andean Lithium Triangle region, due to previous experience in Argentina/Chile/Bolivia. 
Approximately  six  months  was  spent  reviewing  lithium  brine  projects  in  Chile  and 
Argentina, from construction stage to grass roots, leading to a property package being 
secured on a 100% basis in north west Argentina.

The Company’s current activities 
The Company is an Australian listed public company which has to date focussed on 
exploration for copper and gold over three exploration licenses, the Chagai Project, in 
Balochistan, Pakistan. The company’s exploration activities have been restricted since 
the Chagai Project was effectively farmed out in 2015. The Chagai Project is held by a 
private company in Pakistan, Chagai Resources (Pvt.) Limited, with Lake’s initial 
retained equity at 27.5% in 2015, reducing to 15% equity or a 10% carried interest if 
minimum exploration expenditure is met by the incoming parties under certain 
conditions. 
The Company previously undertook mineral exploration activities in 
northern Argentina in 2004 and 2005. From the Company’s incorporation in 1997, Lake 
has concentrated its early efforts in Pakistan and Sweden.  In 2004, the Company 
wound down exploration in Sweden and shifted its focus to a promising new 
exploration play in Argentina, whilst continuing exploration in Pakistan.  In late 2005, 
work in Argentina was terminated to concentrate on the company's more 
advanced copper and gold targets in Pakistan.

3.8 Advantages of the Lith NRG Acquisition

The Directors are of the view that the following non-exhaustive list of advantages may

be relevant to a Shareholder's decision on how to vote on the Resolutions:

(a) the Lithium Triangle Project represents a significant opportunity for the
Company (see Section 3.3 for further details regarding the Lithium Triangle
Project);

(h) the Lith NRG Acquisition may improve share value for Shareholders;

(c) the Lith NRG Acquisition presents a significant opportunity for the Company to
increase its activities which should increase the number and size ofthe investor
pool that may invest in the Company and provide greater market liquidity;

(d) after completion of the Lith NRG Acquisition, the Company is likely to have
improved access to the funding required to continue the exploration and
possible future development of the Lithium Triangle Project;

(e) the Lith NRG Acquisition presents an opportunity for the Company to diversify
into different exploration locations and different commodities which will allow
the Company to spread its potential commodity risk; and

(f) after completion of the Lith NRG Acquisition, the new Board and executive
management will have significant and complimentary resources experience.

3.9 Disadvantages of the Lith NRG Acquisition

The Directors note that there are a number of risks associated with the acquisition of

Lith NRG including the failure to discover economically recoverable reserves,

uncertainty of obtaining access to adequate capital for project development and general

operational riskst

Based on the information available, a non-exhaustive list of the disadva ntages/risk

factors are set out below:

LKE Notice of Meeting 8t Explanatory Statement Page 14 of 50


(a) Potential disadvantages of the Lith NRG Acquisition

Potential disadvantages ofthe Lith NRG Acquisition include:

(i) the Lith NRG Acquisition, if completed, will result in the issue of up to
approximately 127,000,000 Shares and 50,000,000 Options (excluding
Shares issued under the Capital Raising and any Shares issued upon the
exercise of Options). The issue of the Shares will have an immediate
dilutionary effect on the ownership of existing Shareholders, being
approximately 232%. The issue of the Options will also have a dilutionary
effect on existing Shareholders‘ interests if and when they are exercised;

(ii) the Company will be expanding its activities to include exploration for
lithium;

(iii) there are various risk factors associated with the conduct of mining
exploration in Argentina, many of which are common with the conduct of
mining exploration generally. Please refer to Section 3.8 (b) for an outline
of the most significant of these risk factors; and

(iv) There is no guarantee that the exploration and development proposed to
be conducted following the completion of the Lith NRG Acquisition at the
Lithium Triangle Project will result in any beneficial economic outcome.

(h) Potential risks

There are a number of risks associated with the Company's activities and the

development, operation and expansion of the Company’s projects following a

successful acquisition of Lith NRG and the Lithium Triangle Project which may

impact on the Company’s future performance. In addition, there are various risks
inherent in the conduct of any mining exploration activities generally.

Shareholders should give careful consideration to each of the risks. The risks

below identify some of the key risks specific to an investment in the Company;

however, these risks should not be taken as an exhaustive list of all risks which
the Company could be subject to.

(i) Exploration and mining activities
The Company‘s mining exploration activities are dependent upon the grant,
or as the case may be, the maintenance of appropriate leases, licences,
concessions, leases, permits and regulatory consents which may be
withdrawn or made subject to limitations. There is no assurance that such
grant of licences and renewals will be given as a matter of course and there
is no assurance that new conditions will not be imposed in connection with
them. In particular, there are risks that any one or more of exploration
licence applications in Jujuy Province and Catamarca Province will not
result in the grant of a legal or beneficial interest in those applications. In
the legal section (Juzgado de Minas) of the mines department of Jujuy
Province, in May 2016, a decision was made to hold a moratorium for up to
180 days to ensure all mining properties and applications were in good
standing, which may affect the timing ofgranting.

LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement Page 15 of 50


All of the tenement applications listed in Schedule 4 are applications for 
mining  leases  (“minas”).  The  steps  to  granting  of  exploration  over  the 
tenement  applications  are  expected  to  include,  among  others,  formal 
notation  in  the  cartographic  section  which  may  adjust  boundaries  and 
areas,  applications  and  approvals  of  exploration  related  environmental 
impact statements, discussions with local communities and consideration 
by the legal section and administrative section of the mines departments.  
These steps would reasonably be expected to lead to approval for non-
invasive  exploration, 
including  surface  sampling  and  ground  based 
geophysics, followed by a similar process of applications and approvals for 
drill testing which would be anticipated to take 12 to 24 months, if there 
are no substantive issues of potential conflict.
(ii)
Future capital requirements    
The Company’s ongoing activities may require substantial financing in the 
future for its business  activities. Any additional equity financing may be 
dilutive  to  Shareholders,  may  be  undertaken  at  lower  prices  than  the 
current market price or may involve restrictive covenants which limit the 
Company’s operations and business strategy.
(iii)
Although the Directors believe that additional capital can be obtained, no 
assurances can be made that appropriate capital or funding, if and when 
needed, will be available on terms favourable to the Company or at all. If 
the Company is unable to obtain additional financing as needed, it may be 
required to reduce, delay or suspend its operations and this could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s activities and could affect the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Exploration risks 
Mining exploration and development is a high risk undertaking. The success 
of  the  Company  depends  on  the  delineation  of  economically  minable 
reserves and resources, access to required development capital, movement 
in  the  price  of  commodities,  securing  and  maintaining  title  to  the 
Company's exploration and mining tenements and obtaining all consents 
and  approvals  necessary  for  the  conduct  of  its  exploration  activities, 
including consent from local communities and environmental consents.
All of the tenement applications listed in Schedule 4 are applications for 
mining  leases  (“minas”).  The  steps  to  granting  of  exploration  over  the 
tenement  applications  are  expected  to  include,  among  others,  formal 
notation  in  the  cartographic  section  which  may  adjust  boundaries  and 
areas,  applications  and  approvals  of  exploration  related  environmental 
impact statements, discussions with local communities and consideration 
by the legal section and administrative section of the mines departments.  
These steps would reasonably be expected to lead to approval for non-
invasive  exploration, 
including  surface  sampling  and  ground  based 
geophysics, followed by a similar process of applications and approvals for 
drill testing which would be anticipated to take 12 to 24 months, if there 
are no substantive issues of potential conflict.
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement
Page 16 of 50
Exploration on the Company's tenements may be unsuccessful, resulting in 
a  reduction  of  the  value  of  those  tenements,  diminution  in  the  cash 
reserves  of  the  Company  and  possible  relinquishment  of  exploration 
tenements.  The  exploration  costs  of  the  Company  are  based  on  certain 
assumptions with respect to the method and timing of exploration. By their 
nature,  these  estimates  and  assumptions  are  subject  to  significant 
uncertainties and, accordingly, the actual costs may materially differ from 
these estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given 
that cost estimates and underlying assumptions will be realised in practice, 
which may materially and adversely affect the Company’s viability.
(iv)
Due Diligence 
Prior to the date of the Meeting, the Company undertook due diligence on 
information provided by Lith NRG. Such investigation was carried out in a 
relatively short time frame of approximately four weeks.
If  the  Resolutions  are  passed,  after  implementation  of  the  Lith  NRG 
Acquisition, the Company will be subject to any unknown liabilities of Lith 
NRG which may have an adverse impact on the Company’s performance 
and  financial  position.    Certain  Lith  NRG  shareholders  have  provided 
customary warranties in relation to the unaudited accounts of Lith NRG (for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2016) to the Company for a minimum of 
$50,000 up to a maximum limit of $200,000 for a period of 9 months.
Additionally,  there  is  a  risk  the  information  may  have  changed  due  to 
changes in the economy.
Economic risks 
Factors such as inflation, exchange rate or currency fluctuations, interest 
rates,  supply  and  demand  of  capital  and  industrial  disruption  have  an 
impact on business costs, commodity prices and stock market conditions. 
Argentina has a history of sudden political changes which affect investment 
policies  and  attitudes  to  foreign  investment,  including  rapid  changes  to 
inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, import/export controls and the 
ability  to  freely move  capital  in  and out  of  the  country.  The  Company’s 
exploration,  development,  construction  and  operating  costs,  possible 
future revenues and future profitability can be affected by these factors, 
which are beyond the control of the Company.
Potential acquisitions 
As part of its business strategy, the Company may make acquisitions of, or 
significant  investments in, complementary companies or assets or enter 
into  option  to  purchase  agreements over  assets  and/or  companies.  Any 
such  future  transactions  would  be  accompanied  by  the  risks  commonly 
encountered in making such acquisitions.
(v)
(vi)
(vii) Market conditions
Share  market  conditions  may  affect  the  value  of  the  Company’s  Shares 
regardless  of  the  Company’s  performance.  Share  market  conditions  are
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement
Page 17 of 50
affected by many factors such as general economic outlook, interest rates
and inflation rates, currency fluctuations, demands for commodities and
commodity prices, shipping costs, changes in investor sentiment toward
particular market sectors, the demand for, and supply of, capital and
terrorism or other hostilities.
(viii) Reliance on key personnel
The responsibility of overseeing the day-to-day operations and strategic
management of the Company depends substantially on its senior
management and key personnel. There can be no assurance given that
there will be no detrimental impact on the Company ifone or more ofthese
employees cease their employment.
(ix) Investmentspeculative
The above list of risk factors ought not be taken as exhaustive of the risks
faced by the Company or by Shareholders. The above factors, and others
not specifically referred to above, may in the future materially affect the
financial performance of the Company and the value of the Company‘s
securities.
3.10 Directors voting intentions

3.12 Financial information about the Company

Pro-forma balance sheet

Set out in this section for the purposes of illustration only, is a balance sheet of the

Company as at 30 June 2016 and a pro-forma balance sheet of the Company and Lith

NRG as at 30 June 2016 (based on the assumptions below):

Notes to the pro-forma balance sheet

Pro-forma balance sheet has been prepared as if the transaction had occurred on 30

June 2016, based on the accounts as at 30 June 2016, using audited financials for Lake

Resources NL and unaudited financials from Lith NRG Pty Ltd which are subject to

change when the financial reports are completed.

Consideration paid for Lith NRG Pty Ltd is based on the following assumptions, which

include the shares and performance rights issued at the closing LKE share price on 24

May 2016, the day prior to the announcement ofthe transaction on 25 May 2016. The

value of the options has been calculated using a Black-Scholes model with the LKE

closing share price at 30 June 2016, with commonly used assumptions on volatility and
likelihood of occurrence.

The following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options:

Exercise price : $0.05

Share price at 30 June 2016 : $0.04

Volatility : 40%

Expiry : 1.5 years

Probability of vesting : - Immediately (Class A)

- 75% (Class B)
- 50% (Class C)
- 50% (Class D)

The pro-forma Group after Offers assumes the completion ofthe Placement (Resolution

5) of $500,000 and a minimum amount of $2,000,000 raised from the Capital Raising

(Resolution 7) after assumed capital raising costs (section 3.12), the drawdown of the

und rawn loans of $50,000, less the assumed value of the Shares issued under Resolution

11 using the LKE closing share price at 30 June 2016.

Budgets and expenditure 
An exploration and administration budget for the next 12 months for the Company is 
set out below. This budget is prepared on the basis that the Company will complete the 
Placement and the Capital Raising (see Section 11 for further details).
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement
Page 20 of 50
The table below is a summary of the expenditure budgets for the Company for the 12 
months following the date of the Meeting. If the Capital Raising fails to complete within 
3 months of the Meeting (or such longer time as ASX in its discretion may allow), or 
there  are  delays  in  accessing  the  tenements,  the  budget  would  be  reduced  to  the 
amount raised from the Placement, plus the cash within Lith NRG and the Company at 
the time of completion of the Lith NRG Acquisition. These budgets are indicative only 
and are subject to possible change depending on the outcome of exploration results and 
other factors beyond the Company’s control.

Placement and Capital Raising 
The  Company  intends  to  complete  the  Placement  after  the  Meeting,  by  way  of  a 
placement to institutional and/or sophisticated investors (as defined in section 708(8) 
of the Corporations Act), issuing 25,000,000 Shares at an issue price of $0.02 per share, 
raising $500,000 (before costs). Approval is sought for the Placement under Resolution 
5.  The  funds  raised  under  the  Placement  will  largely  be  used  to  fund  the  initial 
exploration programme envisioned under the Lith NRG Acquisition.
The Company also intends to complete the Capital Raising, being a capital raising of a 
minimum of $2 million (before costs) at a future market price. The Shares will be issued 
under the Capital Raising no later than 3 months after the date of the Meeting. Approval 
is sought for the Capital Raising under Resolution 7.
Funds  raised  under  the  Capital  Raising  will  be  used  to  fund  the  Company’s ongoing 
exploration  programme.  Subject  to  completing  the  Capital  Raising,  the  Company 
anticipates that it will have sufficient funds to conduct its proposed exploration and 
development activities at least for the next 12 months without the need to conduct any 
further capital raising.

Annual Report 
The Corporations Act requires the financial report, directors’ report and auditor’s report 
to be laid before the Meeting. There is no requirement for Shareholders to vote on, 
approve or adopt these reports. Shareholders will have a reasonable opportunity at the

The  2016  Annual  Report 
www.lakeresources.com.au. 
Resolution 1 – Adoption of Remuneration Report 
In accordance with subsection 250R(2) of the Corporations Act, the Company must put 
the Remuneration Report to the vote of Shareholders. The Directors’ Report contains 
the Remuneration Report which sets out the remuneration policy for the Company and 
the  remuneration  arrangements  in  place  for  the  executive  Directors,  specified 
executives and non-executive Directors.
In accordance with subsection 250R(3) of the Corporations Act, Resolution 1 is advisory 
only and does not bind the Directors. If Resolution 1 is not passed, the Directors will not 
be required to alter any of the arrangements in the Remuneration Report.
The  Corporations  Amendments  (Improving  Accountability  on  Director  and  Executive 
Remuneration)  Act  2011  which  came  into  effect  on  1  July  2011,  amended  the 
Corporations Act to provide that Shareholders will have the opportunity to remove the 
whole Board except the managing director if the Remuneration Report receives a ‘no’ 
vote of 25% or more (Strike) at two consecutive annual general meetings.
Where a resolution on the Remuneration Report receives a Strike at two consecutive 
annual general meetings, the Company will be required to put to Shareholders at the 
second annual general meeting a resolution on whether another meeting should be held 
within 90 days at which all Directors (other than the managing director) who were in 
office at the date of approval of the applicable Directors’ Report must  stand for re-
election.
The Company’s Remuneration Report did not receive a Strike at the 2015 annual general 
meeting. If the Remuneration Report receives a Strike at this Meeting, Shareholders 
should be aware that if a second Strike is received at the 2017 annual general meeting, 
this may result in the re-election of the Board.
The Chairman will allow a reasonable opportunity for Shareholders as a whole to ask 
about, or make comments on the Remuneration Report.
Resolution 1 is an ordinary Resolution.
The Chairman intends to exercise all available proxies in favour of Resolution 1.
If the Chairman is appointed as your proxy and you have  not  specified the way  the 
Chairman is to vote on Resolution 1, by signing and returning the Proxy Form, you are 
considered  to  have  provided  the  Chairman  with  an  express  authorisation  for  the 
Chairman to vote the proxy in accordance with the chairman’s intention, even though
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement

the Resolution is connected directly or indirectly with the remuneration of a member of
the Key Management Personnel of the Company.
6 Resolution 2 — Re-election of Director — Mr James G. Clavarino
In accordance with Listing Rule 14.4, a Director must not hold office (without re-
election) past the third annual general meeting following the Director's appointment,

9.2 Directors' recommendation
The Directors unanimously recommend that Shareholders vote in favour of Resolution
5.
10 Resolution 6 — Approval of 10% Placement Facility
10.1 General
Listing rule 7.1A enables eligible entities to issue Equity Securities up to 10% of its issued
share capital through placement over 12-month period after the AGM (10% Placement
Facility).
The 10% Placement Facility is in addition to the Company's 15% placement facility under
Listing Rule 7.1. An eligible entity for the purposes of Listing Rule 7.1A is an entity that
is not included in the S&P/ASX 300 Index and has a market capitalisation of $300 million
or less. The Company is an eligible entity.
The Company is now seeking Shareholder approval by way of a special resolution to
have the ability to issue Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Facility. The exact
number of Equity Securities to be issued under the 10% Placement Facility will be
determined in accordance with the formula prescribed in Listing Rule 7.1A.2 (refer
Section 10.2(c) below).
The Company may use the 10% Placement Facility to progress the Lithium Triangle
Project and for general working capital. The Directors ofthe Company believe that Item
10 is in the best interest of the Company and unanimously recommend that
Shareholders vote in favour of Item 10.
10.2 Description of Listing Rule 7.1A
(a) ShareholderApproval
The ability to issue Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Facility is subject
to Shareholder approval by way of a special resolution at an AGM. A special
resolution requires approval of 75% of the votes cast by shareholders present and
eligible to vote (in person, by proxy, by attorney or, in the case of a corporate
Shareholder, by a corporate representative).
(b) Equity Securities
Any Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Facility must be in the same class
as an existing quoted class of Equity Securities in the Company. The Company, as
at the date of the Notice, has two classes of Equity Securities on issue, Shares and
Unlisted Options.
(c) Formula for calculating 10% Placement Facility
Listing Rule 7.1.A.2 provides that eligible entities which have obtained
shareholder approval at an AGM may issue or agree to issue, during the 12-month
period after the date of the AGM, a number of Equity Securities calculated in
accordance with the following formula:
(A x D)-E
A is the number of shares on issue 12 months before the date of issue or
agreement:
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement Page 29 of 50


0 plus the number of fully paid shares issued in the 12 months under exception
in Listing Rule 7.2;

0 plus the number of partly paid shares that became fully in the 12 months;

0 plus the number offully paid shares issued in the 12 months with the approval
of holders of shares under Listing Rule 711 and 7.41 This does not include an
issue of fully paid shares under the entity’s 15% placement capacity without
Shareholder approval; and

0 less the number of fully paid shares cancelled in the 12 months

Note that A has the same meaning in ASX Listing Rule 71 when calculating an

entity’s 15% placement capacity.

D is 10%

E is the number of Equity Securities issued or agreed to be issued under ASX Listing

Rule 7.1A12 in the 12 months before the date of the issue or agreement to issue

that are not issued with the approval of Shareholders under ASX Listing Rule 711

or 7.4

(d) ASX Listing Rule 7.1 and Listing Rule 711A

The ability of an entity to issue Equity Securities under Listing Rule 7.1A is in

addition to an entity's placement capacity under Listing Rule 711. At the date of

this Notice, and subject to the approval of Resolution 5, 3 to 11 the Company
would have on issue 172,876,034 Shares (excluding Shares issued under the

Capital Raising or Shares issued on the exercise of Options) and therefore has a

capacity to issue:

(i) 25,931,405 Equity Securities under Listing Rule 71; and

(ii) Subject to Shareholder approval being sought under Item 8: 17,287,603

(includes 10% of current placement on offer and the Lith NRG Acquisition)
Equity Securities under Listing Rule 7.1At

The actual number of Equity Securities that the Company will have capacity to

issue under Listing Rule 7.1A will be calculated at the date of issue of the Equity

Securities in accordance with the formula prescribed in the Listing Rule 711A.2

(refer Section 1012(c) above)

(e) Minimum Issue Price

The issue price of Equity Securities issued under Listing Rule 711A must be not less

than 75% of the VWAP of Equity Securities in the same class calculated over the

15 Trading Days immediately before:

(i) the date on which the price at which the Equity Securities are to be issued

is agreed; or

(ii) if the Equity Securities are not issued within 5 Trading Days of the date in

paragraph (i) above, the date on which the Equity Securities are issued
(f) 10% Placement Period
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement Page 30 of 50


Shareholder approval ofthe 10% Placement Facility under Listing Rule 71A is valid
from the date of the AGM at which the approval is obtained and expires on the
earlier to occur of:

(i) the date which is 12 months after the date of the AGM at which the
approval is obtained; or

(ii) the date of the approval by the Shareholders of a transaction under Listing
Rule 11.1.2 (a signiﬁcant change to the nature or scale of activities) or
Listing Rule 11.2 (disposal of main undertaking),

or such longer period ifallowed by ASX (10% Placement Period).

10.3 Listing Rule 7.1A

The effect of Item 10 will be to allow Directors to issue the Equity Securities under Listing

Rule 7.1A during the 10% Placement Period without using the Company's 15%

placement capacity under Listing Rule 711. Item 10 is a special resolution and therefore

requires approval of 75% of the votes cast by Shareholders present and eligible to vote

(in person, by proxy, by attorney or, in the case of a corporate Shareholder, by a

corporate representative).

10.4 Specific Information required by Listing Rule 7.3A

Pursuant to and in accordance with Listing Rule 7.3A, information is provided in relation

to the approval ofthe 10% Placement Facility as follows:

(a) The Equity Securities will be issued at an issue price of not less than 75% of the
VWAP for the Company’s Equity Securities over the 15 Trading Days immediately
before:

(i) the date on which the price at which the Equity Securities are to be issued
is agreed; or

(ii) if the Equity Securities are not issued within 5 Trading Days of the date in
paragraph (i) above, the date on which the Equity Securities are issued.

(b) If Item 10 is approved by Shareholders and the Company issues Equity Securities
under the 10% Placement Facility, the existing Shareholders‘ voting power in the
Company will be diluted as shown in the below table (in case of Options, only if
they are exercised). There is a risk that:

(i) the market price for the Company's Equity Securities may be significantly
lower on the date of the issue of the Equity Securities than on the date of
the Meeting; and

(ii) the Equity Securities may be issued at a price that is at a discount to the
market price forthe Company’s Equity Securities on the issue date or Equity
Securities are issued as part ofthe consideration forthe acquisition of new
asset, which may have an effect on the amount offunds raised by the issue
of the Equity Securities.

(c) The below table shows dilution of existing Shareholders on the basis of the issue
price of $0.05 per Share and the current number of ordinary securities for variable
“A” calculated in accordance with the formula in Listing Rule 7.1A (2) as at the
date of this Notice.

The table also shows:

LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement Page 31 of 50


(i)
(ii)
two examples where variable “A” has increased, by 50% and 100%. Variable 
“A”  is  based  on the  number  of  ordinary  securities  the  Company  has on 
issue. The number of ordinary securities on issue may increase as a result 
of issue of ordinary securities that do not require Shareholder approval (for 
example, a pro rata entitlements issue or scrip issued under a takeover 
offer) or future speciﬁc placement under Listing Rule 7.1 that are approved 
at a future Shareholders’ meeting; and 
two examples of where the issue price of ordinary securities has decreased 
by 50%,  and  increased  by  100%  as  against  the  assumed  current market 
price,
both on the basis the Lith NRG Acquisition completes and does not complete.

not taking into account any Shares issued under the Capital Raising or any Shares issued

The table has been prepared on the following assumptions although the issue
price will be at a future market related price:
(i) The Company issues the maximum number of Equity Securities available
under the 10% Placement Facility
(ii) No listed Options (including any listed Options issued under the 10%
Placement Facility) are exercised into Shares before the date ofthe issue of
the Equity Securitiest
(iii) The 10% voting dilution reflects the aggregate percentage dilution against
the issued share capital at the time of issue. This is why the voting dilution
is shown in each example as 10%.
(iv) The table does not show an example of dilution that may be caused to a
particular Shareholder by reason of placement under the 10% Placement
Facility, based on that Shareholder’s holding at the date ofthe Meeting.
(v) The table shows only the effect of the issue of Equity Securities under
Listing Rule 711A, not under the 15% placement capacity under Listing Rule
71
(vi) The issue of Equity Securities under the 10% Placement Facility consists
only of Shares. If the issue of Equity Securities includes listed Options, it is
assumed that those listed Options are exercised into Shares for the purpose
of calculating the voting dilution effect on existing Shareholders.
(vii) The assumed issue price for this calculation is $0105, being a price within
the share price trading range since the announcement on 25 May 2016,
although the issue price will be at a future market related price.
(d) The Company will only issue and allot the Equity Securities during the 10%
Placement Period The approval under Item 10 for the issue of Equity Securities
LKE Notice of Meeting & Explanatory Statement Page 33 of 50


will cease to be valid in the event that Shareholders approve a transaction under

Listing Rule 11.1.2 (a significant change in nature or scale of activities or Listing

Rule 11.2 (disposal of main undertaking).

(e) The Company may seek an issue of the Equity Securities for the following
purposes:

(i) Non-cash consideration for the acquisition of the new resources assets and
investments. In such circumstances the Company will provide a valuation
ofthe non-cash consideration as required by Listing Rule 7.1A.3; or

(ii) Cash consideration. In such circumstances, the Company intends to use the
funds raised towards continued exploration expenditure and/or general
working capital.

(f) The Company will comply with the disclosure obligations under Listing Rules
7.1A(4) and 3.10.5A upon issue of any Equity Securities. The Company's allocation
policy is dependent on the prevailing market conditions at the time of any
proposed issue pursuant to the 10% Placement Facility. The identity of the
allottees of Equity Securities will be determined on a case-by-case basis having
regard to the factors including but not limited to the following:

(i) the methods of raising funds that are available to the Company, including
but not limited to, rights issue or other issues in which existing security
holders can participate;

(ii) the effect of the issue of the Equity Securities on the control of the
Company;

(iii) the ﬁnancial situation and solvency of the Company; and

(iv) advice from corporate, financial and broking advisers (ifapplicable).

(g) The allottees under the 10% Placement Facility have not been determined as at
the date of this Notice but may include existing substantial Shareholders and/or
new Shareholders who are not related parties or associates of a related party of
the Company.

(h) Further, if the Company is successful in acquiring new resources assets or
investments, it is likely that the allottees under the 10% Placement Facility will be
vendors of the new resources assets or investments.

(i) The Company has not previously received Shareholder approval for a 10%
Placement Facility.

Issue. 
In the event of pro-rata issue of securities (except a Bonus Issue) the exercise

reduction or return) of the issued capital of the Company, all rights of the C Class 
Options will be reconstructed (as appropriate) in accordance with the Listing 
Rules.

Performance Criteria of his or her Performance Rights a holder will be entitled to have issued 
to him or her (in addition to the Shares which he or she is otherwise entitled to have issued 
to him or her upon such exercise) the number of securities which would have been issued to 
him or her under that Bonus Issue if the Performance Criteria had been satisfied before the 
record date for the Bonus Issue. 
In the event of any reconstruction (including consolidation, subdivisions, reduction or return) 
of the authorised or issued capital of the Company, all rights of the Performance Right 
holder shall be reconstructed (as appropriate) in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules. 
Specifically, with respect to Performance Rights to the Managing Director solely under 
Resolution 9, the Performance Rights will vest in three tranches linked to the following 
performance criteria: 
(a)
third vest when initial exploration can commence, triggered by the commencement of 
the first ground based geophysical survey over any of 10 of the Tenement Applications 
approved for non-invasive exploration in Schedule 4; and 
third vest when initial drilling can commence, triggered by the commencement of the 
first drill hole over any of 10 of the Tenement Applications approved for exploration 
including drilling in Schedule 4; and 
third vest when the Company’s Market Capitalisation reaches $22.287 million defined 
and calculated based on the volume weighted average market price (VWAP) on the 
ASX over a 20 day trading period multiplied by the number of shares on issue at the

time  (for example $0.10 per share VWAP over 20 days multiplied by  222,876,034 
shares assumed to be issued at the completion of the Lith NRG Acquisition).
Specifically, with respect to Performance Rights to the Director solely under Resolution 10, 
the Performance Rights will vest in a single tranche linked to a hurdle linked to when the 
Company’s Market Capitalisation reaches $22.287 million calculated based on the volume 
weighted average market price (VWAP) on the ASX over a 20 day trading period multiplied
