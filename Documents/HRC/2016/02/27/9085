<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 of 
27 November 2006, describes the current human rights situation in Afghanistan and ongoing 
concerns, and contains recommendations to address them.  
</p>
<p> Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. The adoption of the Afghanistan 
National Development Strategy (ANDS) in 2008 serves as the country&#8217;s poverty reduction 
strategy in which human rights are largely treated as a question of civil and political rights; the 
challenge now is to give greater attention to the human rights dimensions of economic and social 
development.  
</p>
<p> The escalation of the armed conflict in Afghanistan has had a significant impact on 
civilians in conflict-affected areas, in particular on those who are already vulnerable. The 
intensifying conflict has also resulted in a disturbing rise in civilian casualties and has contracted 
the space for humanitarian action. Long-standing discrimination against women and minority 
groups is manifest in their lack of access to justice and other basic services. Important gains 
made recently by women in the public sphere are in danger of receding. Mounting attacks on the 
freedom to express views that challenge existing power structures as well as social and religious 
norms that usually marginalize women cast doubts on the Government&#8217;s ability to ensure a free 
and democratic space where human rights are fully respected. This is especially vital in an 
elections period. While important initiatives to reform the justice sector and improve the 
administration of justice were launched in 2008, the judicial system remains weak, corrupt and 
dysfunctional, and at times does not comply with international human rights obligations. 
Compounded by a surge in criminal violence and decline of public law enforcement authorities 
control over parts of the country, a culture of impunity prevails as demonstrated by the failure to 
prosecute perpetrators for past and contemporary human rights violations and abuses.  </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 
of 27 November 2006 and has been prepared in cooperation with the United Nations Assistance 
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Since the last report by the High Commissioner, Afghans 
have continued to suffer significant rights deficits that pose serious challenges to the enjoyment 
of their human rights and to the country&#8217;s long-term prospects for peace, stability, democracy, 
development and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>2. Gross human rights violations remain a serious threat to continuing efforts to transform 
Afghan society. A culture of impunity prevails, and is deeply entrenched; this is manifested in 
the lack of political will to advance the transitional justice process to address past abuses as well 
as the absence of accountability for current human rights violations. Coupled with a weak, 
corrupt and dysfunctional judicial system, and wide recourse to traditional dispute-resolution 
mechanisms that do not comply with due process requirements, justice is effectively denied to 
the vast majority of Afghans.  
</p><p>3. In November 2008, the High Commissioner expressed concern regarding the resumption of 
the death penalty in Afghanistan, noting that law enforcement and judicial systems in the country 
fall short of internationally accepted standards guaranteeing due process and a fair trial.  
</p>
<p>4. The escalation of the armed conflict during 2008 has resulted in a substantial rise in the toll 
of civilian casualties and further erosion of the humanitarian space. Although certain measures 
have been taken to mitigate the impact of military operations, the limited ability of Afghan and 
other authorities to address the protection needs of at-risk civilians in war-affected areas remains 
a major concern. Not only does the conflict have a disproportionate impact on those who are 
vulnerable, but the deteriorating situation has undermined the people&#8217;s confidence in the 
Government and hampered its ability to meet its human rights obligations, such as the provision 
of basic services, including security.  
</p>
<p>5. The political space to express dissenting political and other views has also been contracting 
during the reporting period. Ongoing attacks on freedom of expression, particularly in relation to 
media and human rights activists, are intrinsically linked to abusive power structures and deeply 
entrenched impunity. This pattern is all the more disquieting as elections are scheduled to take 
place in Afghanistan in 2009.  
</p>
<p>6. Other long-standing human rights problems in Afghanistan have not been adequately 
addressed. The deep-rooted discrimination against and marginalization of women and girls and 
of certain minorities, extreme poverty and patterns of social and economic development that do 
not address inequalities, continue to challenge entitlements to human rights such as health, food, 
water and sanitation, education, shelter and a means of livelihood.  
</p>
<p>7. The adoption at the International Conference in Support of Afghanistan, held in June 2008 
in Paris, of Afghanistan&#8217;s poverty reduction strategy paper, the Afghanistan National 
Development Strategy (ANDS), generated renewed momentum, in particular amongst donors, to 
assist the Government in its endeavour to address some endemic problems, such as poverty and 
marginalization, but these efforts would be strengthened by greater attention to the human rights 
dimensions of economic and social development. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  POVERTY AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>8. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a poverty rate of 42 per cent. 
Another 20 per cent of Afghans are situated slightly above the poverty line, indicating a very 
high level of vulnerability.  
</p>
<p>9. Abusive power structures, weak governance, discrimination and marginalization contribute 
to alarming levels of poverty that impoverish the lives of millions of Afghans; 61 per cent of the 
population is said to be vulnerable to food insecurity. Serious drought, resulting in a poor 
harvest, as well as high prices for staple foods means that the right to food and to the highest 
attainable standard of health, especially among poor households, is being severely impacted. 
Afghanistan has deep inequities in the distribution of its wealth, and productive resources are 
concentrated in the hands of a few. Three decades of conflict have left vulnerable groups with 
limited or no access to land or to livelihoods or even basic social services, and subject to 
exploitation by those in power. A human rights analysis is crucial to the success of poverty 
reduction initiatives, particularly in regard to the factors that affect decision-making and resource 
allocation.  
</p>
<p>10. A positive step in 2008 was the adoption of the country&#8217;s poverty reduction strategy paper, 
ANDS, which is also the vehicle to implement the Afghanistan Compact benchmarks. It was 
approved in June 2008 at the Paris Conference, during which donors indicated their commitment 
to assist the Government. To succeed as a poverty reduction strategy, all stakeholders, including 
the poor, must participate in its implementation, monitoring and evaluation. ANDS generally 
frames human rights in civil and political terms only and fails to identify the Government&#8217;s 
obligations under the various treaties it has ratified. As the design stage is now complete, efforts 
need to be made so that human rights are duly taken into consideration in the implementation 
phase, particularly regarding economic and social development. Most sector strategies 
inadequately define how the situation of vulnerable groups will be addressed. Moreover, the poor 
will not benefit unless the requisite budgetary allocation is dedicated for essential service 
delivery to the most vulnerable sectors of society.  
</p>
<p>11. Given that all United Nations agencies will be involved in supporting the implementation 
of the ANDS, they should be encouraged to adopt the human rights-based approach (HRBA) to 
development as an efficient tool to address the needs of the people through the prism of rights 
and to support the efforts of the Government in meeting its obligations. As part of the ANDS 
implementation process, most provinces have adopted a Provincial Development Plan (PDP) to 
implement the objectives of ANDS. As part of the preparations for the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) process, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) piloted, with the support of UNAMA and the 
United Nations Action 2 Global Secretariat, a project in the provinces of Bamyan and Dai Kundi, 
which focused on the human rights dimension of poverty and how the implementation of ANDS 
could be used as a tool to facilitate the realization of human rights. Through HRBA and 
capacity-building activities, interest has been catalysed among all participating provincial 
development partners, including provincial government officials, civil society, and international 
development actors. This is particularly so for the value of HRBA in achieving sustainable 
development, improving aid coordination and effectiveness and mobilizing adequate resources 
for provinces that receive less attention because of their relative stability.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. As noted in the report of the High Commissioner to the seventh session of the Council 
(A/HRC/7/27), an important initiative toward meeting the commitments set out in the 
Afghanistan Compact is the establishment, with the support of OHCHR, of a human rights unit 
within the Ministry of Justice. I am glad to note that the Government has identified the creation 
of this unit as a key step towards delivering on its commitments under the Compact with respect 
to human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS 
</b></p>
<p>13. The armed conflict intensified significantly throughout 2008 with a corresponding rise in 
civilian casualties and a significant erosion of humanitarian space. UNAMA recorded a total 
of 2,014 civilian casualties between 1 January and 30 November 2008. This figure represents an 
increase of over 41 per cent on the deaths recorded in the same period in 2007. This makes 
the 2008 civilian death toll the highest of any year since the end of major hostilities after the fall 
of the Taliban regime at the end of 2001. In addition, civilians have suffered from injury, 
destruction of property and loss of livelihood, displacement, and disruption of access to 
education, health care and other essential services.  
</p>
<p>14. Of the 2,014 casualties reported, 1,106 (55 per cent) were allegedly caused by 
insurgents, 795 (39 per cent) by pro-Government forces and the remaining 113 (6 per cent) could 
not be attributed to either of the parties because, for example, some civilians died as a result of 
crossfire or were killed by unexploded ordnance. The majority of civilian casualties occurred in 
the south of Afghanistan, but high casualty figures have also been reported in the south-eastern, 
eastern, central and western regions.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Anti-Government elements 
</b></p>
<p>15. A large proportion of the overall increase in civilian casualties is due to insurgent actions. 
While it appears that the majority of suicide attacks have been directed against military or 
government targets, attacks are frequently carried out in crowded civilian areas with an apparent 
disregard for the safety of non-combatants. Throughout 2008, insurgents have shown an 
increasing willingness to inflict harm on civilians in such attacks.  
</p>
<p>16. The tactics of anti-Government elements also involve the direct targeting of civilians. 
Threats, intimidation and violence directed against individuals seen to be linked to the 
Government or the international community have intensified throughout the year.  
</p>
<p>17. Victims of such tactics include doctors, teachers, students, tribal elders, civilian 
government employees, former police and military personnel, and labourers involved in 
public-interest construction work. In several instances women, especially those in public life, 
have been singled out for attack. Substantial evidence exists that tactics used by insurgents point 
to a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation. There were 227 reported assassinations 
by insurgents up to October 2008; many of these were public executions. In October 2008, for 
example, 27 unarmed passengers allegedly linked to the Afghan National Security Forces were 
executed by insurgents in an attack on a bus in Kandahar. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. There is also an increasingly high number of reported abductions and of threats targeting 
individuals linked to the Government or the international community. Such incidents appear to 
be spreading into areas previously seen as relatively calm, such as the North. There have been 
reports of threats against personnel, and forced closure of facilities and services in both health 
and education sectors, affecting hundreds of thousands civilians, in particular women and 
children. This campaign of intimidation severely impacts on the civilian population beyond those 
specifically targeted, instilling widespread fear and insecurity. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International and national security forces 
</b></p>
<p>19. Civilian casualties attributable to the Government of Afghanistan and international security 
forces are almost 33 per cent higher than the 559 reported in the same period in 2007. This 
increase occurred notwithstanding various measures to reduce the impact of the conflict on 
civilians, including internal as well as independent external investigations, after-action reviews, 
and the creation of mechanisms for reviewing trends and reducing the impact of war on civilians. 
Air attacks remain by far the most deadly tactic used by pro-Government forces. There is an 
urgent need to improve overall accountability procedures and the pro-Government forces&#8217; 
response to incidents of civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>20. Air strikes present a particular threat to civilians unable to leave their homes and villages 
when fighting breaks out. There have been several high-profile incidents in which air strikes 
supporting combat operations by national and international forces led to a large number of dead 
civilians including numerous women and children. One such air strike in Shindand district in 
Herat Province in August 2008 resulted, reportedly, in 92 civilian casualties, including 
62 children. In July 2008, an air strike on a wedding party resulted in 47 dead including 
30 children, the majority of them girls. In November 2008 an air strike in Shah Wali Kot of<b> 
</b>Kandahar Province killed some 35 civilians and injured a further 37.  
21. Practices regarding search-and-seizure operations, including night-time raids, have to some 
extent been adjusted to address repeatedly voiced concerns. Yet, serious issues remain, in 
particular regarding a number of joint Afghan and international operations in which excessive 
use of force has allegedly involved severe misconduct and in some cases resulted in the deaths of 
civilians.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p>22. As the conflict has intensified, humanitarian space has shrunk considerably. Large parts of 
the South, East and Central regions of Afghanistan are described in military circles as an 
&#8220;extreme risk&#8221; or a &#8220;hostile environment&#8221;. Aid organizations and their staff have been subjected 
to a growing number of direct attacks, threats and intimidation.  
</p>
<p>23. Until the end of October 2008, 130 aid workers (124 national, 6 international) were 
kidnapped and a total of 38 aid workers were killed. Some highly publicized incidents have 
included an ambush on an International Rescue Committee vehicle in Logar Province in 
August 2008 in which three female international aid workers and their Afghan driver died and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>for which the Taliban claimed responsibility. In September 2008, there was a suicide attack on a 
United Nations convoy in Spin Boldak in which two World Health Organization doctors 
involved in the polio-eradication campaign and one UNAMA driver were killed.  
</p>
<p>24. Insurgents have also targeted private transport companies and construction workers. 
According to the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief, an umbrella group of 
non-governmental organizations, the situation has &#8220;forced many aid agencies to restrict the scale 
and scope of their development and humanitarian operations&#8221;. This effectively means that 
women and children as well as vulnerable people in need of assistance are unable to realize their 
right to receive life-saving humanitarian support and basic social services, including health and 
education in particular for girls. In this regard, it is essential to clarify the scale and nature of the 
humanitarian case load in order to identify those who are most in need of assistance.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Conflict-related detention 
</b></p>
<p>25. The situation of persons arrested and detained in relation with the conflict remains of 
concern, in particular in view of the legal uncertainties regarding the basis for their continued 
detention. Detention of persons by international military forces in their operations is governed by 
the following rules: they may hold detainees for only 96 hours; the International Committee of 
the Red Cross must be informed; after 96 hours, detainees are to be either released or transferred 
to the Afghan authorities, generally, the National Department of Security (NDS). Some countries 
have signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the Government regulating the 
transfer of such detainees and have obtained diplomatic assurances regarding their treatment, 
including that no transferee will be subject to the death penalty. The MoUs are not identical, but 
all provide for diplomatic representatives of that country, the Afghan Independent Human Rights 
Commission (AIHRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to have access 
to transferred detainees. There is however little information on the conditions and treatment of 
such detainees. NDS continues to operate without a public legal framework clearly defining its 
powers of investigation, arrest and detention, and rules applicable to its detention facilities. 
UNAMA has received complaints from individuals previously detained by NDS that they were 
tortured. The treatment of detainees by NDS, including those transferred from international 
military forces&#8217; control, raises questions concerning responsibility of the relevant troop 
contributing countries under principles of international humanitarian and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>26. Individuals detained by Operation Enduring Freedom are held in a detention facility in 
Bagram Airbase governed by United States Department of Defense Directives. Detainees have 
no right to legal counsel or to trial before a court established by law and their status as 
combatants is to be determined by the Enemy Combatant Review Board. If qualified as an 
&#8220;enemy combatant&#8221;, detainees can only be released through the National Reconciliation 
Programme, transferred to the Ministry of Defense for prosecution by the Government of 
Afghanistan. Nationals of third countries are allegedly transferred to Guant&#225;namo Bay Naval 
Base. Some individuals have reportedly been in detention at Bagram for as long as five years and 
some have allegedly been subjected to torture. According to former detainees at Bagram, there 
are approximately 630 detainees held there. ICRC has access to detainees, while UNAMA does 
not. At the end of 2008, Bagram authorities agreed to permit visitation rights to the relatives of 
certain detainees.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  DISCRIMINATION 
</b></p>
<p>27. Equal rights for women and men are enshrined in the Constitution of Afghanistan which, 
moreover, obliges the Government to respect international human rights laws and standards, 
including its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women ratified in 2003. 
</p>
<p>28. A National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA) was adopted in 
May 2008. Its implementation is considered an important benchmark for the promotion of 
gender equality within the 2006 Afghanistan Compact. ANDS recognizes gender as a 
cross-cutting issue and seeks to establish &#8220;greater gender equality by eliminating 
discrimination&#8221;. The reduction of women&#8217;s vulnerability to violence in both domestic and public 
life, and improved access to gender sensitive justice systems are key objectives of the ANDS.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Violence against women and access to justice 
</b>29. The Government is failing to adequately protect the rights of women in Afghanistan 
despite constitutional guarantees and its international obligations. While women have made 
important advances in the spheres of education, employment and political participation in the 
post-Taliban regime years, they continue to confront discriminatory laws, attitudes and practices. 
Of particular concern is the long history of violence against women and girls which impacts on 
their private and public lives. This violence is widespread and deeply rooted in conservative 
religious and traditional values in Afghan society whereby women&#8217;s second-class status is 
perpetuated as a result of systemic and systematic discrimination. Violence is tolerated or 
condoned within the family and community, within traditional and religious leadership circles as 
well as the formal and informal justice systems. The plight of women is exacerbated by growing 
lawlessness that can be attributed, partly, to the pervasive climate of impunity.  
</p>
<p>30. Violence against women and children and harmful traditional practices manifest 
themselves in various forms, such as rape, &#8220;honour killings&#8221;, early and forced marriage, sexual 
slavery (in particular when girls are given away in marriage to settle family debts or disputes), 
sexual abuse in detention, and female victims of violence criminalized by the justice system. 
Much of this violence is perpetrated within the family; however, local power-brokers, the formal 
and traditional justice systems, the police and prison authorities also play their part in reinforcing 
social control over women and in condoning such violence.  
</p>
<p>31. The rape of women and children remains widespread though its true extent is concealed by 
underreporting. Most perpetrators continue to go unpunished. Nevertheless, there are signs of 
increasing willingness on the part of victims to report rape, and of the authorities to investigate 
and prosecute some cases. A number of high-profile cases during 2008 again brought the 
problem of rape to public attention; this may contribute to removing the social stigma attached to 
rape and the problems faced by rape victims. In August 2008 the President called for &#8220;rapists to 
face the country&#8217;s most severe punishment&#8221;. This followed public outrage and demands for 
justice after a 12-year-old girl was raped in Sari Pul province. In this particular instance, an 
official inquiry led to the dismissal of several officials from their posts. Around the same time, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>however, it came to light that two men, convicted by the Supreme Court of the gang rape in 2005 
of a woman in Samangan province, had been released under a presidential pardon in April 2008. 
UNAMA expressed its grave concern that this pardon would send the negative message that 
perpetrators of violent crimes against women would not be held accountable. 
</p>
<p>32. Female victims of violence continue to have limited access to justice and effective redress 
mechanisms. Customary justice systems are only accessed by women accompanied by a male 
relative. The formal law enforcement and judicial systems still lack trained and qualified female 
officials in the police, courts and the legal profession. Services such as legal aid, social work, 
counselling and shelters are often inadequate. Women and girls continue to be prosecuted and 
detained for acts which do not constitute crimes under Afghan law. Thus, victims of sexual abuse 
find themselves criminalized under the offence of <i>zina</i> (consensual sex outside marriage) and 
victims of forced marriage are often prosecuted for the offence of &#8220;running away&#8221;. Failure to 
develop and implement appropriate legislation and policies to protect victims results in 
systematic re-victimization in the justice system. While some children and women are taken into 
custody for their alleged protection, it is apparent that there is no procedure for addressing these 
cases and for ensuring that the deprivation of liberty is used as last resort. Corruption has been 
cited as a further obstacle to obtaining justice, such as the influence of local power brokers or the 
payment of bribes by perpetrators to evade prosecution. Reform of the criminal justice system is 
therefore vital if the legal framework for protecting the rights of women is to be strengthened.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Threats to women in public life 
</b></p>
<p>33. Threats and intimidation against women in public life or who work outside the home have 
seen a dramatic increase. Most employment opportunities for women are found in government 
and international organizations, where they are increasingly targeted by anti-Government 
elements and to a lesser extent by their own families or communities as well as male colleagues. 
Department of Women&#8217;s Affairs representatives, members of the National Assembly and Senate 
as well as Provincial Councils, police, lawyers and journalists, and women working for national 
and international NGOs, have all reported harassment, including death-threat letters and phone 
calls. While it appears that different elements of the armed opposition are chiefly responsible for 
such attacks, it is not always clear whether women are specifically targeted as such, or as part of 
a more general campaign of intimidation against those working for the Government and 
international community or who are in favour of women&#8217;s rights. Many women in public life 
have been forced to curtail their activities or abandon their jobs, lacking confidence that the 
authorities are able or willing to provide them with protection. The assassination of the most 
prominent national female senior police officer, in Kandahar in September 2008, underscores the 
tremendous risks faced by women in public life. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Minority groups 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Constitution recognizes the principle that no individual or group should be 
discriminated against on the basis of their sex, ethnicity, tribe, religion or language. Afghanistan 
has four major ethnic groups: Pashtun, Hazara (Shia minority), Tajik and Uzbek, in addition to a 
myriad of other minorities based on tribal, linguistic and cultural differences, as well as small 
Hindu and Sikh religious minorities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. The Kuchis, or nomads, whose population is estimated at over 5 million by the 
Independent Directorate for the Affairs of the Kuchis (IDAK), are a social minority that has 
faced enduring discrimination. Their traditional livelihood is nomadic herding, although many 
now lead a semi-nomadic existence or have settled in communities. Some of the main challenges 
faced by Kuchis include access to pasture land, and basic services such as health care, education 
and employment. It is understood that in some provinces they have also been denied identity 
cards by the local authorities. 
</p>
<p>36. The rights of Kuchis are guaranteed under article 14 of the Constitution which obliges the 
Government to implement effective programmes to &#8220;improve economic, social and living 
conditions&#8221; of the Kuchis and to adopt measures for the &#8220;provision of housing and distribution of 
public estates to deserving citizens&#8221;. However, IDAK estimates that only 30 per cent of Kuchis 
have received their identity cards and are thus registered as citizens. Kuchis have been allocated 
10 seats (7 for men and 3 for women) in the National Assembly (as they are predominantly 
Pashtun, this is also seen as benefiting one group with a higher percentage of seats). Without 
citizenship, the majority is unable to register to vote. A third measure, a 2007 Presidential 
Decree, granted the Kuchis the right to acquire 10 per cent of municipal housing and it allocated 
land to settled Kuchi communities. The slow and patchy implementation of this policy points to 
the gap between legal guarantees and their accomplishment. 
</p>
<p>37. The disruption of their nomadic lifestyle through conflict and drought, as well as a lack of 
clear government policy on land tenure and pasture rights, has brought the Kuchis into conflict 
with settled communities over access to land and resources. The Government has been unable 
to resolve a long-standing dispute between the Kuchis and settled Hazara populations over 
access to pasture lands in parts of the Central Region and Central Highlands. This year again 
witnessed violent clashes between the two groups in Behsud district of Maidan Wardak 
province, which, according to a joint Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR)-UNAMA mission, resulted in at least 23 deaths, the displacement of more 
than 6,000 families and destruction to property, which for the first time included mosques. These 
figures exclude victims among the Kuchis. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  IMPUNITY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Transitional justice 
</b>38. Re-establishing the rule of law and ending impunity for past crimes remain crucial to 
combating a deeply entrenched culture of impunity that, in turn, is essential to securing a just and 
lasting peace. Individuals suspected of having committed gross human rights violations have still 
not been held to account and quite a number hold and continue to be appointed to high-ranking 
positions of authority, both at the central and local level. Not only is this a violation of 
Afghanistan&#8217;s international obligation to fight against impunity for serious international crimes, 
it also compromises public confidence in the Government and its international partners, 
undermines the legitimacy of public institutions, in particular law enforcement and judicial, and 
reinforces the prevailing impunity for human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>39. The Action Plan on Peace, Reconciliation and Justice adopted in 2005 represented the 
broad framework for addressing the past and building a society based on the rule of law. Its time 
frame indicated that it would meet its objectives by the end of 2008. The Action Plan has not </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>been implemented due to a lack of political support and willingness, on the part of both the 
Government and the international community, to address accountability as a core priority in the 
overall project to transform Afghanistan. 
</p><p>40. Serious concerns remain with respect to the Parliament&#8217;s approval of the National 
Reconciliation Charter in 2007 which called on all parties, including the armed opposition, to 
strive towards national reconciliation. It offered immunity from prosecution to all those 
endorsing the initiative. This move perilously undermined transitional justice process objectives 
by denying victims their right to truth and reparation and by shielding perpetrators from 
accountability and appropriate forms of punishment. 
</p>
<p>41. A further concern is that the voice of Afghan civil society and of human rights 
organizations regarding the future of transitional justice in the country has been silenced through 
threats and harassment. 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR has worked with UNAMA and Afghan partners on transitional justice issues. An 
extensive public-awareness campaign and a theatre project portraying the plight of victims was 
carried out in several provinces during 2008, in collaboration with the AIHRC. UNAMA 
produced a video based on the theatre production which was broadcast on Human Rights and 
Remembrance Day in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>43. Measures were taken to strengthen domestic forensic expertise in the investigation and 
preservation of mass grave sites. In early December 2008, the remains of the late President 
Daud Khan and 16 members of his family were officially identified, as noted by the Minister of 
Public Health. Concerns have been expressed that mass grave sites in the Dasht-i-lali area near 
Shiberghan were tampered with and material evidence destroyed. All measures must be taken so 
that all mass grave sites are secured without delay. Establishing the truth about the past, in 
accordance with international standards, remains of crucial importance. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Impunity and abuse of power 
</b></p>
<p>44. The failure to prosecute perpetrators of past crimes and continuing abuses seriously 
undermines the legitimacy of Afghan law enforcement and judicial institutions and has eroded 
the people&#8217;s confidence in the rule of law. This has ultimately paved the way to the current 
situation in which impunity prevails. 
</p>
<p>45. UNAMA continues to receive complaints concerning the failure of the police to conduct 
proper investigations and to act impartially and independently with regard to human rights 
allegations. Similarly, prosecutors and judges are often reluctant to address cases that confront 
traditional practices or powerful local interests. Certain categories of citizens, such as girls, 
women and the poor, are more often than not excluded from the formal justice system, as judicial 
authorities do not give weight to their claims and systematically side with the power-brokers. 
Thus, the presumption of innocence and procedural fair trial requirements are often disrespected. 
</p>
<p>46. Rampant and institutionalized corruption, combined with weak internal oversight and 
discipline mechanisms, impede the ability of the judiciary to perform its functions independently 
and efficiently. The lack of properly trained personnel and material resources further limits their 
capacity to carry out their mandated functions. Factors such as institutions which do not abide by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the law - particularly in rural and war-affected areas, the ominous influence of warlords, local 
commanders and other local power-holders, and failure to ensure a secure environment for 
courts, victims and witnesses continue to undermine the independence and impartiality of the 
judicial authorities. 
47. Traditional dispute resolution mechanisms (such as <i>jirga</i> and <i>shura</i>), though not 
recognized in the Constitution, are widely resorted to, especially in rural areas; this is due, in 
part, to limited access to, and confidence in, formal justice institutions. Although there are 
positive elements in traditional mechanisms in terms of community cohesion and accessibility, 
there are serious concerns with respect to due-process requirements, in particular for women, 
children and vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>48. Nevertheless, some positive developments have been noted, such as the drafting of a Bill 
on the Elimination of Violence against Women, in which the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs and 
civil society organizations have been involved. The Ministry of Justice&#8217;s recent initiative to 
establish a State-funded legal aid system and the establishment of the Bar Association represent 
another important step forward. These measures should enhance the safeguarding of rights of 
defendants and the provision of legal representation for the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>49. Addressing impunity and further strengthening the rule of law is a priority in Afghanistan. 
There is a need for mechanisms, such as the advisory panel for appointments envisaged in the 
Action Plan for Peace, Justice and Reconciliation, to prevent those accused of having committed 
serious crimes from obtaining senior government posts. The forthcoming elections also present 
an opportunity for Afghans to take further steps to prevent persons accused of having committed 
serious offences under domestic and international law contesting seats in the Parliament.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  DEFICITS IN DEMOCRACY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>50. The ability of media actors, civil society groups and other Afghan citizens to freely express 
their opinions and thoughts came under attack across Afghanistan throughout 2008. National and 
provincial government officials, anti-Government elements and different power-brokers all 
sought to restrict freedom of expression. Police and prosecutors generally proved ineffective at 
protecting freedom of expression given their apparent collusion with those in positions of power. 
The judiciary has not consistently provided protection, and, at times, has also been a factor in 
restricting the right to express opinions. Freedom of expression is often presented as threatening 
existing power structures, national security interests or Islamic values. Afghanistan&#8217;s 
increasingly repressive and closed society has triggered self-censorship throughout the country 
and stifled criticism and debate. 
</p>
<p>51. Threats, intimidation and attacks persisted against journalists and others expressing 
opinions deemed unwelcome, as did attempts to stifle critical reporting on corruption and other 
issues deemed &#8220;sensitive&#8221;. For instance, an Afghan radio-television presenter was dismissed by 
the Ministry of Information and Culture in May 2008 after he stated on television that freedom </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of expression only existed on paper and that the media was a mere tool of the powerful. In 
July 2008, the National Directorate of Security (NDS) arrested and detained a television 
journalist who aired a critical review of the President&#8217;s administration. The journalist eventually 
sought asylum abroad given fears that his life was under threat. Women journalists also continue 
to be specifically targeted. 
</p>
<p>52. Freedom of the media was also under significant threat in the areas affected by armed 
conflict. Kidnappings and killings of journalists continued. In June 2008, an Afghan BBC 
journalist working in Helmand province was abducted and killed. Though the Taliban claimed 
responsibility for the incident, the killing may have been linked to investigations into corruption. 
The killing led to 10 journalists leaving Helmand province. 
</p><p>53. A prominent case this year was that of Sayed Parveiz Kambashkh, a journalism student 
sentenced to death on the charge of insulting and disavowing Islam in January 2008. He was 
alleged to have downloaded, from the Internet, an article concerned with the status and rights of 
women, in the context of Islam, and disseminating this, with added commentary, to other 
students. The Appeals Court reduced his sentence to 20 years in October 2008, but upheld the 
conviction. In addition to the severity of the sentence, there are concerns over apparent 
irregularities in the conduct of the trial at both primary and appeal levels. 
</p>
<p>54. There are strong concerns that in the months leading up to the 2009 elections, the media 
will continue to self-censor or be pressured into broadcasting only views favourable to a certain 
political line and that candidates and citizens will not be permitted to fully express their opinions 
due to threats, intimidations and attacks. Setbacks to the media, and efforts to maintain freedom 
of expression, are of major concern. This is additionally regrettable given that the media, in 
recent years, had been flourishing.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Elections 
</b></p>
<p>55. Elections for President, Parliament and Provincial Councils are scheduled to take place 
in 2009. In anticipation, a staggered exercise to update voter registration was scheduled from 
October 2008 to March 2009 throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>56. An area of particular concern is the ability of women to exercise their right to participate in 
public life, which includes standing for office, supporting candidates, and voting. During the 
voter registration process, some women were unable to update or register to vote because 
registration centres were located almost exclusively in district centres. Cultural practices in many 
conservative and conflict-affected areas restricted women&#8217;s freedom of movement. During 
voting, such problems are expected to be mitigated by having more polling locations, though 
many women will still not be able to participate due to restrictions on movement and lack of 
awareness of their rights. Adequate numbers of female staff to undertake outreach and civic 
education activities and to run women&#8217;s voting centres are still lacking. Whether women will be 
able to stand for office in comparable numbers to the 2005 election cycle remains to be seen; 
increasing insecurity and renewed religious cultural pressure could reduce the number of women 
willing to participate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. Increased insecurity and direct hostility by anti-Government elements towards the electoral 
process is another worrying factor. In September 2008, the Taliban publicly stated its opposition 
to the electoral process. They were responsible for attacks on voter registration sites and 
personnel as well as destruction of voter registration materials during the registration phase. It is 
feared that candidates, their supporters, polling stations and electoral staff might be targeted by 
armed opposition elements. During the voter registration process, a number of voter registration 
centres were reportedly unable to open due to insecurity. 
</p>
<p>58. Careful consideration should be given to the vetting of candidates and handling of 
elections-related complaints. Lessons should be learned from the previous elections, when 
vetting failed to meet the expectations of the Afghan people and the complaints mechanism was 
overwhelmed, particularly when it came to handling complaints of fraud and ballot tampering on 
election day. Ensuring the integrity and independence of the vetting and complaints processes is 
vital to creating an environment conducive to the free exercise of the right of all Afghans to 
participate in elections. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Administration of justice 
</b>59. In early 2008, the National Justice Sector Strategy (NJSS) and National Justice Programme 
were launched. Both call for a comprehensive, coordinated approach to building the justice 
sector and improving the administration of justice. A new Criminal Procedure Code is being 
drafted. The United Nations Office on Drug and Crimes and the United States Department of 
State&#8217;s Justice Support Sector Program chair a drafting group which includes key government 
officials and justice sector actors. Strong emphasis has been placed on compliance with 
international human rights standards. It is important that many of the gaps in the current legal 
framework, such as the absence of the right to be brought promptly before a court to have the 
legality of the detention reviewed, are addressed in the new Code. 
</p>
<p>60. Nonetheless, these positive initiatives have yet to significantly change the realities on the 
ground. Arbitrary arrest and detention persist, and fair trial standards and time limits continue to 
be breached. Furthermore, the justice system is under-resourced and its personnel 
under-qualified. Few defence counsels are available throughout the country, especially outside 
large urban centres. Similarly, prosecutors, and judges are said to be underrepresented. Despite 
several initiatives at district level, insufficient coordination between police, prosecutors, courts 
and detention facilities authorities continue to hamper the efficient administration of justice. 
Conditions in detention facilities have not noticeably improved and largely fail to meet 
international standards. Finally, Afghans generally remain unaware of their rights with respect to 
judicial processes and, when aware of their entitlements, are often not in a position to claim them 
particularly because of the shortage of defence counsels. 
</p>
<p>61. The current lack of confidence in the formal justice system&#8217;s ability to deliver justice fairly 
and independently means that it is not trusted by Afghans to adjudicate disputes. As a result, the 
informal and traditional justice mechanisms continue to enjoy a higher level of confidence at the 
community level. There are concerns about these mechanisms&#8217; ability to deliver justice in a fair 
manner, and in particular to equally protect the rights of women, children and marginalized 
groups. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. Insecurity has further hindered the development of the formal justice system. In 
conflict-affected areas, formal justice institutions are becoming increasingly inaccessible and 
dysfunctional due to frequent attacks by anti-Government elements. Consequently, in some rural 
districts where formal justice institutions are no longer present, the Taliban has reportedly been 
strengthened and is allegedly operating parallel judicial systems. 
</p><p>63. The death penalty continues to be applied and carried out in Afghanistan. In 
November 2008, 16 men were executed following a review by a special commission and the 
approval of the President. Many Afghans, including prominent public figures, strongly support 
the death penalty in the belief that it serves as a deterrent in the face of growing criminality. 
Given my grave concern that law enforcement and judicial systems fall short of international 
standards, I requested the President to halt any further executions and to rejoin the growing 
international consensus for a moratorium on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The National Human Rights Institution 
</b></p>
<p>64. In April 2008, a Statement of Principles was signed between the Afghan Independent 
Human Rights Commission and several United Nations entities in Afghanistan including 
UNAMA, OHCHR, UNHCR, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Its main objective is to further 
enhance the capacity and performance of AIHRC through more coordinated United Nations 
support. By working more closely and in a complementary manner, it is expected that an 
effective human rights protection system based on national capacities will be developed in 
Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>65. The AIHRC maintained its &#8220;A&#8221; status accreditation by the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC). 
Previous concerns expressed by the ICC subcommittee remain, including inadequate and 
inconsistent financial support received by the AIHRC from the Government as well as the 
selection and appointment of Commissioners, a process that should ensure the pluralism and 
independence of the institution. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  TECHNICAL COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>66. As part of its support to the ANDS process, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in 
Afghanistan commenced its preparation of the 2010-2013 United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework (UNDAF) in July 2008 after the launch, a month before, of the ANDS, 
which will serve as the United Nations Common Country Assessment (CCA). The full draft of 
UNDAF has identified three priority areas for the United Nations in Afghanistan: fostering good 
governance, peace and stability; sustainable livelihoods for women and men - agriculture, food 
security and income generation; and basic social services - education and health. Throughout the 
UNDAF process, OHCHR is assisting partners in applying HRBA to socio-economic 
development. 
</p>
<p>67. In the wake of the successful media programming joint project between OHCHR and the 
United Nations Development Programme&#8217;s (UNDP) National Programme on Action for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Disability (NPAD), which was concluded in 2007, my Office provided a grant to a local disabled 
people&#8217;s organization (DPO) to carry on the media programming project and extend it further to 
television programming and broadcasting into the more remote provinces of Afghanistan. In 
addition, early 2008 saw the completion of projects undertaken by three DPOs which were given 
grants under the fifth phase of the Assisting Communities Together scheme established jointly 
by OHCHR and UNDP. 
</p>
<p>68. The Government has put in place a Steering Committee to ensure the widest consultations 
with all relevant government stakeholders and civil society in preparation of its report under the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s universal periodic review scheduled for February 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>69. Throughout 2008, efforts to transform Afghan society were seriously undermined by the 
intensification of the armed conflict, growing lawlessness, widespread abuse of power, violence 
against women and their persistent marginalization, and a significant clampdown on freedom of 
expression. These worrying trends are exacerbated by the lack of political will to address these 
deeply engrained problems. Impunity prevails. Abusive structures of society and the leeway 
given to traditional power brokers have further limited prospects for the realization of human 
rights, in particular for vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>70. It is widely recognized that the conflict cannot be overcome by military means alone. But 
the call for an integrated civilian-led strategy to ensure Afghanistan&#8217;s long-term peace and 
security, opening the way to development, has yet to yield concrete results. The human rights 
challenges identified in this report need to be addressed rapidly and in a systematic and 
comprehensive manner. Delivering basic services cannot be dissociated from the imperative to 
hold accountable those in positions of power who violate human rights; the deep-rooted 
discrimination against and marginalization of women and girls and of minorities cannot be 
separated from alleviating the appalling levels of poverty. More should be done to strengthen 
national institutions&#8217; capacity to effectively deliver on their human rights obligations. Ultimately, 
this is the responsibility of the Government of Afghanistan but, in the Afghan context, the 
international community has particular responsibility to assist the Afghan authorities deliver on 
its commitments and to support civil society actors. 
</p>
<p><b>X.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Further efforts should be made to integrate a human rights perspective into the 
implementation phase of poverty reduction and development strategies, both at the central 
and provincial levels, in particular with a view to addressing the situation of groups who 
face persistent discrimination. The implementation of the ANDS should be consistent with, 
and informed by, the Government of Afghanistan&#8217;s national and international human 
rights obligations. These obligations must be expressly referred to in the ANDS&#8217; 
operationalization and in related monitoring and evaluation activities. Accordingly, the 
requisite budgetary allocation must be dedicated to ensure that groups marginalized by </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>discriminatory practices are prioritized. Means to collect and analyse disaggregated data to 
measure progress in poverty reduction for groups vulnerable to discrimination must 
accompany measures to ensure their participation in processes ostensibly designed for their 
benefit. The Government of Afghanistan, with the support of the international community, 
should ensure the prompt establishment of the proposed Human Rights Unit in the 
Ministry of Justice to coordinate these efforts, and dedicate adequate resources to ensure 
its long-term sustainability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Pro-Government forces and anti-Government elements should ensure greater 
respect for the protection of civilians, including women and children. Investigations and, 
where appropriate, prosecutions should be carried out swiftly and independently. National 
and international security forces must enhance their efforts to establish coherent and 
transparent systems of accountability, including with respect to conflict-related detention. 
Efforts should be made to influence insurgents to cease attacks against civilian targets and 
to enable the humanitarian community to regain and maintain critical humanitarian space; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Government of Afghanistan should actively support and promote the 
National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan (NAPWA) together with the ANDS 
Gender-Equity Cross-Cutting Strategy to ensure that these are mainstreamed into the 
work of the Government. Current legal reform initiatives must incorporate international 
standards to provide greater protection to women and girls against all forms of violence, in 
both the private and public spheres, and must rapidly be translated into policies and 
concrete programmes. In the upcoming electoral period, specific measures should be taken 
to ensure the full participation of women in a safe and dignified manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government of Afghanistan and its international partners must 
demonstrate their commitment to addressing impunity as a matter of priority. Upholding 
the rule of law and delivering justice is a key condition for any democratic society. It will 
also help foster greater confidence by the Afghan population in its public institutions. The 
independence and impartiality of law enforcement and judicial authorities must be 
guaranteed, and the necessary resources must be put at their disposal so that they can 
deliver justice efficiently and professionally. The Government and the international 
community should support civil society, in particular vis-&#224;-vis initiatives to establish the 
truth with regard to the past, including through the forensic investigation of mass graves, 
and to promote reconciliation. They should recommit to the transitional justice process 
with special emphasis on assisting and strengthening government institutions, in particular 
through institutional reforms and fair and transparent appointments procedures; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Government of Afghanistan and the international community must nurture 
and protect civil society, women in public positions and media representatives, as critical 
components of democratic institution-building. Ensuring the integrity and independence of 
the upcoming electoral processes, including with respect to vetting of candidates is of vital 
importance. This will help create an environment that is conducive to Afghans being able 
to exercise freely their rights to receive and impart political and other information and to 
participate in elections;</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) AIHRC should continue its vigilant role in monitoring, promoting and 
protecting human rights with the support of the international community. As indicated by 
the International Coordination Committee of National Human Rights Institutions, the 
Government of Afghanistan must earmark a minimum allocation in its national budget for 
the AIHRC and ensure that legislation is in place to protect its independence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Government of Afghanistan is strongly urged to reinstate its moratorium 
on the death penalty, in particular in recognition of the shortcomings of the criminal justice 
system, and to join the ever-growing community of States around the world which have 
opted for moratoriums on the death penalty.
